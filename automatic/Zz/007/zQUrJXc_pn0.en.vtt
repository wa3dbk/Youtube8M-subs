that I'm very used to which is why I
let's<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> first<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.610> quite<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
let's do it first so if you know quite a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.310 
let's do it first so if you know quite a
lot<00:00:47.969> about<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.989> what<00:00:49.170> it's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
lot about it and I do know what it's

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
lot about it and I do know what it's
gems<00:00:49.530> from<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.829> his<00:00:49.890> weaknesses<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
gems from what his weaknesses are so the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180 
gems from what his weaknesses are so the
3/5<00:00:51.390> -<00:00:51.690> well<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.230> very<00:00:52.500> attacking<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.100> is

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
3/5 - well it's very attacking which is

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.319 
3/5 - well it's very attacking which is
why<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.550> Lee<00:00:53.699> you've<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:53.969> always<00:00:54.149> got<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
why I like Lee you've got always got a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.760 
why I like Lee you've got always got a
lot<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> attacking<00:00:54.930> doctrines<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.530> because

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
lot of attacking doctrines on because

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.889 
lot of attacking doctrines on because
obviously<00:00:55.890> there's<00:00:56.280> about<00:00:56.449> 5<00:00:57.449> midfielders

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
obviously there's about 5 midfielders

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.209 
obviously there's about 5 midfielders
and<00:00:57.930> two<00:00:58.170> attackers<00:00:58.649> which<00:00:58.890> means<00:00:59.070> you've<00:00:59.190> got

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and two attackers which means you've got

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099 
and two attackers which means you've got
7<00:00:59.699> players<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.480> midfield<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
7 players that are in midfield in the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
7 players that are in midfield in the
tower<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.010> thing<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.250> can

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
tower but there is one thing that can

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
tower but there is one thing that can
make<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.780> suspect<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.799> M

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
make it a bit suspect and that's the M

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.109 
make it a bit suspect and that's the M
defense<00:01:05.280> though<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:05.970> free

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
defense though because it's free

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
defense though because it's free
defenders<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> might<00:01:06.930> think<00:01:07.229> well<00:01:07.830> surely

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
defenders you might think well surely

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.320 
defenders you might think well surely
that<00:01:08.280> means<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.549> gonna<00:01:08.640> be<00:01:08.790> hard<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> defend

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that means it's gonna be hard to defend

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
that means it's gonna be hard to defend
you're<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:09.840> get<00:01:09.990> killed<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.409> counter

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you're gonna get killed on the counter

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.440 
you're gonna get killed on the counter
down<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> wings<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.000> actually<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> bit

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
down the wings but it's actually a bit

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
down the wings but it's actually a bit
of<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> myth<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.189> them

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
of a myth that really if you have them

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.950 
of a myth that really if you have them
to<00:01:14.729> winger<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> important<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
to winger this is the important bit you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780 
to winger this is the important bit you
need<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> wingers<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.460> high

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
need really to wingers that have high

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.160 
need really to wingers that have high
defensive<00:01:18.210> work<00:01:18.360> rates<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.020> have

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
defensive work rates and if you have

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.320 
defensive work rates and if you have
that<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.159> should<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.400> fine<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.610> 3/5<00:01:21.090> -

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that then you should be fine with 3/5 -

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.640 
that then you should be fine with 3/5 -
because<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.900> high<00:01:22.080> defensive<00:01:22.500> work

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
because if they have high defensive work

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.810 
because if they have high defensive work
rates<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.979> they'll<00:01:23.070> probably<00:01:23.189> track<00:01:23.580> back

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
rates and they'll probably track back

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
rates and they'll probably track back
and<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.659> sort<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> turns<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> 3-5-2<00:01:25.740> into<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
and it sort of turns the 3-5-2 into a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.830 
and it sort of turns the 3-5-2 into a
five-month<00:01:26.490> formation<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.570> you're<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
five-month formation when you're at the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.480 
five-month formation when you're at the
back<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.259> when<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> try<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> defend<00:01:28.950> its<00:01:29.369> life

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
back and when you try to defend its life

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.560 
back and when you try to defend its life
the<00:01:29.610> first<00:01:29.700> thing<00:01:29.820> I'd<00:01:30.000> recommend<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the first thing I'd recommend if you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.179 
the first thing I'd recommend if you
using<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> free<00:01:30.990> 5<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.409> try<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.009> two

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
using the free 5 to try and have two

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.440 
using the free 5 to try and have two
wingers<00:01:32.490> who've<00:01:32.610> got<00:01:32.790> high<00:01:32.939> defensive<00:01:33.299> work

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
wingers who've got high defensive work

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.690 
wingers who've got high defensive work
rates<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.890> I've<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.189> else<00:01:35.369> Rory

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
rates as you can see I've got else Rory

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.219 
rates as you can see I've got else Rory
and<00:01:35.909> Thomas<00:01:36.210> Malabo<00:01:36.630> field<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.020> high

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
and Thomas Malabo field but high

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.600 
and Thomas Malabo field but high
defensive<00:01:37.619> were<00:01:37.740> right<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.159> as<00:01:38.250> well<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.400> been

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
defensive were right so as well as been

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.859 
defensive were right so as well as been
really<00:01:38.909> attacking<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.420> also<00:01:39.570> really

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
really attacking it's also really

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
really attacking it's also really
defensive<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> right<00:01:41.130> players

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
defensive if you have the right players

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.590 
defensive if you have the right players
and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:41.909> when<00:01:42.060> you're<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.240> forward<00:01:42.450> Eve

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
and then when you're going forward Eve

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
and then when you're going forward Eve
obviously<00:01:42.899> got<00:01:43.079> mu-2<00:01:44.009> wingers<00:01:44.369> bombing

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
obviously got mu-2 wingers bombing

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.090 
obviously got mu-2 wingers bombing
forward<00:01:45.390> you've<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.750> two<00:01:45.899> strikers<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
forward you've got your two strikers the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.260 
forward you've got your two strikers the
center<00:01:47.310> attacking<00:01:47.610> midfielder<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.180> then

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
center attacking midfielder and then

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.120 
center attacking midfielder and then
sometimes<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.470> them<00:01:49.619> only<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
sometimes you know so have them only you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
sometimes you know so have them only you
CDMS<00:01:50.460> could<00:01:50.610> push<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.000> well<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
CDMS could push up as well so it's a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.539 
CDMS could push up as well so it's a
really<00:01:52.409> good<00:01:52.619> formation<00:01:52.890> because<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> works

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
really good formation because it works

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
really good formation because it works
really<00:01:53.759> well<00:01:53.850> at<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.090> back<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> use<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
really well at the back if you use it

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.740 
really well at the back if you use it
Rhino<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.740> also<00:01:56.130> em<00:01:56.479> if<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.659> have

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
Rhino and also em if you will have

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.120 
Rhino and also em if you will have
options<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.469> forward<00:01:58.770> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
options when you're going forward so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
options when you're going forward so
just<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.460> general<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.420> strong

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
just in general it's a really strong

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.209 
just in general it's a really strong
formation<00:02:01.110> both<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.590> forward<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.040> going

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
formation both going forward and going

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.649 
formation both going forward and going
back<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.880> thing<00:02:03.030> we<00:02:03.119> would<00:02:03.210> say<00:02:03.270> though<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.570> is

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
back one thing we would say though it is

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
back one thing we would say though it is
quite<00:02:04.110> hard<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.590> beginners<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.880> need<00:02:06.000> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
quite hard for beginners you do need to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
quite hard for beginners you do need to
know<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.210> players<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.659> use<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.079> does

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
know what players to use and it does

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.510 
know what players to use and it does
take<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.649> getting<00:02:07.799> used<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.310> get<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
take a bit of getting used to to get the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.550 
take a bit of getting used to to get the
most<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.050> you're<00:02:10.229> looking<00:02:10.410> for

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
most out of it but if you're looking for

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.720 
most out of it but if you're looking for
a<00:02:10.590> new<00:02:10.739> formation<00:02:11.009> if<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.310> want<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> look<00:02:11.610> for

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
a new formation if you want to look for

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
a new formation if you want to look for
something<00:02:11.879> that's<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.150> bit<00:02:12.300> fun<00:02:12.599> or<00:02:12.810> something

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
something that's a bit fun or something

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.290 
something that's a bit fun or something
that's<00:02:13.739> different<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.459> I'd<00:02:14.640> go<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.970> 3/5

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
that's different that I'd go for the 3/5

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.089 
that's different that I'd go for the 3/5
-<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.690> very<00:02:15.900> balanced<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.650> does<00:02:16.830> take<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> bit

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
- it's very balanced it does take a bit

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.680 
- it's very balanced it does take a bit
of<00:02:17.220> getting<00:02:17.340> used<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.150> decided<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.569> give

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
of getting used to so I decided to give

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.080 
of getting used to so I decided to give
it<00:02:18.810> an<00:02:18.870> 8.5<00:02:19.530> out<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.830> 10<00:02:19.950> rating<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.790> would<00:02:21.000> have

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
it an 8.5 out of 10 rating I would have

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.490 
it an 8.5 out of 10 rating I would have
gave<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.420> 9<00:02:21.660> but<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.900> think<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.379> little

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
gave it a 9 but I think it's a little

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.140 
gave it a 9 but I think it's a little
bit<00:02:22.680> hard<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.950> get<00:02:23.069> used<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.970> leave

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
bit hard to get used to and it can leave

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.339 
bit hard to get used to and it can leave
you<00:02:24.180> vulnerable<00:02:24.270> on<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> counter<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.319> you

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
you vulnerable on the counter if you

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.809 
you vulnerable on the counter if you
have<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> attacking<00:02:26.099> winger<00:02:26.340> that's<00:02:26.520> Lubin's

have a attacking winger that's Lubin's
where<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> won't<00:02:27.209> give<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.510> little<00:02:27.660> bit

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
where I won't give it a little bit

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
where I won't give it a little bit
higher<00:02:28.050> but<00:02:28.440> as<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.739> tell<00:02:28.800> by<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.099> pros

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
higher but as you can tell by the pros

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.740 
higher but as you can tell by the pros
and<00:02:29.550> cons<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> good<00:02:30.209> formation<00:02:30.480> there

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
and cons it is a good formation there

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.180 
and cons it is a good formation there
isn't<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.050> many<00:02:31.230> cons<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.739> just<00:02:31.920> getting

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
isn't that many cons it's just getting

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.710 
isn't that many cons it's just getting
used<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.489> at<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.700> start<00:02:33.000> another<00:02:33.420> thing<00:02:33.599> to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
used to it at the start another thing to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.790 
used to it at the start another thing to
note<00:02:33.840> as<00:02:33.959> well<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.230> used<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.560> head-to-head

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
note as well if you used on head-to-head

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.559 
note as well if you used on head-to-head
seasons<00:02:35.370> there<00:02:35.459> isn't<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.730> many<00:02:36.090> teams<00:02:36.390> that

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
seasons there isn't that many teams that

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.850 
seasons there isn't that many teams that
have<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> suitable<00:02:37.050> players<00:02:37.290> for<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:37.800> you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
have the suitable players for it but you

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.619 
have the suitable players for it but you
do<00:02:37.950> need<00:02:38.040> frequent<00:02:38.459> Center<00:02:38.790> bucks<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.540> is

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
do need frequent Center bucks but it is

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.670 
do need frequent Center bucks but it is
better<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:39.989> an<00:02:40.110> ultimate<00:02:40.410> team<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
better use an ultimate team and

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.839 
better use an ultimate team and
head-to-head<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.040> my<00:02:41.250> opinion<00:02:41.580> because

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
head-to-head in my opinion because

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.460 
head-to-head in my opinion because
obviously<00:02:42.000> an<00:02:42.300> ultimate<00:02:42.900> team<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.110> can<00:02:43.230> build

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
obviously an ultimate team you can build

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.630 
obviously an ultimate team you can build
the<00:02:43.560> team<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.890> whittle<00:02:44.099> Larkin<00:02:44.400> where<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.550> was

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
the team to whittle Larkin where I was

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.070 
the team to whittle Larkin where I was
and<00:02:44.730> head-to-head<00:02:45.090> you've<00:02:45.239> obviously<00:02:45.360> got<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
and head-to-head you've obviously got a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.270 
and head-to-head you've obviously got a
set<00:02:46.319> amount<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.590> players<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.010> can<00:02:47.040> use

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
set amount of players that you can use

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.470 
set amount of players that you can use
in<00:02:47.400> each<00:02:47.519> team<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.209> stronger

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
in each team but it is stronger

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.970 
in each team but it is stronger
defensively<00:02:48.900> high<00:02:49.200> numbers<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.530> midfield<00:02:49.890> and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
defensively high numbers in midfield and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.170 
defensively high numbers in midfield and
it's<00:02:50.099> great<00:02:50.250> for<00:02:50.370> retaining<00:02:50.640> possession<00:02:50.790> if

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
it's great for retaining possession if

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.820 
it's great for retaining possession if
you<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.390> sort<00:02:51.599> of<00:02:51.629> player<00:02:51.840> it's<00:02:52.140> not<00:02:52.230> 3-5-2

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
you that sort of player it's not 3-5-2

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.070 
you that sort of player it's not 3-5-2
formation<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.489> I'm<00:02:53.640> very<00:02:53.730> hopeful<00:02:54.120> um<00:02:54.360> it's

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080
