doesn't seem very safe that the guy
filming<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:25.050> riding<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> motorcycle<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
filming is riding a motorcycle and

off<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:29.939> i<00:00:29.970> guess<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.359> leads<00:00:30.570> me<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
off but i guess that leads me to the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.120 
off but i guess that leads me to the
most<00:00:31.109> obvious<00:00:31.439> question<00:00:32.219> why<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> fuck

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
most obvious question why in the fuck

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.479 
most obvious question why in the fuck
was<00:00:35.130> there<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> cow<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.480> car

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
bud I mean wouldn't it be easier just to
