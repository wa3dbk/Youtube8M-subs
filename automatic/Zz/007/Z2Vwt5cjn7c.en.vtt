from<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.500> edge<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.340> wood<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:13.019> closer<00:00:13.320> you

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
from the edge of the wood the closer you

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.000 
from the edge of the wood the closer you
are<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.549> end<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.630> more<00:00:15.839> likely<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.529> for

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
are to the end the more likely it is for

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.590 
are to the end the more likely it is for
you<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.250> get<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> split<00:00:18.800> right<00:00:19.800> here<00:00:20.600> we're

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
you to get a split right here we're

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.089 
you to get a split right here we're
going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.840> intentionally<00:00:22.199> split<00:00:24.680> I'm<00:00:25.760> about

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
going to intentionally split I'm about

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.410 
going to intentionally split I'm about
three<00:00:29.099> quarters<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:30.320> an<00:00:31.320> inch<00:00:32.180> from<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> end

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
three quarters of an inch from the end

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.889 
three quarters of an inch from the end
there<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.500> we've<00:00:40.649> got<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
there and you can see that we've got a

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.959 
there and you can see that we've got a
crack<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.200> such<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> not<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.460> bad<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> split

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
crack not such a not so bad as a split

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:56.869 
crack not such a not so bad as a split
come<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> little<00:00:48.180> closer<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> end<00:00:55.879> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
come a little closer to the end and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.170 
come a little closer to the end and
that's<00:00:57.210> splitting<00:00:57.660> even<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.730> now<00:00:59.730> these<00:00:59.940> are

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that's splitting even more now these are

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.440 
that's splitting even more now these are
things<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.870> want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> avoid<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
things that you want to avoid so if you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.020 
things that you want to avoid so if you
can<00:01:07.100> stay<00:01:08.100> away<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> knots<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.920> come

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.480 

this<00:01:15.030> far<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.840> from<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> end<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:16.979> wood<00:01:17.250> as

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this far in from the end of the wood as

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.520 
this far in from the end of the wood as
you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:19.040> keep<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.189> nice<00:01:20.430> clean<00:01:20.970> board<00:01:24.380> here<00:01:25.380> we

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can keep a nice clean board here we

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.880 
you can keep a nice clean board here we
have<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> split<00:01:27.409> see<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.740> little

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
have a split see it's a little

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.770 
have a split see it's a little
unpredictable<00:01:30.350> what<00:01:31.350> caused<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.189> here

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
unpredictable what caused this one here

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.060 
unpredictable what caused this one here
is<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.140> hole<00:01:34.430> in<00:01:35.570> this<00:01:36.570> area<00:01:37.020> which<00:01:37.890> had

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
is the hole in this area which had

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.800 
is the hole in this area which had
already<00:01:38.250> weakened<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.509> impossible

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
already weakened it so it's impossible

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.670 
already weakened it so it's impossible
to<00:01:46.200> avoid<00:01:46.320> completely<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:52.259> further<00:01:52.439> away

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to avoid completely but the further away

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.420 
to avoid completely but the further away
you<00:01:52.829> stay<00:01:53.340> from<00:01:53.610> knots<00:01:53.939> or<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:55.170> edges<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you stay from knots or the edges the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.210 
you stay from knots or the edges the
better<00:01:56.610> off<00:01:56.880> you'll<00:01:57.149> be
