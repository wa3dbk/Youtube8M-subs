00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.450
 use the game mechanics similar to the 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.130
 classic prince of persia at the time 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.500
 attracted attention both by the graphs 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.050
 with the story without much depth 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.540
 mixing laser weapon area technologies 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.930
 in a confused future or a full plate 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.220
 for those who like the science fiction 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.290
 game against secret agent's xara 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.000
 called code that is captured by the 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.350
 alien furniture that has the ability to 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.579
 of transforming into humans 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.989
 he is caught he discovered a 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.360
 conspiracy without list of aliens 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.159
 who intends to destroy the land 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.890
 be stuck with where I have deleted memory 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.690
 and predicting that this would happen with 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.520
 he backed up his memories in cubes 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.540
 graphs as it was the future in 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.250
 awaits 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.990
 and in the game you have to recover these 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.200
 cubes that contains a series of flashbacks 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.299
 am going to help you recover your 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.920
 memories and frustrates the plan 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:28.500
 aliens in 1992 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.850
 the game was considered revolutionary 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.830
 due to their realistic movements 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.770
 because they used the technique of rotoscopy 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.590
 the same used in mortal kombat in which 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.909
 actors are filmed and their movements 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.840
 are used when creating animations 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.400
 to the game 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.490
 the game came to be called 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.490
 first platform game 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 cinematographic 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.140
 Good, now it's enough. 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.060
 I already said too much about the old game 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.799
 Now let's talk about the remake. 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.020
 in the current flashback the gameplay 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.030
 continues to involve the exploitation of 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.100
 areas of the platform for contracting and 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.140
 solve puzzles while you 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.479
 fight against the different enemies series 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.939
 the environments in 2d and a half have a 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.950
 design similar to the original fortunately 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.989
 the changes are very 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.999
 more funds than the previous version was 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.800
 the negative point because the movements were 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.810
 very light the cars back 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.700
 to the fight it was very complicated 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.560
 access to inventory of items was very 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.480
 boring but in this version 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.030
 everything got too fluid can skill 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.890
 very simple as well as updating the various 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.960
 movements various modern elements 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.900
 have also been added as a system 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.640
 of gains where the xp points can be 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.710
 used to unlock enhancements and 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.300
 skills for your character and room 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.420
 training were included for 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.490
 improve and learn new skills 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.430
 to remake ubisoft called design 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.290
 few previous game boss and he 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.090
 brought with him several members of his 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.490
 team the developer of the previous game 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.160

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.380
 original exposure to please fans and 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.720
 build a new audience at ubisoft 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.580
 even managed to please the old fans but 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.410
 failed to attract new players 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.050
 the game has nothing innovative is 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.340
 just a trophy to show me where it is 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.440
