00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.429
 there was something new at the Strasbourg School of Management 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.000
 the establishment offers a unique training in France Islamic finance 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.660
 in other words a finance consistent with the precepts of the Koran no loan to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.030
 alter no speculation no investment in certain sectors 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.680
 like arming or pornography five years of study for these new 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 university graduates because a career I have desires 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.970
 first credit law course for its 30 or so students enrolled in 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.279
 Islamic finance 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.750
 to graduate they will have to follow during this month more than 400 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.490
 class hours 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.750
 students and who will follow this course to learn of course 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.520
 the fundamentals of finance but also the fundamentals of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.510
 value systems related to Islam and binds it with the billions 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.920
 another value system than the one she was going to deal with the mechanisms 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.970
 financial turning most of these students are already working in the 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.660
 banking and insurance sector they still have the ranking 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.970
 for them this training is a bit more in their career project 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.280
 it must be said that it was created to meet one expectation at a time 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.160
 financial institutions and economic actors concerned about 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.330
 certain religious ethics 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.110
 a current world should be sufficient since Islamic finance 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.880
 does not differ from conventional finance 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.170
 only by three or four grand prizes 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.350
 I still interest is forbidden in consequently 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.150
 fundamentally that Islamic financing is funding has only 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.850
 no interest so she who does not make loans with interest 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.800
 they make financing its interest in the same way 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.060
 if you deposit your money as for the case of harm to you have an interest 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.510
 which is going down 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.820
 in the case of healthy banks and they can not pay you a 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.310
 fixed interest is the big difference 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.990
 another difference and not the least and the ban on 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.040
 speculation 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.410
 this partly explains the good financial health of Islamic banks and 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.630
 interest in their assets 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.479
 so far only the united kingdom I had developed its activities of 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.479
 Islamic finance France to catch up 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.650
 the Minister of Economy is considering adapting the framework 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.400
 this formation is delighted 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.520
 should therefore be a success
