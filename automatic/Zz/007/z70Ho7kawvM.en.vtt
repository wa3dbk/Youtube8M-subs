Basque<00:03:31.799> Gaelic<00:03:32.730> DNA<00:03:32.910> which<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.480> tall<00:03:33.840> blonde

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
Basque Gaelic DNA which is tall blonde

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.099 
Basque Gaelic DNA which is tall blonde
and<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:35.639> shaft<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.209> hair<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.750> length<00:03:36.959> of

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
and the shaft of the hair the length of

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.160 
and the shaft of the hair the length of
the<00:03:37.230> hair<00:03:37.410> had<00:03:37.739> rare<00:03:38.370> chinese<00:03:39.299> mitochondrial

the hair had rare chinese mitochondrial

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.620 
the hair had rare chinese mitochondrial
DNA<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.370> hare<00:03:41.400> had<00:03:41.790> two<00:03:42.000> strands<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.450> DNA

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
DNA so the hare had two strands of DNA

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.870 
DNA so the hare had two strands of DNA
which<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.250> can't<00:03:44.459> happen<00:03:44.549> unless

a<00:04:01.260> pretty<00:04:01.769> sorry<00:04:02.160> kind<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.609> history<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.150> it's

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
a pretty sorry kind of history but it's

a pretty sorry kind of history but it's

kind of slowly creeping door I guess our
critical<00:04:07.410> mass<00:04:07.560> where<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:07.920> think<00:04:08.069> eventually

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
critical mass where I think eventually

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.309 
critical mass where I think eventually
it's<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.419> be<00:04:09.540> sort<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.780> seriously<00:04:10.139> love

it's going to be sort of seriously love

that and scientists in the future look
back<00:04:12.329> at<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.599> say<00:04:12.750> well<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.079> know<00:04:13.169> we<00:04:13.319> lost<00:04:13.530> a

back at and say well you know we lost a

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.870 
back at and say well you know we lost a
lot<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.799> opportunities<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.549> looking<00:04:14.790> in

lot of opportunities of looking in

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.580 
lot of opportunities of looking in
something<00:04:15.180> really<00:04:15.299> interesting<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:16.019> perhaps

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
something really interesting and perhaps

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.870 
something really interesting and perhaps
we<00:04:16.889> should<00:04:17.039> have<00:04:17.130> looked<00:04:17.310> at<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.579> little<00:04:17.669> bit

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
we should have looked at it a little bit
