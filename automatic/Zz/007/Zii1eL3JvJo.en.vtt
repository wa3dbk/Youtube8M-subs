true the parts used to recreate the
Warthog<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.470> such<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.710> small<00:03:20.040> scale<00:03:20.310> were

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
Warthog in such a small scale were

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.630 
Warthog in such a small scale were
cleverly<00:03:21.360> used<00:03:21.800> but<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:22.890> think<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.190> inclusion

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
cleverly used but I think the inclusion

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.370 
cleverly used but I think the inclusion
of<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.820> large-scale<00:03:24.090> helmet<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:25.260> either

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.850 
of the large-scale helmet can either
break<00:03:25.740> or<00:03:25.920> make<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.880> line<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:28.470> new<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.740> that

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
break or make this line so new is that

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.920 
break or make this line so new is that
pretty<00:03:29.070> much<00:03:29.130> does<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.400> for<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:29.730> review<00:03:30.000> hope
