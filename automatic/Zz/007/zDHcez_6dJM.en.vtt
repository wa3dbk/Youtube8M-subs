and I fill it with hot water or warm

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.850 
and I fill it with hot water or warm
water<00:02:13.870> not<00:02:14.049> so<00:02:14.230> hot<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.530> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.709> bring

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
water not so hot it's going to bring

your hands to the point where I know

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.810 
your hands to the point where I know
it's<00:02:16.690> going<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.870> cover<00:02:17.109> my<00:02:17.739> all<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.340> parts

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
it's going to cover my all the parts

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's going to cover my all the parts
here<00:02:19.209> in<00:02:20.109> case<00:02:20.290> you're<00:02:20.440> wondering<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.980> did<00:02:21.130> not

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
here in case you're wondering I did not

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.740 
here in case you're wondering I did not
take<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:21.790> little

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
take this little

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.930 
take this little
ever<00:02:22.870> adjust<00:02:23.320> draw<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.950> wouldn't<00:02:24.700> recommend

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
ever adjust draw I wouldn't recommend

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.250 
ever adjust draw I wouldn't recommend
that<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.740> then<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.480> simply<00:02:28.480> mix<00:02:28.930> about<00:02:29.140> a

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
that and then I simply mix about a

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.410 
that and then I simply mix about a
depending<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:30.190> how<00:02:30.310> much<00:02:30.400> water<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.940> have<00:02:30.970> I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
depending on how much water you have I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.960 
depending on how much water you have I
mix<00:02:31.630> about<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.200> quarter<00:02:33.070> cup<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.490> half<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.790> cup

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
mix about a quarter cup to a half a cup

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.500 
mix about a quarter cup to a half a cup
at<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> time<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:36.640> something<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.150> stir<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
at a time and have something to stir it

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.290 
at a time and have something to stir it
with<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.100> stir<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.430> while<00:02:40.180> I'm

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
with and just stir it in while I'm

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.630 
with and just stir it in while I'm
mixing<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.140> warm<00:02:41.980> water<00:02:42.220> will<00:02:42.459> help

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
mixing it and the warm water will help

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.050 
mixing it and the warm water will help
the<00:02:44.010> will<00:02:45.010> help<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.280> citric<00:02:45.580> acid<00:02:45.940> to

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
the will help the citric acid to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.890 
the will help the citric acid to
dissolve<00:02:46.180> faster<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> key<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.240> is<00:02:49.510> then<00:02:49.690> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
dissolve faster so the key is is then to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.620 
dissolve faster so the key is is then to
just<00:02:50.050> stick<00:02:50.320> your<00:02:50.470> parts<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.640> your<00:02:52.360> metal

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
just stick your parts in your metal

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.350 
just stick your parts in your metal
parts<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:54.010> are<00:02:54.130> rusted<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.760> don't<00:02:55.000> I'm<00:02:55.300> not

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
parts that are rusted I don't I'm not

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.580 
parts that are rusted I don't I'm not
going<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.690> do<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.870> big<00:02:55.989> hand<00:02:56.200> plane<00:02:56.410> because<00:02:56.560> I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
going to do the big hand plane because I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.750 
going to do the big hand plane because I
don't<00:02:56.709> have<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.830> container<00:02:57.130> big<00:02:57.340> enough<00:02:57.580> and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
don't have a container big enough and

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.520 
don't have a container big enough and
I'll<00:02:57.850> find<00:02:58.390> some<00:02:58.570> other<00:02:58.720> ways<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.870> remove<00:02:59.380> rust

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
I'll find some other ways to remove rust

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.260 
I'll find some other ways to remove rust
from<00:02:59.709> that<00:02:59.890> later<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.290> drop<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.440> in<00:03:03.120> drop<00:03:04.120> all

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
from that later and drop it in drop all

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.510 
from that later and drop it in drop all
these<00:03:04.360> parts<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:06.070> thing<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.340> you

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
these parts in and the thing that you

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.060 
these parts in and the thing that you
want<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.760> look<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.810> make<00:03:07.840> sure<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.980> be

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
want to look for and make sure to be

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.420 
want to look for and make sure to be
careful<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:10.320> or<00:03:11.320> not<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.800> be<00:03:11.890> careful<00:03:12.220> abut

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
careful of is or not to be careful abut

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.100 
careful of is or not to be careful abut
the<00:03:12.610> thing<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.910> watch<00:03:13.060> for<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:14.020> you're

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
the thing to watch for so you're

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.690 
the thing to watch for so you're
sticking<00:03:14.290> these<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.650> here<00:03:14.770> is<00:03:15.130> after<00:03:15.520> about<00:03:15.550> a

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
sticking these in here is after about a

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.500 
sticking these in here is after about a
minute<00:03:15.910> or<00:03:16.120> two<00:03:16.330> if<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.520> solution<00:03:19.180> should

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
minute or two if if this solution should

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.930 
minute or two if if this solution should
be<00:03:19.570> bubbling<00:03:20.500> up<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.860> getting<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.190> rust<00:03:21.670> off

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
be bubbling up and getting the rust off

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.410 
be bubbling up and getting the rust off
loosening<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.600> rust<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.200> if<00:03:24.070> it's<00:03:24.250> not<00:03:24.550> then

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
loosening the rust and if it's not then

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.070 
loosening the rust and if it's not then
what<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.750> need<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.050> do<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:27.540> add<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.600> little<00:03:28.780> bit

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
what you need to do is add a little bit

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.380 
what you need to do is add a little bit
more<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.380> stir<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:29.890> but<00:03:30.340> my<00:03:30.880> solution<00:03:31.360> here

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
more and stir it in but my solution here

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.830 
more and stir it in but my solution here
is<00:03:32.130> bubbling<00:03:33.130> up<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.000> like<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.450> leave<00:03:37.660> it

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
is bubbling up and so I like to leave it

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.110 
is bubbling up and so I like to leave it
for<00:03:38.110> about<00:03:38.769> an<00:03:39.040> hour<00:03:39.100> you<00:03:39.670> could<00:03:39.820> do<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:39.970> little

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
for about an hour you could do a little

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.340 
for about an hour you could do a little
bit<00:03:40.330> less<00:03:40.570> but<00:03:41.380> then<00:03:41.560> after<00:03:41.890> an<00:03:41.980> hour<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:44.320> can

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
bit less but then after an hour you can

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.060 
bit less but then after an hour you can
go<00:03:44.560> back<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.209> start<00:03:46.209> scrubbing<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.860> rush

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
go back and start scrubbing and the rush

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.690 
go back and start scrubbing and the rush
should<00:03:48.280> start<00:03:48.580> coming<00:03:48.730> off<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:50.100> if<00:03:51.100> after<00:03:51.579> an

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
should start coming off so if after an

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.920 
should start coming off so if after an
hour<00:03:51.850> your<00:03:53.160> parts<00:03:54.160> don't<00:03:54.370> your<00:03:55.239> metal<00:03:55.660> parts

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
hour your parts don't your metal parts

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.870 
hour your parts don't your metal parts
the<00:03:56.290> rust<00:03:56.739> isn't<00:03:56.920> coming<00:03:57.220> off<00:03:57.340> really<00:03:57.579> easily

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
the rust isn't coming off really easily

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.960 
the rust isn't coming off really easily
with<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.660> wire<00:03:58.930> brush<00:03:58.959> or<00:03:59.380> toothbrush<00:03:59.970> just

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
with a wire brush or toothbrush just
