00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.719 
quite a lot so it's going to be
interesting<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.650> how<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.159> react<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
interesting to see how they react to the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.000 
interesting to see how they react to the
price<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:49.260> not<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.470> lot<00:01:49.740> because

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
price of this is not a lot because

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.130 
price of this is not a lot because
really<00:01:50.400> we're<00:01:50.580> not<00:01:50.729> paying<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.360> much<00:01:51.659> really

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
really we're not paying for much really

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.899 
really we're not paying for much really
it's<00:01:52.320> only<00:01:52.440> like<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.159> change<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.610> appearance

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
it's only like to change the appearance

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's only like to change the appearance
of<00:01:54.150> your<00:01:54.360> character<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
of your character and it's not that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.289 
of your character and it's not that
important<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.400> I<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.760> hope<00:01:56.790> they<00:01:57.060> don't

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
important so I really hope they don't

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.390 
important so I really hope they don't
put<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.600> high<00:01:57.840> price<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.440> or<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.159> just

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
put a high price on it or it will just

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.820 
put a high price on it or it will just
be<00:01:59.490> greedy<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.150> my<00:02:00.360> honest<00:02:00.840> opinion<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.770> is

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
be greedy in my honest opinion this is

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.640 
be greedy in my honest opinion this is
interesting<00:02:02.790> there<00:02:03.180> will<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.420> trial<00:02:03.990> versions

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
interesting there will be trial versions

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.969 
interesting there will be trial versions
of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.070> packs<00:02:05.310> or<00:02:05.580> skin<00:02:06.030> DLCs<00:02:06.630> meaning<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
of the packs or skin DLCs meaning you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.309 
of the packs or skin DLCs meaning you
can<00:02:08.219> try<00:02:08.549> out<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.090> skins<00:02:09.389> before<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.989> buy

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
can try out the skins before you buy

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.170 
can try out the skins before you buy
them<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:11.099> I'm<00:02:11.249> not<00:02:11.400> sure<00:02:11.639> how<00:02:11.849> they're<00:02:12.029> going

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
to do this but I think

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.890 
to do this but I think
trial<00:02:14.400> versions<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.300> skins<00:02:15.600> you'll<00:02:15.780> be

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
trial of 20 minutes or like 10 minutes
