00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.230
 once it stopped and you can see it 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.299
 We are in the Eifel am NÃ¼rburgring 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.330
 typical eifel weather it is freezing cold 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.020
 However, it is completely cold by car 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.370
 quickly warm 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.450
 an automobile legend alpine a310 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.120
 Chicago 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.020
 What immediately strikes the car goes to 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.850
 just up to the hip 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.450
 if I fit in afterwards I know 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.010
 it not 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.440
 otherwise I find that very funny 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.200
 Rieder are moored with three nuts 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.780
 only 3 if that holds back 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.550
 here under the glass is under 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.070
 not the trunk there is the engine 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.070
 I'll show you Libyan goals 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.680
 and there it is 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.489
 you notice the car is being moved 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.490
 six cylinders normally 150 ps the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.570
 here 200 ps normally 27 liters of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.430
 here 2.9 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.730
 So I think that's really fun 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.730
 the thing 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.650
 the alpine a310 was built from 1971 to 1985 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.150
 built 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.930
 there were four and 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.360
 Six-cylinder engines from 95 to 150 hp 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.770
 roaring from just under 32,000 d-mark 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.570
 the engines are already high time that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
 not actually allowed to drive 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.210
 but bring up the highway 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.479
 but the biggest thing will be what I have there 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.479
 purely 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:02:02.460
 a tall man calling a small car 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:03.690
 you have to sort me a foot pedal so 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.100
 which key what for me now 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.100
 We think we're doing that now 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.489
 2.9 liter 200 ps once it that their 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.489
 club is 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.060
 are 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.460
 amazing the car of 177 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.180
 Everything finished like modern 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.180
 feels absolutely 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.970
 177 is a true korso 26 years 36 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.970
 years 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.540
 30 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.349
 that means that cars are not nearly as old 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.019
 it is at last on the sporty 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.900
 hindlimb asphalt behind the other motor 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.890
 crawls away to yourself 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.890
 really cool 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.220
 The entrance is correct 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.490
 the whole with a family the 1000th 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.170
 kilo comment that the body 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.170
 made of fiberglass everything is super light 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.740
 You can see if I'm a little big 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.690
 for the car so here above 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.280
 Do not wait for headroom 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.230
 the legs are hidden in the tunnel 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.430
 they are all very much together 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.110
 you have to be a bit of a turn 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.110
 get used to it and sort its feet 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.390
 so makes playful 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.390
 excite 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.730
 of course express surcharge over 200 ps 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.130
 six cylinder we are a bit 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.250
 Crashing lets 30 liters go another 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.390
 refuel 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.380
 but I'll say he's not 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.330
 everyday car 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.060
 the car 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.360
 right 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.800
 the steering wheel turns on the listener and the car 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.190
 is 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.850
 directly not think this is a car 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.850
 can make 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.910
 the seats 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.770
 very much lateral support 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.889
 in the car on the race track can also 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.499
 still have fun today 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.499
 and the circuit super g 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.249
 concerns the courses immediately 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.029
 our turn 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.029
 third and fourth 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.600
 st 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.770
 all my prejudices the personal 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.380
 to have a car 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.880
 Naturally 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.880
 I have to drive a car first 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.610
 athletic and 20 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.250
 but 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.959
 really funny and also the 

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.199
 windshield wiper because we have been quite 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:21.199
 different 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:38.570
 and if you're the engine, that's what 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.940
 is then the front trunk of the need 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:45.350
 also be opened a bit complicated 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:54.540
 just here a few on aebischer 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:55.920
 pull back to make here yes then 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.680
 Everything in it what you need for the 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.270
 Oldtimer exit bit of oil 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.160
 jerrycan glass cleaner very important 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.750
 for the short break will be rich or 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.210
 alpine driver takes his luggage em on 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.210
 the rear seat with much more practical
