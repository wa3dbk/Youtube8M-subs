00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.759
 hello youtube welcome to my channel 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.920
 good is my brother but anyway I 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.080
 make a new video where we will see a 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.559
 of the pages to earn easy money and 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.449
 fast the truth is that it is not a scam 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.890
 I'm gaining a little bit of the 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.360
 area and it helps me to buy things in 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.120
 internet as in ebay 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.440
 it also depends on how much we dedicate ourselves 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.350
 make an effort and earn a lot of money 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.670
 well at the bottom I'll leave the url 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.719
 of the good page first 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.719
 we copy the url 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.340
 this url will serve us to be able 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.900
 enter the page without any problem 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.880
 let it be quickly here I have it 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.560
 copied me 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.560
 then the url 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.320
 on the website I copy and I will 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.320
 leave a page like this 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.379
 the page is called portals but the 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.399
 truth is that the truth is very good 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.500
 is that at first they do not believe much 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.600
 because there are many pages like neo books 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.509
 or something after you have to invest 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.460
 a lot of money to be able to win triple 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:17.680
 but to be doing that is like 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.930
 very complicated here this works with 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.390
 also refer the difference between 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.610
 this and the other pages is that here the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.580
 surfers can not buy surfers 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.780
 can only sustain them well we enter 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.049
 freising out 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.119
 to be able to register for free is 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.140
 a free page where you earn money 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.140
 It is very nice 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.670
 well the next thing is that we enter 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.539
 all the data that we are asked for but 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.630
 important here if you work with 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.549
 paypal I recommend that you use it if 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.880
 you leave with paisa too or 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.520
 perfect is not the same but when 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.990
 work with western union will be done 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.420
 a little more complicated because it has 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.209
 they reach the minimum 100 dollars for 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.909
 that can be paid and the minimum 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.390
 for paypal it is 3 dollars that the minimum 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.060
 the only thing they need 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.850
 good when you get in that space 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.520
 they have to place the same how is how 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.140
 is presented in the catch are recorded 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.480
 let's be mind I can not do this 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.790
 because I already have an account when 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.209
 finish follow the next steps that 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.170
 tell you the page to protect yourself when 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.130
 finish enter here halloween 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.600
 that are written write in your mail 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.600
 and the contraction they chose 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.950
 good when you start not 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.829
 this screen is almost going to come out 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.349
 as you are beginning, you are going to enter 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.159
 to this page this page will come out 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.980
 as a tutorial then you what 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.080
 they read and review all of what it is about and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.490
 things like that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.380
 we will also leave this 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.650
 what would it be that he was taught 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.350
 I also want you to enter rolls-royce 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.660
 here you will see everything you can 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.240
 do 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.340
 when a captcha came out you can not 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.320
 write random words like 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.990
 example 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.700
 type, type anything and 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.240
 write anything that can not be 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.730
 they can be varied for that reason 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.470
 for as for example are you when 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.770
 you leave a captcha of this 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.300
 way that is cut only have to 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.430
 put the word that is there you have 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.740
 the captchas have to be put such and 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.450
 as they are not case sensitive 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.580
 they import numbers they also have to 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.010
 put on correctly 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.180
 well after reviewing all this that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.180
 is the the guide and the rules we will enter 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.850
 here is the working in start working 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.069
 we will have a count to be able to complete 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.140
 captchas 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.659
 I will start doing some for 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:14.469
 show them how they can see my balance 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.469
 here is 148 and it keeps going up 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.330
 in the part of here you can observe 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.790
 that means the 0.85 means what 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.120
 is being paid do not be fooled that 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.060
 that 0.85 does not mean they are 85 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.840
 cents for each catch means that 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.030
 they will give you 8 thousandths for each 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.220
 captcha what does it mean that every time 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.979
 that you complete a captcha here 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.810
 will open by adding 8.5 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.910
 depending 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.230
 then we will continue to complete some 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.560
 causes to show them how it's going 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.560
 growing 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.090
 here you have to be able to complete 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.910
 captchas you have to be very fast and 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.300
 Well most of them lose a lot of money already 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.470
 that when you complete the captchas 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.630
 let's say when I do not know the word in 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.390
 instead of putting do not know I come and I press 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.810
 because it is preferable to put the captcha 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.360
 even if it's wrong 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.310
 that puts in one since when you put 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.100
 denounced at a discount on a large 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.530
 of your kisses of your money and that is how 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.270
 that there is no gas then nothing then 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.010
 we are already tired and we want 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.620
 see how we're going we go to that 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.810
 statistics here in statistics the 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.430
 precision is precision refers to 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.889
 the speed at which you solve the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.080
 catchment I have a 90 93.4 well 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.270
 here you can see the table in this 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.320
 table you can observe the different 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.710
 0.65 prices that means that those are 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.840
 the hours according to the server in which 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.620
 you pay more for example 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.580
 of 03 13 to 14 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:01.540
 until 8:00 p.m. 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.030
 price varies and can vary 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.150
 raise so much can be reduced the greatest 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.680
 part of the time is elevated here 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.990
 You can also observe what I have 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.000
 made the world 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.780
 of the causes I can solve for 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.009
 every 1000 captchas that you solve 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.919
 this is what you earn from 0.85 cents 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.960
 this is a table of a game I what 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.539
 we can this is how a competition in 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.699
 which in a certain time resolves 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.159
 more captchas is going to have an amount 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:33.379
 let's say these are going to be divided for 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:36.139
 pay several so you can observe 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.719
 I here try to see the truth times 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.939
 is that only a few times has he won 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.589
 let's say here you could win here 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:44.839
 you can see that I can earn how much 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:48.580
 can you win let's say I recommend them 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:52.050
 that the days go into the young 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.050
 22 to 23 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.830
 as you can tell until 0 34 that 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.470
 it's like until 12 o'clock at night 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.710
 savior question or central america a 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.320
 goodbye 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.080
 then I have won my imagine me 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.390
 I made 102 captures and the value was 40 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.820
 points 45 we are multiplying and I do not 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:17.690
 is going to leave this amount then I 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:20.490
 I came earn 20 points 12 cents is 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:24.030
 another 60 you are reflected there 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.740
 good now so that I can for them 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.389
 that you can enter this part 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.650
 of the competition do not need to be 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:30.990
 they really have not necessarily 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:35.160
 they have to have great skill but 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:37.080
 if they need to have some speed 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.800
 so I recommend you enter here 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.560
 which is a page that the example that is 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.020
 this is a discharge zone where I 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.210
 I recommend that you download this 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.180
 application that is called rapid eye pins 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:54.200
 of the good program this program is for 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:58.220
 be able to write faster 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:00.580
 on the keyboard then I leave it with me 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:05.259
