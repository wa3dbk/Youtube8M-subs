00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.330
 posed 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.620
 but when she seems so wearing 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.600
 when you see the window 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.200
 when the two kids are renting Tita Ralf therapy rooms 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.540
 Christmas cookies can not be forgotten as the garden days 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.700
 Pyramids or you want to pay attention to the time to the considered 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.990
 Suddenly it all looks like it turns off the window when 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.810
 the scene is shining outside 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.090

 Meadow is also a comfort 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.490
 quite casually we sang Christmas carols 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.860
 However, these are very exciting sounds and you can see singing together 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.930
 Let us be happy and cheerful 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.350
 that will be the text 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.990
 it's slow as the Christmas season 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 if it eventually snows 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.910
 Christmas is very popular May Esther presents gifts 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.600
 my clean what no fouls Homos Sinsen to the photos 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.510
 because he wants a present from dogs now 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.290
 from the many Christmas trees
