this can be a nice little background
stamp<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> border<00:02:05.329> different

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
snowflakes on it

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.990 
snowflakes on it
so<00:02:09.159> what<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.759> took<00:02:09.969> was<00:02:10.719> the<00:02:11.459> two<00:02:12.459> in<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> from

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
so what I took was the two in the from

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.940 
so what I took was the two in the from
and<00:02:13.530> then<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:15.900> medium<00:02:16.900> sized<00:02:17.170> snuff

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
and then this medium sized snuff

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.199 
and then this medium sized snuff
actually<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.459> think<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.000> large

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
actually I think this is the large

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.240 
actually I think this is the large
snowflake<00:02:19.719> from<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.049> collection<00:02:20.439> and<00:02:20.650> what

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
snowflake from the collection and what

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.130 
snowflake from the collection and what
I'm<00:02:21.370> using<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:22.090> my<00:02:22.780> versa<00:02:23.469> magic<00:02:24.189> chalk<00:02:25.000> ink<00:02:25.299> my

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.039 
I'm using is my versa magic chalk ink my
dew<00:02:26.200> drop<00:02:26.819> here<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.269> these<00:02:28.510> because<00:02:29.670> they

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
dew drop here I like these because they

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.949 
dew drop here I like these because they
really<00:02:32.049> cover<00:02:32.349> well<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.299> with<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.510> chalks

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
really cover well and with the chalks

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.349 
really cover well and with the chalks
they're<00:02:35.530> very<00:02:35.859> easy<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:37.239> use<00:02:38.879> your<00:02:39.879> embossing

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.140 
they're very easy to use your embossing
powders<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:42.099> embossing<00:02:42.370> powders<00:02:42.909> stay

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
powders on the embossing powders stay

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:56.960 
powders on the embossing powders stay
really<00:02:43.480> nicely<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:44.079> them<00:02:46.079> so

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.650 

there's<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.180> inside<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:02.370> then<00:03:03.450> while<00:03:04.450> that's

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
there's the inside and then while that's

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.160 
there's the inside and then while that's
drying<00:03:05.160> let<00:03:06.160> me<00:03:06.340> show<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:08.940> my<00:03:10.170> snowflakes

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
drying let me show you my snowflakes

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.220 
drying let me show you my snowflakes
here<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.190> cut<00:03:12.580> from<00:03:13.480> these<00:03:18.180> dies<00:03:19.230> in

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
here that I have cut from these dies in

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.880 
here that I have cut from these dies in
physics<00:03:20.830> this<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:23.590> set<00:03:23.980> of

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
physics this is the this set of

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.220 
physics this is the this set of
snowflakes<00:03:26.890> said<00:03:27.190> I'm<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.970> think<00:03:28.570> this<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.080> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
snowflakes said I'm I think this is the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.820 
snowflakes said I'm I think this is the
only<00:03:29.410> medium<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:32.350> know<00:03:32.440> this<00:03:32.590> size

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
only medium or you know this size

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.640 
only medium or you know this size
snowflake<00:03:33.460> set<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.940> they<00:03:34.120> have<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.960> it

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
snowflake set that they have and it

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.030 
snowflake set that they have and it
comes<00:03:35.920> with<00:03:36.070> these<00:03:36.720> 44<00:03:37.720> dies<00:03:37.960> and<00:03:38.440> I<00:03:38.620> really

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
comes with these 44 dies and I really

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.660 
comes with these 44 dies and I really
like<00:03:39.220> them<00:03:39.400> they're<00:03:39.550> all<00:03:39.700> very<00:03:40.090> different<00:03:40.690> and
