00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.350
 you set up a new aquarium 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.570
 and you are eager to add your 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.529
 fish but you have to follow some 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.650
 steps like installing a filtration 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.830
 effective establish the correct temperature 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.090
 a suitable ph and treat the water for 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.680
 eliminate chlorine and chloramines 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.270
 now your aquarium seems ready 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.730
 but not so fast 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.010
 it is generally advisable to wait 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.780
 days or even weeks before 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.220
 to add fish to a new 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.350
 aquarium or introduce them 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.739
 gradually over a period of six 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.020
 weeks 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.790
 it's about avoiding ammonia spikes 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.980
 and nitrites toxic to fish 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.790
 when developing the filter 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.590
 biological 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.750
 when fish are added a 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.070
 new aquarium it releases waste 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.960
 in water as ammonia 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.370
 toxic 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.350
 the bacteria present in the gravel 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.770
 slowly convert ammonia into 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.320
 nitrite the ammonia peak first and then 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.269
 the nitrite peak of high levels 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.479
 ammonia and nitrites are toxic 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.979
 for fish 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.020
 the biological filter will end up 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.240
 turn nitrites into nitrates 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.009
 harmless but it can take some 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.819
 weeks which may be too late for 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.799
 your fish but now you can 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.799
 activate the filter immediately 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.600
 biological with aqua elbow start and 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.969
 add your fish right now 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.579
 no need to wait at what quickstart 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.609
 contains a patented system of bacteria 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.929
 nitry droppings that lets you start 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.270
 instantly the transformation of 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.859
 toxic ammonia in nitrites this is a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.439
 two-step process 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.119
 the bacteria nitro monasse transforms 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.439
 ammonia to nitrites then the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.810
 bacteria neither too low as earth 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.479
 converts nitrite to nitrate 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.919
 harmless aqua quickstart keeping 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.229
 Ammonia and nitrite levels 

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.679
 low safely for your 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.389
 Pisces 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.399
 now you can add your 

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.380
 fish without waiting to start a 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.079
 aquarium has never been so fast and 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.590
 sure used to kouakou who start at 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.140
 starting the aquarium during a 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.270
 production of new fish during 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.990
 back changes during interviews 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.450
 regular 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.900
 after treatment during the presence 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.480
 ammonia and nitrite aqua quickstart 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.140
