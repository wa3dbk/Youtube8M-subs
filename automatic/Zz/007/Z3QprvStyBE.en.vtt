combined<00:02:12.420> land<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.320> naval<00:02:13.470> forces<00:02:13.650> first

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
combined land and naval forces first

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.340 
combined land and naval forces first
time<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.270> there's<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.450> lot<00:02:15.630> more<00:02:15.660> going<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.140> as

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
time so there's a lot more going on as

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.990 
time so there's a lot more going on as
there's<00:02:16.590> more<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.860> see<00:02:17.040> there's<00:02:17.280> more<00:02:17.489> there's

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
there's more to see there's more there's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.870 
there's more to see there's more there's
more<00:02:18.030> terrain<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.600> cover<00:02:19.250> as<00:02:20.250> more<00:02:20.489> places<00:02:20.730> to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
more terrain to cover as more places to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.150 
more terrain to cover as more places to
hide<00:02:21.180> stuff<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.739> enormously

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
hide stuff it can be enormously

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.100 
hide stuff it can be enormously
difficult<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.700> keep<00:02:23.910> track<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.239> 40<00:02:24.750> units<00:02:24.989> at

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
difficult to keep track of 40 units at

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.800 
difficult to keep track of 40 units at
the<00:02:25.170> same<00:02:25.380> time<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.430> what<00:02:27.060> we've<00:02:27.239> done<00:02:27.269> is

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
the same time so what we've done is

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.050 
the same time so what we've done is
created<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:29.040> tactical<00:02:29.610> map<00:02:29.760> if<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:29.970> in

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
created a tactical map if you in

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.100 
created a tactical map if you in
something<00:02:30.209> we<00:02:30.360> wanted<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.690> put<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.930> game

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
something we wanted to put in the game

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.170 
something we wanted to put in the game
for<00:02:31.380> quite<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.769> few<00:02:31.890> titles<00:02:32.220> now<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:33.030> it's

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
for quite a few titles now but it's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
for quite a few titles now but it's
never<00:02:33.360> quite<00:02:33.959> been<00:02:34.200> right<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.860> some<00:02:35.070> people

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
never quite been right so some people

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.860 
never quite been right so some people
might<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:36.000> putting<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.330> tactical<00:02:36.750> map

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
might think that putting a tactical map

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.900 
might think that putting a tactical map
into<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> game<00:02:37.320> may<00:02:37.530> make<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.920> too<00:02:38.220> easy<00:02:38.250> can't

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
into the game may make it too easy can't

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.280 
into the game may make it too easy can't
actually<00:02:39.030> control<00:02:39.390> units<00:02:39.630> from<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.870> level

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
actually control units from that level

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.350 
actually control units from that level
that's<00:02:40.830> very<00:02:41.100> much<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.430> tactical<00:02:41.880> overview

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that's very much a tactical overview

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.720 
that's very much a tactical overview
it's<00:02:42.570> really<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.930> great<00:02:43.400> orientation<00:02:44.400> tool

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
it's really a great orientation tool

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.610 
it's really a great orientation tool
there's<00:02:45.510> something<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.170> players<00:02:46.410> have

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
there's something that the players have

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.080 
there's something that the players have
been<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.860> know<00:02:46.920> crying<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.670> four<00:02:47.910> years

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
been you know crying out for four years

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.699 
been you know crying out for four years
and<00:02:48.269> we're<00:02:48.510> finally<00:02:48.750> delivering<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.380> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
and we're finally delivering it the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.110 
and we're finally delivering it the
tactical<00:02:50.160> map<00:02:50.280> really<00:02:50.610> helps<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.940> keep<00:02:51.060> track

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
tactical map really helps you keep track

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
tactical map really helps you keep track
of<00:02:51.360> where<00:02:51.690> things<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:52.200> where<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.860> are<00:02:53.010> where

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
of where things are where you are where

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.250 
of where things are where you are where
they're<00:02:53.430> means

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.480 

so<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.470> next<00:02:57.500> step<00:02:57.800> diary<00:02:58.010> we're<00:02:58.250> leaving

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490

vision<00:03:18.260> was<00:03:18.350> done<00:03:18.500> pre-alpha<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.580> it's<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.730> very

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
vision was done pre-alpha so it's a very

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.390 
vision was done pre-alpha so it's a very
early<00:03:20.120> stage<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.690> development<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:22.250> lots

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
early stage of development and a lots

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.830 
early stage of development and a lots
changed<00:03:22.490> since<00:03:22.790> then<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.270> at<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.510> point<00:03:23.570> we

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
changed since then so at that point we

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.230 
changed since then so at that point we
put<00:03:24.080> in<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.380> got<00:03:24.890> unit<00:03:25.400> looks<00:03:25.580> into<00:03:26.060> great

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
put in we got unit looks into great

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.940 
put in we got unit looks into great
diversity<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.930> look<00:03:27.110> good<00:03:27.320> but<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.800> wasn't

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
diversity and look good but it wasn't

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.640 
diversity and look good but it wasn't
with<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.520> final<00:03:28.880> system<00:03:29.210> as<00:03:29.390> we<00:03:30.170> release<00:03:30.290> more

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
with the final system as we release more

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.990 
with the final system as we release more
art<00:03:30.800> for<00:03:31.010> Rome<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.520> will<00:03:31.670> see<00:03:31.820> this

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
art for Rome to you will see this

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.880

difference<00:03:32.450> between<00:03:32.840> what<00:03:33.440> we<00:03:33.560> showed<00:03:33.740> in

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
difference between what we showed in

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.410 
difference between what we showed in
Carthage<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.640> what<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.970> units<00:03:35.240> will<00:03:35.300> look

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
Carthage and what the units will look

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.140 
Carthage and what the units will look
like<00:03:35.570> in<00:03:35.720> finally
