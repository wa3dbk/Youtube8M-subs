sections here are where you're actually

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.200 
sections here are where you're actually
going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> put<00:01:49.049> your<00:01:49.200> adhesive<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.250> make<00:01:51.060> sure

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
going to put your adhesive so make sure

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.760 
going to put your adhesive so make sure
you<00:01:51.299> only<00:01:51.420> cut<00:01:51.720> around<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.170> solid<00:01:52.380> black

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you only cut around the solid black

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.710 
you only cut around the solid black
lines<00:01:53.100> these<00:01:53.729> dashed<00:01:54.000> lines<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.540> where

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
lines these dashed lines are where

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.590 
lines these dashed lines are where
you're<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:55.530> fold<00:01:56.450> fold<00:01:57.450> this

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you're going to actually fold fold this

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
you're going to actually fold fold this
piece<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.380> let<00:01:58.560> me<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.740> ahead<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.250> fold<00:01:59.670> this

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
piece so let me go ahead and fold this

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.940 
piece so let me go ahead and fold this
together<00:02:00.030> right<00:02:00.390> now<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.500> pretty<00:02:01.680> easy

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
together right now and it's pretty easy

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.810 
together right now and it's pretty easy
to<00:02:02.310> put<00:02:02.430> together

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
to put together

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.120 
to put together
I<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.390> recommend<00:02:03.750> folding<00:02:04.259> each<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.799> both

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
I do recommend folding each one both

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.469 
I do recommend folding each one both
ways<00:02:06.140> because<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.220> fold<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.729> only<00:02:08.910> one<00:02:09.239> way

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
ways because if you fold it only one way

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.479 
ways because if you fold it only one way
it's<00:02:09.690> not<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.410> much

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
it's not going to have as much

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.020 
it's not going to have as much
it's<00:02:11.940> not<00:02:12.030> gonna<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.300> strong<00:02:13.700> make<00:02:14.700> sure<00:02:14.879> we

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
it's not gonna be as strong make sure we

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:25.520 
it's not gonna be as strong make sure we
fold<00:02:17.390> all<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.450> these<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:25.170> once<00:02:25.349> we've<00:02:25.500> got

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
fold all of these and once we've got

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.070 
fold all of these and once we've got
everything<00:02:25.980> folded<00:02:26.760> I'm<00:02:27.599> going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.900> go<00:02:27.989> ahead

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
everything folded I'm going to go ahead

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.660 
everything folded I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:28.260> put<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.830> my<00:02:28.950> card<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.400> I'm<00:02:29.489> going<00:02:29.519> to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
and put this in my card and I'm going to

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.809 
and put this in my card and I'm going to
put<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.510> -<00:02:30.750> side<00:02:31.140> down<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.760> don't

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
put this the - side down because I don't

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.690 
put this the - side down because I don't
want<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.150> showing<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.660> card<00:02:34.459> all<00:02:35.459> right<00:02:35.489> so

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
want it showing in the card all right so

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.570 
want it showing in the card all right so
this<00:02:35.819> dash<00:02:36.360> line<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.230> actually<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.980> center<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
this dash line is actually the center of

this dash line is actually the center of
the<00:02:38.819> card<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.750> going<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.080> be<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
middle point of it you're going to want

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.620 
middle point of it you're going to want
it<00:02:44.849> slightly<00:02:45.299> above<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:46.829> body<00:02:47.269> not<00:02:48.269> too<00:02:48.450> much

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
it slightly above the body not too much

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.030 
it slightly above the body not too much
but<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.410> little<00:02:49.530> bit<00:02:51.260> also<00:02:52.260> when<00:02:52.920> you're

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
but just a little bit also when you're

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.460 
but just a little bit also when you're
putting<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.579> your<00:02:53.610> card<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.599> red<00:02:55.200> piece

putting this in your card the red piece
down<00:02:55.799> here<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.310> want<00:02:56.489> at<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.730> bottom<00:02:56.879> so<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
down here you want at the bottom so the

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.960 
down here you want at the bottom so the
smaller<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.110> two<00:02:58.260> sections<00:02:59.250> make<00:02:59.849> sure

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
smaller of the two sections make sure

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.400 
smaller of the two sections make sure
it's<00:03:00.090> at<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.239> bottom<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.110> I'm<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.319> flip

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
it's at the bottom so I'm going to flip

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.410 
it's at the bottom so I'm going to flip
this<00:03:01.620> over<00:03:01.769> I'm<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:02.849> using<00:03:03.030> I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
this over I'm going to be using I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.000 
this over I'm going to be using I
recommend<00:03:03.870> using<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.230> strongest<00:03:04.590> adhesive

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
recommend using the strongest adhesive

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.920 
recommend using the strongest adhesive
you<00:03:05.099> have<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.610> going<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.819> use<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.120> ATG<00:03:06.569> con

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
you have I'm going to use this ATG con

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.080 
you have I'm going to use this ATG con
just<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.620> don't<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.310> time<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.940> let<00:03:09.060> a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
just because I don't have time to let a

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.360 
just because I don't have time to let a
wet<00:03:09.420> adhesive<00:03:09.959> dry<00:03:10.230> which<00:03:10.920> i<00:03:11.040> think<00:03:11.099> would

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
wet adhesive dry which i think would

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.309 
wet adhesive dry which i think would
probably<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> bit<00:03:12.420> stronger<00:03:12.720> than<00:03:12.959> this

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
probably be a bit stronger than this

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.509 
probably be a bit stronger than this
although<00:03:13.739> this<00:03:14.430> is<00:03:14.579> pretty<00:03:14.819> strong<00:03:15.120> tape<00:03:16.519> just

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
although this is pretty strong tape just

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.210 
although this is pretty strong tape just
go<00:03:17.730> ahead<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.359> take<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.690> these<00:03:19.220> red

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
go ahead and take about these red

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.830 
go ahead and take about these red
triangles<00:03:20.850> here<00:03:20.940> on<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> sides<00:03:21.389> of<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.470> X

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
triangles here on the sides of that X

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.030 
triangles here on the sides of that X
now<00:03:24.840> I'm<00:03:24.930> going<00:03:25.139> to<00:03:25.290> place<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.799> in<00:03:25.980> the

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
now I'm going to place this in the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.949 
now I'm going to place this in the
middle<00:03:26.250> again<00:03:26.459> make<00:03:26.609> sure<00:03:26.639> that<00:03:26.819> this<00:03:27.180> red

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
middle again make sure that this red

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.360 
middle again make sure that this red
section<00:03:28.319> is<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> bottom<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.250> I'm<00:03:29.310> going

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
section is on the bottom and I'm going

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.470 
section is on the bottom and I'm going
to<00:03:29.489> place<00:03:29.670> these<00:03:29.910> dashed<00:03:30.840> lines<00:03:30.989> down<00:03:32.480> I'm

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
to place these dashed lines down I'm

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.569 
to place these dashed lines down I'm
going<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.690> put<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.959> side<00:03:34.230> down<00:03:34.440> first<00:03:34.739> make

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
going to put this side down first make

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.610 
going to put this side down first make
sure<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.940> X<00:03:36.359> is<00:03:36.720> just<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:37.019> tiny<00:03:37.230> little<00:03:37.470> bit

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
sure this X is just a tiny little bit

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:46.400 
sure this X is just a tiny little bit
above<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.950> body<00:03:43.549> place<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.730> other<00:03:44.880> side<00:03:45.410> all

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
above the body place the other side all

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.699 
above the body place the other side all
right

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
right

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.080 
right
there's<00:03:47.250> that<00:03:47.430> what<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:47.609> looks<00:03:47.910> like

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
there's that what that looks like

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.280 
there's that what that looks like

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.089 
on this top section right here press it
up<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.870> kind<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.169> folds<00:03:55.500> up<00:03:55.620> like<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.829> milk

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
up so it kind of folds up like a milk

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.860 
up so it kind of folds up like a milk
carton<00:03:56.280> you're<00:03:57.120> going<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.299> do<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.480> same<00:03:57.630> thing

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
carton you're going to do the same thing

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.470 
carton you're going to do the same thing
with<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.079> bottom<00:03:58.819> so<00:03:59.819> basically<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.299> looks

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
with the bottom so basically it looks

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.430 
with the bottom so basically it looks
like<00:04:00.630> this<00:04:00.980> so<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.130> kind<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.400> folds<00:04:02.669> up<00:04:02.819> and

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
like this so it kind of folds up and

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.069 
like this so it kind of folds up and
they<00:04:04.440> should<00:04:04.680> actually<00:04:05.069> meet<00:04:05.750> when<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.870> start

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
they should actually meet when you start

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.110 
they should actually meet when you start
holding<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.500> card<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.280> kind<00:04:08.609> of<00:04:08.760> fold<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
holding the card so you kind of fold the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.770 
holding the card so you kind of fold the
card<00:04:09.359> down<00:04:09.569> so<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:11.700> get<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:11.880> really<00:04:12.329> good

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
card down so you get a really good

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.159 
card down so you get a really good
crease<00:04:13.109> in<00:04:13.410> there<00:04:14.030> now<00:04:15.030> you'll<00:04:15.419> see<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.870> should

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
crease in there now you'll see it should

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.830 
crease in there now you'll see it should
turn<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:16.919> pop<00:04:17.039> up<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.269> final<00:04:18.630> thing<00:04:18.660> is

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
turn and pop up so the final thing is

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.390 
turn and pop up so the final thing is

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
here on this section right here just

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.799 
here on this section right here just
like<00:04:54.539> that<00:04:55.490> all<00:04:56.490> right<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.879> I'm<00:04:57.240> going<00:04:57.539> to<00:04:57.569> put

00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:57.809 
like that all right and I'm going to put

like that all right and I'm going to put
my<00:04:57.930> adhesive<00:04:58.229> down<00:04:58.499> right<00:04:58.649> here<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.729> only

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
my adhesive down right here the only

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.369 
my adhesive down right here the only
problem<00:05:00.300> with<00:05:00.389> putting<00:05:00.629> this<00:05:00.809> head<00:05:00.990> on<00:05:01.139> is

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
problem with putting this head on is

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.959 
problem with putting this head on is
sometimes<00:05:01.969> when<00:05:02.969> you<00:05:03.330> close<00:05:03.899> the<00:05:04.139> actual<00:05:04.439> card

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
sometimes when you close the actual card

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.629 
sometimes when you close the actual card
the<00:05:05.969> head<00:05:06.149> will<00:05:06.330> pop<00:05:06.449> out<00:05:06.689> like<00:05:06.930> this<00:05:07.279> um<00:05:08.279> so

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
the head will pop out like this um so

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.489 
the head will pop out like this um so
and<00:05:08.789> then<00:05:08.909> sometimes<00:05:09.509> it<00:05:09.809> won't<00:05:09.960> be<00:05:10.169> quite

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:10.499 
and then sometimes it won't be quite

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:12.469 
and then sometimes it won't be quite
even<00:05:10.919> so<00:05:11.099> I<00:05:11.370> almost<00:05:11.759> recommend<00:05:12.270> putting

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
even so I almost recommend putting

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.889 
even so I almost recommend putting
something<00:05:13.020> not<00:05:13.349> too<00:05:13.889> sticky<00:05:14.279> on<00:05:14.610> this<00:05:15.419> to<00:05:15.689> kind

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:15.899 
something not too sticky on this to kind

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.499 
something not too sticky on this to kind
of<00:05:15.960> test<00:05:16.229> out<00:05:16.439> and<00:05:16.710> see<00:05:16.919> where<00:05:17.219> you<00:05:17.339> want<00:05:17.610> to

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
of test out and see where you want to

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.019 
of test out and see where you want to
place<00:05:18.659> the<00:05:18.960> head<00:05:19.279> I'm<00:05:20.279> comfortable<00:05:20.729> with<00:05:20.879> it

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:21.029

open up to reveal a perfectly placed
head<00:06:10.949> could<00:06:11.610> be<00:06:11.699> a<00:06:11.729> little<00:06:11.939> bit<00:06:12.029> lower<00:06:12.180> but<00:06:12.449> I'm

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
head could be a little bit lower but I'm

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.969 
head could be a little bit lower but I'm
going<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.169> go<00:06:13.229> ahead<00:06:13.289> and<00:06:13.469> leave<00:06:13.559> it<00:06:13.740> just

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
going to go ahead and leave it just

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:15.739 
going to go ahead and leave it just
because<00:06:14.219> of<00:06:14.249> this<00:06:14.490> problem<00:06:14.849> and<00:06:15.059> if<00:06:15.269> you<00:06:15.360> do

00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:15.749 
because of this problem and if you do

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:17.809 
because of this problem and if you do
encounter<00:06:16.019> this<00:06:16.349> problem<00:06:16.409> I<00:06:16.949> found<00:06:17.490> that

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
encounter this problem I found that

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.129 
encounter this problem I found that
curling<00:06:18.779> the<00:06:19.259> front<00:06:19.949> nose<00:06:20.279> here<00:06:20.899> will<00:06:21.899> kind<00:06:22.080> of

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
curling the front nose here will kind of

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.350 
curling the front nose here will kind of
help<00:06:22.259> it<00:06:22.439> to<00:06:23.300> slide<00:06:24.300> a<00:06:24.860> little<00:06:25.860> better

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
help it to slide a little better

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:36.240 
help it to slide a little better
not<00:06:27.360> too<00:06:27.539> much

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:44.530 

it's<00:06:37.250> a<00:06:37.370> little<00:06:37.550> better<00:06:41.980> that<00:06:42.980> works<00:06:43.420> so<00:06:44.420> when

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
it's a little better that works so when

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.820
