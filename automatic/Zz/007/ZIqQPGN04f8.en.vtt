00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
to and then lift up one foot like so
once<00:01:37.020> you're<00:01:37.200> confident<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.610> go

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
once you're confident with that and go

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.760 
once you're confident with that and go
up<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.119> one<00:01:39.299> foot<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.200> take<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> hands

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
up on one foot and you take the hands

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.789 
up on one foot and you take the hands
away<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.790> feel<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> balance<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.659> that

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
away and just feel the balance like that

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.990 
away and just feel the balance like that
it's<00:01:43.799> very<00:01:44.100> important<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.790> practice

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it's very important that you practice

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.550 
it's very important that you practice
this<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> right<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> left<00:01:46.320> foot

equally and then once you build up the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.719 
equally and then once you build up the
confidence<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.500> using<00:01:49.890> something<00:01:50.189> solid<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
confidence of using something solid to

rolling

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.960 

now<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:57.830> we<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.220> balance<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.790> things

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
now that we have the balance and things

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.030 
now that we have the balance and things
organized<00:01:59.540> it's<00:02:00.020> time<00:02:00.260> to<00:02:00.380> start<00:02:00.620> looking<00:02:00.950> at

the<00:02:01.160> push<00:02:01.400> it's<00:02:02.120> very<00:02:02.450> important<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.140> you

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the push it's very important that you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.350 
the push it's very important that you
learn<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.530> push<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.920> side<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.000> not<00:02:05.180> too

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
learn to push to the side and not too

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.960

on<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.140> bigger<00:03:38.470> radius<00:03:38.830> corner<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.940> then<00:03:40.180> as

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
on a bigger radius corner and then as

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.150 
on a bigger radius corner and then as
you<00:03:40.510> get<00:03:40.630> more<00:03:40.810> confident<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.470> more<00:03:41.530> advanced

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
you get more confident and more advanced

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.010 
you get more confident and more advanced
slowly<00:03:42.820> make<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.270> corner<00:03:43.570> tighter<00:03:43.840> and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
slowly make the corner tighter and

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.410 
slowly make the corner tighter and
tighter<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.470> tighter<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:45.610> also<00:03:45.850> important

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
tighter and tighter it's also important

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.690 
tighter and tighter it's also important
you<00:03:46.450> practice<00:03:46.900> turning<00:03:47.170> left<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.830> right<00:03:48.070> the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
you practice turning left and right the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.610 
you practice turning left and right the
way<00:03:48.850> we<00:03:49.030> do<00:03:49.210> this<00:03:49.360> is<00:03:49.420> lay<00:03:49.750> some<00:03:49.990> cones<00:03:50.350> or

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
way we do this is lay some cones or

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.680 
way we do this is lay some cones or
other<00:03:50.770> objects<00:03:51.310> on<00:03:51.490> the<00:03:51.580> ground<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:52.150> then

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
other objects on the ground and then

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.570 
other objects on the ground and then
slam<00:03:53.200> your<00:03:53.350> body<00:03:53.560> through<00:03:53.890> them<00:03:54.100> using<00:03:54.460> your

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
slam your body through them using your

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.540 
slam your body through them using your
body<00:03:54.820> weight<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.300> turn<00:03:55.570> both<00:03:55.930> left<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.590> right

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.580 

the<00:04:00.550> world<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.940> not<00:04:01.120> flat<00:04:01.360> so<00:04:01.750> therefore<00:04:02.440> it's

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
the world is not flat so therefore it's

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.080 
the world is not flat so therefore it's
also<00:04:02.740> important<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.310> practice<00:04:03.730> jumping

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
also important to practice jumping

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.020 
also important to practice jumping
obstacles<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.780> things<00:04:05.020> at<00:04:05.590> first<00:04:05.950> start<00:04:06.760> just

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
obstacles and things at first start just

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.090 
obstacles and things at first start just
practicing<00:04:07.570> without<00:04:07.690> an<00:04:07.990> obstacle<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.650> then

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
practicing without an obstacle and then

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.910 
practicing without an obstacle and then
step<00:04:09.370> by<00:04:09.550> step<00:04:09.880> croak<00:04:10.600> this<00:04:10.750> jumping<00:04:11.170> it's

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
step by step croak this jumping it's

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.290 
step by step croak this jumping it's
important<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.460> always<00:04:12.610> keep<00:04:12.880> your<00:04:12.940> beat

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
important you always keep your beat

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.660 
important you always keep your beat
under<00:04:13.960> your<00:04:14.110> body<00:04:14.320> so<00:04:14.980> therefore<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.520> have

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
under your body so therefore you have

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.990 
under your body so therefore you have
complete<00:04:16.000> balance<00:04:16.739> exactly<00:04:17.739> like<00:04:17.920> that<00:04:18.000> now

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
complete balance exactly like that now

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
complete balance exactly like that now
that<00:04:19.180> we've<00:04:19.299> been<00:04:19.420> through<00:04:19.630> many<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.930> the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
that we've been through many of the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.410 
that we've been through many of the
basic<00:04:20.200> exercises<00:04:20.730> it's<00:04:21.730> important<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.240> we

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
basic exercises it's important that we

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.760 
basic exercises it's important that we
maybe<00:04:22.600> start<00:04:22.930> looking<00:04:23.230> at<00:04:23.320> something<00:04:23.500> more

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
maybe start looking at something more

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.070 
maybe start looking at something more
advanced<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:25.060> most<00:04:25.300> simple<00:04:25.510> advanced

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
advanced the most simple advanced

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.220 
advanced the most simple advanced
exercise<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.890> skating<00:04:27.160> backwards<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.990> skate
