00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
addicted to the smartphone and this is

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.740 
addicted to the smartphone and this is
it<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> helicopter<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.689> is

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
it so this is the helicopter and this is

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
what you get in the pack so you have the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.310 
what you get in the pack so you have the
helicopter<00:00:24.210> itself<00:00:24.539> which<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.050> easy

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
to fly it has a gyro inside it so the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.300 
to fly it has a gyro inside it so the
balance<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.900> brilliant<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.619> then<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> get

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
balance is brilliant and then you get

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.310 
balance is brilliant and then you get
the<00:00:29.429> transmitter<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.080> plugs

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the transmitter and this is what plugs

copter<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:43.050> quite

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
copter I really like this because quite

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.990 
copter I really like this because quite
often<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.100> helicopters<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.850> get

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
often with these helicopters you get

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.869 
often with these helicopters you get
bulky<00:00:45.510> remote<00:00:45.809> controls<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.710> take<00:00:47.250> lots<00:00:47.760> of

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
bulky remote controls that take lots of

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.369 
bulky remote controls that take lots of
batteries<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.450> need<00:00:48.719> replacing<00:00:48.960> quite

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
batteries and need replacing quite

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350 
batteries and need replacing quite
quickly<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.280> much<00:00:50.460> easier<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.300> able

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
quickly it's much easier to just be able

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.270 
quickly it's much easier to just be able
to<00:00:51.480> plug<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> into<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.410> computer<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:53.160> your

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
to plug it into your computer or your

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.069 
to plug it into your computer or your
laptop<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.789> charge<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> then

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
laptop to charge it up and then

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.410 
laptop to charge it up and then
obviously<00:00:55.260> your<00:00:55.620> remote<00:00:55.890> control<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:57.059> your

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
obviously your remote control is your

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.380 
obviously your remote control is your
phone<00:00:57.859> finally<00:00:58.859> inside<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.670> box<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
phone finally inside the box we have a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.180 
phone finally inside the box we have a
couple<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> spare<00:01:00.989> parts<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.770> Copts<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
couple of spare parts the Copts is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.860 
couple of spare parts the Copts is
really<00:01:02.460> durable<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.239> never<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.570> just

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
really durable but you never know just

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.690 
really durable but you never know just
in<00:01:03.989> case<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> major<00:01:05.159> crash<00:01:05.489> or

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
in case you do have a major crash or

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.820 
in case you do have a major crash or
something<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.960> some<00:01:07.140> extra<00:01:07.260> parts

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
something you do have some extra parts

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.429 
something you do have some extra parts
and<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.549> also<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> manual<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.630> I

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and then you also have the manual and I

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
and then you also have the manual and I
really<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> man<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:12.090> manuals

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really I think the man use manuals

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.980 
really I think the man use manuals
actually<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> really<00:01:13.170> good<00:01:13.680> piece<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.549> kit

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
actually a really good piece of this kit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.420 
actually a really good piece of this kit

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
again quite often you just get flimsy

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.770 
again quite often you just get flimsy
pieces<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> paper<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.299> don't<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.600> tell

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
pieces of paper that don't really tell

pieces of paper that don't really tell

and we should get some brilliant
flashing<00:02:31.060> lights<00:02:31.269> in<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.540> second<00:02:31.959> it's<00:02:32.709> quite

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
flashing lights in a second it's quite

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.199 
flashing lights in a second it's quite
useful<00:02:33.099> actually<00:02:33.489> that<00:02:33.580> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.700> turn<00:02:34.060> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
to save some battery you can just turn

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.110 
to save some battery you can just turn
the<00:02:37.630> lights<00:02:37.810> off<00:02:38.019> if<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.860> want<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.580> then

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
the lights off if you want to and then

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.210 
the lights off if you want to and then
you<00:02:40.299> have<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.720> transmitter<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.799> transmitter

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
you have the transmitter the transmitter

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.160 
you have the transmitter the transmitter
has<00:02:42.280> been<00:02:42.340> charged<00:02:42.940> up<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.330> we<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.599> see<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
has been charged up and we can see the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.120 
has been charged up and we can see the
LED<00:02:44.560> lights<00:02:44.799> I'm<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:45.910> plug<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.390> in

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
LED lights I'm just going to plug it in

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.800 
LED lights I'm just going to plug it in
and<00:02:48.239> here<00:02:49.239> we<00:02:49.330> go

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
and here we go

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.600 
and here we go
we<00:02:50.170> should<00:02:50.380> be<00:02:50.500> ready<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.799> go

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.730 

now<00:02:57.270> what<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.630> think<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:58.020> one<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.350> best

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
now what I think is one of the best

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.370 
now what I think is one of the best
things<00:02:59.040> about<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.490> product<00:02:59.760> if<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.810> want<00:03:01.170> to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
you can either control it just using the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.930 
you can either control it just using the
button<00:03:03.510> or<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.680> can<00:03:04.800> switch<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.280> motion

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
button or you can switch on motion

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.030 
button or you can switch on motion
control<00:03:06.390> if<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.290> switch<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.650> motion

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
control if I just switch on motion

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.020 
control if I just switch on motion
control<00:03:08.460> now

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.850 

you<00:03:12.030> can<00:03:12.240> actually<00:03:12.510> just<00:03:13.140> control<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.620> by

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
you can actually just control it by

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.310 
you can actually just control it by
tilting<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.670> phone<00:03:17.690> which<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.110> much

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
tilting the phone which is so much

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.050 
tilting the phone which is so much
easier<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.860> use<00:03:19.890> because<00:03:20.250> obviously<00:03:20.460> tilting

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
easier to use because obviously tilting

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.750 
easier to use because obviously tilting
the<00:03:21.180> phone<00:03:21.210> is<00:03:21.720> more<00:03:21.870> intuitive<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.610> makes

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the phone is more intuitive and it makes

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.100 
the phone is more intuitive and it makes
it<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.180> much<00:03:24.210> easier<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.870> fly<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:27.630> there<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:27.960> go

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
it so much easier to fly and there we go

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.170 
it so much easier to fly and there we go
so<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.590> is<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.190> Lightspeed<00:03:29.700> I<00:03:31.010> helicopter

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
so that is the Lightspeed I helicopter

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.720 
so that is the Lightspeed I helicopter
from<00:03:33.180> think<00:03:33.420> is<00:03:33.540> low
