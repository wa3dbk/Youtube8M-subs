00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
because if it is smooth the primer will

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.330 
because if it is smooth the primer will
actually<00:05:23.120> kind<00:05:23.540> of<00:05:23.630> evenly<00:05:24.500> coat<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:25.010> a<00:05:25.130> little

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340
