it after taking it off and cleaning it
and<00:02:23.209> restoring<00:02:24.109> it<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.500> think<00:02:25.400> many<00:02:25.549> times<00:02:25.879> our

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and restoring it I think many times our

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.379 
and restoring it I think many times our
dancers<00:02:26.659> feel<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.500> certain<00:02:28.069> connection<00:02:28.879> to

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:29.389

dancers feel a certain connection to
older<00:02:29.719> costumes<00:02:30.230> there's<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.650> history<00:02:31.010> there

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
older costumes there's a history there

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.670 
older costumes there's a history there
in<00:02:31.370> an<00:02:31.459> older<00:02:31.730> costume<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.359> think<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.290> gives

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
in an older costume I think that gives

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.429 
in an older costume I think that gives
them<00:02:33.829> a<00:02:34.250> feeling<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.849> nostalgia<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.750> wear<00:02:36.170> this

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
them a feeling of nostalgia to wear this

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.289 
them a feeling of nostalgia to wear this
costume<00:02:36.799> that's<00:02:37.189> been<00:02:37.430> around<00:02:37.549> for<00:02:38.030> decades

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
and is nice and a way to kind of extend

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.129

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
out each layer separately so that you

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.930 
out each layer separately so that you

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
create that nice flat - to shape

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.000 
create that nice flat - to shape
then<00:04:11.270> tax<00:04:11.660> each<00:04:12.170> layer<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:12.860> one

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
then tax each layer to the one

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.550 
then tax each layer to the one
underneath<00:04:13.370> working<00:04:14.180> around<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.990> entire<00:04:15.290> -

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.580 
underneath working around the entire -
to<00:04:15.770> a<00:04:16.000> lot<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.120> our<00:04:17.209> bodies<00:04:17.510> they<00:04:17.959> come<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.560> a

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
to a lot of our bodies they come to a

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.650 
to a lot of our bodies they come to a
very<00:04:19.010> severe<00:04:19.370> point<00:04:19.760> at<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.090> center<00:04:20.269> front

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
and to get that very exact point it

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.290 
and to get that very exact point it
takes<00:04:24.380> laying<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.490> bodice<00:04:25.760> on<00:04:25.880> an<00:04:26.030> ironing

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
table and then literally using a hammer

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.560 
table and then literally using a hammer
to<00:04:29.630> kind<00:04:29.900> of<00:04:29.960> pound<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:30.620> shape<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:34.570> it

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
to kind of pound it and shape it it

movement that they do it's like

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.150

dancer is a happy dancer and ultimately
they'll<00:05:50.120> dance<00:05:50.330> better<00:05:51.400> and<00:05:52.400> I<00:05:52.520> think<00:05:52.610> that

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
they'll dance better and I think that

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.790 
they'll dance better and I think that
when<00:05:53.270> these<00:05:53.450> girls<00:05:53.840> get<00:05:54.080> out<00:05:54.140> on<00:05:54.380> stage<00:05:54.620> and

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
when these girls get out on stage and

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.750 
when these girls get out on stage and
that<00:05:54.890> curtain<00:05:55.280> goes<00:05:55.430> up

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
that curtain goes up

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.870 
that curtain goes up
I<00:05:55.790> think<00:05:56.360> these<00:05:56.690> new<00:05:57.050> tutus<00:05:57.770> will<00:05:58.100> make<00:05:58.400> a<00:05:58.610> huge

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
I think these new tutus will make a huge

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.330 
I think these new tutus will make a huge
