out of duct tape
let's<00:00:28.920> get<00:00:29.279> started<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:31.109> begin<00:00:31.289> take<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.219> single

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
let's get started to begin take a single

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.260 
let's get started to begin take a single
red<00:00:33.030> rubber<00:00:33.360> band<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.050> wrap<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.280> around<00:00:35.430> your

red rubber band and wrap it around your
hook<00:00:36.750> three<00:00:37.079> times<00:00:39.050> then<00:00:40.050> take<00:00:40.739> two

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
hook three times then take two

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.860 
hook three times then take two
additional<00:00:42.300> red<00:00:42.750> rubber<00:00:43.230> bands<00:00:44.660> place<00:00:45.660> them

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
additional red rubber bands place them

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.740 
additional red rubber bands place them
on<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.020> hook<00:00:46.320> pull<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.010> tight<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:47.750> push

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
on your hook pull it tight and then push

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
on your hook pull it tight and then push
that<00:00:49.050> tripled<00:00:49.320> over<00:00:49.950> band<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.700> center<00:00:50.730> if

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that tripled over band to the center if

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.799 
that tripled over band to the center if
it<00:00:52.110> won't<00:00:52.260> push<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:53.309> pinch<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.210> pull<00:00:54.270> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it won't push you can pinch and pull it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.880 
it won't push you can pinch and pull it
over<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.260> hook<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> should<00:01:01.680> look<00:01:01.710> like

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
over your hook so it should look like

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.840 
over your hook so it should look like
that<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.579> begin<00:01:02.870> then<00:01:03.870> take<00:01:04.199> another<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:05.189> red

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that to begin then take another two red

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.539 
that to begin then take another two red
rubber<00:01:05.880> bands<00:01:09.140> slide<00:01:10.140> them<00:01:10.409> through<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:13.549> then

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
rubber bands slide them through and then

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:23.050 
rubber bands slide them through and then
we're<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.240> switch<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.409> two<00:01:16.710> green<00:01:17.220> bands

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.210 

so<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.299> should<00:01:24.450> look<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.590> start<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so it should look like this to start and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.140 
so it should look like this to start and
now<00:01:27.060> we're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.909> not<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
now we're going to go back into not the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.249 
now we're going to go back into not the
cap<00:01:30.390> band<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.380> first<00:01:31.770> pair<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> bands

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
cap band but this first pair of bands

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:41.990 
cap band but this first pair of bands
with<00:01:34.259> our<00:01:34.439> hook<00:01:36.140> like<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:39.979> add<00:01:40.979> two<00:01:41.670> more

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
with our hook like that and add two more

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
with our hook like that and add two more
red<00:01:42.720> bands<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> now<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.420> should<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.979> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
red bands so now you should have the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.370 
red bands so now you should have the
pair<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.549> red<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.390> pair<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> green<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.350> your

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
pair of red and a pair of green on your

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.609 
pair of red and a pair of green on your
hook<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.070> we're<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> take<00:01:54.420> two<00:01:54.899> green

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
hook and we're going to take two green

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.410 
hook and we're going to take two green
bands<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.960> B<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.530> Bing<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.219> bring<00:01:59.820> them

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

through<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:01.049> four<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> those<00:02:01.890> loops<00:02:04.579> like

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
through all four of those loops like

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.690 
through all four of those loops like
that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.250 

now<00:02:09.700> we're<00:02:09.970> going<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.120> go<00:02:10.300> back<00:02:10.540> into<00:02:10.900> that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
now we're going to go back into that

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.420 
now we're going to go back into that
first<00:02:11.950> pair<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.400> rubber<00:02:12.940> bands<00:02:13.270> again<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:17.430> put

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
first pair of rubber bands again and put

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:28.539 
first pair of rubber bands again and put
two<00:02:18.760> more<00:02:19.210> red<00:02:19.690> rubber<00:02:20.170> bands

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.209 

now<00:02:29.549> we<00:02:29.609> take<00:02:30.090> another<00:02:30.689> pair<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.079> green<00:02:31.650> bands

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
now we take another pair of green bands

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.059 
now we take another pair of green bands
and<00:02:32.400> again<00:02:32.730> bring<00:02:33.329> them<00:02:33.540> through<00:02:33.989> all<00:02:34.260> four

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
and again bring them through all four

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:45.319 
and again bring them through all four
loops<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.829> we're<00:02:44.370> going<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.519> repeat<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.819> one

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
loops and we're going to repeat that one

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.979 
loops and we're going to repeat that one
more<00:02:45.719> time<00:02:46.489> going<00:02:47.489> back<00:02:47.790> into<00:02:48.389> that<00:02:48.510> first

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
more time going back into that first

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:58.550 
more time going back into that first
pair<00:02:49.409> of<00:02:49.439> bands<00:02:52.609> take<00:02:53.609> two<00:02:54.000> red<00:02:57.290> pull<00:02:58.290> those

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
pair of bands take two red pull those

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.159 
pair of bands take two red pull those
through<00:02:59.159> and<00:03:00.500> then<00:03:01.500> bring<00:03:02.010> another<00:03:02.840> pair<00:03:03.840> of

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
through and then bring another pair of

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:17.830 
through and then bring another pair of
green<00:03:04.680> bands<00:03:05.280> through<00:03:06.120> all<00:03:06.480> four<00:03:07.290> loops

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.559 

so<00:03:18.470> now<00:03:18.739> we<00:03:18.800> just<00:03:19.040> need<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.790> add<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.300> single

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
so now we just need to add a single

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.080 
so now we just need to add a single
rubber<00:03:20.930> band<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.770> hold<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:22.580> whole<00:03:22.790> shape

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
rubber band to hold the whole shape

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.190 
rubber band to hold the whole shape
together<00:03:26.739> so<00:03:27.739> one<00:03:28.040> green<00:03:28.489> band<00:03:29.140> pull<00:03:30.140> it

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
together so one green band pull it

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.120 
together so one green band pull it
through<00:03:30.620> those<00:03:31.010> two<00:03:31.040> green<00:03:31.700> loops<00:03:32.680> bring<00:03:33.680> both

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
through those two green loops bring both
