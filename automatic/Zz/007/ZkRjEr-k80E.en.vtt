the<00:00:18.600> gameplay<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.320> very<00:00:19.439> repetitive<00:00:19.949> the

the character animations are kind of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.349 
the character animations are kind of
stiff<00:00:24.539> they're<00:00:25.529> animated<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.099> 3d<00:00:26.550> some<00:00:27.150> people

Holy bubbled spell so never mind the
controls<00:00:43.260> are<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:44.280> weird<00:00:44.460> at<00:00:44.610> first<00:00:44.789> they

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
controls are a bit weird at first they

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.580

take<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.629> serious<00:00:46.020> getting<00:00:46.260> used<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
take some serious getting used to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.260 
take some serious getting used to
considering<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> game<00:00:47.670> where<00:00:47.820> you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
considering that it's a game where you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.779 
considering that it's a game where you
can<00:00:48.420> level<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.289> 15<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.280> less<00:00:50.460> than<00:00:50.640> an

can level up to about 15 in less than an
hour<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.510> sure<00:00:51.809> what<00:00:52.260> you'd<00:00:52.440> call<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
hour I'm not sure what you'd call it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.029 
hour I'm not sure what you'd call it
it's<00:00:53.730> not<00:00:54.030> hard<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:55.410> even<00:00:55.469> sure<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.920> it's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
it's not hard I'm not even sure if it's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.529 
it's not hard I'm not even sure if it's
fun<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.649> sort<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.789> also<00:01:00.180> makes<00:01:00.390> me

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
fun it just sort of is it also makes me

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180 
fun it just sort of is it also makes me
wonder<00:01:00.719> why<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:00.989> game<00:01:01.320> exists<00:01:01.829> other<00:01:01.980> than
