00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.870
 position number 8 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.340

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.740
 Silence move by Fernando MarÃ­as 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.970
 this book is one of those that I read without 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.950
 know nothing about him and he succeeded 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.479
 surprise me completely because the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.090
 true that left me with an open mouth 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.180
 when I was reading it has a mixture 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.550
 very clear between suspense or mystery 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.650
 ghosts but we do not raise normal 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.540
 that are scary but a cute species 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.010
 you could say in ghosts besides I 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.320
 love that I play a lot that 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.520
 illustrations this book that is so 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.660
 linked with what is the story 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.600
 then the truth that I enjoyed it 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.970

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.920
 in position number 6 I decided to put the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.820
 very much is told of the point of 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.070
 view of death and that makes it super 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.770
 original and surprising the truth is that 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.720
 when I was reading I could not stop 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.100

 explosion of the Chernobyl reactor and the 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.170
 truth is that it is something that we are not 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.030
