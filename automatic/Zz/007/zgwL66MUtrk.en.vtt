my other video where we've covered this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.590 
my other video where we've covered this
in<00:01:16.170> some<00:01:16.380> detail<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.970> notice<00:01:18.330> I've

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
in some detail and if you notice I've

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.289 
in some detail and if you notice I've
got<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.320> tenor<00:01:19.830> saxophone<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:20.939> might

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
got a tenor saxophone and they might

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.460 
got a tenor saxophone and they might
expanded<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.259> repair<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.250> don't<00:01:23.970> worry

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
expanded for repair but and don't worry

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.130 
expanded for repair but and don't worry
Aalto<00:01:25.470> interact<00:01:26.070> very<00:01:26.369> very<00:01:26.670> similar<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
Aalto interact very very similar and the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200 
Aalto interact very very similar and the
principles<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.950> explained<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.579> video<00:01:29.939> are

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
principles I explained in this video are

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.340 
principles I explained in this video are
the<00:01:30.240> same<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.960> both<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:33.140> keep<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.290> in

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the same for both so just keep that in

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.960 
the same for both so just keep that in
mind<00:01:34.470> when<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.070> explain<00:01:35.549> things<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
mind when I do explain things on the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.630 
mind when I do explain things on the
tenets<00:01:36.299> if<00:01:36.450> you've<00:01:36.659> got<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.229> us<00:01:37.350> home

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
tenets if you've got it all to us home
