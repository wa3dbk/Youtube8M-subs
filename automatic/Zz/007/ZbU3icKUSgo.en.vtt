circles<00:03:38.120> so<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.140> just<00:03:39.590> suggest<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.520> go<00:03:40.819> as

slow<00:03:41.360> as<00:03:41.569> you<00:03:41.630> possibly<00:03:42.170> can<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:42.800> you<00:03:42.860> can<00:03:42.950> take

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
slow as you possibly can so you can take

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.699 
slow as you possibly can so you can take
a<00:03:43.489> lot<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.790> time<00:03:43.910> as<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.540> want<00:03:44.569> to<00:03:45.230> go<00:03:45.440> through

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709
