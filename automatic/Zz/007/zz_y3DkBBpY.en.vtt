so<00:00:00.659> now<00:00:00.780> we<00:00:00.840> have<00:00:00.989> our<00:00:01.140> important<00:00:01.709> roots<00:00:01.949> r1<00:00:02.250> r2

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
so now we have our important roots r1 r2

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.190 
so now we have our important roots r1 r2
are<00:00:03.929> 57<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:04.950> our<00:00:05.130> six<00:00:05.460> minor<00:00:05.930> so<00:00:06.930> now<00:00:07.049> we're

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
are 57 and our six minor so now we're

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.320 
are 57 and our six minor so now we're
going<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.350> go<00:00:07.440> through<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:08.069> walk<00:00:08.309> what's<00:00:08.820> a

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
going to go through and walk what's a

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.799 
going to go through and walk what's a
very<00:00:09.809> common<00:00:10.320> jazz<00:00:10.650> chord<00:00:11.010> change<00:00:11.280> which<00:00:11.490> is

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
very common jazz chord change which is

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.749 
very common jazz chord change which is
1625<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.500> that's<00:00:13.889> just<00:00:14.070> simply<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
1625 and that's just simply the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.189 
1625 and that's just simply the
intervals<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> scale<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.960> we're<00:00:16.080> going

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
intervals of the scale and we're going

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.960 
intervals of the scale and we're going
to<00:00:16.260> go<00:00:16.500> through<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.010> walk<00:00:17.190> through<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.789> make

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
to go through and walk through and make

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.630 
to go through and walk through and make
an<00:00:18.840> ounce<00:00:19.020> when<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> use<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.529> new<00:00:19.830> route<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
an ounce when I use the new route and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.070 
an ounce when I use the new route and
we'll<00:00:20.789> go<00:00:20.939> through<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.359> play<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.930> we're

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
we'll go through and play that so we're

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.359 
we'll go through and play that so we're
going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.619> flat<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:24.390> F<00:00:24.539> minor<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:26.160> B

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
going to have a flat to F minor to B

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.429 
going to have a flat to F minor to B
flat<00:00:26.609> minor<00:00:26.849> E<00:00:27.180> flat<00:00:27.300> seven<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.170> I'm<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
flat minor E flat seven so I'm going to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:44.119 
flat minor E flat seven so I'm going to
one<00:00:29.869> six<00:00:30.869> two<00:00:33.620> five<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:35.960> two<00:00:39.320> five<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:43.129> six

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.270 
one six two five one two five one six
six<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:48.300> i'm<00:00:49.200> still<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.710> same<00:00:50.010> pattern<00:00:50.600> 1

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
2 5 11 down to six two five one six two
five<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.010> also<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.700> call

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
five and you can also do what we call

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.899 
five and you can also do what we call
sidestepping<00:01:12.570> where<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.080> take<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.430> route

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
sidestepping where I take the route

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.789 
sidestepping where I take the route
we're<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.840> sidestep<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.680> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
we're going to and I sidestep to it so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
we're going to and I sidestep to it so
go<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.280> into<00:01:18.180> 6<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:19.500> 2<00:01:19.890> into<00:01:20.189> 5<00:01:21.380> 1<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> you're

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
go one into 6 into 2 into 5 1 so you're

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
go one into 6 into 2 into 5 1 so you're
just<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.020> using<00:01:31.710> these<00:01:31.799> chromatic<00:01:32.310> notes

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
just really using these chromatic notes

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
just really using these chromatic notes
to<00:01:32.790> slide<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.750> root<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
to slide into the root you're going to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
to slide into the root you're going to
and<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> always<00:01:35.189> start<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> downbeat<00:01:36.180> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and you always start on the downbeat so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:51.679 
and you always start on the downbeat so
into<00:01:41.360> 1625<00:01:44.119> 12<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:47.180> 6251<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:50.299> you<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.479> all

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
into 1625 12 or 6251 and you have all

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.270 
into 1625 12 or 6251 and you have all
those<00:01:51.810> roots<00:01:52.110> right<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.950> straight

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
those roots right here going straight

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.510 
those roots right here going straight
down<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.670> fret<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.299> go<00:01:56.030> 1625<00:01:59.149> 1625

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
down this fret so you can go 1625 1625

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.420 
down this fret so you can go 1625 1625
so<00:02:02.520> those<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:02.790> your<00:02:03.409> 1625<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.860> go<00:02:05.159> through<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
so those are your 1625 so go through and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.550 
so those are your 1625 so go through and
start<00:02:05.850> walking<00:02:06.000> around<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.540> scale<00:02:06.840> getting

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
start walking around that scale getting

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.179 
start walking around that scale getting
that<00:02:07.680> jazz<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.340> onto<00:02:08.729> your<00:02:08.819> fingers
