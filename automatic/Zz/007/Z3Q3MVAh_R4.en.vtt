00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
together you'll see it just creates the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.500 
together you'll see it just creates the
most<00:02:28.019> amazing<00:02:28.650> thick<00:02:29.250> creamy<00:02:29.700> sauce<00:02:30.030> and

because<00:02:31.290> there's<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.769> much<00:02:31.980> flavor<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.489> that

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
because there's so much flavor in that

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.550

Philadelphia<00:02:33.209> cooking<00:02:33.510> cream<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:34.260> don't<00:02:34.440> have

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
Philadelphia cooking cream we don't have

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.410 
Philadelphia cooking cream we don't have
to<00:02:34.680> add<00:02:34.830> any<00:02:35.069> milk<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.550> anything<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.180> that's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
to add any milk or anything to it that's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.089 
to add any milk or anything to it that's
why<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:37.110> can<00:02:37.260> just<00:02:37.410> use<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> little<00:02:37.650> bit<00:02:37.980> of

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
why you can just use a little bit of

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.620 
why you can just use a little bit of
this<00:02:38.190> cooking<00:02:38.489> water<00:02:38.790> instead<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.269> having<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
this cooking water instead of having to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.390 
this cooking water instead of having to
use<00:02:39.690> another<00:02:40.019> ingredient<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.280> go

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
use another ingredient so there you go

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.910
