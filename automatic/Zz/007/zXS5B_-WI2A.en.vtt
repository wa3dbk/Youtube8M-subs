00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
blood arginine now because arginine is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
raise blood arginine is high so you

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.629 
raise blood arginine is high so you
could<00:01:40.530> stack<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.069> combine<00:01:41.429> it<00:01:41.609> with

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.709 
citrulline which gets into the button
and<00:01:44.009> raised<00:01:44.219> blood<00:01:44.459> arginine<00:01:44.880> much<00:01:45.420> higher

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.440 
and raised blood arginine much higher
almost<00:01:46.289> twice<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.740> high<00:01:46.889> as<00:01:47.159> arjuna<00:01:48.119> itself

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
and then you can even go one step

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.770 
and then you can even go one step
further<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.639> add<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.999> glutamine<00:01:51.509> which

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
further and add in glutamine which

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.050 
further and add in glutamine which
actually<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.679> be<00:01:52.740> used<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.100> convert<00:01:53.399> into

actually can be used to convert into
citrulline<00:01:54.959> and<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.709> get<00:01:55.859> a<00:01:55.889> a<00:01:56.069> three<00:01:56.520> pronged

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
