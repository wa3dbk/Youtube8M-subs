00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.990
 good hello to all guys and welcome back 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.550
 in this new video I am Carlo Fortino 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.040
 of the staff of the last magic italian team 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.400
 and today we are here that player review of 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.250
 sneijder sif 86 on paper for him with 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.369
 77 of speed 87 of shooting 90 of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.079
 pass 87 free as many as 53 defense and 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.989
 68 of physical then the card in the form of 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.030
 sneijder was not the card on the left 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.090
 informed ceci then returns to be 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.200
 chickpeas and I'm glad of that because 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.720
 the iv version while costing around 70 80 k 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.760
 and I didn't like it from the left 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.340
 but not even data s 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.860
 while this version is definitely the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.320
 better than sneijder and and I liked it 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.120
 a lot indeed a lot indeed then 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.070
 you will see the pros and cons and above all 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.320
 of the final grade 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.720
 let's start talking about the speed 77 of 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.780
 general acceleration value 78 which 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.000
 it's a pro and 77 speed shot these 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.280
 two values ​​precisely as a number yes 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.370
 they look like speed but click 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.220
 so maybe when it has to start 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.130
 galloping car 10 20 30 meters 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.830
 I didn't like it while accelerating 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.380
 then the first two three four meters 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 in fact he manages to speak very fluently 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.360
 also very agile with 85 of agility 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.159
 so I have to say that the acceleration me 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.930
 liked it while the waste rate didn't 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.330
 I put it in against but let's say that 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.510
 made me turn up my nose a little 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.760
 dribbling 87 with three-star skill and with 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.100
 I didn't put the three star skills to 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.530
 against but I'm not a pro so I am 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.810
 a middle ground because the dribbling 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.820
 dreaming let's say simple one 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.640
 ball control 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.710
 right left is very good indeed 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.340
 we have 90 ball control 80 i 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.920
 reflections therefore a good value for 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.990
 guaranteeing a fast movement 85 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.709
 of equilibrium agility 88 therefore 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.200
 perhaps despite having low physical strength 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.390
 of 66 the balance still succeeds a 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.129
 let it stay upright maybe the first one 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.900
 the second shoulder 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.060
 then he will discharge the ball because 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.409
 obviously not being too fast not 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.800
 will always manage to get away into 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.690
 speed the defenders 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.270
 which in any case are not always very many 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.390
 they are not always very fast but he is not 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.990
 had to do the galloping 10 20 30 40 50 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.820
 meters since he at warcraft medium 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.680
 medium so it will always stay there on 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.150
 trocar and precisely the role of 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.800
 playmaker 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.340
 I strongly advise you of e 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.010
 use it trequartista then throws then 5 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.930
 weak foot stars for him this does it 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.730
 look a lot like casolla though me 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.790
 liked more than cazorla because the shots 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.470
 they are much better than the cazorla ones 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.930
 the value that stands out the most and that is the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.350
 best shot is the 91 shot from 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.290
 distance then we also have a shooting 91 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.230
 a fantastic lap the sneijder shots me 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.630
 they all liked the shooting power 94 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.020
 then the power longs either from or around 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.600
 they are alike then we always fall 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.700
 82 of placement so he will always succeed 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.610
 to stay there where you have to be doing the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.320
 fulcrum of the finalization game 83 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.630
 which sometimes sinned me then 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.800
 the meeting omitted sometimes not always 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.690
 I repeat the 5-star pid is weak and omitted 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.020
 in the pros because they are fantastic 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.970
 the steps then the passages do not know 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.950
 because but I haven't tried so many 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.300
 But, and here I tried a few are really 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.810
 fantastic with 93 division with 86 of 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.630
 cross 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.860
 so even if he should expand 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.239
 he will always manage to put it in the middle 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.450
 excellently both of right and of 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.580
 left 92 precision punishments not 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.680
 I seem to have beaten but unfortunately 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.690
 I think they are very good at hand 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.200
 you too if you have tried just the 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.850
 conditions of sneijder 90 of passages 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.660
 courts goes by the short passages are a 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.640
 point value than in all players 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.860
 in the end it is good because the transition 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.050
 short who doesn't know how to do it well there are 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.109
 short passages and short passages then 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.330
 we must also classify this 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.750
 long passages 92 in fact adidas that 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.630
 of left it makes the good passages 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.370
 really this player is very complete 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.280
 if it were not for the physicist who is a 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.620
 against because we have a value that 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.409
 stands out that it has only 77 of stamina 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.999
 that anyway 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:36.800
 lets him maybe not arrive 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:39.050
 distorted at the end of the game and maybe 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.869
 keep running and doing your best 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.189
 even maybe the ninetieth 

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:45.110
 at eighty-five then the is fine 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:48.080
 physical value not strange here too 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.669
 to say why the blow has a strength of 66 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.059
 of head we don't even talk about it given 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.879
 which is a player 70 m high anyway i 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:57.889
 top is long shot acceleration 5 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.469
 weak foot stars absolutely a pro 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.139
 absolute that made him a player 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:07.069
 in my opinion the best playmaker of 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.899
 this game passes the throws the 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.719
 simple dreaming not with skills 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:13.969
 because it is really very fluid with the 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.949
 90 ball control I really liked 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.949
 much 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.269
 while the cons are sometimes sins 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.309
 in the finalization 

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:24.289
 the maximum speed that just isn't a 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:26.899
 against so relevant is the physical 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.909
 surely then I also mentioned the 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:31.550
 three star skills that in the end not only 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.709
 a counter like the maximum speed too 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.110
 if I inserted it in the cons but I am 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:38.149
 let's say a middle way they make 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.599
 this player not from ten but from 8 

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:40.610
 to 9 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.779
 then the void I give him precisely from 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.279
 8 to 9 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.289
 so guys, I hope this review 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.329
 you enjoyed tell me what you 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:51.219
 think of sneijder seaf and us there 

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:51.219
 we hear in a next video bye bye
