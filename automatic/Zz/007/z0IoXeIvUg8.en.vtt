it it's a very great time-waster but in
this<00:00:16.619> one<00:00:16.800> we're<00:00:17.039> gonna<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> video<00:00:17.670> on

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
this one we're gonna do a video on

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.570 
this one we're gonna do a video on
arcade<00:00:19.770> mode<00:00:21.830> basically<00:00:22.830> when<00:00:23.460> you're

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
arcade mode basically when you're

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.880 
arcade mode basically when you're
playing<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.000> game<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.210> you're<00:00:25.199> motion<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
playing the game you you're motion the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.710 
playing the game you you're motion the
accelerometer<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.699> how<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.210> move<00:00:27.449> your<00:00:27.480> bat

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
accelerometer is how you move your bat

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.259 
accelerometer is how you move your bat
around<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.580> tap<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> screen<00:00:30.000> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
around and you just tap the screen to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.970 
around and you just tap the screen to
swing<00:00:31.369> object<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.489> arcade<00:00:32.850> mode<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.890> get<00:00:34.890> as

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
swing object of arcade mode is to get as

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.799 
swing object of arcade mode is to get as
many<00:00:35.100> home<00:00:35.370> runs<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:37.370> 10<00:00:38.370> outs

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
many home runs as you can with 10 outs

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.549 
many home runs as you can with 10 outs
once<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.290> hit<00:00:40.410> ten<00:00:40.680> outs<00:00:40.879> game<00:00:41.879> over

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
once you hit ten outs game over

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.729 
once you hit ten outs game over
so<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:43.739> we'll<00:00:43.920> run<00:00:44.100> through<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:45.469> short<00:00:46.469> piece

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
so here we'll run through a short piece

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:57.229 
so here we'll run through a short piece
of<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:55.160> get<00:00:56.160> points<00:00:56.550> based<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.879> different

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
of it you get points based on different

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.049 
of it you get points based on different
things<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> monster<00:00:58.770> shot

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
things one of them is the monster shot

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.720 
things one of them is the monster shot
monster<00:01:00.059> shot<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.690> hitting<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.620> over<00:01:01.920> 500<00:01:02.609> feet

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
monster shot is hitting it over 500 feet

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.310 
monster shot is hitting it over 500 feet
I<00:01:02.789> believe<00:01:05.869> crashes<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.500> worth<00:01:07.680> 300<00:01:08.189> points

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
I believe crashes are worth 300 points

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.929 
I believe crashes are worth 300 points
if<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> hit<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> these<00:01:10.979> polls<00:01:11.340> that's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
if you hit one of these polls that's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.149 
if you hit one of these polls that's
worth<00:01:12.210> 300<00:01:12.689> points<00:01:14.900> cycling

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
worth 300 points cycling

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.590 
worth 300 points cycling
you'll<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.490> top<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> board

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you'll see up top here on the board

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.520 
you'll see up top here on the board
there's<00:01:19.470> three<00:01:20.310> things<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:22.259> hit

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
there's three things here if you hit

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
there's three things here if you hit
each<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.860> those<00:01:23.130> three<00:01:23.490> sections<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.720> into

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
each of those three sections you go into

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.760 
each of those three sections you go into
cycling<00:01:25.409> mode<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:27.020> what<00:01:28.020> cycling<00:01:28.470> mode<00:01:28.650> will

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
cycling mode and what cycling mode will

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.710 
cycling mode and what cycling mode will
do<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:30.049> tell<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.259> which<00:01:31.500> section<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.189> hit

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
do is tell you which section to hit

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.840
