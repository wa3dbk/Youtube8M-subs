00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.469
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.529
 show how to restore your iphone 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.380
 ipad or ipod with the software to be mirrored 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.680
 store that came out last night it's 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.680
 left 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.410
 at first you must have 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.119
 downloaded the file that is in 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.739
 the description for either windows or 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.689
 for mac 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:34.780
 then you unzip the file on 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:39.730
 your computer and you open up to yourself 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.489
 store then you accept and you 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.339
 plug your iphone into your work 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:49.179
 your computer then you click 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:51.579
 on semi restores and there it is possible that 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.550
 you have an error that will display 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.019
 that is to say, that the blind has ceased 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.239
 to operate does not respond and that's 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.829
 in these cases no panic makes you 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.460
 cancel a right click on semi restores 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.930
 then you go to the properties 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.060
 in the compatibility tab you 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.399
 select the windows service pack 2 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.610
 then you apply you do 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.710
 ok and you raise and then it will work 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.820
 and you also do not forget to run 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.100
 as a preference administrator 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.170
 so your iphone ipod or ipad and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.409
 plug in you click on semi restore 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.549
 and then the software will do the 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.680
 necessary ie it will 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.469
 restore your device so there it 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.469
 will have to wait a few minutes 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.730
 So here the software has thus completed 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.620
 obviously I passed for it to be 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.470
 faster 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.660
 so that's it restores and then a 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.910
 Once the restoration has been done 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.730
 via the software you will see that your 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.770
 device is completely restored but 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.060
 that so far there will always be cydia 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.880
 who will be present so you will have 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.680
 keep the jailbreak 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.410
 this was a tutorial for 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.450
 iphonesoft tv we end up in a 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.590
 next video do not hesitate to the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.590
