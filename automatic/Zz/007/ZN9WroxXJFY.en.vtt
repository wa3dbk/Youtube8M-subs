00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
multi-sensory and this is how we pick

multi-sensory and this is how we pick
our<00:01:39.210> peaches<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:40.350> let<00:01:40.590> them<00:01:40.800> stay<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.640> tree

our peaches we let them stay on the tree

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.210 
our peaches we let them stay on the tree
as<00:01:42.270> long<00:01:42.660> as<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.230> physically<00:01:43.680> possible

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
as long as it's physically possible

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.790 
as long as it's physically possible
that's<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.580> tree<00:01:44.880> ripened<00:01:45.330> peach<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.900> peach<00:01:46.560> will

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
that's a tree ripened peach a peach will

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.160 
that's a tree ripened peach a peach will
not<00:01:46.950> ripen<00:01:47.190> off<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.880> tree<00:01:48.120> so<00:01:48.600> once<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.020> off

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
not ripen off the tree so once it's off

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.990 
not ripen off the tree so once it's off
the<00:01:49.350> tree<00:01:49.620> it<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.040> soften<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.730> it<00:01:50.820> won't

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the tree it will soften but it won't

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.420 
the tree it will soften but it won't
actually<00:01:51.180> ripen<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.840> become<00:01:52.110> sweeter<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.220> our

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
actually ripen and become sweeter so our

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.550 
actually ripen and become sweeter so our
goal<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.850> leave<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> fruit<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.750> till<00:01:55.290> as

goal is to leave the fruit on till as

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.950 
goal is to leave the fruit on till as
