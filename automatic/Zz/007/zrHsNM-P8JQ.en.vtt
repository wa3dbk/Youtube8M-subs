around<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.570> it'd<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.780> nice<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:01.229> was

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
around in here it'd be nice if there was

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.039 
around in here it'd be nice if there was
a<00:02:01.350> way<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> kind<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.860> compress<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.850> down<00:02:03.049> make

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
a way to kind of compress that down make

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.789 
a way to kind of compress that down make
it<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.350> more<00:02:04.700> sturdy<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.880> guess<00:02:06.799> insecure

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
it a little more sturdy I guess insecure

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.400 
it a little more sturdy I guess insecure
so<00:02:08.220> there's<00:02:08.940> also<00:02:09.090> another<00:02:09.450> magazine<00:02:10.080> or<00:02:10.379> a

both<00:02:41.960> been<00:02:42.020> in<00:02:42.290> they're<00:02:42.470> actually<00:02:43.160> very<00:02:43.340> well

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
both been in they're actually very well

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.130 
both been in they're actually very well
it's<00:02:43.910> almost<00:02:44.120> like<00:02:44.330> it's<00:02:44.480> custom-made<00:02:44.870> for

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
it's almost like it's custom-made for

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.920 
it's almost like it's custom-made for
that<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.590> then<00:02:46.510> right<00:02:47.510> here<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.720> can<00:02:47.900> see

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
that and then right here you can see

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.590 
that and then right here you can see
this<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.380> where<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.620> camera<00:02:48.950> sits<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:50.420> is

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
this is where the camera sits so this is

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.390 
this is where the camera sits so this is
really<00:02:50.750> what<00:02:50.930> makes<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.260> bag<00:02:51.500> different

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
really what makes this bag different

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.000 
really what makes this bag different
than<00:02:52.940> other<00:02:53.090> bags<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.440> there's<00:02:54.680> there's<00:02:54.950> a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
than other bags so there's there's a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.250 
than other bags so there's there's a
side<00:02:55.690> access<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:58.400> camera<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.870> that's

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
side access to the camera and that's

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.900 
side access to the camera and that's
that's<00:03:00.530> as<00:03:00.740> big<00:03:00.890> as<00:03:00.980> it'll<00:03:01.130> go<00:03:01.160> right<00:03:01.430> there<00:03:01.670> so

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
that's as big as it'll go right there so

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.660 
that's as big as it'll go right there so
it's<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:02.990> a<00:03:03.080> good<00:03:03.260> size<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:04.190> takes<00:03:04.340> up<00:03:04.520> about

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
it's it's a good size it takes up about

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.770 
it's it's a good size it takes up about
half<00:03:04.850> of<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.780> main<00:03:06.440> storage<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.250> bag<00:03:07.780> but

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
half of the main storage of the bag but

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.810 
half of the main storage of the bag but
you<00:03:09.650> could<00:03:09.770> still<00:03:10.040> fit<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> decent<00:03:10.640> sized

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
you could still fit a decent sized

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.310 
you could still fit a decent sized
camera<00:03:11.210> in<00:03:11.270> there<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:11.660> I'll<00:03:11.900> show<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.110> what<00:03:12.290> I

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320

camera in there so I'll show you what I
have<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.590> here<00:03:12.620> right<00:03:12.860> now<00:03:13.360> so<00:03:14.360> that's<00:03:14.480> what<00:03:14.660> it

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720

have a couple complaints though one is
the<00:05:03.490> handle<00:05:03.909> is<00:05:04.120> kind<00:05:04.659> of<00:05:04.690> in<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:04.870> bad<00:05:04.990> spot<00:05:05.349> if

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
the handle is kind of in a bad spot if

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.010 
the handle is kind of in a bad spot if
you<00:05:05.889> lift<00:05:06.130> it<00:05:06.250> up<00:05:06.370> it's<00:05:06.729> it's<00:05:07.300> kind<00:05:07.990> of

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
you lift it up it's it's kind of

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.370 
you lift it up it's it's kind of
off-center<00:05:08.699> it<00:05:09.699> wants<00:05:10.419> to<00:05:10.539> kind<00:05:10.720> of<00:05:10.810> flop<00:05:11.169> open

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
off-center it wants to kind of flop open

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.120 
off-center it wants to kind of flop open
so<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.669> that's<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.750> little<00:05:13.960> I<00:05:14.349> guess

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
so that that's a little I guess

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.249 
so that that's a little I guess
disappointing<00:05:15.940> but<00:05:16.120> it's<00:05:16.599> not<00:05:16.780> it's<00:05:17.050> not<00:05:17.110> the

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
disappointing but it's not it's not the

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.980 
disappointing but it's not it's not the
end<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.710> world<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:19.060> also<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:20.280> strap<00:05:21.280> is

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
end of the world and also the strap is

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.510 
end of the world and also the strap is
it's<00:05:22.990> it's<00:05:23.289> nice<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.680> wide<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.129> that's<00:05:24.250> great

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
it's it's nice and wide and that's great

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.700 
it's it's nice and wide and that's great
but<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:25.690> can<00:05:25.840> hold<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.110> lot<00:05:26.259> of<00:05:26.289> stuff<00:05:26.500> in<00:05:26.620> this

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
but you can hold a lot of stuff in this

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.089 
but you can hold a lot of stuff in this
bag<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.219> it<00:05:28.030> gets<00:05:28.360> heavy<00:05:28.900> quickly<00:05:29.469> and<00:05:29.710> it

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
bag and it gets heavy quickly and it

balance<00:06:56.080> between<00:06:56.410> cost<00:06:57.340> and<00:06:57.580> and<00:06:58.180> overall

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
balance between cost and and overall

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.230 
balance between cost and and overall
