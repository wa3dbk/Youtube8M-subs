00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.883
I lost because I have bad stomach

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:20.104
I lost because I could not sleep well

00:00:20.104 --> 00:00:24.940
I lost because my girlfriend was sick last night, I worried about her

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.679
that's why I lost

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.219
so many excuses

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.466
in Korea we say

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:35.318
go to sanitary and ask them whey are they dead

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:38.264
every single of them have reasons

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:43.823
if I were you, you lost

00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:46.424
I will only say two words

00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:48.591
when I lost

00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.113
number 1 - I lost

00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:57.182
number 2 - you are better, shake hand end of the story

00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.615
the meaning of I lost means

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:06.121
I am accepting my opponent is better

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:11.360
he has something more than I have thats why I lost

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.635
there fore I am going to train harder

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:20.358
and then I will prepare my self to be the winner in next match

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:23.448
that's the meaning of saying I lost

00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:26.507
because I lost, no other excuses

00:01:26.507 --> 00:01:30.899
lets say he had bad stomach last night

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.337
he his girl friend was sick last night

00:01:34.337 --> 00:01:36.203
its true

00:01:36.203 --> 00:01:38.628
yes, because I did not eat well

00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:40.285
I was low in energy

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:43.036
so in a certain game last 5 points I lost

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.363
that is true

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.058
but I would not say

00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:50.349
even that is true

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:51.286
because

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:54.531
because I lost what ever I say

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.407
that's only excuses, even that is true

00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:01.952
I will not say because of my pride

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:04.513
but there are so many players

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:11.008
pride is so small and say such things

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:15.846
without anything shame of them

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:17.837
when you lose

00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:20.273
say nothing

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:28.720
when you lose don't show your disappointment in front of every one

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.254
just upset

00:02:31.254 --> 00:02:35.743
you might cry in your room, when there is no one

00:02:35.743 --> 00:02:37.891
even your parents don't see you

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.623
you cry because you are so frustrated

00:02:40.623 --> 00:02:45.077
you are so upset, you can cry in your room

00:02:45.785 --> 00:02:48.711
not in front of other people

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:53.902
because you have pride, your pride is too big to behave that way
