00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
the first knot I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.500 
the first knot I'm going to demonstrate
today<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.630> simple<00:00:34.230> overhand<00:00:34.710> knot<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
today is a simple overhand knot and that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.110 
today is a simple overhand knot and that
is<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.020> kind<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.040> most<00:00:38.340> commonly<00:00:38.910> used

is the kind of most commonly used
pretzel<00:00:39.870> II<00:00:39.960> looking<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:41.160> ends<00:00:41.460> up

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
pretzel II looking not it ends up

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.760 
pretzel II looking not it ends up
looking<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.030> next<00:00:45.390> knot<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.500> I'm

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
looking like this the next knot that I'm

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.760 
looking like this the next knot that I'm
going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.780> called<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> surgeon's<00:00:49.530> knot

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
going to do is called the surgeon's knot

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.240 
going to do is called the surgeon's knot
and<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.059> an<00:00:51.239> overhand<00:00:51.780> knot<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:53.129> we're

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and it is like an overhand knot so we're

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100 
and it is like an overhand knot so we're
going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.820> again<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
going to do that again and that is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.170 
going to do that again and that is
typically<00:00:55.680> used<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.399> know<00:00:56.520> at<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> end<00:00:56.820> of

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
typically used you know at the end of

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.139 
typically used you know at the end of
your<00:00:57.329> thread<00:00:57.530> but<00:00:58.530> instead<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> coming<00:00:59.910> all

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
your thread but instead of coming all

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.150 
your thread but instead of coming all
the<00:01:00.300> way<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.449> what<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.890> go

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the way down what I'm going to do is go

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.649 
the way down what I'm going to do is go
through<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.149> loop<00:01:03.359> again<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.890> and

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
through the loop again like this and

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.240 
through the loop again like this and
then<00:01:06.659> I'm<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> move<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:07.710> knot<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
then I'm going to move my knot to the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.539 
then I'm going to move my knot to the
end<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> thread<00:01:09.380> like<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.070> finish<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
end of the thread like this to finish it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.320 
end of the thread like this to finish it
off<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.420> that's<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.780> surgeon's<00:01:13.200> knot<00:01:14.150> now<00:01:15.150> I'm

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
off so that's a surgeon's knot now I'm

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.450 
off so that's a surgeon's knot now I'm
going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> show<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.110> larks<00:01:16.680> head<00:01:16.799> knot<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
going to show you a larks head knot and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.300 
going to show you a larks head knot and
a<00:01:18.030> larks<00:01:18.299> head<00:01:18.390> knot<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.990> typically<00:01:19.590> used<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
a larks head knot is typically used to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.870 
a larks head knot is typically used to
capture<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.880> doughnut<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.850> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
capture a doughnut like this so what you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.170 
capture a doughnut like this so what you
want<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.229> thread<00:01:25.909> like<00:01:26.909> this

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
want to do is take your thread like this

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.410 
want to do is take your thread like this
in<00:01:27.479> half<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.700> we're<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> take<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
in half and we're going to take the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.810 
in half and we're going to take the
middle<00:01:30.720> point<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.259> thread<00:01:31.680> pick<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
middle point of the thread pick up a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.100 
middle point of the thread pick up a
doughnut<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.869> through<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> middle<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
doughnut and go through the middle of it

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.240 
doughnut and go through the middle of it
we're<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> bring<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> other

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
we're going to bring it on to the other

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.100 
we're going to bring it on to the other

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
keep one cord stationary and then we're

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.069 
keep one cord stationary and then we're
going<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.009> use<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.670> other<00:02:05.790> side<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> cord

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
going to use the other side of the cord

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.460 
going to use the other side of the cord
to<00:02:07.680> go<00:02:07.860> around<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.670> we're<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:10.200> an

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
to go around it and we're going to do an

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.000 
to go around it and we're going to do an
overhand<00:02:11.099> knot<00:02:11.310> like

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
overhand knot like

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.369 
overhand knot like
is<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.760> overhand<00:02:13.239> knot<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.019> close
