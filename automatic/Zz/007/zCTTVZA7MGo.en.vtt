v8<00:01:52.730> single<00:01:53.730> problem<00:01:54.060> out<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.300> it

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.300 

Gork

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.309 

this<00:02:00.310> particular<00:02:00.609> one<00:02:01.359> is<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.600> z71

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
this particular one is the z71

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.130 
this particular one is the z71
so<00:02:03.189> this<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.399> an<00:02:03.490> LT<00:02:04.119> model<00:02:04.450> but<00:02:04.569> it's<00:02:04.689> optioned
