 sleeping in a very early hours 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:27.040
 when suddenly he received a call 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:31.000

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.990

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.450

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.939
 I did not know who it was 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.990
 night a few seconds started to 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:13.000
 cry uncontrollably 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.920
 He was out of the office for months and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.050
 weeks and days 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.140
 his colleagues in the office did not know 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.740
 what was wrong 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.290
 a day at the office suddenly arrived 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.810
 night all of the office were 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.319
 impressed by how he looked he wore a 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.900
 black suit a black hat was not 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.120

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.450
 bathed 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.440
 he just came and sat on his computer 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.920
 I shout you all out please 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.959
 and night he was alone 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.860
 none of his colleagues in the office 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.830
 he knew what he did that day on his computer 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.720
 all they know is that he put something in there 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.239
 in something inexplicable unimaginable 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.980
 they did not know what it was but they knew that something 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.870
 I had the game 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.099
 a few months after having 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.980
 removed the most updated version of the 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.640
 Minecraft game began to receive 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.490
 countless emails claiming about 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.820
 of a strange player inside the game 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.310
 they did not know what they meant when 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.080
 suddenly they sent them an email that 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.080
 said hello 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.989
 They do not know who I am but I do know who 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.989

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.569

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.689

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.030
 and you will have chills when 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.990
 hear 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.900
 they did not know whose mail it was 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:58.340
 since the recipient and who had it 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.230
 sent were in a blood red color 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.319
 a few seconds later another 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.960
 mail came a user of the game that 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.590
 I was saying 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.750
 hello excuse the inconvenience but it's all 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.270
 recently playing minecraft and I 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.640
 I found this strange player 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.250
 He has killed me countless times and I do not know 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.299
 what to do if it is a bug please 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:25.430
 fix what 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:29.710
 in the mail there was a file 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:32.360
 that contained a photo that photo 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.979
 a screenshot of minecraft 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.939
 you could see that the player was in a 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.390
 forest with the viewing distance to 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.210
 minimum 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.940
 they tried to find what was strange 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.550
 the photo but they found nothing 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.730
 a few days later they went back to examine the 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.280
 photo and they realized that in the part 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.830
 from behind a tree there was a strange 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.590
 figure 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.550
 because if another player had 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.210
 exactly the same skin green shirt 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.860
 blue pants 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.910
 face of a fleshy color brown hair 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.310
 but there was something strange in that photo 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.850
 the blue eyes that you should usually 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.160
 have a minecraft user without a skin 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:23.180
 they were completely white 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.090
 they impacted remembered that day in 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.600
 that we arrived at the office without saying 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.670
 nothing 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.580
 they were quickly the apartment of 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.570
 night to see what it was that had him 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:40.010
 done to the game when they came night not 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.010
 I remembered nothing
