closer to the heat get to choose how you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.450 
closer to the heat get to choose how you
spawn<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:43.710> responsibility

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

that<00:03:12.210> that<00:03:12.300> area<00:03:12.690> has<00:03:12.900> been<00:03:13.080> cleared<00:03:13.350> here<00:03:13.950> if

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
that that area has been cleared here if

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.780 
that that area has been cleared here if
you<00:03:14.280> kill<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.520> guy

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
