00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
best going out there but it definitely

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
best going out there but it definitely

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
that makes it so good is really the low

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.630 
that makes it so good is really the low
amount<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> recoil<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.220> thing<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.490> pretty

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
amount of recoil this thing is pretty
much<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> laser<00:00:30.179> which<00:00:30.810> makes<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.289> fun

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
with practice and right here look at

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.230 
with practice and right here look at
this<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.800> catch<00:03:57.310> them<00:03:57.460> all<00:03:57.580> spawning<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.120> see

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
this I catch them all spawning and see

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.700 
this I catch them all spawning and see
this<00:03:58.360> is<00:03:58.510> where<00:03:58.690> flanking<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.260> Russian<00:03:59.530> comes

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
this is where flanking and Russian comes

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.440 
this is where flanking and Russian comes
in<00:03:59.860> the<00:03:59.920> key<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.310> catch<00:04:00.730> like<00:04:00.970> five<00:04:01.210> of<00:04:01.240> them

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
in the key I catch like five of them

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.080 
in the key I catch like five of them
spawning<00:04:01.870> pick<00:04:02.230> them<00:04:02.350> all<00:04:02.500> off<00:04:02.910> that's<00:04:03.910> where

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
spawning pick them all off that's where

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.040 
spawning pick them all off that's where
it<00:04:04.180> really<00:04:04.210> does<00:04:04.540> all<00:04:04.690> come<00:04:04.870> down

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
it really does all come down

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.930 
it really does all come down
unfortunately<00:04:06.040> in<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.250> game<00:04:06.490> of<00:04:06.730> course

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
unfortunately in this game of course

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.190 
unfortunately in this game of course
there's<00:04:07.180> triple<00:04:07.420> cappers<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.050> there's

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
there's triple cappers and there's

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.720 
there's triple cappers and there's
there's<00:04:08.740> always<00:04:09.040> going<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.220> be<00:04:09.310> those<00:04:09.460> triple

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
there's always going to be those triple

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.340 
there's always going to be those triple
cappers<00:04:10.180> I<00:04:10.270> kind<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.540> wish<00:04:10.720> there<00:04:10.930> was<00:04:11.050> like<00:04:11.080> I

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
cappers I kind of wish there was like I

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.500 
cappers I kind of wish there was like I
max<00:04:11.650> amount<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.580> times<00:04:12.790> in<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.030> game<00:04:13.210> you<00:04:13.360> can

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
max amount of times in the game you can

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.229 
max amount of times in the game you can
cap<00:04:14.020> three<00:04:14.380> flags<00:04:14.650> or<00:04:14.890> something<00:04:15.250> because<00:04:15.760> it

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
cap three flags or something because it

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.240 
cap three flags or something because it
really<00:04:16.780> does<00:04:16.989> get<00:04:17.140> annoying<00:04:17.260> honestly<00:04:18.190> you

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
really does get annoying honestly you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.890 
really does get annoying honestly you
guys<00:04:18.370> probably<00:04:18.609> hear<00:04:18.790> this<00:04:18.910> a<00:04:18.970> lot<00:04:19.090> but<00:04:19.780> it

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
guys probably hear this a lot but it

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.270 
guys probably hear this a lot but it
really<00:04:20.049> doesn't<00:04:20.260> get<00:04:20.380> annoying<00:04:20.650> when<00:04:20.890> people

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
really doesn't get annoying when people

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.670 
really doesn't get annoying when people
kind<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:21.940> just<00:04:22.330> triple<00:04:22.810> cap<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.380> think<00:04:23.590> we

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
kind of just triple cap and I think we

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.410 
kind of just triple cap and I think we
win<00:04:23.830> this<00:04:23.950> game<00:04:24.130> like<00:04:24.400> 200<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.150> set

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
win this game like 200 is set

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.900 
win this game like 200 is set
the<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:26.080> know<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.230> really<00:04:27.070> wish<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.550> games

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
the you know I really wish that games

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.660 
the you know I really wish that games
didn't<00:04:28.180> go<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.450> fast<00:04:29.220> because<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.370> know<00:04:30.490> is

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
didn't go that fast because you know is

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.580 
didn't go that fast because you know is
good<00:04:31.300> good<00:04:31.720> amount<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.050> time<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.260> could<00:04:32.500> have

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
good good amount this time I could have

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.170 
good good amount this time I could have
probably<00:04:32.710> had<00:04:32.920> kills<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.400> think<00:04:33.850> right<00:04:33.970> at<00:04:34.090> the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
probably had kills I think right at the

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.060 
probably had kills I think right at the
end<00:04:34.330> i<00:04:34.450> get<00:04:34.600> i<00:04:34.750> get<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:35.050> visa<00:04:35.260> unfortunately<00:04:36.040> i

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
end i get i get a visa unfortunately i

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.220 
end i get i get a visa unfortunately i
die<00:04:36.340> but<00:04:36.700> you<00:04:37.150> know<00:04:37.270> if<00:04:37.570> there<00:04:37.720> was<00:04:37.870> more<00:04:38.020> time

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
die but you know if there was more time

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.420 
die but you know if there was more time
i<00:04:38.290> probably<00:04:38.680> would<00:04:38.860> have<00:04:38.920> played<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.160> little

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
i probably would have played a little

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.250 
i probably would have played a little
bit<00:04:39.580> smarter<00:04:39.820> i<00:04:40.000> know<00:04:40.210> there's<00:04:40.390> only<00:04:40.510> like<00:04:40.660> you

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
bit smarter i know there's only like you

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.900 
bit smarter i know there's only like you
know<00:04:41.410> five<00:04:41.680> seconds<00:04:42.130> left<00:04:42.340> so<00:04:42.490> i<00:04:42.520> just<00:04:42.700> kind<00:04:42.760> of

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
know five seconds left so i just kind of

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.670 
know five seconds left so i just kind of
ran<00:04:43.120> out<00:04:43.150> there<00:04:43.480> so<00:04:44.020> unfortunately<00:04:44.500> maybe

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
ran out there so unfortunately maybe

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.930 
ran out there so unfortunately maybe
this<00:04:44.920> could<00:04:45.010> have<00:04:45.130> been<00:04:45.160> a<00:04:45.250> hierarchical<00:04:45.730> game

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
this could have been a hierarchical game

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.030 
this could have been a hierarchical game
but<00:04:46.180> as<00:04:46.330> I<00:04:46.450> said<00:04:46.600> guys<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:46.990> 104<00:04:47.590> kill<00:04:47.800> game
