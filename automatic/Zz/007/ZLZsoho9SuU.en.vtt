valves<00:00:06.440> these<00:00:07.440> are<00:00:07.649> called<00:00:07.890> hose<00:00:08.790> burst

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
valves these are called hose burst

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.959 
valves these are called hose burst
valves<00:00:09.750> or<00:00:10.590> something<00:00:11.040> called<00:00:11.309> hose<00:00:11.610> break

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
valves or something called hose break

valves or something called hose break
valves<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.630> even<00:00:13.440> I've<00:00:14.009> heard<00:00:14.219> them<00:00:14.370> called

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450

velocity<00:00:15.450> velocity<00:00:16.379> fuses<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.810> idea<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.529> that

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
velocity velocity fuses the idea is that

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.400 
velocity velocity fuses the idea is that
you<00:00:20.520> screw<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.150> into<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.779> port<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
you screw this into the port of the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.910 
you screw this into the port of the
hydraulic<00:00:22.949> ram<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> hose<00:00:25.050> bursts

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
hydraulic ram and if the hose bursts

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.259 
hydraulic ram and if the hose bursts
that<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> valve<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.990> sense<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.519> change<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
that the valve will sense the change of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.510 
that the valve will sense the change of
flow<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:32.149> stop<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.809> load<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> ram<00:00:34.829> from

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
flow and stop the load or the ram from

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.680 
flow and stop the load or the ram from
falling<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:38.040> way<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.370> work<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
falling the way they work is that you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.100 
falling the way they work is that you
have<00:00:40.010> cartridge<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:43.010> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> cartridge

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
have cartridge and in the cartridge

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.479 
have cartridge and in the cartridge
there's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.440> plate<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.460> a

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
there's a little plate is a bit like a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
there's a little plate is a bit like a
check<00:00:47.820> valve<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.230> instead<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
check valve you have but instead of a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.119 
check valve you have but instead of a
poppet<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> plate<00:00:51.960> which<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> held

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
poppet you have a plate which is held

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.590 
poppet you have a plate which is held
off<00:00:53.340> by<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:54.660> spring<00:00:55.110> from<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> body<00:00:56.480> what<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
off by a spring from the body what you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.819 
off by a spring from the body what you
have<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.989> do<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.949> have<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.460> set<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:01.379> gap

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
have to do you have to set up this gap

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.189 
have to do you have to set up this gap
in<00:01:02.219> here

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
in here

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.820 
in here
with<00:01:04.700> Peter<00:01:05.700> gauges<00:01:06.439> there's<00:01:07.439> usually<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
with Peter gauges there's usually a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.950 
with Peter gauges there's usually a
chart<00:01:08.250> where<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:10.400> have<00:01:11.400> flow<00:01:11.960> against

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
chart where you can have flow against

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.120 
chart where you can have flow against
gap<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> flow<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.950> two

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
gap so if you know the flow so it's two

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.469 
gap so if you know the flow so it's two
liters<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> minute<00:01:18.350> you've<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.560> across<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
liters a minute you've go across on the

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.020 
liters a minute you've go across on the
chart<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.979> two<00:01:23.130> liters<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.490> minute<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
chart to to two liters a minute and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.899 
chart to to two liters a minute and
you'll<00:01:24.509> find<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.710> gap<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:27.530> millimeters<00:01:28.909> but

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
you'll find the gap in millimeters but

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.899 
you'll find the gap in millimeters but
you<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.299> set<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:32.729> easily

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
you have to set that to and it's easily

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.700 
you have to set that to and it's easily
done<00:01:33.060> by<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:34.040> small<00:01:35.040> nut<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.180> back<00:01:36.560> now<00:01:37.560> how

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
done by a small nut on the back now how

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
done by a small nut on the back now how
it<00:01:37.829> works<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.430> under<00:01:38.970> normal<00:01:39.119> conditions

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it works is that under normal conditions

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.050 
it works is that under normal conditions
the<00:01:40.549> flow<00:01:41.549> will<00:01:42.479> pass<00:01:42.750> through<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.530> valve

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the flow will pass through this valve

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.980 
the flow will pass through this valve
but<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.540> hose<00:01:45.780> breaks<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.990> pressure

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
but if the hose breaks the pressure

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.210 
but if the hose breaks the pressure
across<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> valve<00:01:50.720> recorded<00:01:51.720> Delta<00:01:52.170> P<00:01:52.380> will

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
across the valve recorded Delta P will

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.800 
across the valve recorded Delta P will
also<00:01:53.579> increase

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
also increase

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.740 
also increase
they'll<00:01:55.380> overcome<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> spring<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.759> close

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
they'll overcome the spring and close

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.280 
they'll overcome the spring and close
this<00:01:58.560> plate<00:01:58.890> hang<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> its<00:01:59.880> seat<00:02:00.290> closing

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.430 

the<00:02:05.640> problem<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.600> these<00:02:06.720> films<00:02:07.020> is

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the problem we have with these films is

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.120 
the problem we have with these films is
that<00:02:07.680> they're<00:02:07.860> quite<00:02:08.220> difficult<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.850> set<00:02:09.119> up

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
that they're quite difficult to set up

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.350 
that they're quite difficult to set up
you<00:02:11.130> can<00:02:11.310> set<00:02:11.520> them<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> feeler

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you can set them up with the feeler

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
you can set them up with the feeler
gauges<00:02:12.800> but<00:02:13.820> often<00:02:14.820> they<00:02:15.030> either<00:02:15.380> close

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
gauges but often they either close

been a fan of these valves because I
think<00:02:48.600> there<00:02:48.930> are<00:02:48.959> far<00:02:49.680> better<00:02:49.740> ways<00:02:50.160> of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
think there are far better ways of

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.870 
think there are far better ways of
stopping<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:52.110> load<00:02:52.800> from<00:02:53.160> dropping<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.640> around

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
stopping a load from dropping on around

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.670 
stopping a load from dropping on around
if<00:02:54.200> if<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.620> hose<00:02:56.130> bursts<00:02:56.990> but<00:02:57.990> they<00:02:58.140> are<00:02:58.320> about

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
if if the hose bursts but they are about

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.050 
if if the hose bursts but they are about
people<00:02:59.520> do<00:02:59.700> buy<00:02:59.940> them<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:01.430> many<00:03:02.430> don't

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
people do buy them and many don't

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.750 
people do buy them and many don't
realize<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:04.020> they<00:03:04.800> have<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.070> be<00:03:05.250> set<00:03:05.550> up

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
realize that they have to be set up

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
realize that they have to be set up
before<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.330> can<00:03:06.570> install<00:03:06.750> them<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:08.450> fear<00:03:09.450> that

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
before you can install them I fear that

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.990 
before you can install them I fear that
there<00:03:09.959> are<00:03:10.050> many<00:03:10.260> systems<00:03:10.560> out<00:03:11.010> there<00:03:11.340> with

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000

these<00:03:12.150> valves<00:03:12.690> installed<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:15.140> should<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.410> hose
