00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
here and then you had to pick a specific

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.110 
here and then you had to pick a specific
amount<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.430> clues<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.820> found<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.060> have

itself which half the time don't even
make<00:02:50.370> any<00:02:50.520> fucking<00:02:50.820> sense<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.270> apparently<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
make any fucking sense so apparently the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.850 
make any fucking sense so apparently the
killer<00:02:51.810> was<00:02:51.990> here<00:02:52.020> because<00:02:52.260> he<00:02:52.410> was<00:02:52.620> looking
