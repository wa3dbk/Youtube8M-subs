00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
and the other thing that's important

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.949 
and the other thing that's important
about<00:03:21.700> microfiber<00:03:22.700> enviro<00:03:23.450> cloths<00:03:23.750> from

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
about microfiber enviro cloths from

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.110 
about microfiber enviro cloths from
Norwest<00:03:24.410> is<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:25.160> they've<00:03:25.310> infused<00:03:25.640> silver

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
Norwest is that they've infused silver

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.560 
Norwest is that they've infused silver
in<00:03:26.239> it

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
in it

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.470 
in it
the<00:03:27.080> reason<00:03:27.440> silver<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:27.980> important<00:03:28.670> is

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
the reason silver is important is

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.010 
the reason silver is important is
because<00:03:30.160> silver<00:03:31.209> when<00:03:32.209> it's<00:03:32.360> wetted<00:03:32.780> in<00:03:32.900> the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
because silver when it's wetted in the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.310 
because silver when it's wetted in the
cloth<00:03:33.290> actually<00:03:34.220> acts<00:03:34.400> as<00:03:34.670> an<00:03:34.850> agent<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.480> begin

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
cloth actually acts as an agent to begin

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.270 
cloth actually acts as an agent to begin
to<00:03:36.530> render<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.340> live<00:03:37.730> organism<00:03:38.860> unable<00:03:39.860> to

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
to render a live organism unable to

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
breathe and continue to live so you

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.009 
breathe and continue to live so you
actually<00:03:43.820> end<00:03:43.970> up<00:03:44.060> with<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.300> self<00:03:44.690> cleaning

actually end up with a self cleaning
cloth<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:46.519> stays<00:03:46.790> cleaner<00:03:47.180> longer<00:03:48.010> I'm

going to test the cutting board so that

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.860 
going to test the cutting board so that
you<00:03:50.959> can<00:03:51.170> see<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.370> will<00:03:52.519> pick<00:03:52.700> up<00:03:52.870> the

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
you can see that it will pick up the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.890 
you can see that it will pick up the
protein<00:03:54.290> from<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.500> time

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
protein from the time

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.430 
protein from the time
we're<00:03:55.080> going<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.349> use<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:56.430> clear<00:03:56.970> blue<00:03:57.440> so

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
we're going to use this clear blue so

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.199 
we're going to use this clear blue so
that<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.739> can<00:03:58.920> see<00:03:59.099> it<00:03:59.220> stays<00:03:59.489> blue<00:03:59.849> after

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
that you can see it stays blue after

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.149 
that you can see it stays blue after
testing<00:04:00.599> on<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.840> cutting<00:04:01.140> board<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:02.040> other

thing<00:04:02.400> I'm<00:04:02.519> going<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.700> do<00:04:02.909> is<00:04:03.450> I'm<00:04:04.140> going<00:04:04.170> to

thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.500 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

actually go ahead and I'm going to test
my<00:04:06.720> clock<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.459> can<00:04:08.640> see<00:04:08.879> that

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
my clock so that you can see that

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.370 

here<00:05:51.770> we<00:05:51.920> have<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.730> three<00:05:53.240> swab<00:05:53.570> that<00:05:53.930> I

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
here we have the three swab that I

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.740 
here we have the three swab that I
swabbed<00:05:54.770> on<00:05:54.980> the<00:05:55.130> clean<00:05:55.400> knife<00:05:55.670> the<00:05:56.420> clean

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
swabbed on the clean knife the clean

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.160 
swabbed on the clean knife the clean
cutting<00:05:57.110> board<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:57.770> a<00:05:58.550> cloth<00:05:58.910> show<00:05:59.690> you<00:05:59.750> that

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
cutting board and a cloth show you that

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.130 
cutting board and a cloth show you that
there<00:06:00.830> is<00:06:00.860> no<00:06:01.130> proteins<00:06:01.640> present<00:06:02.270> on<00:06:02.450> this

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
there is no proteins present on this

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.500 
there is no proteins present on this
side<00:06:03.410> you<00:06:03.590> can<00:06:03.650> see<00:06:04.010> that<00:06:04.370> this<00:06:04.550> is<00:06:04.850> reacting

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
side you can see that this is reacting

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.500 
side you can see that this is reacting
and<00:06:05.690> turning<00:06:06.500> a<00:06:06.590> purple<00:06:06.980> tint<00:06:07.360> showing<00:06:08.360> you

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
and turning a purple tint showing you

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.750 
and turning a purple tint showing you
that<00:06:08.780> after<00:06:09.260> I<00:06:09.290> swap<00:06:09.740> with<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.220> chicken<00:06:10.580> juice

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
that after I swap with the chicken juice

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.090 
that after I swap with the chicken juice
on<00:06:10.970> the<00:06:11.240> knife<00:06:11.450> that<00:06:12.140> there<00:06:12.380> was<00:06:12.560> a<00:06:12.590> presence

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
on the knife that there was a presence

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.750 
on the knife that there was a presence
of<00:06:13.220> proteins<00:06:14.410> so<00:06:15.410> this<00:06:15.560> is<00:06:15.740> just<00:06:15.890> a<00:06:16.100> way<00:06:16.280> with

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
of proteins so this is just a way with

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.150 
of proteins so this is just a way with
Norway<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.450> viral<00:06:17.780> claws<00:06:18.020> that<00:06:18.590> we<00:06:18.740> can<00:06:18.950> save

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
Norway and viral claws that we can save

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.880 
Norway and viral claws that we can save
