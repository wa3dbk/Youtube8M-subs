00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
looks pretty much identical but guys

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.940 
looks pretty much identical but guys
it's<00:02:10.330> just<00:02:10.660> gonna<00:02:10.990> be<00:02:11.170> nice<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.590> have<00:02:11.770> this

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
it's just gonna be nice to have this

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.610 
it's just gonna be nice to have this
part<00:02:12.340> be<00:02:12.520> aluminium<00:02:13.030> believe<00:02:13.330> me<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:14.380> yeah<00:02:14.530> a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
part be aluminium believe me and yeah a

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.680 
part be aluminium believe me and yeah a
little<00:02:14.920> nut<00:02:15.220> fell<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.610> just<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.390> case<00:02:16.570> you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
little nut fell out just in case you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.790 
little nut fell out just in case you
didn't<00:02:16.930> know<00:02:16.960> there's<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.350> three<00:02:17.620> millimeter

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
didn't know there's a three millimeter

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.640 
didn't know there's a three millimeter
nut<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.370> goes<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> top<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.210> this<00:02:19.650> is

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
nut that goes on the top of that this is

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.710 
nut that goes on the top of that this is
different<00:02:21.190> because<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.580> has<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:22.240> piece<00:02:22.540> of

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
different because it has this piece of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.360 
different because it has this piece of
plastic<00:02:22.960> that<00:02:23.320> goes<00:02:23.500> through<00:02:23.920> there<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.310> that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
plastic that goes through there and that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.080 
plastic that goes through there and that
pretty<00:02:25.060> much<00:02:25.180> works<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> way<00:02:26.500> for<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.090> screw

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
pretty much works as a way for the screw

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.030 
pretty much works as a way for the screw
to<00:02:28.360> get<00:02:28.480> stuck<00:02:28.810> into<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.530> doesn't<00:02:29.770> slide

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
to get stuck into so it doesn't slide

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
to get stuck into so it doesn't slide
right<00:02:30.250> back<00:02:30.490> out<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.510> good<00:02:31.660> way<00:02:31.810> of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
right back out it's a good way of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.290 
right back out it's a good way of
getting<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:33.040> screw<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.490> stay<00:02:33.700> into<00:02:34.030> aluminum

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
getting a screw to stay into aluminum

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.050 
getting a screw to stay into aluminum
without<00:02:34.960> having<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.470> use<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.860> threading<00:02:36.370> so

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
without having the use of threading so

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.780 
without having the use of threading so
let's<00:02:37.480> go<00:02:37.690> ahead<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.410> just<00:02:38.680> slide<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.490> into

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
let's go ahead and just slide that into

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.890 
let's go ahead and just slide that into
place<00:02:41.490> now<00:02:42.490> I'm<00:02:43.180> gonna<00:02:43.330> go<00:02:43.570> ahead<00:02:43.600> and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
place now I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.560 
place now I'm gonna go ahead and
reinstall<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.410> three<00:02:44.920> screws<00:02:45.190> one<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.210> bottom

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
reinstall the three screws one on bottom

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.500 
reinstall the three screws one on bottom
and<00:02:46.990> then<00:02:47.530> one<00:02:47.740> on<00:02:47.770> each<00:02:48.040> side<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:49.150> can<00:02:49.270> see

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
and then one on each side as you can see

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.870 
and then one on each side as you can see
it<00:02:49.780> has<00:02:50.020> been<00:02:50.380> installed<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.640> looks
