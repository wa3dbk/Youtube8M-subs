00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hello everyone is Subaru Nagano of Sagamihara Pakurenzu belongs 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.580
 The balls to be introduced this time were newly released from the 6 company heads. 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.900
 I would like to introduce Zero Gravity Gold 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:20.430
 The layout goes first 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.400
 It is a little ppap is Koinko from do you think? Pin and look difficult because the color is flashy 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.720
 4 and 1/2 because there are crutch chairs here 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:32.599
 The pin bapper is 3 inches and the balance hole is 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:39.430
 It opens at about a 7 inch 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:42.600
 And comparison ball wants to throw the zero gravity of the previous work as a comparison ball 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:48.070
 The payout is the same 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.180
 go I don't have balance here with 4 and 1/2 and 3 inches 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.110
 I would like to throw this as a comparison ball 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.470
 Though it is this zero gravity gold 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.260
 There is a change with the previous work 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:10.260
 Is this cover stock? 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.390
 The previous work is from erg reactive base cover stock this time 7 base nrg 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:20.050
 Changed to cover stock 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:21.960
 The middle child is ld core of blue block which was highly appreciated at the previous work zero gravity 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.900
 It has become 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:36.300
 And it is very because it has been changed from solid to pearl 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:41.040
 Compared to the previous work Zero Gravity has become a ball that feels a sense of skit smoother 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:45.270
 Though it is quite 8 skit officer is long, though 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:50.370
 By the material of the surface becoming the pearl of the 7 base name 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.610
 It is not an image that slides too much , but a ball that skits come out while catching 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:58.360
 It has become 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.260
 And because the core itself is government 6 ld core, it is quite core 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.230
 It becomes 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:11.600
 When rg is 2.55 , rg is 0.037 and bias is 0.01 0 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:12.530
 Because very high itself has become after that, as the way of movement 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.020
 Is 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:22.640
 I think very calm that I mean easy to handle such a move is whether feature 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.940
 But it is compared to the Gravity of the Edo Gravity electric fence 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.360
 It is a part that has become 8 pearl 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:37.700
 The fit on the front gets longer and the movement of the back end feels so much 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.570
 If anything , 0g t of the previous work is a solid cover, so the catch is strong 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.100
 Feeling 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.960
 Rather and extremely calm and tightener instead of the ball, such as taking too much width 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:51.570
 Though line taking was effective ball 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:57.480
 This time as catches by becoming a pearl of 7 this time as a slick back 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.170
 Very out back is zero of that previous work gravity has become so large movement in the end 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.050
 More than 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.520
 It has become easy ball 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:10.500
 That's a very versatile ball 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:16.470
 This is a series of two zero gravity, which is the broad medium 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.810
 A wide range by putting processing of oily to medium dry and surface to the right or to the cancellation 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.790
 Because it is a usable ball 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.510
 Basically I think it is a very easy to use ball as the main ball 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.650
 And this 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:35.650
 Thank you Gold for the composition of the former new work 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.480
 The movement of the back end is also very strong that much, so either Japanese customers 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.909
 As preferred by 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.269
 Take a look towards the videos on the I think that is a ball that has finished in the more movement 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.269
 Please 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.780
 Ha 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.780
