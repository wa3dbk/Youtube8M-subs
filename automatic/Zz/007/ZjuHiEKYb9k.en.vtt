don't<00:03:35.290> really<00:03:35.439> the<00:03:35.829> computer<00:03:36.280> doesn't<00:03:36.549> need<00:03:36.790> a

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
don't really the computer doesn't need a

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.629 
don't really the computer doesn't need a
render<00:03:37.239> all<00:03:37.389> that<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:38.709> just<00:03:39.340> slowing

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
render all that so just just slowing

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:50.959 
render all that so just just slowing
down<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:41.470> just<00:03:41.889> test<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.900> compile<00:03:50.319> it

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:50.969 
down and just test it just compile it

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.089 
down and just test it just compile it
and<00:03:51.969> it'll<00:03:52.480> give<00:03:52.659> you<00:03:52.689> heirs<00:03:53.019> if<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.829> did<00:03:54.010> it

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
and it'll give you heirs if you did it

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.420 
and it'll give you heirs if you did it
wrong<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:56.530> would<00:03:56.650> have<00:03:56.739> gave<00:03:56.919> you<00:03:56.950> somewhere

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:32.230 

oops<00:04:18.850> eggs<00:04:19.850> out<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.209> wrong<00:04:20.389> thing

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.719 

see<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.990> says<00:04:33.259> it's<00:04:33.979> telling<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.550> you

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
see it says it's telling you that you

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.100 
see it says it's telling you that you
have<00:04:34.759> a<00:04:34.910> portal<00:04:35.360> that's<00:04:35.509> wrong<00:04:37.870> it's<00:04:38.870> pretty

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
have a portal that's wrong it's pretty

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.839 
have a portal that's wrong it's pretty
much<00:04:39.289> means<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.650> same<00:04:39.889> portal<00:04:40.280> as<00:04:40.490> on<00:04:40.639> both

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
much means the same portal as on both

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.939 
much means the same portal as on both
sides<00:04:41.150> because<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:42.229> doesn't<00:04:42.560> take<00:04:42.680> up<00:04:42.830> the

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
sides because it doesn't take up the

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.080 
sides because it doesn't take up the
whole<00:04:43.130> wall<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.690> whole<00:04:44.840> area<00:04:45.789> or<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:46.940> whole

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
whole wall the whole area or the whole

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.350 
whole wall the whole area or the whole
source<00:04:47.660> it<00:04:48.199> it's<00:04:48.770> practically<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.580> whole<00:04:49.819> you

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
source it it's practically the whole you

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.029 
source it it's practically the whole you
just<00:04:50.509> made<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.840> whole<00:04:51.020> map<00:04:51.229> one<00:04:51.530> cell<00:04:51.860> right

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
just made the whole map one cell right

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.219 
just made the whole map one cell right
there<00:04:52.099> which<00:04:52.940> doesn't<00:04:53.389> do<00:04:53.479> anything<00:04:53.870> so<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.169> was

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
there which doesn't do anything so I was

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.010 
there which doesn't do anything so I was
telling<00:04:54.410> you<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.650> guess<00:04:54.970> that's<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.210> basic

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
telling you I guess that's the basic

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:07.940 
telling you I guess that's the basic
poor<00:04:57.889> line<00:04:58.190> all<00:04:59.000> right<00:04:59.120> thanks<00:04:59.509> for<00:04:59.539> watching
