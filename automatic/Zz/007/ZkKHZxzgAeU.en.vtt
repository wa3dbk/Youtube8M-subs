like<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> level<00:02:38.970> three<00:02:39.120> different<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.930> think

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
like a level three different I think

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.110 
like a level three different I think
it's<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.160> issue<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.550> your<00:02:41.700> class<00:02:41.880> now

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
it's it's the issue of your class now

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.180 
it's it's the issue of your class now
but<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.420> has<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> lot<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.720> pushback<00:02:42.959> yeah<00:02:43.920> and
