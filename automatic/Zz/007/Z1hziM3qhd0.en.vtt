00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
versatility is something that I think is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.390 
versatility is something that I think is
so<00:01:12.720> underrated<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.530> league<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
so underrated in this league and in the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.530 
so underrated in this league and in the
Big<00:01:14.549> East<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.210> think<00:01:15.330> makes

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
Big East is that what you think makes

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.390 
Big East is that what you think makes
him<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.810> valuable<00:01:15.930> he's<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.979> really<00:01:17.159> good

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
him so valuable he's just a really good

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.520 
him so valuable he's just a really good
player<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.630> think<00:01:19.080> he's<00:01:19.200> one<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.439> those

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
player and I think he's one of those

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
player and I think he's one of those
guys<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.770> doesn't<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> position<00:01:20.909> he<00:01:21.090> can

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
guys that doesn't have a position he can

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.490

just<00:01:21.390> play<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.840> he<00:01:21.960> could<00:01:22.080> play<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.439> about

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
just play and he could play just about

carriers<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.620> one<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.190> things<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.489> that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
carriers and one of the things that that

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.800 
carriers and one of the things that that
happens<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.120> think<00:02:31.300> that's<00:02:31.450> one<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.660> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
happens I think that's one of the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.900 
happens I think that's one of the
reasons<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.950> want<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.489> have<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> program

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
reasons that you want to have a program

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.570 
reasons that you want to have a program
instead<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.080> teams<00:02:35.410> is<00:02:35.739> when<00:02:36.400> you've<00:02:36.489> got

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
instead of just teams is when you've got

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.100 
instead of just teams is when you've got
a<00:02:36.640> program<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.239> older<00:02:37.450> players<00:02:37.569> teach<00:02:37.959> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
a program the older players teach the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.930 
a program the older players teach the
younger<00:02:38.260> ones<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.010> those<00:02:39.220> guys<00:02:39.400> got<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.790> learn

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
younger ones so those guys got to learn

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.729 
younger ones so those guys got to learn
last<00:02:40.480> year<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.019> now<00:02:41.050> they're<00:02:41.530> stepping

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
last year and now they're stepping

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.650 
last year and now they're stepping
forward<00:02:42.100> having<00:02:42.489> learned<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:43.000> practice<00:02:43.420> every

think Marquette's done a really good job
of<00:02:56.319> that<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:57.220> know<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.519> think<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.090> rest<00:02:58.239> of

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
of that so you know I think the rest of

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.270 
of that so you know I think the rest of
us<00:02:58.540> can<00:02:58.720> act<00:02:58.870> like<00:02:58.959> we're<00:02:59.200> surprised<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.890> don't

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
us can act like we're surprised I don't

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.559 
us can act like we're surprised I don't
think<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.580> players<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.299> Marquette

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
think the players in the Marquette

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:02.940 
think the players in the Marquette
locker<00:03:01.780> room<00:03:01.959> are<00:03:02.080> surprised<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:02.830> you

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
locker room are surprised and that you

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.740 
locker room are surprised and that you
know<00:03:03.040> that's<00:03:03.250> another<00:03:03.459> sign<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:03.940> mentally

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
know that's another sign of a mentally

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.720 
know that's another sign of a mentally
tough<00:03:04.930> team<00:03:05.110> finally<00:03:05.650> for<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.950> Marquette<00:03:06.580> I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
tough team finally for you Marquette I

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.309 
tough team finally for you Marquette I
think<00:03:06.910> pessimistic<00:03:07.630> fans<00:03:07.840> would<00:03:08.019> say<00:03:08.170> this

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
think pessimistic fans would say this

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.500 
think pessimistic fans would say this
size<00:03:08.590> disadvantage<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.370> they<00:03:09.549> have<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:10.030> a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
size disadvantage that they have is a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.750 
size disadvantage that they have is a
disadvantage<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.769> know<00:03:11.890> pundits<00:03:12.610> that

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
disadvantage but you know pundits that

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.160 
disadvantage but you know pundits that
watch<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.120> game<00:03:13.299> yourself<00:03:13.720> included<00:03:14.110> I'm

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
watch the game yourself included I'm

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.840 
watch the game yourself included I'm
sure<00:03:14.319> you<00:03:14.410> can<00:03:14.530> see<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.769> speed<00:03:15.010> is<00:03:15.459> often<00:03:15.790> a

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
sure you can see the speed is often a

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.910 
sure you can see the speed is often a
mismatch<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.269> their<00:03:16.420> favor<00:03:16.690> going<00:03:17.590> out<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.769> the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
mismatch in their favor going out of the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.229 
mismatch in their favor going out of the
Big<00:03:18.070> East<00:03:18.250> once<00:03:18.459> they<00:03:18.579> step<00:03:18.790> out<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.060> jump

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
Big East once they step out and jump

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.340 
Big East once they step out and jump
into<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.450> NC<00:03:19.630> double-a<00:03:19.840> tournament<00:03:19.870> do<00:03:20.260> you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
into the NC double-a tournament do you

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.080 
into the NC double-a tournament do you
think<00:03:20.650> in<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:21.370> end<00:03:21.459> that<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.820> can<00:03:21.970> actually

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
think in the end that that can actually

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.949 
think in the end that that can actually
help<00:03:22.299> them<00:03:22.739> no<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.609> think<00:03:25.239> they<00:03:25.329> can<00:03:25.540> they<00:03:25.930> can

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
help them no I think they can they can

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.710 
help them no I think they can they can
cover<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.859> up<00:03:27.070> I<00:03:27.430> think<00:03:28.180> you'd<00:03:28.299> rather<00:03:28.480> be

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
cover it up I think you'd rather be

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.780 
cover it up I think you'd rather be
bigger<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.829> know<00:03:29.920> anytime<00:03:30.220> size<00:03:30.519> is

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
bigger you know anytime size is

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.300 
bigger you know anytime size is
important<00:03:31.269> in<00:03:31.359> basketball<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:32.500> can<00:03:32.980> cover<00:03:33.190> it

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
important in basketball you can cover it

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.190 
important in basketball you can cover it
up<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.820> make<00:03:34.060> up<00:03:34.209> for<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.540> with<00:03:34.570> great<00:03:34.930> speed

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
up and make up for it with great speed

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.140 
up and make up for it with great speed
and<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.739> think<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.100> one<00:03:36.519> thing<00:03:36.549> I<00:03:36.730> love

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
and I think the one thing I love

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.250 
and I think the one thing I love

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
watching about marchetti's their ball

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.140 
watching about marchetti's their ball
movement<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.859> great<00:03:39.160> Obama<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.000> player

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.840 
movement is spectacular but you know the
size<00:03:43.359> thing<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.810> an<00:03:44.109> issue<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.829> think<00:03:45.670> if<00:03:45.760> you
