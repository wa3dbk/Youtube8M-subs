so<00:00:00.179> we're<00:00:00.599> setting<00:00:01.079> yourselves<00:00:01.319> up<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.560> make<00:00:01.709> a

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
so we're setting yourselves up to make a

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.280 
so we're setting yourselves up to make a
million<00:00:02.550> units<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.750> next<00:00:03.929> couple<00:00:04.080> months

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
million units in the next couple months

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.019 
million units in the next couple months
and<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.279> course<00:00:05.339> we<00:00:05.549> run<00:00:05.670> our<00:00:05.759> ramp<00:00:05.910> up

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
and of course we run our ramp up

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.249 
and of course we run our ramp up
production<00:00:06.150> as<00:00:06.450> quickly<00:00:06.600> as<00:00:06.779> we<00:00:06.810> can<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.170> on

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
production as quickly as we can be on

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.950 
production as quickly as we can be on
that<00:00:07.440> what's<00:00:07.980> your<00:00:08.130> target<00:00:08.690> we<00:00:09.690> don't<00:00:09.719> have

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
that what's your target we don't have

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.900 
that what's your target we don't have
any<00:00:10.380> particular<00:00:10.800> target<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.130> mean<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> new

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
any particular target I mean for a new

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.209 
any particular target I mean for a new
device<00:00:12.179> like<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.599> our<00:00:13.110> goal<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.740> make<00:00:14.099> as

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
device like this our goal is to make as

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.790 
device like this our goal is to make as
many<00:00:14.370> as<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:15.960> sunny<00:00:16.199> it's<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.619> new

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
many as we can but it's sunny it's a new

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.349 
many as we can but it's sunny it's a new
production<00:00:17.010> process<00:00:17.580> right<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.029> it's

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
production process right you know it's

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.990 
production process right you know it's
in<00:00:18.449> fact<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.810> very<00:00:18.960> complex<00:00:19.770> new<00:00:20.520> production

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
in fact a very complex new production

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.689 
in fact a very complex new production
process<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.449> takes<00:00:21.600> almost<00:00:22.529> 40<00:00:23.160> hours<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
process that takes almost 40 hours it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.070 
process that takes almost 40 hours it
takes<00:00:23.880> almost<00:00:24.090> 40<00:00:24.449> hours<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.750> make<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:24.900> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
takes almost 40 hours to make one of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.170 
takes almost 40 hours to make one of
these<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.289> us<00:00:25.380> right<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.699> ramp<00:00:27.029> up

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
these of us right so we have to ramp up

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.730 
these of us right so we have to ramp up
over<00:00:27.449> time<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.750> takes<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.140> time<00:00:28.230> now<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
over time it takes a bit of time now you

markets<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.480> quickly<00:01:00.660> as<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:01.020> without<00:01:01.140> new

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
markets as quickly as we can without new

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.869 
markets as quickly as we can without new
products<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.100> why<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.399> emerging<00:01:02.850> markets

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
products but why the emerging markets

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.670 
products but why the emerging markets
because<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> reason<00:01:04.019> why<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.260> asking<00:01:04.379> is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
because I'm the reason why I'm asking is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
because I'm the reason why I'm asking is
because<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:05.070> competitors<00:01:05.549> say<00:01:05.760> samsung<00:01:06.360> or

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
because your competitors say samsung or

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.020 
because your competitors say samsung or
apple<00:01:06.830> targeted<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.310> developed<00:01:08.880> markets

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
apple targeted the developed markets

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
apple targeted the developed markets
first<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.020> after<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.530> went<00:01:10.560> into

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
first and then after that they went into

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.990 
first and then after that they went into
the<00:01:10.890> urging<00:01:11.250> markets<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> seems<00:01:11.820> as<00:01:11.970> though

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the urging markets it seems as though

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.140 
the urging markets it seems as though
your<00:01:12.299> strategies<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.960> reverse<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.950> what<00:01:14.580> so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
your strategies in reverse so what so

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.219 
your strategies in reverse so what so
first<00:01:15.330> thing<00:01:15.420> about<00:01:15.540> these<00:01:15.659> markets<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
first thing about these markets is that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.899 
first thing about these markets is that
they're<00:01:16.380> very<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.650> large<00:01:16.890> markets<00:01:17.280> where

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
they're very very large markets where

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.460 
they're very very large markets where
people<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.390> experiencing<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> internet<00:01:19.350> for

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
people are experiencing the internet for

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.510 
people are experiencing the internet for
the<00:01:19.560> first<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:19.950> their<00:01:20.130> mobile<00:01:20.369> phones

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the first time on their mobile phones

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
the first time on their mobile phones
right<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.850> there's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> huge<00:01:21.330> man<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:22.470> smart

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
right so there's a huge man for smart

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.260 
right so there's a huge man for smart
phones<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.340> across<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> entire<00:01:24.000> range

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
phones you know across the entire range

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.450 
phones you know across the entire range
you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.229> secondly<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.159> how<00:01:26.400> we

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
you know secondly because of how we

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.490 
you know secondly because of how we
build<00:01:27.330> our<00:01:27.570> products<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:27.930> how<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.350> about

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
build our products and how I think about
