00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello to everyone this is anya and today I will show 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.880
 how do i make such a light summer evening 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.870
 laying all known since childhood method 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.750
 Bundle my hair with help for weaving 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 braids for the night mainly as we did 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.430
 we spit a lot of braids and so with him and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.050
 asleep I will show the method as using 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.080
 braids and I wind the hair for two 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 hours of hair I have already dry so I 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.940
 wetting is best done naturally 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.000
 after you have washed your hair and head 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.950
 you are almost dry that is to wet 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.610
 his hair in two hours is just not 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.460
 dry i divide my hair into three zones 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.809
 lateral zones are larger than average 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.219
 I tie side areas with rubber bands to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.239
 I was not disturbed yet 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.809
 good at combing this middle zone and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.830
 I begin to weave an ordinary spikelet that is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.680
 side strands and here over the middle and 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.299
 I try to weave the maximum closer and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.020
 closer to the head grabbing extra 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:23.270
 hide and seek thinner 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.270
 stove i front and back 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.420
 captures all all the hide and seek 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.030
 when i hide and seek everything is woven i 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.130
 just do the braid to the end and how 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.050
 often happens when we twist hair on 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.810
 pigtails they we have all the hair 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.020
 twisted and straight tips and so that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.420
 I didn't whip my pigtail up to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.430
 end or then bend the tip and with 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 using the gum I fix it now these 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.780
 side strands I divide into two parts and from 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 each part of the lash on the same pigtails 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.520
 how to weave to the middle of the head 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:38.019
 here are all the pigtails we are ready and I will 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.080
 over braids straight to put muse 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.239
 I squeeze out every time a little bit better 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.140
 you add them directly applied 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.940
 lot 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.790
 and hair will stick together a little bit 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:57.700
 add on top and along the entire length of the braids 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.099
 and distribute here I show the result 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.030
 basically who goes to a hippie party 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.030
 could be so 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.010
 after two hours i did 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.820
 manicure pedicure makeup changed 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.510
 spreading pigtails 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.750
 fingers not dissolve not comb 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.560
 because i want to keep this 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.560
 hair structure 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.690
 here are all pigtails dismissed I beat 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.599
 hair roots and hands to get 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.000
 maximum volume can be combed but 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.130
 I basically such a natural 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.450
 enough and here I am combing only 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.880
 hair tips 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.069
 that is, literally the last 10 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.330
 centimeters to just the tips were not 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.190
 together with stuck together and the result can 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.989
 splash varnish but it is not at all 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.510
 necessarily because such styling 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.510
 keeps very well and without lat 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.890
 and here is the result thank you all very much 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.640
 for watching 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.640
 good all week
