incredibly<00:01:18.180> durable<00:01:18.540> both<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.729> width

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
incredibly durable both and the width

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.550 
incredibly durable both and the width
total<00:01:21.810> width<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.280> 141<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.180> that's<00:01:24.420> from<00:01:25.290> here

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
total width is 141 so that's from here

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
total width is 141 so that's from here
to<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.610> smaller<00:01:26.939> than<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
to here so a little smaller than the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.410 
to here so a little smaller than the
Holbrook<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:29.250> bridge<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.270> 17<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.460> one

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
Holbrook the bridge is 17 so that's one

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.440 
Holbrook the bridge is 17 so that's one
millimeter<00:01:33.990> less<00:01:34.770> than<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.880> Holbrook<00:01:36.530> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
millimeter less than the Holbrook and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.539 
millimeter less than the Holbrook and
lastly<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> temple<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.829> 137<00:01:43.829> millimeters

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
lastly the temple is 137 millimeters

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.850 
lastly the temple is 137 millimeters
again<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.329> smaller<00:01:45.720> overall<00:01:46.500> frame

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
again so it is smaller overall frame

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.039 
again so it is smaller overall frame
than<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> Holbrook<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.060> they're<00:01:48.509> both<00:01:48.720> very

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
than the Holbrook and they're both very

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.560 
than the Holbrook and they're both very
very<00:01:49.259> nice<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:49.979> comes<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.570> personal

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
very nice and it comes down to personal

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.960 
very nice and it comes down to personal
preference<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.920> got<00:01:53.070> slightly<00:01:53.579> larger

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970
