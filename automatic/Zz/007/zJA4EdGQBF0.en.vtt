 How welcome are you to courses 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.410
 basic computing my name is daniel

 gomez in this video you will learn which 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:23.000
 are the requirements to install windows 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.800
 7 You will also learn how to verify if 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.949
 your computer meets these 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.949
 Requirements 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.910
 are you thinking about installing the system 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.460
 operative windows7 on your computer 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.830
 to be able to install windows 7 and have 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.020
 a pleasant experience when using your 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.090
 computer it is necessary that your 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.020
 computer meets some minimum 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.020
 Requirements 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.520
 the requirements to install windows 7 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.520
 are 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.260
 one- giga hertz processors 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.260
 1GB ram memory 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.869
 available space on the hard disk of 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.869
 16 gigabytes 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.720
 vertex graphic device 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.869
 at least version number 9 or better 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:25.640
 with 100 28 megabytes of memory and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.640
 wv driver of m version 1 or higher 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.300
 The advantages of windows 7 are 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.470
 quick installation takes more or less 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.470
 between 20 or 30 minutes 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.799
 high performance this operating system 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.799
 it's faster than the previous ones 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.880
 best system interface 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.450
 greater compatibility with 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.080
 controllers 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.830
 of devices 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.980
 automatically windows 7 will recognize 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.110
 all the devices that you have 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.880
 computer there will be no need to go 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.880
 looking for the controllers 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.010
 windows 7 has a new bar 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.140
 chores 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.140
 the start menu is more accessible 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.400
 and windows 7 has a nice 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.040
 experience when using your computer 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.290
 next I'll show you how 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.920
 Check if your computer complies with 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920
 the requirements 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.750
 press the start button 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:48.030
 and in the search bar type of 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.030
 d &amp; g and press the enter key 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:59.069
 in this window we can verify 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:03.370
 the processor that we have mine is from 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:07.819
 1.73 gigahertz so if it complies with 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.210
 the minimum requirements of the processor 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.910
 the memory 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.720
 it's two 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.600
 here it says 2048 megabytes that come 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.600
 being two gigabytes then also 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.600
 meets the requirements of memory 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.550
 and below we can see the version of 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.170
 directx that I have installed I have 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.660
 installed the 11 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.660
 windows 7 requires at least the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.070
 version number 9 so here too 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.070
 I am complying with the requirements 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.660
 now let's go to the screen tab 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.880
 and here we can verify the memory 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.770
 of our graphic device in my 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.770
 case I have 256 megabytes windows 7 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.940
 requires 100 28 so if I comply with 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.820
 the requirement 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.870
 and here we can see the model of 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.940
 controller that is version 1 and 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.780
 windows 7 requires at least version 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.370
 1 so my computer complies with 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.540
 all the minimum requirements for 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.540
 install windows 7 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.360
 now you have to verify 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.600
 the space available for this we do 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.180
 double click on equipment 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.590
 we click with the right button on the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.590
 local disk c 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.840
 and we select properties 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:50.510
 the pink color indicates the space 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.950
 available I have 100 9 gigabytes 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:56.310
 available on my hard drive 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.900
 and windows 7 requires at least 16 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.430
 gigabytes so here I am too 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.430
 fulfilling the minimum requirements 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.220
 If your computer complies with 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.130
 requirements to install windows 7 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.080
 you can proceed with confidence to install 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.080
