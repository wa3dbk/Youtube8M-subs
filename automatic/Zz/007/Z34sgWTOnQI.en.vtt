00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.860
 hello welcome friends for an easy tour 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.070
 this time I have ubuntu here 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.490
 aquarium 65 points that you have already been able 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.710
 see the boxing that is in the channel of a 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.990
 you easy and good today we are going to enter a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.630
 little in detail then in how is how 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.960
 works and such a good thing actually the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.060
 system is sub a tube and I already taught you in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.490
 the previous version 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:44.650
 of aquarium 4.5 which is this version that 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.290
 I have the previous one here 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.570
 and he good 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.360
 the operation is the same has not 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.120
 changed is quite similar and 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.440
 well as there are not too many 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.260
 news about what you are going to 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.670
 compare a little both phones first 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.110
 So you see, he's going to remove the case 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.570
 so you can see him 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.120
 the size that has the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.120
 on the phone in comparison 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.930
 Well, as you can see, the screen is quite 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.810
 bigger and the terminal is not so 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.770
 big as it might seem to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.770
 first sight 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.770
 the height of more or less similar good 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.219
 As you can see they are quite similar 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.140
 both phones and specifications 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.870
 well 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.870
 practically the same this one has 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.050
 5 has 5 inches and 45 has 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:51.729
 4.5 plays this one has more battery and 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:54.520
 to be able to assume the consumption of the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.840
 larger screen then the the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.170
 Battery life is similar in 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.990
 both phones 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.450
 both carry a memory processor 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.540
 ram and this takes twice as much space as 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.460
 have 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.830
 well both carry a gig of ram this 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.840
 has 16 gb of memory and this has 8 and 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.140
 then the chamber eastern 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 previous version of 45 then they are one of 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.370
 I can teach you I have here some 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.920
 photos taken 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.049
 both we are trying to do the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.450
 same photo to the best in the video is not 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.530
 they appreciate the differences 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.260
 principles are not many 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.260
 this one has a camera of 45 out of 8 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.900
 megapixels and this one has a 13 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.159
 megapixels 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.159
 and well, in principle 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.310
 oslo upload on the web both examples of 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.920
 the photos that I am showing so that 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.530
 You can see the differences in the photo 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.220
 for your own hands 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 then I do not know what else comments 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.490
 because the system is exactly the same or 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.620
 there have been almost no changes or improvements 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.220
 so I've been trying some things 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.800
 and well, it has improved functioning 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.290
 of bluetooth and this I'm talking about 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.960
 operating system the terminal is good 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.340
 terminal 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.440
 together and that it takes to settle down because 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.540
 because the first uses until 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.610
 updated all the right now 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.390
 I have updated 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.390
 but yes 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.020
 but come on even if you do not have updated 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.430
 the first uses always takes time and 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.070
 usually give a few for in the area 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.660
 there are only a few updates left or 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.470
 is some applications is nothing 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.390
 the system and the first courses that what 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.770
 as I said, it usually gives problems here 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.020
 with this in some games 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.020
 for example in this one that I was testing 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.040
 This is a tower of herschel machines 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.040
 universes machine 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.690
 Well yes it has given me some problem of 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.340
 the first time that you and that gave me 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.610
 some problem but let the rest have 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.610
 been 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.130
 well, the typical problems that 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.170
 I commented with also with the version 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.450
 previous this mobile well here also 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.810
 It happens in a similar way 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:31.360
 but little by little as you are using the 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.360
 phone so yes that allows us 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.919
 well that the performance of the best 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.880
 and little by little the system is improving 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.880
 settles and leaves us 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.170
 Well, work in a more normal way 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.430
 editing the small problems that 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.190
 we can come up with one of the 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.280
 applications been testing enough 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.020
 things and it works quite well enough 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.970
 everything as in this version is not in 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.910
 There is really no improvement because the 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.320
 system that is the machine that carries is 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.740
 same though this one has one more screen 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.810
 great then they are pretty options 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.280
 similar that in which really only 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.889
 they change the screen and the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.790
 and the camera then well, this is already 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.860
 It would be a bit like the decade lesson 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.729
 of each user that is what is 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.979
 refer 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.800
 I personally think that still 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.349
 the ubuntu system remains green 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.270
 for mobile phones but I trust that you can go 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.740
 improving and I trust that little by little I 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.629
 is coming out more applications and that 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.889
 make these terminals and those that 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.550
 go out because they are the terminals 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:44.360
 to keep in mind to use between 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.130
 between all the users and nothing then in 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.950
 principle this is what I have 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:53.110
 comments from him 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.110
 new goris 5 d 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.050
 d 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.520
 dvq and nothing I hope you liked the 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.010
 video or it seems interesting that it be 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.970
 I like that and give Libyan likes to the channel and 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.970
 do not hesitate to pass them by
