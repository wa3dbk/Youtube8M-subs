00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.270
 In this video we will see how to code by 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.390
 list 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.300
 we already know how to create free codes 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.140
 if I open the code manager I see 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.410
 that I have several codes created 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.680
 now we start reading the text 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.950
 let's read the text and suppose that 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.970
 right here talks about services 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.809
 health and I already have a code create I want 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.910
 associate this code with health services to 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:55.160
 the textual quote how to do it simply 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.060
 I select the textual quote 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.820
 and the trail and I release the code now in 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.110
 the margin area I think I have a 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.320
 appointment and the code here social 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.990
 so we can directly code 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.780
 from the code manager in 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.020
 first place we select this appointment 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.100
 You can select another appointment to 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.840
 repeat the practice and the trail and loose 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.969
 the code 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.840
 but we can also take advantage of 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:31.990
 left side panel is very useful and the 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 true that at 17 that is one of the most 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.509
 with news that it offers if we give a 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.939
 click on the three triangles in 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.240
 the left side part we can 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:47.640
 view both the documents and the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.720
 codes quotes memos and networks 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.370
 in this case I'm interested in chorus I can 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.170
 now you will have visualized by 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.200
 example in the documents and below the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 codes in the same way I can follow 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.030
 coding by list select one 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:10.060
 appointment and drag and drop the code 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.920
 we will continue with this practice but now 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.760
 I'm going to open another document that is not 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.640
 pdf to see how a video is encoded 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.319
 in this case we could already follow 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.310
 working with the appointments that we have 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.060
 previously created select the appointment and 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.099
 drag and drop the code but if not 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.099
 I can listen to the video again 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.020
 mark where I consider that initiates the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:44.170
 quote drag to or rather squeeze 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.980
 where the appointment ends and create the appointment 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.190
 I have another appointment that I just created and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.710
 now I simply drag and drop the 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.090
 code 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.540
 ok let's see how it is encoded by 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.239
 list 1 world 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.879
 the truth that is in the same way 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.060
 he just selected the appointment and I can 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.609
 drag so many codes those that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.129
 considered opportune because maybe in a 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:17.439
 textual quote so much is talked about 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:21.739
 prevention as about health or including 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:26.989
 pediatrics and finally we're going to see 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:31.459
 spend how you encode some images like this 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:36.670
 that I could simply select the 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:38.849
 appointment and drag and drop the elbow 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.940
 so in this video we have learned 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:49.440
 code by list how to code so much 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.440
 images pdf videos and word files
