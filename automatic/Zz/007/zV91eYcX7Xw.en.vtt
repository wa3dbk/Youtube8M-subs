00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
compared to last year all rights good i

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.119 
compared to last year all rights good i
like<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.780> lot<00:00:35.989> i<00:00:36.020> mean<00:00:36.350> last<00:00:36.530> year<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.980> last

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
like it a lot i mean last year the last

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.310 
like it a lot i mean last year the last
two<00:00:37.430> kilometers<00:00:37.969> were<00:00:38.149> or<00:00:38.420> last<00:00:38.930> kilometer

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
two kilometers were or last kilometer

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.720 
two kilometers were or last kilometer
and<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.440> half<00:00:39.620> was<00:00:39.800> all<00:00:39.949> downhill<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.489> then<00:00:40.550> in

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
and a half was all downhill and then in

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.250 
and a half was all downhill and then in
long<00:00:40.879> flat<00:00:41.179> to<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.420> stadium<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:41.929> now<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:42.109> have

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
long flat to the stadium so now you have

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.290 
long flat to the stadium so now you have
that<00:00:42.469> big<00:00:42.649> downhill<00:00:43.100> then<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.789> have<00:00:43.879> two<00:00:44.120> more

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
that big downhill then you have two more

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.119 
that big downhill then you have two more
steep<00:00:44.570> hills<00:00:44.809> afters<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.350> think<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.649> strongman

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
steep hills afters I think the strongman

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.790 
steep hills afters I think the strongman
can<00:00:46.339> really<00:00:46.640> make<00:00:47.359> a<00:00:47.390> move<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:47.839> other<00:00:48.109> guys<00:00:48.559> and

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
can really make a move on other guys and

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.739 
can really make a move on other guys and
not<00:00:48.920> wait<00:00:49.159> just<00:00:49.399> for<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.609> flat<00:00:49.909> sprint<00:00:50.269> finish<00:00:50.420> I

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
not wait just for a flat sprint finish I

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.049 
not wait just for a flat sprint finish I
think<00:00:51.109> that's<00:00:51.679> interesting<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:52.730> sure<00:00:52.760> and

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
think that's interesting for sure and

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.020 
think that's interesting for sure and
yeah<00:00:53.569> the<00:00:53.749> strongman<00:00:54.199> will<00:00:54.440> win<00:00:54.819> you<00:00:55.819> had<00:00:55.999> a

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
workouts and then in some of our

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.009 
workouts and then in some of our
training<00:04:19.789> camps<00:04:20.120> two<00:04:20.239> intervals<00:04:20.570> on<00:04:20.750> really

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
training camps two intervals on really

training camps two intervals on really
really<00:04:21.229> steep<00:04:21.410> hills<00:04:21.650> because<00:04:22.160> that's<00:04:22.340> my

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
really steep hills because that's my

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.719 
really steep hills because that's my
other<00:04:22.820> weakness<00:04:23.180> is<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.750> hill<00:04:23.900> climb<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:25.460> so

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
other weakness is the hill climb but so

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.550 
other weakness is the hill climb but so
it<00:04:26.180> remains<00:04:26.479> to<00:04:26.630> be<00:04:26.660> seen<00:04:26.780> if<00:04:27.139> that<00:04:27.320> works

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
it remains to be seen if that works
