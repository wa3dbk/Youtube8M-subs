00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.540
 thank you very much, good afternoon 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.519
 effectively already many chains of 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.710
 supermarkets small merchants will 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.590
 prepare for the placement of 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.290
 prices that will come into effect on the day 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.900
 Monday according to the decree of the president of 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.880
 the Republic Juan Carlos Varela with the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.460
 signature of the price control decree 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.009
 to 22 products of the basic basket that 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.900
 it will be the first of July this time 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.089
 We visited the supermarket chain on 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.759
 king where since this Friday already 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.210
 placed on prices regulated by 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.400
 the national government this is an effort 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.590
 which it requires solidarity of all 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.930
 parts of the supply chain 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.780
 it comes from the supplier us as 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.910
 the intermediaries and finally the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.160
 consumer everyone has had to 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.780
 make some kind of contribution in this for 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.330
 be able to reach the prices that the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.070
 government has fixed the products are 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.500
 regulated not only in prices but 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.820
 in profit margin that is to say 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.100
 understands that the products that are 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.290
 within that category they also have 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.210
 a profit cap so on that 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.400
 meaning then it is very transparent to 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.110
 we know exactly how much 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.140
 we can win in each of these 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.690
 categories and it is our duty to fulfill 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.090
 with the price set at least 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.580
 one of the products in that category of 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.440
 agreement with decree number 165 will be 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.570
 the consumer protection authority 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.520
 and defense of competition which 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.620
 will execute and watch over the faithful 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.150
 compliance with this provision as well 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.040
 as well as the application of 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.080
 sanctions for those who infringe this 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.330
 norm for example we have the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.600

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.210
