00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
be dope sticks and I got a medium range

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.080 
be dope sticks and I got a medium range
because<00:03:01.959> i<00:03:01.989> feel<00:03:02.260> like<00:03:02.470> uh<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.730> know<00:03:03.850> whatever

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
because i feel like uh you know whatever

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.940 
because i feel like uh you know whatever
you're<00:03:04.360> using<00:03:04.390> for<00:03:04.959> more<00:03:05.350> accuracy<00:03:05.650> there

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
you're using for more accuracy there

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.320 
you're using for more accuracy there
should<00:03:06.070> be<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> little<00:03:06.519> higher<00:03:06.790> than<00:03:06.970> shorter

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
should be a little higher than shorter

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.840 
should be a little higher than shorter
so<00:03:07.750> yeah<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.320> a<00:03:08.350> stilt<00:03:08.800> here<00:03:09.580> now<00:03:09.760> I'm

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
so yeah this is a stilt here now I'm

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.640 
so yeah this is a stilt here now I'm
going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.060> show<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.239> what<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.720> regular<00:03:10.989> spell<00:03:11.530> I

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
going to show you what a regular spell I

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.140 
going to show you what a regular spell I
mean<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.890> regular<00:03:12.190> control<00:03:12.519> looks<00:03:12.730> like<00:03:12.880> and

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
mean a regular control looks like and

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.310 
mean a regular control looks like and
what<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.940> step<00:03:15.940> looks<00:03:16.420> like<00:03:16.600> for<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.019> hell

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
what a step looks like for the hell

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.170 
what a step looks like for the hell
darkens<00:03:17.799> in<00:03:17.920> comparison<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.060> a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
darkens in comparison so this is a

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.699 
darkens in comparison so this is a
regular<00:03:19.480> xbox<00:03:19.840> controller<00:03:20.410> right<00:03:20.530> here

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
regular xbox controller right here

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.770 
regular xbox controller right here
typically<00:03:21.519> half<00:03:21.730> that's<00:03:21.970> not<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.180> xbox<00:03:22.510> one

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
typically half that's not the xbox one

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.080 
typically half that's not the xbox one
looks<00:03:23.049> now<00:03:24.040> look<00:03:24.280> how<00:03:24.370> much<00:03:24.580> darker<00:03:24.820> that

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
looks now look how much darker that

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.990 
looks now look how much darker that
number<00:03:25.390> just<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.200> much<00:03:26.410> more<00:03:26.470> sleep<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.850> this

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
number just so much more sleep so this

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.190 
number just so much more sleep so this
is<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.180> difference<00:03:28.480> between<00:03:28.510> felt<00:03:28.959> something

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
is the difference between felt something

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.460 
is the difference between felt something
right<00:03:29.320> now<00:03:29.440> in<00:03:30.400> my<00:03:30.549> opinion<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:31.030> like<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:32.410> one

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
right now in my opinion I like this one

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.020 
right now in my opinion I like this one
here<00:03:32.680> more<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.430> rumble<00:03:33.700> pack<00:03:33.850> as

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
here more to that the rumble pack as

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.360
