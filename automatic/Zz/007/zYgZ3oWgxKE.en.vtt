00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
Lebon I thought also from the Bible both

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.050 
Lebon I thought also from the Bible both
are<00:01:07.619> actually<00:01:07.770> from<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> book<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.430> Joe<00:01:08.670> I

creatures<00:01:12.840> well<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.740> thought<00:01:13.979> was<00:01:14.100> kind<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
