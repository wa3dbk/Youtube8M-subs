00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
frozen in the freezer those work

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.050 
frozen in the freezer those work
beautifully<00:02:17.980> definitely<00:02:18.980> use<00:02:19.130> those<00:02:19.400> at<00:02:19.850> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
beautifully definitely use those at the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.050 
beautifully definitely use those at the
culinary<00:02:20.480> school<00:02:20.750> here<00:02:21.020> we<00:02:21.260> use<00:02:22.060> ice-cream

culinary school here we use ice-cream

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.120 
culinary school here we use ice-cream
machines<00:02:23.390> with<00:02:23.570> compressors<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.500> they<00:02:24.710> get<00:02:24.860> a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
machines with compressors so they get a

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.910 
machines with compressors so they get a
little<00:02:25.490> colder<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.210> you<00:02:27.140> have<00:02:27.350> absolutely<00:02:27.770> no

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
little colder and you have absolutely no

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.440 
little colder and you have absolutely no
reason<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.310> freeze<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.790> base<00:02:28.940> because<00:02:29.300> they

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
reason to freeze the base because they

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.560 
reason to freeze the base because they
have<00:02:29.570> their<00:02:29.720> own<00:02:29.750> compressor<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.270> think<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.390> lost

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
have their own compressor I think I lost

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.660 
have their own compressor I think I lost
count<00:02:32.840> here<00:02:33.110> because<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.320> was<00:02:33.440> talking<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.130> think

count here because I was talking I think

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:44.590 
count here because I was talking I think
we're<00:02:35.060> on<00:02:35.180> egg<00:02:35.620> five<00:02:36.620> one<00:02:37.520> more<00:02:37.730> 2x6<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:44.390> my

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
bring this to a scald right under a boil

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.179 
bring this to a scald right under a boil
so<00:04:45.740> we<00:04:46.129> are<00:04:46.280> talking<00:04:46.669> about<00:04:47.289> 190<00:04:48.289> degrees<00:04:48.590> 180

00:04:49.179 --> 00:04:49.189 
so we are talking about 190 degrees 180

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.469 
so we are talking about 190 degrees 180
degrees<00:04:49.550> somewhere<00:04:49.909> around<00:04:49.969> there<00:04:50.300> right

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
degrees somewhere around there right

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.659 
degrees somewhere around there right
below<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.139> boil<00:04:51.439> the<00:04:51.889> way<00:04:52.009> you<00:04:52.069> can<00:04:52.310> tell<00:04:52.460> when

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
hot enough a little skin will form on

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.920 
hot enough a little skin will form on
the<00:04:57.800> top<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.460> you'll<00:04:59.180> see<00:04:59.360> bubbles<00:04:59.719> right
