quick easy dirty way to do it is take

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.840 
quick easy dirty way to do it is take
your<00:01:07.410> yarn<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:10.340> strand<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.460> yarn<00:01:11.580> and

your yarn just like strand of yarn and
just<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:13.980> own<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.550> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
just so this is your own and just you

just so this is your own and just you
know<00:01:15.180> fold<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.930> half<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.940> then<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.060> have

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
know fold it in half and then you have

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.400 
know fold it in half and then you have
with<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.630> loop<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.170> you're<00:01:19.290> holding

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
with a little loop that you're holding

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.310 
with a little loop that you're holding
together<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.040> fingers<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.080> knit

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
together with your fingers and just knit

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.500 
together with your fingers and just knit
that<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.590> scarf<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.820> i<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> i

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
that in to your scarf the way i do it i

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.780 
that in to your scarf the way i do it i
find<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> keeps<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:29.010> fabric<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.580> little

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
find that it keeps the fabric a little

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.130 
find that it keeps the fabric a little
bit<00:01:29.910> tighter<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:32.060> make<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.270> slipknot<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
bit tighter is to make a slipknot if you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
bit tighter is to make a slipknot if you
don't<00:01:34.410> know<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:34.710> they're<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.190> easy<00:01:35.240> you

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.100 
take a little bit of this leftover yarn
pinch<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.880> hold<00:02:02.880> both<00:02:03.180> strings<00:02:03.660> with<00:02:03.990> your

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
pinch it hold both strings with your

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.140 
pinch it hold both strings with your
other<00:02:04.200> hand<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.590> pull<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.550> then<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.970> have<00:02:06.120> a

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
other hand and pull and then you have a

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.539 
other hand and pull and then you have a
slipknot<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.960> make<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.340> shorter<00:02:08.340> as

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
slipknot and you can make it shorter as

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.699 
slipknot and you can make it shorter as
you<00:02:08.939> need<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.989> make<00:02:10.140> sure<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.590> know

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you need it just make sure that you know

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.949 
you need it just make sure that you know
you<00:02:10.769> tug<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.150> gets<00:02:12.239> nice<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.480> tight<00:02:12.780> so

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
you tug and it gets nice and tight so

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.090 
you tug and it gets nice and tight so
that's<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.319> way<00:02:13.409> that<00:02:13.439> I<00:02:13.590> do<00:02:13.709> it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
that's the way that I do it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.500 
that's the way that I do it
no<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.400> you're<00:02:14.550> not<00:02:14.760> supposed<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.210> do<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.330> that

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
no if you're not supposed to do it that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.320 
no if you're not supposed to do it that
way<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.160> still<00:02:17.460> does<00:02:17.610> leave<00:02:17.790> an<00:02:17.910> end<00:02:18.090> if

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
way but it still does leave an end if

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.000 
way but it still does leave an end if
you<00:02:18.360> don't<00:02:18.630> know<00:02:18.720> how<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.900> weave<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.590> ends<00:02:19.800> it's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
you don't know how to weave in ends it's

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.940 
you don't know how to weave in ends it's
really<00:02:20.310> easy<00:02:20.490> um<00:02:21.230> I'm<00:02:22.230> sure<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.710> find<00:02:22.740> a

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
the way that I join yarn is I just would

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.710 
the way that I join yarn is I just would
put<00:02:32.600> my<00:02:33.600> needle<00:02:34.410> through<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.100> then<00:02:36.060> knit

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
put my needle through here and then knit

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.880 
put my needle through here and then knit
that<00:02:37.080> loop<00:02:37.440> off<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.960> then<00:02:39.960> take<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.590> long

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
that loop off and then take the long

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.250 
way that that was my my phone buzzing I
don't<00:04:14.610> know<00:04:14.700> if<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.850> heard<00:04:14.970> that<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:16.170> way

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
don't know if you heard that the way

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.570 
don't know if you heard that the way

switch but I carry the yarn along is

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.060 
switch but I carry the yarn along is
that<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:24.240> will<00:04:24.600> make<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.080> twist<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.770> between

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
that it will make a twist in between

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.880 
that it will make a twist in between
your<00:04:26.250> two<00:04:26.430> balls<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:26.790> yarn

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
your two balls of yarn

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.250 
your two balls of yarn
but<00:04:28.890> it's<00:04:29.100> really<00:04:29.340> not<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:29.640> annoying<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.390> if

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260
