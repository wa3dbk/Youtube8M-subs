00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
in forever anyway so that's pretty much

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.100 
in forever anyway so that's pretty much
it<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> had<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.680> clay<00:01:19.979> details<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> front

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
it I had it on clay details in the front

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
it I had it on clay details in the front
to<00:01:22.110> give<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:25.430> curved<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.640> feature

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to give it the more curved in feature

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
to give it the more curved in feature
like<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> could<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.650> done<00:01:28.770> it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
like I don't know I could have done it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.560 
like I don't know I could have done it
with<00:01:28.979> Lego<00:01:29.130> bricks

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
with Lego bricks

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.330 
with Lego bricks
so<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> decided<00:01:30.869> clay<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.979> why<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.159> looks<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
so I decided clay that's why it looks a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.420 
so I decided clay that's why it looks a
little<00:01:32.400> later<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.829> also<00:01:35.189> added

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
little later right here and I also added

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
little later right here and I also added
the<00:01:35.579> bladder<00:01:35.820> with<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> Mario<00:01:36.570> symbol<00:01:37.259> why

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the bladder with the Mario symbol why

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.510 
the bladder with the Mario symbol why
does<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:37.950> look<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.400> weird<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.530> lit<00:01:41.340> up

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
does that look so weird so lit up

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.020 
does that look so weird so lit up
whatever<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:43.070> yeah<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.310> add<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> glider<00:01:44.700> and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
