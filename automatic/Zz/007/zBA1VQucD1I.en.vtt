00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.429
 the ingredients you need for 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.910
 make this grapefruit recipe 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.799
 candied 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.270
 so these are grapefruits not 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.210
 treated liters of water 2 kg of sugar 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.619
 Picnic grapefruit by dipping 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.500
 our fans and we'll leave them like that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.080
 24 hours of throats and we will change one 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.520
 time the water is then went 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.530
 recover and bleach them in the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.160
 start cold water and let's leave 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.800
 white and about 10 minutes 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.520
 so there we prepared our syrup so 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.460
 time yet to two liters of water and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.500
 2 kg of sugar and the confection is going 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.149
 achieve 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.140
 because every time we go re 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 densify the syrup with sugar 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:03.420
 we will recover the grapefruit 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 where we are going to cut our grapefruit and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 the facts alleged in the syrup a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.869
 thirty minutes to shudder and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.299
 we add a weight on them 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.229
 well emerged and there they will be blamed 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.990
 thirty minutes 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.320
 we have them 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.280
 so put in the fridge for 24 hours 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.210
 immerse completely in the syrup that 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.200
 is of course cold we go out we recover 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.430
 the grapefruit that starts to be 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.729
 already nicely candied and we will recover 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.950
 the syrup in which we will add 500 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.470
 g sugar again and then we go on the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.450
 pour on grapefruit syrup 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.130
 boiling and again we will put in 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.950
 fresh so we renew the operation 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.390
 three times once realize it 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.250
 confectioning the grapefruits always the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.479
 leave in immersion in the syrup to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.369
 the air shelter of course for easter and 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.799
 bacterial development and that's true 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.350
 that can be kept cool more than one 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.399
 months without problems because there will be 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.740
 no bacterial development 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.780
 it can be used with a terrine or 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.030
 a game a bit strong something that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.470
 has character in any case if we propose 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.700
 with a salty preparation it is necessary 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.229
 add a little fleur de sel which is 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.989
 not at all embarrassing to have this contrast 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.729
 sweet salty a little flower of salt that 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.380
 is going to be crunchy under the tooth and what 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.180
 is interesting in cutting a slice 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.650
 like these simply it's from 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.880
 can use this pulp also from 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.970
 taste this pub which is very very good 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.970
 as well
