00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.370
 hello everybody, good night, I'm a doctor, Moses. 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.190
 john rock aquino slippers January right 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.619
 and it's going to happen again, Mom, I'm going 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.260
 Let me explain some things. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.080
 clarify some doubts about the world 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.480
 plastic surgery by videos in the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.029
 taking this question if they 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.070
 Can you send me a mother, she asked me a question about 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.019
 prisoners or specific questions about 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.920
 this or that scene since the person is going 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.800
 do because that is not possible is 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.350
 answer a medical consultation is and I 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.649
 I separated some themes to talk about it 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.989
 For you a home today, I'll tell 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.170
 This first week I'm going to tell 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.449
 about pros and cons that together with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 your inspiration is one of the surgeries 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.800
 one of the two most 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.010
 carried out worldwide is between the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.079
 early afternoon, this is not ours 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.539
 first week i'll start explaining 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.360
 A little while showing you the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.030
 difference between smoking models 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.030
 between models and formats the next 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.340
 50 points while the timbu will be 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.060
 there are three more models of proof 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.420
 different in the market and three models 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.930
 different in the form of texture of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.500
 projection I try again because a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.759
 little of everything for you 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.670
 essentially I'll talk to you then 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.900
 the three most common models of prosthesis 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.900
 of silicone 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.090
 the round prosthesis it has a format 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.659
 round 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.130
 profile is r in the world 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.439
 another prosthesis is doubt 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.520
 I'll also tell you to show it to me. 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.509
 you too 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 after communicating she remembered the cone 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.979
 looks at her profile with a cough with 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.080
 My friend, she's on my side and I'm going to talk. 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.840
 to show you too 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.970
 the prosthesis into account it resembles a 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.970
 plant picks her profile aside 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.960
 this one is not really a prosthesis 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.850
 this is the meter that is one is equal 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.070
 we use drugs to 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.810
 test the size the patient looks like 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.890
 that appropriate minimum size 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.510
 people call in the pre-operative consultation 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.120
 This one is close to the first one. 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.080
 according to this here is a meter of the world 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.530
 this here where the conic then the most 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.840
 once a round prosthesis next to 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.080
 a tectonic plate you can note 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.080
 the difference 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:02.090
 side by side 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.070
 this aspect here in the iconic prosthesis he 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.780
 gives a little higher credit 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.370
 in that pole more to the attack against thinks 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.830
 different from the round one that some 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.850
 patient attended is expelled lost here 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.160
 a fully independent patient in the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.860
 Drop glue happen when the prosthesis 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.110
 the patient she goes there 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.770
 here she will fill more the part 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.690
 bottom 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.870
 we usually say that the next wave 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.510
 is a good superior proof 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.290
 it has its format here it fills O 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.459
 quite the upper part of the breast is well 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.650
 It was full so slowly and the next is 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.630
 a proof of how a doctor largely 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.880
 of the volume of waste is concentrated in the 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.340
 prosthesis center 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.950
 the center of the prosthesis is where the party who 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.140
 is more focused and the next account 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.500
 that most of the flight said he 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.320
 when it is concentrated on the basis of it 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.030
 on the bottom 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.370
 So that's it today if you understand a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.400
 I'm just a little 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.250
 the next round that produces it 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.860
 more than 90 and 95 percent of the 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.599
 Surgeries performed on people 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.269
 patients had no car to use 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.250
 products in lyon after the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.169
 to get close to the time I really like it 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.320
 cloud model has already spoken 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.020
 it is possible to provide professional after 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.180
 patient outcomes and give 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.919
 result machines near but with greater 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.120
 projection on next next lap more 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.120
 discreet and the next
