00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.380 
small cloud there and then just glue
that<00:02:06.759> onto<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.590> bigger<00:02:08.920> mobile<00:02:09.429> piece<00:02:09.820> and<00:02:10.209> if

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
that onto the bigger mobile piece and if

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.440 
that onto the bigger mobile piece and if
you<00:02:10.509> do<00:02:10.660> one<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.470> each<00:02:11.950> side<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.820> get<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.000> really

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
you do one on each side you get a really

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.569 
you do one on each side you get a really
good<00:02:13.630> 3d<00:02:14.620> effect<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.010> don't<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.370> do<00:02:15.489> them

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
good 3d effect you don't have to do them

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.250 
good 3d effect you don't have to do them
on<00:02:15.730> each<00:02:16.030> side<00:02:16.299> just<00:02:16.480> do<00:02:16.570> them<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.780> one<00:02:16.989> but<00:02:17.170> it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
on each side just do them on one but it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.170 
on each side just do them on one but it
makes<00:02:17.500> it<00:02:17.590> really<00:02:17.739> 3d<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.670> then<00:02:18.760> take<00:02:18.970> some

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
makes it really 3d and then take some

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.479 
makes it really 3d and then take some
sticky<00:02:19.810> tack<00:02:20.139> and<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.470> sharp<00:02:20.769> pencil<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.340> just

each of your mobile pieces both sides
you'll<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.130> something<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:09.420> looks<00:03:09.750> like

you'll have something that looks like

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.350 
you'll have something that looks like
that<00:03:10.860> look<00:03:11.610> at<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.030> see<00:03:12.120> what<00:03:12.240> I've<00:03:12.330> done

that look at that and see what I've done

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.390 
that look at that and see what I've done
here<00:03:12.570> I've<00:03:12.660> added<00:03:12.780> on<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.230> some<00:03:13.740> more<00:03:13.950> details

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
here I've added on on some more details

here I've added on on some more details
put<00:03:14.610> some<00:03:14.760> shading<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.960> bottom<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.350> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
put some shading in the bottom of the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.340 
put some shading in the bottom of the
cloud<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.920> some<00:03:17.490> light<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.750> top<00:03:18.960> edge<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
cloud and some light the top edge of the

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.310 
cloud and some light the top edge of the
cloud<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.890> I've<00:03:20.250> even<00:03:20.370> threaded<00:03:21.270> some<00:03:21.810> cotton

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
cloud and I've even threaded some cotton

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.380 
cloud and I've even threaded some cotton
and<00:03:22.350> again<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.220> thread<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.640> cotton<00:03:23.970> onto

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
and again you thread the cotton onto

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.650 
and again you thread the cotton onto
each<00:03:24.600> piece<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.170> then<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:25.710> just<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.070> case<00:03:26.310> of

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
each piece and then it's just a case of

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.320 
each piece and then it's just a case of
deciding<00:03:27.660> an<00:03:27.870> order<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.610> arrange<00:03:29.730> them<00:03:30.180> in

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
deciding an order and arrange them in

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.910 
deciding an order and arrange them in
the<00:03:30.510> order<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.959> then<00:03:31.230> tie<00:03:31.470> them<00:03:31.590> all<00:03:31.739> together

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the order and then tie them all together

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.060 
the order and then tie them all together
roughly<00:03:32.489> four<00:03:33.450> or<00:03:33.570> five<00:03:33.750> meters<00:03:34.080> apart<00:03:34.350> and

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
roughly four or five meters apart and

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.260 
roughly four or five meters apart and
there<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.580> have<00:03:35.820> your<00:03:36.320> straight<00:03:37.320> down<00:03:37.560> mobile

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
there you have your straight down mobile

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.410 
there you have your straight down mobile
that's<00:03:39.270> blowing<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:41.220> wind<00:03:41.250> look<00:03:42.180> at<00:03:42.300> that

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
that's blowing in the wind look at that

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.170 
that's blowing in the wind look at that
and<00:03:43.110> then<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:43.680> just<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:43.920> case<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.130> hanging<00:03:44.910> it

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
and then it's just a case of hanging it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.229 
and then it's just a case of hanging it
up<00:03:45.330> or<00:03:45.540> better<00:03:46.440> still<00:03:46.640> get<00:03:47.640> someone<00:03:48.000> else<00:03:48.150> to
