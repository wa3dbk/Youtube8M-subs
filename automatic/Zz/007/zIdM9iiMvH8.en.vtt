00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.560
 cirillo 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.169
 ap a judge 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.679
 other than a game of questions and answers that develops in a 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.210
 television show 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.380
 we will be one of the participants of the game 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.350
 day day with friends or against the console itself 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.000
 we will try to win something 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.150
 do not take our home the most peace 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.480
 for this we have to go answering correctly the questions that we 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.200
 raise 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.190
 but we also have to be quick since we will get more money if we are the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.010
 first to choose that option 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.160
 between each round of questions we will defend the possibility of turning 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.670
 Orlov the resource roulette in it we can double our money 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.000
 exchange them with other players comment our highs you can live 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.899
 is an exciting point that gives some randomness to the game in it that 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.340
 you'll have to generate some luck in roulette ok you could lose 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.070
 all rounds of questions from the two players with the most money are 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.290
 will face in the final round where the first player who warns will win 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.100
 correctly five questions 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.210
 it is to be thankful for the dubbing of the Spanish derby the presenter of the program 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.619
 this makes the cross the fashion rather the atmosphere of a television contest 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.700
 although it is also true that his vocabulary is reduced to a few 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.500
 phrases another detail in favor of fire is the inclusion of the mir and that was 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.020
 perfectly in the title 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.210
 we can not only choose one of our thousand to play but also 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.740
 In the public we will see the rest of them that we have stored in 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.900
 nelspruit will use the pointer function of the wii knob to select the 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.920
 response and although most of the round we will simply have to mark 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.749
 reinforces that we want to succeed 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.750
 we will also find another round of questions in which the answers 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.290
 they will remain hidden and we will have to sell arms passing over the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.429
 course 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.779
 even though these rounds try to influence variety of the game form 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.549
 end up giving away freely what we see in normal mode 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.270
 It would have been better to include some questions based on images lived 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.430
 with music for example it would have also been appreciated some other way in 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.480
 the style rounds will pass pump ok time trial that we find in others 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.849
 titles of this genre as it goes 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.870
 we are facing a title oriented without doubt to the multiplayer mode despite 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.540
 be able to play not individually and even if it does not reach the quality of other titles 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.730
 of this format 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.789
 It is a good option for holders of a 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.239
 and distinction offers us today's hours 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.239
 me with friends reasonable way nor the deputies 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.279
 it was rather division
