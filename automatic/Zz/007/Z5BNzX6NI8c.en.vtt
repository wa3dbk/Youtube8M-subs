make it into a single speed we advise
we're<00:02:08.239> going<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.479> be<00:02:09.129> breaking<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.250> chain

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
we're going to be breaking the chain

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.850 
we're going to be breaking the chain
with<00:02:10.700> your<00:02:10.879> little<00:02:11.030> chain<00:02:11.360> breaker

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
just pick another spot on the chain to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.180 
just pick another spot on the chain to
actually<00:02:17.270> detach

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
actually detach

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.530

brake and the reason I'm I breaking that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.380 
brake and the reason I'm I breaking that
is<00:02:24.720> when<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.810> get<00:02:25.960> back<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.980> the

there<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.200> go<00:02:35.380> broken<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.100> little<00:02:36.370> chain<00:02:37.350> so

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
there you go broken the little chain so

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.470 
there you go broken the little chain so
now<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.530> won't<00:02:38.800> like<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.100> chain<00:02:39.480> not

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
now you won't like the chain not

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.530 
now you won't like the chain not
completely<00:02:40.990> hard<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.950> let<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.580> chain<00:02:42.850> wrap

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
completely hard but let the chain wrap

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.660 
completely hard but let the chain wrap
around<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.020> sprocket<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:44.770> and<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.460> front

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670

you're going to take the derailleur off
and<00:02:54.960> what<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.110> broke<00:02:56.710> into<00:02:56.920> Raylan<00:02:57.310> are<00:02:57.490> in

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
and what you broke into Raylan are in

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.880 
and what you broke into Raylan are in
your<00:02:57.850> back<00:02:58.000> pocket<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:58.810> now<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.260> need<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.620> pick

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
your back pocket so now you need to pick

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.790 
your back pocket so now you need to pick
a<00:03:00.100> sprocket<00:03:00.840> now<00:03:01.840> if<00:03:02.020> you've<00:03:02.170> got<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.440> three

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
a sprocket now if you've got a three

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.830 
a sprocket now if you've got a three
chain<00:03:03.100> ring<00:03:03.310> front<00:03:03.700> blade<00:03:03.910> you're<00:03:04.630> going<00:03:04.780> to

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
chain ring front blade you're going to

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.200 
chain ring front blade you're going to
pick<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.110> middle<00:03:05.410> chaining<00:03:05.860> if<00:03:06.220> you've<00:03:07.060> got

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
pick the middle chaining if you've got

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.790 
pick the middle chaining if you've got
ten<00:03:07.450> gears<00:03:07.690> in<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.080> back<00:03:08.290> you're<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.680> to

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
ten gears in the back you're going to

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.620 
ten gears in the back you're going to
pick<00:03:09.010> somewhere<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.730> middle<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.270> it<00:03:10.300> sort

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
pick somewhere in the middle so it sort

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.660 
pick somewhere in the middle so it sort
of<00:03:10.690> between<00:03:10.870> your<00:03:11.290> fourth<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.250> sixth

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
of between your fourth and sixth

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.940 
of between your fourth and sixth
sprockets<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.780> there<00:03:14.020> that<00:03:14.440> would<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.770> your

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
sprockets so there that would be your

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.740 
sprockets so there that would be your
foot<00:03:15.250> sprocket<00:03:15.700> day<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.270> what<00:03:16.450> I'll<00:03:16.570> suggest

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
foot sprocket day so what I'll suggest

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.300 
foot sprocket day so what I'll suggest
is<00:03:17.140> come<00:03:17.350> one<00:03:17.530> down<00:03:19.950> bring<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.070> chain

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
is come one down bring the chain

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.400 
is come one down bring the chain
together<00:03:21.540> because<00:03:22.540> now<00:03:22.720> we've<00:03:22.930> got<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.230> break

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
together because now we've got to break

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.530 
together because now we've got to break
the<00:03:23.440> chain<00:03:23.770> again<00:03:24.040> because<00:03:24.940> we<00:03:24.970> need<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.330> break

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
the chain again because we need to break

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.530 
the chain again because we need to break
the<00:03:25.720> chain<00:03:25.989> in<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.320> way<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.980> it's<00:03:27.540> maximizing

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
the chain in a way that it's maximizing

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.660 
the chain in a way that it's maximizing
on<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.780> tension<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.830> what<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.130> want<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.400> do<00:03:30.550> is

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
on the tension so what you want to do is

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.479 
on the tension so what you want to do is
keep<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.630> that's<00:03:31.840> full<00:03:32.050> tension<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:33.250> keep

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
keep it so that's full tension so keep

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.720 
keep it so that's full tension so keep
it<00:03:33.640> as<00:03:33.730> sort<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.209> link<00:03:35.310> break<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.489> on<00:03:36.580> that

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
it as sort of to link break it on that

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.000 
it as sort of to link break it on that
second<00:03:37.150> link<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.690> looks<00:03:37.930> like<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.590> supple

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
second link so it looks like the supple

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.430 
second link so it looks like the supple
as<00:03:39.130> this<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:40.360> put<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.810> on<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.020> small<00:03:41.290> one

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
as this is so put this on the small one

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.020 
as this is so put this on the small one
for<00:03:41.620> now<00:03:41.800> just<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.370> that<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:42.670> can<00:03:42.850> actually

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
for now just so that you can actually

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.110 
for now just so that you can actually
join<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.600> chain<00:03:44.370> ok<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.640> got<00:03:45.790> your<00:03:45.820> quick

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
join the chain ok so you got your quick

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.199 
join the chain ok so you got your quick
link<00:03:47.100> again<00:03:48.100> in<00:03:48.340> certain<00:03:48.850> on<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:48.970> one<00:03:49.180> side

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
link again in certain on the one side

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.370 
link again in certain on the one side
and<00:03:49.750> set<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.860> opposite<00:03:51.459> side<00:03:52.380> bring

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
and set it to the opposite side bring

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.430 
and set it to the opposite side bring
the<00:03:53.500> two<00:03:53.680> together<00:03:53.830> quick<00:03:54.670> link<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:56.230> now

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
the two together quick link is in so now

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.290 
the two together quick link is in so now
you<00:03:56.500> can<00:03:56.800> pedal<00:03:57.160> but<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.430> can<00:03:57.610> see<00:03:57.820> obviously

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
you can pedal but you can see obviously

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.780 
you can pedal but you can see obviously
you're<00:03:58.630> Chinese<00:03:59.110> very<00:03:59.410> very<00:03:59.650> subtle<00:04:00.010> so<00:04:00.610> what

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
you're Chinese very very subtle so what

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.330 
you're Chinese very very subtle so what
you<00:04:00.910> need<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.269> do<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.660> just<00:04:01.690> carefully<00:04:02.440> push

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
you need to do is just carefully push

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.740 
you need to do is just carefully push
with<00:04:03.519> your<00:04:03.550> finger<00:04:03.970> while<00:04:04.150> you're<00:04:04.360> pedaling

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
with your finger while you're pedaling

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.970 
with your finger while you're pedaling
and<00:04:04.900> go<00:04:05.680> into<00:04:06.070> one<00:04:06.760> bigger<00:04:07.060> gear<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.560> if<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.800> go

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
and go into one bigger gear so if you go

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.729 
and go into one bigger gear so if you go
one<00:04:09.220> bigger<00:04:09.519> gear<00:04:09.880> so<00:04:10.300> see<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:12.420> there<00:04:13.420> you<00:04:13.510> go

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
one bigger gear so see you there you go

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.409 
one bigger gear so see you there you go
so<00:04:14.739> all<00:04:14.950> my<00:04:15.400> finger<00:04:15.730> was<00:04:15.850> acting<00:04:16.269> like<00:04:16.359> a

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
so all my finger was acting like a

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.870 
so all my finger was acting like a
derailleur<00:04:16.900> does<00:04:17.310> while<00:04:18.310> you're<00:04:18.489> pedaling

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
derailleur does while you're pedaling

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.000 
derailleur does while you're pedaling
move<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.540> chain<00:04:19.810> up<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.200> you'll<00:04:20.560> see<00:04:20.769> now<00:04:20.950> the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
move the chain up and you'll see now the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.970 
move the chain up and you'll see now the
chain<00:04:21.370> has<00:04:21.400> full<00:04:22.300> tension<00:04:22.620> Shawn's<00:04:23.620> on<00:04:23.860> a

chain has full tension Shawn's on a
triple<00:04:24.430> chain<00:04:24.640> ring<00:04:24.820> we'd<00:04:25.060> run<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.480> middle

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
triple chain ring we'd run the middle

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.050 
triple chain ring we'd run the middle
one<00:04:25.870> on<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.169> double<00:04:26.680> unassuming<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.460> small<00:04:27.820> and

You<00:04:33.550> Sean<00:04:33.880> remember<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.540> key<00:04:34.750> here<00:04:35.050> is<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.260> run

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
You Sean remember the key here is to run

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.790 
You Sean remember the key here is to run
the<00:04:35.860> chain<00:04:36.160> as<00:04:36.430> straight<00:04:37.030> as<00:04:37.330> possible

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
the chain as straight as possible

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.860 
the chain as straight as possible
remember<00:04:38.800> each<00:04:39.070> drop<00:04:39.460> art<00:04:39.700> is<00:04:39.940> proprietary<00:04:40.780> to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
remember each drop art is proprietary to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.860 
remember each drop art is proprietary to
that<00:04:41.230> particular<00:04:41.680> brand<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.940> model<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.540> bark

that particular brand and model of bark

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.450 
that particular brand and model of bark
so<00:04:44.140> make<00:04:44.290> sure<00:04:44.320> you've<00:04:44.680> got<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.890> right<00:04:45.040> drop

so make sure you've got the right drop

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.180 
so make sure you've got the right drop
out<00:04:45.640> because<00:04:46.180> chances<00:04:46.990> are<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.590> can't<00:04:47.890> use

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
out because chances are you can't use

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.330 
out because chances are you can't use
somebody<00:04:48.670> else's<00:04:48.870> this<00:04:49.870> is<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.080> skill<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.680> you

somebody else's this is a skill that you

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.400 
somebody else's this is a skill that you
need<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.850> practice<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.570> first<00:04:52.840> time<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.260> do

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
it Sean made it look really easy it's

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.050 
it Sean made it look really easy it's
not<00:04:55.750> quite<00:04:56.230> so<00:04:56.410> easy<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:57.250> first<00:04:57.490> time<00:04:57.730> there's

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
not quite so easy the first time there's

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.850 
not quite so easy the first time there's
a<00:04:58.120> big<00:04:58.180> learning<00:04:58.630> curve<00:04:58.870> but<00:04:59.320> once<00:04:59.680> you've

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
a big learning curve but once you've

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:08.140 
a big learning curve but once you've
done<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.070> once<00:05:00.370> it's<00:05:00.700> a<00:05:00.910> lot<00:05:01.090> easier
