guys<00:00:05.460> this<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.759> matt<00:00:05.940> titantron<00:00:06.450> studio<00:00:07.080> I've

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
guys this is matt titantron studio I've

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.020 
guys this is matt titantron studio I've
got<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> studio<00:00:07.980> update<00:00:08.280> on<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.610> completed

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
got a studio update on a completed

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.730 
got a studio update on a completed
project<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.719> look<00:00:09.840> at<00:00:10.050> what<00:00:10.620> we've

project for you to look at what we've
got<00:00:10.920> here<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:12.090> war<00:00:12.929> machine<00:00:13.110> set<00:00:14.009> it's

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
got here is a war machine set it's

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.160 
got here is a war machine set it's
actually<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.059> war<00:00:15.210> machine<00:00:15.330> import<00:00:15.809> set

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
actually a war machine import set

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.429 
actually a war machine import set
because<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.070> circle<00:00:17.490> ohs<00:00:17.730> burroughs

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
because it's the circle ohs burroughs

village<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.800> has<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> lot<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> really

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
village so this has got a lot of really

village so this has got a lot of really
cool<00:00:24.210> stuff<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.840> we'll<00:00:25.650> start<00:00:25.859> here<00:00:26.039> with

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
cool stuff in it we'll start here with

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.060 
cool stuff in it we'll start here with
the<00:00:26.369> big<00:00:26.580> centerpiece<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.230> Tesla

this<00:00:32.820> but<00:00:32.969> I'm<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.300> ahead<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.540> go

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
this but I'm going to go ahead and go

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.780 
this but I'm going to go ahead and go
over<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> again<00:00:34.430> essentially<00:00:35.430> what's<00:00:35.579> going

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
over it again essentially what's going

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
over it again essentially what's going
on<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> defense<00:00:37.140> system<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.860> the

on is this is a defense system for the
entire<00:00:37.950> village<00:00:38.489> they<00:00:39.480> build<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
entire village they build it and it

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.410 
entire village they build it and it
sends<00:00:40.890> Tesla<00:00:41.640> lightning<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.270> these

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
sends Tesla lightning to all these

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970 
sends Tesla lightning to all these
little<00:00:42.600> defense<00:00:42.960> points<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.440> these<00:00:43.559> village

little defense points on these village

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.420 
little defense points on these village
pieces<00:00:44.510> now<00:00:45.510> what's<00:00:45.719> happened<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:47.010> circle

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430

just<00:01:08.970> completely<00:01:09.860> obliterated<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.640> one

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just completely obliterated it this one

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.250 
just completely obliterated it this one
was<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> little<00:01:12.060> luckier<00:01:12.659> though<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.960> defense

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
was a little luckier though it's defense

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.130 
was a little luckier though it's defense

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
most part the buildings intact now this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.170 
most part the buildings intact now this
one<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> pub<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.640> aptly<00:01:23.640> named<00:01:23.850> the

one the pub which is a aptly named the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.289 
one the pub which is a aptly named the
pub<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:25.189> still<00:01:26.189> an<00:01:26.400> operation<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.180> that's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
pub is still an operation but that's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.940 
pub is still an operation but that's
because<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.659> has<00:01:27.869> its<00:01:28.049> own<00:01:28.259> Tesla<00:01:28.920> generator

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
because it has its own Tesla generator

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.730 
because it has its own Tesla generator
hooked<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.079> defense<00:01:31.380> system

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
hooked on to it so it's defense system

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.380 
hooked on to it so it's defense system
still<00:01:31.950> active<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.369> all<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> blue<00:01:32.729> oso<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
everything then over here you have to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.100 
everything then over here you have to
the<00:01:37.860> villages<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.939> village<00:01:39.720> buildings

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
be turned back on the defense system

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.100 
be turned back on the defense system
with<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.189> down<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.970> see<00:01:48.000> all<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.509> all

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
with it down you can see all these all

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.920 
with it down you can see all these all
these<00:01:49.170> warble<00:01:50.009> claw<00:01:50.700> marks<00:01:51.119> over<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.810> the

these warble claw marks over here on the
stonework<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.340> see<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
stonework and you can see just the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.639 
stonework and you can see just the
