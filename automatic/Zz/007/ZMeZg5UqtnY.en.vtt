00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
product with the with the rough nature

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.679 
product with the with the rough nature
of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.860> motorsport<00:01:56.399> environment<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.450> first

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
of the motorsport environment so first

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.359 
of the motorsport environment so first
of<00:01:57.810> all<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:58.020> fully<00:01:58.229> environmentally<00:01:59.100> sealed

of<00:02:06.869> vibration<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.740> unit<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.399> with

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
of vibration this unit can with

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.520 
of vibration this unit can with
stand<00:02:09.130> without<00:02:09.940> having<00:02:10.479> any<00:02:10.810> impact<00:02:11.319> that's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
stand without having any impact that's

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.430 
stand without having any impact that's
like<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.740> 200<00:02:12.280> mile<00:02:12.460> an<00:02:12.700> hour<00:02:12.819> car<00:02:13.319> hitting<00:02:14.319> a

like a 200 mile an hour car hitting a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.910 
like a 200 mile an hour car hitting a
wall

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
wall

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
wall
we<00:02:15.040> hope<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.220> never<00:02:15.580> happens<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.209> our

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
we hope that never happens with our

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.350 
we hope that never happens with our
product<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:17.770> if<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.100> does<00:02:18.280> our<00:02:18.880> products

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
product but if it does our products

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.110 
product but if it does our products
still<00:02:19.540> going<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.410> survive<00:02:21.100> okay<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.000> then

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
still going to survive okay and then

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.580 
still going to survive okay and then
let's<00:02:22.330> talk<00:02:22.450> about<00:02:22.720> some<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.560> know

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
let's talk about some of the you know

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.750 
let's talk about some of the you know
features<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.490> on<00:02:24.640> there

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
features that you have on there

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.100 
features that you have on there
obviously<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.240> have<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.570> lights<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:26.020> go

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
obviously you have the lights that go

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.050 
obviously you have the lights that go
across<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.470> top<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.160> those<00:02:27.250> are<00:02:27.400> for<00:02:27.700> warning

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
across the top and those are for warning

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.090 
across the top and those are for warning
well<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:28.870> have<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.320> that's<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.560> progressive

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
well we have so that's a progressive

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.740 
well we have so that's a progressive
shift<00:02:30.340> light<00:02:30.580> as<00:02:30.910> well<00:02:31.090> as<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.360> warning

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
shift light as well as a warning

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.979 
shift light as well as a warning
indication<00:02:32.560> system<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.910> there<00:02:34.209> are<00:02:34.360> multiple

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
indication system so there are multiple

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.570 
indication system so there are multiple
ways<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.170> we're<00:02:35.709> going<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.950> signal<00:02:36.430> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
ways that we're going to signal the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.130 
ways that we're going to signal the
driver<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.209> there's<00:02:37.420> something<00:02:37.630> going<00:02:37.900> on

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
driver that there's something going on

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.680 
driver that there's something going on
with<00:02:38.200> their<00:02:38.560> car<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.459> could<00:02:39.730> be<00:02:39.910> through<00:02:40.209> LED

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
with their car that could be through LED

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.800 
with their car that could be through LED
indicators<00:02:41.440> we<00:02:41.950> also<00:02:42.160> have<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.790> set<00:02:43.300> up<00:02:43.330> where

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
indicators we also have it set up where

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.040 
indicators we also have it set up where
the<00:02:44.680> screen<00:02:45.010> itself<00:02:45.400> will<00:02:45.790> display<00:02:46.390> messages

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
the screen itself will display messages

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.350 
the screen itself will display messages
and<00:02:47.800> because<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.130> our<00:02:48.340> telemetry<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.060> other

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
and because of our telemetry and other

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.290 
and because of our telemetry and other
experience<00:02:50.140> for<00:02:50.830> racing<00:02:51.400> sanctioning<00:02:51.940> bodies

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
experience for racing sanctioning bodies

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.930 
experience for racing sanctioning bodies
we'll<00:02:52.510> be<00:02:52.780> able<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.110> display<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:54.010> yellow<00:02:54.580> light

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
we'll be able to display a yellow light

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.990 
we'll be able to display a yellow light
warning<00:02:55.630> item<00:02:56.260> across<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.220> screen<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:57.850> the
