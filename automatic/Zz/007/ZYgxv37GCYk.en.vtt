when I first add the time clock effect
to<00:01:16.560> my<00:01:16.680> clip<00:01:16.979> you'll<00:01:17.430> notice<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.090> can

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to my clip you'll notice that you can

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
to my clip you'll notice that you can
see<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> timer<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> background<00:01:19.979> has

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
see the timer but the background has

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
see the timer but the background has
turned<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> solid<00:01:21.270> black<00:01:21.479> we'll<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.560> ahead

turned to a solid black we'll go ahead

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.700 
turned to a solid black we'll go ahead
and<00:01:22.979> open<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> effect<00:01:23.939> controls<00:01:24.530> uncheck<00:01:25.530> the

time<00:02:21.410> clock

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
time clock

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.240 
time clock
I<00:02:22.010> think<00:02:22.790> ticker<00:02:23.060> looks<00:02:23.390> pretty<00:02:23.690> good<00:02:23.870> right

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
I think ticker looks pretty good right

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.370 
I think ticker looks pretty good right
now<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.490> clock<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.120> overlaid<00:02:26.630> directly<00:02:27.260> on

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
now the clock is overlaid directly on

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.830 
now the clock is overlaid directly on
the<00:02:27.530> video<00:02:27.800> but<00:02:28.550> as<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.850> start<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.240> increase<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
the video but as I start to increase the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.450 
the video but as I start to increase the
background<00:02:30.290> control<00:02:30.710> you'll<00:02:31.130> see<00:02:31.430> a

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
background control you'll see a

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.060 
background control you'll see a
background<00:02:32.000> become<00:02:32.330> visible<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.990> want<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:33.980> to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
background become visible I want it to

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.890 
background become visible I want it to
be<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> little<00:02:34.490> transparent<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:35.570> I'll<00:02:35.720> leave

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
be a little transparent so I'll leave

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.730 
be a little transparent so I'll leave
that<00:02:35.930> set<00:02:36.440> at<00:02:36.620> about<00:02:36.980> 75<00:02:38.170> now<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.230> clock<00:02:39.560> is

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
that set at about 75 now the clock is

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.250 
that set at about 75 now the clock is
about<00:02:39.860> twice<00:02:40.400> as<00:02:40.640> big<00:02:40.850> as<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.090> want<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.570> be<00:02:41.720> so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
about twice as big as I want it to be so

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.680 
about twice as big as I want it to be so
I'll<00:02:42.440> lower<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.800> size<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.610> I'm<00:02:44.210> going<00:02:44.240> to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
I'll lower the size and I'm going to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.480 
I'll lower the size and I'm going to
move<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.410> it's<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.830> upper<00:02:46.160> left<00:02:46.370> hand

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
move it so it's in the upper left hand

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.350 
move it so it's in the upper left hand
corner<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.200> now<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> really<00:02:48.920> nice

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
corner and now we have a really nice

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.480 
corner and now we have a really nice
professional-looking<00:02:50.360> timer<00:02:51.190> now<00:02:52.190> for<00:02:52.400> this

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
professional-looking timer now for this

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.940 
professional-looking timer now for this
example<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:53.180> was<00:02:53.330> using<00:02:53.570> only<00:02:54.020> one<00:02:54.200> video<00:02:54.440> clip

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
example I was using only one video clip

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.490 
example I was using only one video clip
but<00:02:55.940> what<00:02:56.150> if<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.390> have<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> whole<00:02:56.960> sequence

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
but what if you have a whole sequence

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.340 
but what if you have a whole sequence
that<00:02:57.680> you<00:02:57.830> want<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.160> add<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.310> timer<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:59.000> if<00:02:59.350> I

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
that you want to add a timer to if I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.260 
that you want to add a timer to if I
place<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.770> time<00:03:01.010> clock<00:03:01.310> effect<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:01.910> each

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
place the time clock effect on each

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.020 
place the time clock effect on each
individual<00:03:03.080> clip<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.620> would<00:03:04.370> have<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.640> open<00:03:04.940> the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
individual clip I would have to open the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.180 
individual clip I would have to open the
effect<00:03:05.300> controls<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:05.960> each<00:03:06.140> one<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.770> change

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
effect controls for each one and change

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.520 
effect controls for each one and change
old<00:03:07.520> settings<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.930> would<00:03:09.050> be<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.200> nightmare

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
old settings and it would be a nightmare

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.260 
old settings and it would be a nightmare
to<00:03:09.770> get<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.160> times<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.580> match<00:03:10.730> up<00:03:10.970> between
