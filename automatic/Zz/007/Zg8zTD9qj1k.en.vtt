hi I'm Phil Amadou Leo with ls2 helmets
and<00:00:03.120> this<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:03.990> FFF<00:00:04.350> 386<00:00:05.390> what<00:00:06.390> you're

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
and this is the FFF 386 what you're

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.600 
and this is the FFF 386 what you're
looking<00:00:06.779> at<00:00:06.870> here<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.140> actually<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.830> flip<00:00:08.340> front

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
looking at here is actually a flip front

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.520 
looking at here is actually a flip front
helmet<00:00:09.000> but<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.660> want<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.050> notice<00:00:10.230> how

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
helmet but I want you to notice how

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.129 
helmet but I want you to notice how
aerodynamic<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.519> shell<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.969> how<00:00:12.570> smooth<00:00:12.929> it

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
aerodynamic the shell is how smooth it

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.720 
aerodynamic the shell is how smooth it
is<00:00:13.170> all<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> way<00:00:13.679> around<00:00:13.799> especially<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
is all the way around especially the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.550 
is all the way around especially the
transition<00:00:15.269> from<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> chin<00:00:15.750> bar<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
transition from the chin bar to the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.099 
transition from the chin bar to the
shell<00:00:16.770> itself<00:00:17.510> this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.690> something<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.050> don't

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
shell itself this is something you don't

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.099 
shell itself this is something you don't
typically<00:00:19.470> see<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.920> helmet<00:00:20.100> at<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.369> price

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
typically see in a helmet at this price

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.689 
typically see in a helmet at this price
the<00:00:22.109> button<00:00:22.380> at<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> front<00:00:22.769> has<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:22.949> nice<00:00:23.250> big

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the button at the front has a nice big

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.370 
the button at the front has a nice big
tab<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.420> even<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> heavy<00:00:25.140> winter

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
tab so even if you have a heavy winter

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
tab so even if you have a heavy winter
glove<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:26.039> super<00:00:26.340> easy<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.670> find<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.090> and

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
glove on it's super easy to find it and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.859 
glove on it's super easy to find it and
the<00:00:27.869> action<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.349> ultra<00:00:28.890> smooth<00:00:29.359> it<00:00:30.359> has<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> nice

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the action is ultra smooth it has a nice

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
the action is ultra smooth it has a nice
detent<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> top<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.189> not<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
detent at the top so it's not going to

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.069 
detent at the top so it's not going to
come<00:00:32.700> down<00:00:32.820> when<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.120> don't<00:00:33.239> want<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
come down when you don't want it to and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.170 
come down when you don't want it to and
you'll<00:00:34.710> notice<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> hooks<00:00:35.489> are<00:00:35.610> metal

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
you'll notice that the hooks are metal

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.479 
you'll notice that the hooks are metal
so<00:00:36.899> are<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> hooks<00:00:37.469> underneath<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> chin

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
so are the hooks underneath the chin

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.639 
so are the hooks underneath the chin
it's<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.879> complete<00:00:39.210> metal<00:00:39.629> mechanism<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.379> it's

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
it's a complete metal mechanism so it's

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.310 
it's a complete metal mechanism so it's
very<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.280> secure<00:00:41.730> again<00:00:42.390> more<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.170> you'd

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
very very secure again more like you'd

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
very very secure again more like you'd
find<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.710> high<00:00:44.250> end<00:00:44.489> flip<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:45.030> the

find on a high end flip from the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.069 
find on a high end flip from the
interior<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.010> antibacterial<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
interior on this is antibacterial and it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.380 
interior on this is antibacterial and it
is<00:00:49.200> also<00:00:49.350> odor<00:00:49.710> resistant<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:51.030> fully

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
is also odor resistant it's fully

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.319

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it's a two-stage so you can get extra

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
it's a two-stage so you can get extra
air<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.869> need<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> trigger

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
air if you need it and then the trigger

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.410 
air if you need it and then the trigger
to<00:01:35.280> release<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.820> right<00:01:36.000> here

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
to release it is right here

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.280 
to release it is right here
slide<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.049> closes<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:39.060> chin<00:01:39.329> vent<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.720> also

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
slide it it closes the chin vent is also
