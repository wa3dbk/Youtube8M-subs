00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.540
 I came into the world as a golf ball 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.030
 really for small money and am 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.480
 Certainly not to be envied for the golf ball 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.060
 live full of suffering imprisoned in cardboard 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.450
 the third person takes us to golf 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.149
 With 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.390
 then I will be galvanized with the pen 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:29.029
 because golfer otherwise equal to the golfer link 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.980
 chase me into a hole and punch 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.220
 I still get it in spite of it 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.609
 expectation great one I want a braver 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.969
 golf ball be careful 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.640
 my team of fear tremble my 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.519
 knee then man skin with all skin 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.499
 power and cheers even if he succeeds 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.039
 that I get the full page shot 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.899
 and far into the uncertain fly like me 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.719
 wind me still hurt 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.510
 clap against tree bark 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.879
 Sounds loud clack clack clack 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.390
 I bounce off the trees and fall 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.170
 with a distorted view from 15 meters up 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.240
 chin a long way off loud then cuss 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.610
 you start to look for me 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.009
 I do not feel sad 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.560
 small and creep quickly into the foliage 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.770
 not in there already occurs one 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.159
 on top of me and lift me triumphantly 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.549
 on 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.850
 but instead to maintain me sore care 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.430
 Gently let me grow into the green grass 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.399
 you drop me from above and now 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.259
 popping the earth again 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.850
 that's what these duds call dry 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.090
 the household is unbeatable 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.900
 then I finally land in the hole of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.950
 still human picture I hope 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.850
 a little rest 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.340
 Two fingers come to me 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.490
 I 'm soaked in sweat by the glove 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.700
 a trouser purely forced and tremble there 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.950
 with w and complains of the next 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.649
 merciless blow lying again 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.330
 I on the thie here my heart falters 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.270
 my knee is staggering 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.390
 I silently pray that with all your soul 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.330
 me the rough three miss already brings 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.360
 the inhuman powerful and beating 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.670
 my size out to punishment I do 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.160
 a sentence and a form ladies 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.620
 I'll fly again 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.560
 beaten through the air 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.519
 bad fuck then I end up with a loud 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.900
 place in a meadow from much 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.780
 I hope in vain that filthy 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.330
 honestly not discovered this time yet 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.480
 already the thing begins to circle 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.720
 the awful seven travel and again 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.420
 makes it loudly and throwing skin again 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.510
 he's on me I never do that 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.120
 work right times I complain one put 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.150
 bad times I fly over the fire department 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.700
 I can not get out of Hungary 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.720
 then again I do not hit the hole 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.660
 then not the train then again the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.150
 guilt only ever falls on me 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.690
 human beings are looking for the blame 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.840
 I will be back on the scene already 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.720
 again i get into the area my butt 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.410
 hurts horribly as I from above 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.330
 suddenly lake with tall grass a dense 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.770
 Raff with last power I there 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.160
 again they come looking for me 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.400
 again by consensus curse the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.160
 grass is mercilessly combed and man 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.890
 curses me uninhibited as yet 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.030
 criminals you look for one to me 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.360
 can discover 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.250
 How can I live this jammer because 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.099
 just give it a turn 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.480
 I could tie myself up in both 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.569
 Ticks hide me 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.819
 I dream of a deep dig in 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.790
 that they did not bury themselves 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.970
 in a pool by the fly 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.150
 Seebestattung wars that I'm in dense 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.920
 Variegated foliage where no mushrooms collectors me 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.670
 would find that deliver me from not one 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.670
 graceful gnadentod 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.819
