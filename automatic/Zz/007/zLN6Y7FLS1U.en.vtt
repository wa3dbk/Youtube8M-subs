00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
really don't mind what you want to do I

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.210 
really don't mind what you want to do I
personally<00:01:22.619> was<00:01:22.770> thinking<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.479> something

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
personally was thinking to do something

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.429 
personally was thinking to do something
virago<00:01:26.220> II<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:27.180> start<00:01:27.479> off<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.810> virago<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
virago II like start off with virago and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.960 
virago II like start off with virago and
then<00:01:28.530> maybe<00:01:28.710> move<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.220> next<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.549> frog<00:01:29.820> or

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
then maybe move to next a frog or

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.690 
then maybe move to next a frog or
doesn't<00:01:30.270> go<00:01:30.450> too<00:01:30.509> well<00:01:31.250> mainly<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
doesn't go too well mainly because I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.640 
doesn't go too well mainly because I
think<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.210> lot<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.450> people<00:01:33.570> want<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.200> learn<00:01:34.409> how

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
think a lot of people want to learn how

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.499 
think a lot of people want to learn how
to<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.950> virago<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.150> go<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
to do virago and I think if we go in a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.240 
to do virago and I think if we go in a
mass<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.229> try<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.130> we

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
mass and we can try it out and see if we

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
mass and we can try it out and see if we
can<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> couple<00:01:38.640> kills<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.329> teach<00:01:39.600> people

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
can get a couple kills and teach people

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
can get a couple kills and teach people
out<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> let<00:01:40.590> people<00:01:40.860> mall<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.340> stuff

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
out or do it let people mall and stuff

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.569 
out or do it let people mall and stuff
like<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.810> however<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.310> week

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
like that however if I do it this week

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.249 
like that however if I do it this week
it<00:01:44.790> will<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.909> Greenbaum<00:01:45.540> week<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
it will be Greenbaum week if I do it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.749 
it will be Greenbaum week if I do it
next<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.649> could<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.950> ceilings<00:01:47.369> week<00:01:47.579> which

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
next we could be ceilings week which

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.609 
next we could be ceilings week which
would<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> bit<00:01:48.210> easier<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.380> mass

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
would be a bit easier but in a mass

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.530 
would be a bit easier but in a mass
Greenbaum<00:01:50.189> isn't<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> massive<00:01:51.329> issue

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
Greenbaum isn't really a massive issue

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.469 
Greenbaum isn't really a massive issue
