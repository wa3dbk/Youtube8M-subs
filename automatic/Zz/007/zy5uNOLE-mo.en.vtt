00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
look at I find it interesting that when

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
look at I find it interesting that when
you<00:01:30.360> peel<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.010> color<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.549> of

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
you peel these that the color is kind of

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
you peel these that the color is kind of
gray<00:01:33.090> instead<00:01:33.510> of<00:01:33.720> blue<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.409> kind<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
gray instead of blue what you kind of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.530 
gray instead of blue what you kind of
expect<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.189> blueberries<00:01:35.580> but<00:01:35.939> anyway<00:01:36.240> there

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
expect with blueberries but anyway there

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.910 
expect with blueberries but anyway there
they<00:01:36.720> are

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
they are

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
they are
the<00:01:37.920> pattern<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.460> certainly<00:01:38.820> there<00:01:39.090> except

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the pattern is certainly there except

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:48.280 
the pattern is certainly there except
it's<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.170> faint

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.770

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
seeped into the cracks and made a very

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.500 
seeped into the cracks and made a very
nice<00:02:25.070> spider<00:02:25.460> web<00:02:25.670> pattern<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:26.120> these<00:02:26.240> ones

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
nice spider web pattern on these ones

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.720 
nice spider web pattern on these ones
these<00:02:27.230> ones<00:02:27.290> turned<00:02:27.680> out<00:02:27.800> really<00:02:28.160> good<00:02:28.370> as<00:02:28.580> far

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
these ones turned out really good as far

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.220 
these ones turned out really good as far
as<00:02:29.290> how<00:02:30.290> dark<00:02:30.830> they<00:02:31.040> were<00:02:31.100> that<00:02:31.820> one<00:02:32.270> big<00:02:32.510> black

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
as how dark they were that one big black

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.440 
as how dark they were that one big black
spot<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.860> for<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.130> crack<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.490> egg<00:02:34.760> too<00:02:35.000> much<00:02:35.180> and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
spot is for I crack the egg too much and

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.760 
spot is for I crack the egg too much and
too<00:02:35.600> much<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:35.960> food<00:02:36.140> coloring<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.590> went

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
too much of that food coloring it went

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.080 
too much of that food coloring it went
under<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.100> shell<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.520> I'll<00:02:37.610> be<00:02:37.700> careful<00:02:37.880> with

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
under the shell so I'll be careful with

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.420 
under the shell so I'll be careful with
that<00:02:38.120> now<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> make<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.200> deviled<00:02:39.530> egg<00:02:39.680> spiders

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that now to make the deviled egg spiders

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.090 
that now to make the deviled egg spiders
you<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.180> use<00:02:41.450> whatever<00:02:41.870> deviled<00:02:42.410> egg<00:02:42.530> recipe

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
you can use whatever deviled egg recipe

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
like now for the actual spider bodies

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.650 
like now for the actual spider bodies
I'm<00:03:06.590> using<00:03:06.769> black<00:03:07.100> olives<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:08.269> just<00:03:08.450> cut<00:03:08.630> a

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
I'm using black olives you just cut a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.040 
I'm using black olives you just cut a
block<00:03:08.870> all<00:03:09.140> up<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:09.500> half<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.780> then<00:03:11.780> take<00:03:12.019> one

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
block all up in half and then take one

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.259 
block all up in half and then take one
of<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.320> halves<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.980> just<00:03:13.220> make<00:03:13.760> little<00:03:13.910> thin

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
of the halves and just make little thin

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.449 
of the halves and just make little thin
slices<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.170> half<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.800> those<00:03:16.070> are<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
slices to the half and those are the

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.170 
slices to the half and those are the
spider<00:03:16.760> legs<00:03:17.360> very<00:03:18.260> simple<00:03:18.850> now<00:03:19.850> for<00:03:20.060> these

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
spider legs very simple now for these

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.670 
spider legs very simple now for these
deviled<00:03:20.510> eggs<00:03:20.630> I'm<00:03:20.810> using<00:03:21.019> this<00:03:21.230> spiderweb

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
deviled eggs I'm using this spiderweb

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.650 
deviled eggs I'm using this spiderweb
egg<00:03:22.010> said<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.340> just<00:03:22.670> showed<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.209> how<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.360> make

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
egg said I just showed you how to make

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.900 
egg said I just showed you how to make
but<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:24.860> also<00:03:25.010> use<00:03:25.430> just<00:03:25.459> plain

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
but you can also use just plain

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.640 
but you can also use just plain
hard-boiled<00:03:26.420> eggs<00:03:26.540> for<00:03:26.630> these<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:27.019> course<00:03:27.260> I'm

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
hard-boiled eggs for these of course I'm

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.860 
hard-boiled eggs for these of course I'm
using<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.430> piping<00:03:28.730> bag<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:28.970> fill<00:03:29.360> them<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.660> just

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
using a piping bag to fill them I just

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.449 
using a piping bag to fill them I just
find<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.200> easier<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.709> neater<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.190> do<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.370> that

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
find it easier and neater to do it that

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.699 
find it easier and neater to do it that
way<00:03:31.640> but<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.300> can<00:03:32.450> also<00:03:32.570> use<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> spoon<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.410> fill

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
way but you can also use a spoon to fill

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.070 
way but you can also use a spoon to fill
them<00:03:33.860> up<00:03:33.920> now<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.820> assemble<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.600> spider<00:03:35.900> you

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
them up now to assemble the spider you

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.040 
them up now to assemble the spider you
just<00:03:36.200> put<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.620> olive<00:03:37.459> half<00:03:37.640> down<00:03:37.940> cut<00:03:38.780> side

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
just put the olive half down cut side

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.440 
just put the olive half down cut side
down<00:03:39.260> and<00:03:39.590> then<00:03:39.769> add<00:03:40.040> little<00:03:40.459> spider<00:03:40.820> legs<00:03:41.150> on

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
down and then add little spider legs on

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.930 
down and then add little spider legs on

them over so that you could see the

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.480 
them over so that you could see the
little<00:04:00.350> spider<00:04:00.560> pattern
