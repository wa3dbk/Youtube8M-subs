they<00:00:01.920> did<00:00:02.070> some<00:00:02.280> research<00:00:02.490> and<00:00:02.820> figured<00:00:03.149> out

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
they did some research and figured out

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.829 
they did some research and figured out
that<00:00:03.300> Mars<00:00:04.700> it's<00:00:05.700> pretty<00:00:06.000> decided<00:00:06.540> but<00:00:06.629> so

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
that Mars it's pretty decided but so

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.200 
that Mars it's pretty decided but so
that<00:00:07.049> Mars<00:00:07.259> was<00:00:07.529> struck<00:00:07.919> by<00:00:08.090> asteroid<00:00:09.090> or

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
that Mars was struck by asteroid or

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.540 
that Mars was struck by asteroid or
comet<00:00:09.330> or<00:00:09.719> something<00:00:09.750> huge<00:00:10.440> four<00:00:11.280> billion

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
comet or something huge four billion

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.240 
comet or something huge four billion
years<00:00:11.910> ago<00:00:12.030> or<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.920> northern

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
years ago or so in the northern

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.880 
years ago or so in the northern
hemisphere<00:00:14.870> near<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.020> Magnetic<00:00:16.410> Pole<00:00:16.440> I'm

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
hemisphere near the Magnetic Pole I'm

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:28.089 
hemisphere near the Magnetic Pole I'm
sure<00:00:17.720> there's<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.840> huge<00:00:19.080> crater<00:00:23.269> it's<00:00:24.269> called

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.939 

borealis<00:00:29.630> like<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> aurora<00:00:31.050> borealis<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
borealis like the aurora borealis the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.000 
borealis like the aurora borealis the
borealis<00:00:32.700> creator<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.680> what

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
borealis creator so I think what

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.740 
borealis creator so I think what
happened<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.370> an<00:00:35.579> attack<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> video<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.660> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
happened was an attack a video of a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.880 
happened was an attack a video of a
simulation<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.320> would<00:00:37.469> happen<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
simulation of what would happen at a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.430 
simulation of what would happen at a
huge<00:00:38.100> comet<00:00:38.489> struck<00:00:38.760> earth<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.930> inside

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
huge comet struck earth like the inside

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.060 
huge comet struck earth like the inside
of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> planet<00:00:41.160> comes<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:42.379> bursts<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.829> out

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
of the planet comes up bursts up and out

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.910 
of the planet comes up bursts up and out
and<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.780> thought<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.410> lit<00:00:46.590> but

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
and it's like just thought this lit but

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.049 
and it's like just thought this lit but
red-hot<00:00:47.460> molten<00:00:47.850> iron<00:00:48.620> rich<00:00:50.360> mass<00:00:51.360> matter

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
red-hot molten iron rich mass matter

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.250 
red-hot molten iron rich mass matter
elements<00:00:55.640> up<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> atmosphere<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.809> then

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
elements up in the atmosphere and then

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990 
elements up in the atmosphere and then
it's<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.949> earth<00:00:59.010> holds<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> regret

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it's the earth holds on to regret

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's the earth holds on to regret
visually<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> says<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> all<00:01:00.930> around<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
visually it says it all around the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
visually it says it all around the
planet<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.980> hip<00:01:02.309> planted<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.850> covered<00:01:03.210> in

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
planet and hip planted it's covered in

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.070 
planet and hip planted it's covered in
that<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.719> head<00:01:03.979> ash<00:01:05.360> won't<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> actually<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that your head ash won't you actually I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.760 
that your head ash won't you actually I
destructive<00:01:07.950> hot<00:01:08.250> cloudy<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.750> endure<00:01:10.049> first

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
destructive hot cloudy will endure first

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.630 
destructive hot cloudy will endure first
and<00:01:10.950> fire<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:12.680> that's<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.010> think<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.369> assume

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and fire and that's I think I assume

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
and fire and that's I think I assume
that<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.390> happened<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.750> Mars<00:01:16.049> about

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that that's what happened on Mars about

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.340 
that that's what happened on Mars about
four<00:01:16.770> billion<00:01:17.009> years<00:01:17.310> ago<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.259> that's<00:01:19.259> what

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
four billion years ago and that's what

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.460 
four billion years ago and that's what
is<00:01:19.470> rubble<00:01:19.799> everywhere<00:01:19.890> why<00:01:20.430> it's<00:01:20.580> red<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> I'm

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
is rubble everywhere why it's red so I'm

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.219 
is rubble everywhere why it's red so I'm
thinking<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.700> dig<00:01:24.060> down<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.049> about

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
thinking if we dig down and it's about

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.640 
thinking if we dig down and it's about
to<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.920> about<00:01:26.040> two<00:01:26.460> miles<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:28.110> cross<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.350> two

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to it's about two miles the cross is two

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230 
to it's about two miles the cross is two
miles<00:01:28.829> thinner<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.400> northern<00:01:29.759> hemisphere

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
miles thinner in northern hemisphere

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
miles thinner in northern hemisphere
doing<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> south<00:01:31.079> where<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.159> creative

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
doing the south where the creative

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.249 
doing the south where the creative
struck<00:01:32.820> or<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:34.159> comet<00:01:35.159> asteroid<00:01:35.520> struck

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
struck or with a comet asteroid struck

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.770 
struck or with a comet asteroid struck
so<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.380> thinking<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.430> dig<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:39.000> about<00:01:39.329> two

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so I'm thinking if we dig down about two

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.830 
so I'm thinking if we dig down about two
miles<00:01:40.460> go<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.759> mile<00:01:42.950> one<00:01:43.950> mile<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
miles go one mile one mile in the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.389 
miles go one mile one mile in the
southern<00:01:46.229> hemisphere<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.860> should<00:01:47.100> break

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
southern hemisphere you should break

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.330 
southern hemisphere you should break
through<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.000> powder<00:01:48.360> taking

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
through this powder taking

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.370 
through this powder taking
air<00:01:49.509> crust<00:01:50.710> about<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.890> mass<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.700> crap<00:01:53.390> like<00:01:53.990> iron

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
air crust about a mass of crap like iron

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.370 
air crust about a mass of crap like iron
heavy<00:01:54.619> me<00:01:54.920> dead<00:01:55.189> mass<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.179> get<00:01:56.539> you<00:01:56.689> a<00:01:56.719> healthy

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
heavy me dead mass and get you a healthy

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.969 
heavy me dead mass and get you a healthy
a<00:01:57.619> rich<00:01:58.100> planet<00:01:58.960> underneath<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.140> Martian

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
a rich planet underneath the Martian

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.590 
a rich planet underneath the Martian
surface<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:02.109> oxygen<00:02:03.109> rich<00:02:03.590> soil<00:02:04.600> underneath

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
surface is oxygen rich soil underneath

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.199 
surface is oxygen rich soil underneath
this<00:02:06.110> it's<00:02:06.740> been<00:02:06.920> compressed<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.459> long<00:02:07.610> time<00:02:07.939> so

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
this it's been compressed a long time so

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.160 
this it's been compressed a long time so
we<00:02:08.269> may<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.569> dig<00:02:08.750> down<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.470> i<00:02:10.000> think<00:02:11.170> it's

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
we may have to dig down but i think it's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.350 
we may have to dig down but i think it's
only<00:02:12.260> two<00:02:12.530> miles<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.700> breathe<00:02:13.940> and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
only two miles and that can breathe and

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.150 
only two miles and that can breathe and
there's<00:02:14.540> ice<00:02:14.720> on<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.080> surface<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:15.830> there's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
there's ice on the surface so there's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.100 
there's ice on the surface so there's
water<00:02:16.370> all<00:02:16.610> down<00:02:17.090> through<00:02:17.390> there<00:02:17.540> there<00:02:17.959> may

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
water all down through there there may

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.350 
water all down through there there may
be<00:02:18.140> huge<00:02:18.560> caverns<00:02:19.069> under<00:02:19.340> Mars<00:02:19.549> there's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
be huge caverns under Mars there's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.770 
be huge caverns under Mars there's
probably<00:02:20.810> huge<00:02:21.290> cabers<00:02:22.360> when<00:02:23.360> we<00:02:23.510> start

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
probably huge cabers when we start

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:34.180 
probably huge cabers when we start
getting<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:28.450> lot<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.480> moisture<00:02:32.680> so<00:02:33.680> there's<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
getting a lot of moisture so there's the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.949 
getting a lot of moisture so there's the
KP<00:02:34.519> layer<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:37.090> magnate<00:02:38.090> without<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> mystical

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
KP layer of magnate without a mystical

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:47.140 
KP layer of magnate without a mystical
way<00:02:39.079> man<00:02:40.090> let<00:02:41.090> your<00:02:41.239> imagination<00:02:41.750> run<00:02:41.780> with<00:02:42.019> it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.820 

so<00:02:48.150> I'm<00:02:48.330> thinking<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.050> if<00:02:49.790> we<00:02:50.790> dig<00:02:51.030> down

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.180 

straight<00:02:56.790> down<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.530> mean<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:58.680> need<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.890> dig<00:02:59.040> away

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
straight down I mean we need to dig away

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.890 
straight down I mean we need to dig away
the<00:02:59.390> brittle<00:03:00.390> surface<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.560> Mars<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:02.280> iron

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
the brittle surface of Mars this iron

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.350 
the brittle surface of Mars this iron
sulfur<00:03:03.900> sulfate<00:03:05.750> face<00:03:06.750> mask<00:03:07.080> its<00:03:07.980> dirt<00:03:08.790> mud

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
sulfur sulfate face mask its dirt mud

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.420 
sulfur sulfate face mask its dirt mud
masks<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:09.990> Mars<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.620> chip<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.070> break<00:03:11.280> away

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
masks on Mars we can chip in break away

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.870 
masks on Mars we can chip in break away
so<00:03:11.670> dry<00:03:12.170> riddle<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.470> decide<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:14.730> is

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
so dry riddle and decide that this is

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.690 
so dry riddle and decide that this is
wrong<00:03:15.180> people<00:03:15.810> are<00:03:16.310> where<00:03:17.310> all<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.520> elements

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
wrong people are where all the elements

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.530 
wrong people are where all the elements
go<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.960> water<00:03:19.320> must<00:03:19.710> have<00:03:20.150> went<00:03:21.150> straight

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
go the water must have went straight

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.190 
go the water must have went straight
down<00:03:21.570> through<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:23.360> carry<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.540> elements<00:03:24.960> down

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
down through and carry the elements down

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.060 
down through and carry the elements down
in<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:28.380> may<00:03:28.500> be<00:03:28.530> possible<00:03:28.740> in

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
in with it and that may be possible in

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.470 
in with it and that may be possible in
the<00:03:29.100> small<00:03:29.400> scale<00:03:29.610> but<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:29.880> believe<00:03:30.210> really

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
the small scale but I believe really

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.760 
the small scale but I believe really
what<00:03:30.660> they're<00:03:30.810> doing<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.320> surface<00:03:31.530> that

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
what they're doing is the surface that

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.140 
what they're doing is the surface that
they're<00:03:31.920> testing<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.490> think<00:03:32.550> is<00:03:32.880> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
they're testing that they think is the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.570 
they're testing that they think is the
natural<00:03:33.510> surface<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.050> Mars<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.920> KP<00:03:35.340> layer

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
natural surface of Mars is that KP layer

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.710 
natural surface of Mars is that KP layer
of<00:03:35.940> iron<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.440> they're<00:03:37.590> not<00:03:37.709> getting<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
of iron so they're not getting the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.330 
of iron so they're not getting the
nutrient-rich<00:03:39.720> soil<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.740> they<00:03:40.890> think<00:03:41.190> they

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
nutrient-rich soil that they think they

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.550 
nutrient-rich soil that they think they
are<00:03:41.370> it's<00:03:41.820> not<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.090> same<00:03:42.270> soil<00:03:42.510> it's<00:03:42.810> an<00:03:42.990> outer

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
are it's not the same soil it's an outer

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.020 
are it's not the same soil it's an outer
layer<00:03:43.800> before<00:03:44.250> they're<00:03:44.610> going<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.820> get<00:03:44.940> to

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
layer before they're going to get to

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.000 
layer before they're going to get to
that<00:03:45.060> soil<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:45.990> I'm<00:03:46.050> thinking<00:03:46.110> if<00:03:46.380> we<00:03:46.530> dig<00:03:46.740> down

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
that soil so I'm thinking if we dig down

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.780 
that soil so I'm thinking if we dig down
we<00:03:47.880> can<00:03:48.180> grow<00:03:49.140> crops<00:03:49.560> underground<00:03:50.370> then<00:03:50.640> I<00:03:50.670> was

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
we can grow crops underground then I was

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.520 
we can grow crops underground then I was
dating<00:03:50.940> but<00:03:51.150> we<00:03:51.209> need<00:03:51.810> sunlight<00:03:52.080> it's<00:03:52.410> going

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
dating but we need sunlight it's going

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.130 
dating but we need sunlight it's going
to<00:03:52.590> be<00:03:52.650> moist<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.160> cool<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.700> we<00:03:54.660> can<00:03:54.810> reflect

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
to be moist and cool and we can reflect

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.800 
to be moist and cool and we can reflect
sunlight<00:03:55.650> underground<00:03:56.550> if<00:03:57.390> we<00:03:57.600> build

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
sunlight underground if we build

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.770 
sunlight underground if we build
reflective<00:03:58.380> systems<00:03:58.830> we<00:03:59.070> can<00:03:59.780> produce

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
reflective systems we can produce

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.960 
reflective systems we can produce
natural<00:04:01.470> sunlight<00:04:01.709> underground<00:04:02.400> for<00:04:02.820> long

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
natural sunlight underground for long

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.860 
natural sunlight underground for long
