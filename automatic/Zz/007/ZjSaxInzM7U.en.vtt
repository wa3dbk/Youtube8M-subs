is<00:07:01.900> the<00:07:02.020> obvious<00:07:02.319> thing<00:07:02.500> after<00:07:02.770> you've

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
is the obvious thing after you've

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:04.950 
is the obvious thing after you've
stopped<00:07:03.250> playing<00:07:03.520> there<00:07:04.479> wasn't<00:07:04.690> really<00:07:04.780> a

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
stopped playing there wasn't really a

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.839 
stopped playing there wasn't really a
role<00:07:05.139> for<00:07:05.470> me<00:07:05.590> to<00:07:05.710> go<00:07:05.800> into<00:07:05.949> the<00:07:06.220> was<00:07:06.400> in<00:07:06.580> terms

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:06.849 
role for me to go into the was in terms

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:08.640 
role for me to go into the was in terms
of<00:07:06.970> the<00:07:07.030> TV<00:07:07.419> so<00:07:07.599> that's<00:07:07.750> why<00:07:07.900> I<00:07:07.930> took<00:07:08.050> that<00:07:08.380> book

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650 
of the TV so that's why I took that book

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.469 
of the TV so that's why I took that book
in<00:07:09.219> the<00:07:09.340> future<00:07:09.699> of<00:07:09.789> a<00:07:09.849> role<00:07:10.030> came<00:07:10.270> up

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 
in the future of a role came up

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:11.879 
in the future of a role came up
obviously<00:07:11.199> give<00:07:11.320> it<00:07:11.409> serious<00:07:11.620> thought

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:11.889 
obviously give it serious thought

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.110 
obviously give it serious thought
because<00:07:12.400> you<00:07:12.639> know<00:07:12.789> football<00:07:13.419> matter<00:07:15.000> yeah<00:07:16.000> I

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
because you know football matter yeah I

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.610 
because you know football matter yeah I
think<00:07:16.270> be<00:07:16.479> when<00:07:16.690> you're<00:07:16.810> a<00:07:16.900> senior<00:07:17.259> player<00:07:17.469> at

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
think be when you're a senior player at

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.170 
think be when you're a senior player at
a<00:07:17.650> club<00:07:17.919> and<00:07:18.070> you've<00:07:18.460> been<00:07:18.789> there<00:07:18.969> for<00:07:19.120> that

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
a club and you've been there for that

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.730 
a club and you've been there for that
long<00:07:19.389> you<00:07:19.599> probably<00:07:19.870> took<00:07:20.320> on<00:07:20.500> that<00:07:20.590> role

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
long you probably took on that role

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.110 
long you probably took on that role
naturally<00:07:21.219> anyway<00:07:21.550> with<00:07:21.759> some<00:07:21.940> of<00:07:22.060> the

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
naturally anyway with some of the

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.629 
naturally anyway with some of the
younger<00:07:22.360> players<00:07:22.659> coming<00:07:22.870> through<00:07:23.610> yeah<00:07:24.610> I

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 
younger players coming through yeah I

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.129 
younger players coming through yeah I
think<00:07:24.849> so<00:07:25.150> I<00:07:25.210> think<00:07:25.270> she<00:07:25.630> Steve<00:07:25.870> means<00:07:25.990> you're

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139 
think so I think she Steve means you're

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:27.209 
think so I think she Steve means you're
not<00:07:26.229> doing<00:07:26.289> that<00:07:26.560> now<00:07:26.710> with<00:07:26.860> the<00:07:26.979> younger

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:27.219 
not doing that now with the younger

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.010 
not doing that now with the younger
players<00:07:27.460> and<00:07:27.789> I<00:07:27.969> think<00:07:28.300> as<00:07:28.389> one<00:07:28.509> of<00:07:28.599> the<00:07:28.659> senior

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
players and I think as one of the senior

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.810 
players and I think as one of the senior
players<00:07:29.259> that<00:07:29.590> is<00:07:29.710> something<00:07:30.039> that<00:07:30.099> yet<00:07:30.340> you

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820
