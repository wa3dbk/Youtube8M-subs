00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hey YouTube I'm back with another

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.499 
hey YouTube I'm back with another
supercedes<00:00:02.639> episode<00:00:03.210> 2<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:04.250> this<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.509> the

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
supercedes episode 2 and this is the

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.709 
supercedes episode 2 and this is the
spawn<00:00:06.779> point<00:00:07.109> right<00:00:07.259> here<00:00:07.970> you<00:00:08.970> spawn<00:00:09.300> in<00:00:09.330> an

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
spawn point right here you spawn in an

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.480 
spawn point right here you spawn in an
ocean<00:00:10.080> biome<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:11.280> an<00:00:11.639> unusually<00:00:12.240> big<00:00:12.450> island

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
ocean biome on an unusually big island

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.160 
ocean biome on an unusually big island
but<00:00:14.490> what's<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.790> funny<00:00:15.089> about<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.570> island<00:00:15.839> is

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
but what's so funny about this island is

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.859 
but what's so funny about this island is
when<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.529> fly<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:17.340> really<00:00:17.670> high<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
when you fly up really high it's in the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.040 
when you fly up really high it's in the
shape<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.410> tree<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.539> pretty<00:00:21.779> funny

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
shape of a tree so it's pretty funny

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.870 
shape of a tree so it's pretty funny
because<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.560> see<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> branch<00:00:23.130> right<00:00:23.609> here

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
because you can see a branch right here

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120 
because you can see a branch right here
looks<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> branch<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.590> trunk<00:00:25.890> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
looks like a branch that's the trunk and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.070 
looks like a branch that's the trunk and
then<00:00:26.970> pretty<00:00:27.150> much<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> grass<00:00:27.810> looks

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
then pretty much all the grass looks

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.480 
then pretty much all the grass looks
like<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> leaves<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.039> so<00:00:29.220> that's<00:00:29.400> pretty

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
like the leaves of it so that's pretty

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.729 
like the leaves of it so that's pretty
cool<00:00:30.050> and<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.189> then<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.520> go<00:00:33.230> behind<00:00:34.230> you

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
cool and so then when you go behind you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.880 
cool and so then when you go behind you
from<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> spawn<00:00:35.640> point<00:00:36.260> there<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> huge

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
from the spawn point there is a huge

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.880 
from the spawn point there is a huge
mountain<00:00:38.219> biome<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.230> plus<00:00:40.230> another<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.800> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
mountain biome and plus another one of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.190 
mountain biome and plus another one of
these<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> islands<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.870> venture

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
these kind of islands you get to venture

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
these kind of islands you get to venture
off<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> right<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.370> tag<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> get

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
off to the right just a tag just to get

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.799 
off to the right just a tag just to get
over<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.899> island<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> first<00:00:48.660> thing

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
over to this island and the first thing

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.270 
over to this island and the first thing
you'll<00:00:48.930> probably<00:00:48.960> notice<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.950> peninsula

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you'll probably notice is this peninsula

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490 
you'll probably notice is this peninsula
which<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:51.719> skinny<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.320> just

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
which is kind of really skinny it just

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.790 
which is kind of really skinny it just
kind<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.739> goes<00:00:52.890> up<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.289> isn't<00:00:55.649> one

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
kind of goes up so this isn't one

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.150 
kind of goes up so this isn't one
another<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.340> those<00:00:56.430> islands<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:58.160> takes

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
another one of those islands it's takes

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.810 
another one of those islands it's takes
a<00:00:59.309> bigger<00:00:59.489> volume<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:01.670> lot<00:01:02.670> more

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
a bigger volume but it's a lot more

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.539 
a bigger volume but it's a lot more
skinnier<00:01:03.270> than<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.229> other<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.549> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
skinnier than it is the other one and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.640 
skinnier than it is the other one and
then<00:01:05.700> right<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> crater<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.200> ocean

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
then right here is a crater in the ocean

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.510 
then right here is a crater in the ocean
it's<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> lake<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.830> then<00:01:10.830> over<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it's like a lake and then over here is a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.600 
it's like a lake and then over here is a
big<00:01:11.820> mountain<00:01:12.090> biome

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
big mountain biome

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.210 
big mountain biome
so<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.970> funny<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> sita's<00:01:16.220> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
so it's so funny about the sita's you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.249 
so it's so funny about the sita's you
think<00:01:17.520> piranha<00:01:18.000> flashdrive<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.049> really

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
think piranha flashdrive is like really

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.999 
think piranha flashdrive is like really
random<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.430> random<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.259> came<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.979> with

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
random it is random but I came up with

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
random it is random but I came up with
it<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.430> I'm<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> piranhas<00:01:24.509> swim<00:01:24.840> team

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it because I'm on the piranhas swim team

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.310 
it because I'm on the piranhas swim team
supposedly<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:27.210> happen<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.869> looking<00:01:28.200> at

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
supposedly and I happen to be looking at

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.140 
supposedly and I happen to be looking at
a<00:01:28.350> flash<00:01:28.619> drive<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.369> thought<00:01:29.579> her<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
a flash drive so I just thought her on a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.670 
a flash drive so I just thought her on a
flash<00:01:30.450> drive<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:31.020> how<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> got<00:01:31.470> this

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
flash drive and that's how I got this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.499 
flash drive and that's how I got this
seat<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.450> pretty<00:01:33.600> funny<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:35.329> really<00:01:36.329> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
seat so it's pretty funny I really like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.990 
seat so it's pretty funny I really like
this<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:36.930> buying<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.680> cut<00:01:38.280> edges<00:01:38.700> here

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this not buying this like cut edges here

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.399 
this not buying this like cut edges here
and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.930> huge<00:01:40.409> cave<00:01:41.280> underneath

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
and then this is huge cave underneath

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.460 
and then this is huge cave underneath
there's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.500> waterfall<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:49.320> there's

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
there's a waterfall and then there's

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.639 
there's a waterfall and then there's
these<00:01:49.590> floating<00:01:50.070> mountains<00:01:50.490> up<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:54.649> think

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
these floating mountains up here I think

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.139 
these floating mountains up here I think
it's<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.100> weird<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.030> in

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it's really weird that they have that in

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's really weird that they have that in
the<00:01:57.240> game<00:01:58.790> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:01:59.880> say<00:02:00.060> some<00:02:00.270> Enderman<00:02:00.659> in

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the game you can say some Enderman in

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200 
the game you can say some Enderman in
there

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 

yeah<00:02:03.420> definitely<00:02:03.960> check<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.500> seed<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
yeah definitely check out the seed it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.880 
yeah definitely check out the seed it
has<00:02:05.010> lots<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.490> cool<00:02:05.730> features<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.470> um

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
has lots of cool features to it it's um

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.720 
has lots of cool features to it it's um
it<00:02:07.980> feels<00:02:08.310> very<00:02:09.200> barren<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.550> kind

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
it feels very barren it's like you kind
