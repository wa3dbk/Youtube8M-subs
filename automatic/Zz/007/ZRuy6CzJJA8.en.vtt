00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.490
 this video has been recorded for 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.170
 'trading' a point is and remember that 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.160
 is invited to participate in the forum 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.160
 whenever you want 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.630
 let's see this example right now 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.010
 we have a previous trend of type 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.990
 bass guitarist 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.250
 and here we have a support line 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.250
 let's mark it 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.000
 was support at this point in this and 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.390
 now it seems that it is also 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 reacting again 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.410
 but since we are not fortunetellers, let's see 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.970
 what the market offers us 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.530
 before let's see if there is anything else that 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.800
 justify this line because it looks like 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.900
 a little poor friend yes here for example 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.880
 it was also support and in fact a 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.340
 important support given that from this 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.690
 level the market went quite up 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.690
 until now he has returned to him 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.260
 good then variety of this area 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.780
 let's see what the market offers us 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.710
 we are in graph of one dollar dollar yen 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.619
 it seems that it can not break for now 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.940
 Nor is there a shadow over or be 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.799
 that the opening price has been the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.810
 maximum so far establishing 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.590
 break and broke with strength remain 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.590
 five minutes 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.929
 and there it is 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.270
 here we have a bearish marubozu sail 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:48.610
 has made a break of a level 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.200
 important a support that involves us 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.300
 bearish strength and continuous continuity has 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.370
 made the breaking of the level here 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.520
 was the bearish breakdown trend 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.590
 what can be expected according to the theory 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.840
 usually means that this 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.229
 trend will continue to decline 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.170
 and will continue in one way or another is 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.220
 say or continue like this breaks and continues to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.330
 the down directly 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.210
 break 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.900
 come to try again now support 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.580
 past future resistance and rejects the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.710
 case is that what we expect to happen 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.270
 as probability is that late or 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.260
 early go down directly 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.110
 psychology 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.579
 is the important level where the bears 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.950
 in this case they knew that they have to 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.170
 incorporate many sales positions 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.939
 to break the resistance that 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.000
 obviously we have seen in the past 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:47.129
 on the part of the bulls here then 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.159
 they put many orders on everything here 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.519
 at the right point of the line and 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:56.180
 they broke when they broke and ended 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.849
 closing here at this level the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.489
 buyers lowered it a bit the case 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.620
 is that the general is candle was created as well 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.530
 this drawing that did that 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.480
 that other people other traders 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.819
 convince the possibility of being 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.340
 found against a bearish pattern of 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.580
 then then when entering 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.230
 incorporate all these plus these are going to 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.230
 generate a bear market 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.970
 when everything is incorporated , this 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.090
 another candle and this other candle is a 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.620
 confirmation and perhaps too excessive 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.300
 as to incorporate new 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.160
 sellers but good the case is that 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.690
 are being incorporated and those that were missing 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.840
 that was being by his pattern of 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.030
 confirmation and here I would be after this 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.100
 that would indicate a great descent 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.290
 I say it may be excessive to enter 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.840
 because it has gone down so much that 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.819
 join this level by cutting the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.220
 Stop here, maybe it's a lot and 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.390
 it would be better to wait for a pullback in this 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.240
 case I would at least make it a 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.430
 pullback to the resistance for then 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.550
 go to the underworld if you do 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.740
 lack 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.960
 for the sake of japan of his 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.350
 exports from the us let's hopefully 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.350
 not 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.820
 I spoke 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.300
 and already went to start is down 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.569
 another 15 minute graphic example dollar 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.069
 Swiss franc 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.620
 we have an important level of support 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.180
 more or less at this level 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.580
 and 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.430
 see how support was here 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.289
 support here a fake attempt 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.210
 breakage that finally ended 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.910
 respecting the support right now 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.160
 we are practically on the same level 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.389
 bearish previous trend indeed 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.690
 probably come from much more 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.690
 behind 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.940
 let's let the market tell us what 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.940
 is proposing 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.349
 look, it's opening a break 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.530
 and already stop 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.030
 you recognize this candle 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.490
 and indeed a bearish marubozu 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.160
 you do not stay that it does not cost me 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.890
 pronounce it 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.889
 as it should be we have here a level 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.990
 important in this case of support 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.080
 and the psychology after the movement which 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.759
 it is because we already know the truth sales 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.800
 sales in sales because they want 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.430
 break the level and continue to win with 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.169
 their short positions then when they 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.080
 approach the level at this price to this 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.889
 line where we know that in the past the 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.469
 bulls have entered what they have done here 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.479
 the bears has been having to increase the 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:55.210
 pressure to then have broken that 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.060
 support by breaking the support they are going to 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.870
 probably generate this candle that has 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.870
 been a marubozu 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:07.660
 turn this pattern this drawing goes to 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:11.690
 convince others who are waiting 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.390
 maybe with less capital to enter and 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:18.400
 go on sale because they know that this 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.400
 pattern usually represents continuity 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.660
 then when the second ones 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.250
 let's say sunny traders generate this 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.530
 candle that closes below the previous 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.380
 and can be considered as a pattern 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.400
 of as a confirmation that would make 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:39.009
 and the vast majority of operators 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.699
 definitely come for sale 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:45.430
 and can also many operators that 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.469
 were bulls can decide to close their 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.819
 purchase operations which also 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.819
 increases the bearish precision 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.210
 and that generate this movement more 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.870
 down as you can see the market 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.630
 the movement continues after the 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.510
 breaking and it definitely goes to the 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.910
 low 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.980
 do not worry you'll get used to your sight and 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.440
 your eyes with the experience were many 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.409
 practices that you will perform to see more 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.689
 beyond the candles themselves 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.099
 it's exactly like on matrix with is 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:19.939
 also from the screen with the codes 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:19.939
 for equal 

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.620
 this video has been recorded for trading 

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.690
 point is and remember that this is 

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.140
