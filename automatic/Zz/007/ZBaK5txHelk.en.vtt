 hello I am steel eurosport larios traigo 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.839
 a new video that has emerged thanks to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.250
 the idea that has given me because this tweet 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.990
 that I will leave you here that has been 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.610
 great help as I say for the idea 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.040
 of this video this video as well you read 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.900
 in the title to deal with books that I 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.480
 would like you to adapt in to see the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.520
 series movies or whatever the thing was 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.980
 is that they adapt them and that they can be 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.689
 happy is worth having good adaptations 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.400
 of those books we are going to consider that 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.810
 all the adaptations of those that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.580
 I want to talk about all the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.669
 hypotheticals let's keep in mind that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.890
 they are good because 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.719
 because yes because we will not have in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.129
 realize that they are bad because I would not have 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.420
 I mean making the video so it's 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.829
 the first book that I would like to see in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.329
 the screens would be fulminated from 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.190
 jennifer post word the truth is that it is 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 a novel whose trailer I'll leave you 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.179
 Above the book, the link invites us 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.369
 to believe that there is a movie but 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.619
 really there is not the reason is that this 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.539
 woman is a scriptwriter and her husband is a producer 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.059
 so they said let's make a 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.890
 super mega ultra great trailer that ni 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.140
 many movies have that budget 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 simply to make a book 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 trailer is after the woman footballer 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.990
 and instead of investing a tad more and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.700
 finish doing something in conditions 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.840
 they made the truth about the trailer 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.119
 is that they do not understand it I felt very 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.100
 outraged to discover that it was a 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.990
 book trailer not the trailer itself so 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.060
 well i hope jennifer post word you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.890
 convince your husband that you write the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.909
 script and make a movie because of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.749
 truth the novel is worth 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.429
 and very much it's worth to see them in 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.869
 large screens and I think it would be a 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.250
 great movie another novel that I 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.810
 would love to see on the big screen is 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.189
 daughter of a very good set of lane and taylor 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.170
 and I tell you because when I was reading 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.659
 the novel kept thinking about how 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.520
 it would be if it were a movie and the truth 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.020
 is that it would work even better than 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.060
 as a novel I know that as a novel I 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.140
 loved it and it works pretty well but 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.149
 I sincerely believe it's a story 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.969
 which is made to be represented in 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.920
 cinema has a lot of magic has many 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.329
 things that could be used in 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.219
 how much special effects and I have a few 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.229
 very good characters very charismatic and 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.420
 I believe that sincerely as a movie 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.099
 it would be a spectacular product and therefore not 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.869
 I know if it 's so sold the rights or not 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.069
 but hopefully they make film because in 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.959
 serious is great 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.659
 another novelty that is also the beginning of 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.579
 I was awake cross the universe 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.010
 from time I reviewed the novel I liked it a lot 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.170
 I did not expect it to be such a thriller 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.549
 exciting let's say but the truth is that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.530
 as a movie I think it would work 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.840
 pretty good even like the book 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.959
 that thriller and that fact that they are in 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.700
 a spaceship living and so I would 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.990
 remember a bit also the synopsis 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.840
 of the 100 the cw series and then 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.880
 with this similar thing it would have 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.650
 true pull on the screen because 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.100
 although there is a similar series I think 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.070
 that this could have more strength I do not know 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.600
 as they do not know how to explain but 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.860
 I do not know if you have read it or not 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.540
 but I think that as a movie 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.070
 It would work very well and I'll leave 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.680
 movies and ice cream will go with 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.240
 series or miniseries paradise that by itself 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.190
 you do not know it's the first part of a 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.800
 simon biology the what is the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.140
 perfect chemistry author is one of my 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.970
 sagas favorite biological sagas 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.530
 favorite I loved both the first 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.540
 novel with a second the two are 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.640
 wonderful the characters are great 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.740
 the love star is so pretty so 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.180
 credible that I do not know is wonderful but 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.460
 honestly I do not think it works well 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.950
 on big screens therefore I from 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.050
 paradise would make a kind of series no 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.970
 very long maybe two seasons a 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.550
 season per book or if you hurry me three 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.230
 seasons is worth to stage some 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.360
 things in conditions I think so 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.460
 would give for a series in short plan of 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.890
 these of not of 22 chapters of these of 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.600
 10 12 chapters ryan mind fat tie-breaks 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.010
 I think it would work pretty well 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.840
 because it's a story has its parts 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.519
 pretty hard and I think it has 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.970
 and also that it reminds me a bit of 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.860
 other series that yes then well yes it would be 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.239
 dead I would see this series the truth and 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.790
 finally a saga that really 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.010
 I need you to do series as you see is 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.959
 shadow hunters the angel origins 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.910
 mechanical this is the first but good to 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.980
 see my plan is worth it if I was this 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.799
 producer or something as my plan would be the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.530
 next youtube's cool plans 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.989
 I take cassandra clare and I say look 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.170
 beautiful you've done a movie past sold 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.450
 the rights for a fucking movie 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.730
 and as you saw is so shit that neither you 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.810
 you knew that they had done 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.640
 with your story is that neither 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.750
 recognized then you say I'm going to 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.140
 sell the rights for me to do 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.600
 a series then 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.190
 ok not then you think the series 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.680
 Well they will do it well in 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.270
 conditions I hope so I wanted to 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.270
 that are real I would say that and then 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.870
 if necessary with a beast force 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.000
 accompanied by a value knife would you say 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.000
 that you sell me of the rights for this 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:42.409
 mechanical angel has an incredible reef 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:45.770
 and I would do a season for each book 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.449
 of the trilogy my approach would be in 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.039
 penny trade full plan that in fact 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.399
 penetrates excel when I saw it is that 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.009
 I saw so many things in this saga and 

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:56.930
 so many hits special effects and such 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.330
 that were very related to these 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.969
 weapons that I think is what would work 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.639
 It is also that you do not tell me that this is 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:06.889
 this saga so spectacular would not be cool 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.749
 in a series is what is it 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.430
 wonderful however the saga of 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.999
 shadow hunter itself does not hit me like 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.800
 series hits me more tonight I did the 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.419
 idea a while ago and then nobody 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.490
 removes it so if they do not do series 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.710
 when I am a billionaire 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.050
 acclaimed artist film director 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.839
 worldwide and supreme diva of the universe 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.309
 I will buy the rights to a series and 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.629
 is this has been all for the video of 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:31.309
 today if you have seen me doing weird things 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.770
 with my eyes is that I do not have contact lenses 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:35.240
 because I'm very smart and then 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.009
 I say not bad for contact lenses because 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.509
 total I have a camera nearby and I'm going to 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.520
 I can focus but I do not see everything 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.860
 fuzzy so if you see me put on a 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.930
 little cross-eyed forgive me is just as I am 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.669
 to wish born this way baby thanks for 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.819
 see me and see you the next video up 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.819
 then 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.940
 I can see
