00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
was done throughout the series was

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.780 
was done throughout the series was
slowly<00:01:58.380> being<00:01:58.710> reversed<00:01:59.070> towards<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> end

which is like that had impact and that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.620 
which is like that had impact and that
gave<00:02:02.399> character<00:02:02.790> development<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.360> lot<00:02:03.540> of

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
gave character development to a lot of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.819 
gave character development to a lot of
people<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.259> supposed<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> mean

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
people and just it was supposed to mean

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
something so when you bring these

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.700 
something so when you bring these
characters<00:02:06.840> back<00:02:06.960> especially<00:02:07.469> towards<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
characters back especially towards the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.770 
characters back especially towards the
end<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:08.039> kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> felt

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
it's again the best way to put it would

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.050 
it's again the best way to put it would
be<00:03:19.239> Fairy<00:03:20.239> Tail<00:03:20.980> done<00:03:21.980> more<00:03:22.220> serious<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.850> kind

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
because Fairy Tail doesn't necessarily

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.570

the<00:03:42.440> endings<00:03:43.130> definitely<00:03:43.579> should<00:03:43.700> have<00:03:43.730> been

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
the endings definitely should have been

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.580 
the endings definitely should have been
more<00:03:44.090> focused<00:03:44.269> like<00:03:44.600> on<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.019> way<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.260> manga
