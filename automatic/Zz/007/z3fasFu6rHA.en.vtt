00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
okay so basically the once you've found

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.450 
okay so basically the once you've found
is<00:00:03.780> part<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.170> wider<00:00:04.350> convergent<00:00:04.980> platform

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
is part of a wider convergent platform

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.390 
is part of a wider convergent platform
where<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:06.270> can<00:00:06.359> run<00:00:06.569> up<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.859> goal<00:00:08.280> is

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
where you can run up on to the goal is

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.660 
where you can run up on to the goal is
to<00:00:08.429> build<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.760> single<00:00:09.719> OS<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.290> runs<00:00:10.469> across

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
to build a single OS that runs across

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.830 
to build a single OS that runs across
all<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.820> devices<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.300> care<00:00:12.540> about<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
all of the devices you care about the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.140 
all of the devices you care about the
cloud<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.469> runs<00:00:13.590> on<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.860> desktop<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.969> runs

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
cloud so it runs on the desktop it runs

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.269 
cloud so it runs on the desktop it runs
on<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> TV<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:16.320> appointed<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.740> Android<00:00:17.130> we

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
on the TV is appointed for Android we

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.740 
on the TV is appointed for Android we
can<00:00:17.430> take<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> standard<00:00:17.910> android<00:00:18.270> phone<00:00:18.510> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
can take a standard android phone and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.500 
can take a standard android phone and
you<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.930> dock<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.560> reboot<00:00:19.859> into<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
you can dock it and reboot into the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
moves into the ubuntu desktop and then

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.130 
moves into the ubuntu desktop and then
obviously<00:00:23.970> we've<00:00:24.300> introduced<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> phone<00:00:24.960> as

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
obviously we've introduced the phone as

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.900 
obviously we've introduced the phone as
well<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:26.099> set<00:00:26.310> out<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.519> build<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> really

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
well we set out to build a really

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.130 
well we set out to build a really
personal<00:00:27.119> experience<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.750> found<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.990> long

changes in the balls of the day

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
changes in the balls of the day
progresses<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.860> feels<00:01:04.979> more<00:01:05.220> personal<00:01:05.400> to

you<00:01:06.530> now<00:01:07.530> what<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.770> did<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.070> built<00:01:08.369> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
you now what we did is we built this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399 
you now what we did is we built this
with<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> goal<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.240> being<00:01:09.990> able<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.229> work

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
with the goal of it being able to work

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.770 
with the goal of it being able to work
on<00:01:10.650> devices<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.549> no<00:01:11.729> buttons<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.659> keeps

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
on devices with no buttons so it keeps

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
on devices with no buttons so it keeps
us<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.500> keeps<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.920> Bill<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> Materials<00:01:15.119> low

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
us so it keeps the Bill of Materials low

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.590 
us so it keeps the Bill of Materials low
for<00:01:15.750> handset<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.229> firm<00:01:16.409> operators<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.360> get

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
for handset and firm operators so to get

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.810 
for handset and firm operators so to get
around<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.170> lack<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.350> buttons<00:01:19.830> we've

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
around the lack of buttons we've

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
around the lack of buttons we've
hot-rodded<00:01:21.689> each<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> four<00:01:22.290> edges<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
hot-rodded each of the four edges of the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.179 
hot-rodded each of the four edges of the
screen<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:24.710> map<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> different

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
screen to map to the different

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.649 
screen to map to the different
functionality<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.090> example<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.479> sign

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
functionality so for example if I sign

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.110 
functionality so for example if I sign
up<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> left

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
up for the left

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.900 
up for the left
this<00:01:29.660> is<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.930> launcher<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:31.370> is<00:01:31.490> where<00:01:31.640> most

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
this is the launcher this is where most

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.370 
this is the launcher this is where most
of<00:01:32.060> your<00:01:32.120> frequently<00:01:32.630> use<00:01:32.720> applications<00:01:33.290> are

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
of your frequently use applications are

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.640 
of your frequently use applications are
going<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.590> live<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:34.880> for<00:01:35.030> example<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.480> could<00:01:35.650> if

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
going to live so for example I could if

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.280 
going to live so for example I could if
I<00:01:36.830> wait<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:37.700> can<00:01:38.030> look<00:01:38.150> for<00:01:38.270> facebook<00:01:38.690> on<00:01:38.900> my<00:01:39.020> web

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
I wait I can look for facebook on my web

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.290 
I wait I can look for facebook on my web

screen<00:05:29.360> obviously<00:05:30.370> so<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.430> provides<00:05:31.729> a<00:05:31.880> really

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
screen obviously so it provides a really

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.180 
screen obviously so it provides a really
nice<00:05:32.240> way<00:05:32.419> which<00:05:32.570> we<00:05:32.660> can<00:05:32.810> browse<00:05:33.020> content<00:05:33.200> so

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
nice way which we can browse content so

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.950 
nice way which we can browse content so
for<00:05:34.280> example<00:05:34.310> if<00:05:34.610> I<00:05:34.669> load<00:05:34.880> load<00:05:35.419> this<00:05:35.510> image<00:05:35.780> up

for example if I load load this image up
it<00:05:36.770> obviously<00:05:36.890> conflict<00:05:37.430> between<00:05:37.520> your
