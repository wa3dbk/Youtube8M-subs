why it's a little bit boring for a lot
of<00:03:24.790> people<00:03:25.000> because<00:03:25.480> basically<00:03:25.750> you've<00:03:26.139> seen

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
of people because basically you've seen

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.660 
of people because basically you've seen
the<00:03:26.650> games<00:03:26.859> you<00:03:27.010> know<00:03:27.099> I'm<00:03:27.250> just<00:03:27.489> there

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
the games you know I'm just there

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.020 
the games you know I'm just there
telling<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:29.799> know<00:03:29.950> about<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.430> games<00:03:30.670> but

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
telling you you know about the games but

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.759 
telling you you know about the games but
you've<00:03:31.239> actually<00:03:31.480> already<00:03:31.690> witnessed<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
you've actually already witnessed the

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.440 
you've actually already witnessed the
most<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.310> them<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.579> know<00:03:33.730> you've<00:03:33.970> played<00:03:34.239> them

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
most of them you know you've played them

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.800 
most of them you know you've played them
and<00:03:34.629> it<00:03:35.409> kinda<00:03:35.739> seems<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.129> bit<00:03:36.250> pointless<00:03:36.810> some

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
and it kinda seems a bit pointless some

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.800 
and it kinda seems a bit pointless some
stages<00:03:38.409> of<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:39.370> commentaries<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.299> know<00:03:40.449> I'm

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
stages of the commentaries you know I'm

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.869 
stages of the commentaries you know I'm
just<00:03:41.049> reiterating<00:03:41.859> things<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.340> everybody's

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
just reiterating things that everybody's

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.720 
just reiterating things that everybody's
already<00:03:43.060> sent<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.750> cod<00:03:44.079> and<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.919> think<00:03:45.519> that's

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
already sent in cod and I think that's

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.559 
already sent in cod and I think that's
why<00:03:47.099> my<00:03:48.099> videos<00:03:48.549> on<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.819> channel<00:03:49.000> aren't

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
why my videos on that channel aren't

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.180 
why my videos on that channel aren't
exactly<00:03:49.930> getting<00:03:50.109> a<00:03:50.319> lot<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.500> views<00:03:50.919> at<00:03:51.099> the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
exactly getting a lot of views at the

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.150 
exactly getting a lot of views at the
moment<00:03:51.549> but<00:03:51.760> that's<00:03:52.540> what<00:03:52.810> sort<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.650> going<00:03:53.889> on

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
moment but that's what sort of going on

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.180 
moment but that's what sort of going on
I<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:55.150> haven't<00:03:55.750> had<00:03:55.810> chance<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.410> post<00:03:56.650> any
