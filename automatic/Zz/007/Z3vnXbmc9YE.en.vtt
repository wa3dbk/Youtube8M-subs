Melo<00:03:24.880> who<00:03:25.209> have<00:03:25.329> really<00:03:25.720> not<00:03:25.930> played<00:03:26.290> up<00:03:26.500> to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
Melo who have really not played up to

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.280 
Melo who have really not played up to
that<00:03:26.829> level<00:03:27.070> but<00:03:27.940> Kobe<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.540> LeBron<00:03:28.630> they're

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
that level but Kobe and LeBron they're

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.190 
that level but Kobe and LeBron they're
they<00:03:29.500> really<00:03:30.040> do<00:03:30.220> me<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.640> constants<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:32.079> as

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
they really do me to constants but as

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.860 
they really do me to constants but as
far<00:03:32.470> as<00:03:32.640> between<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.940> there<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.390> me<00:03:34.510> there's<00:03:34.750> no

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
far as between to there to me there's no

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.500 
far as between to there to me there's no
question<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.620> LeBron<00:03:36.459> James<00:03:36.940> has<00:03:37.209> been<00:03:37.450> a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
question that LeBron James has been a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.699 
question that LeBron James has been a
better<00:03:38.410> player<00:03:38.829> than<00:03:38.859> Kobe<00:03:39.459> Bryant<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.709> in

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
better player than Kobe Bryant so in

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.069 
better player than Kobe Bryant so in
that<00:03:41.980> way<00:03:42.220> LeBron<00:03:42.700> James<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.870> best

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
that way LeBron James is the best

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.030 
that way LeBron James is the best
