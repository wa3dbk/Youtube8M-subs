I think it's a very good piece of

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.890 
I think it's a very good piece of
equipment<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.460> helps<00:00:30.029> prevent<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> saddle

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
equipment that helps prevent the saddle

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.200 
equipment that helps prevent the saddle
from<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.949> underneath<00:00:32.279> your<00:00:32.640> horses<00:00:33.030> belly

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
from going underneath your horses belly

from going underneath your horses belly
scaring<00:00:34.170> them<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> death<00:00:34.469> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> fall<00:00:35.700> off

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
scaring them to death if you fall off

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.869 
scaring them to death if you fall off
the<00:00:35.940> lose<00:00:36.329> your<00:00:36.570> balance<00:00:37.250> it's<00:00:38.250> very

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the lose your balance it's very

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
the lose your balance it's very
important<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.530> adjust<00:00:40.950> your

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
important that you know you adjust your

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.549 
important that you know you adjust your
breast<00:00:41.340> call<00:00:41.610> properly<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.930> wanted<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> have

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
breast call properly you wanted to have

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.479 
breast call properly you wanted to have
how<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> above<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.520> shoulder<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:46.340> loosen<00:00:47.340> up

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
how to above the shoulder and loosen up

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.850 
how to above the shoulder and loosen up
here<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.660> when<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.320> four<00:00:49.530> strides

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
here so that when the four strides

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.130 
here so that when the four strides
forward<00:00:50.280> they're<00:00:50.940> not<00:00:51.149> running<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.809> this

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
forward they're not running into this

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.920 
forward they're not running into this
over<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> treeless<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:54.239> since

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
over time but with a treeless out since

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
over time but with a treeless out since
you<00:00:55.050> don't<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.500> tree<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.760> hugs<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
you don't have a tree that hugs the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.099 
you don't have a tree that hugs the
force<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:59.460> curves<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> force<00:01:00.930> of

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
force and it curves more to the force of

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.590 
force and it curves more to the force of
shape<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.039> helps<00:01:02.550> particularly<00:01:03.449> when

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
shape this helps particularly when

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.350 
shape this helps particularly when
you're<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.899> uphill<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.769> downhill<00:01:05.360> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you're going uphill and downhill the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
you're going uphill and downhill the
saddle<00:01:07.170> moving<00:01:07.680> back<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.369> forth<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.420> one

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
saddle moving back and forth because one

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.760 
saddle moving back and forth because one
of<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> things<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.260> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.439> find

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
of the things that you're going to find

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.219 
of the things that you're going to find
with<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> treeless<00:01:12.000> Alice<00:01:12.390> 20<00:01:12.720> horse<00:01:12.990> goes

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
with the treeless Alice 20 horse goes

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.730 
with the treeless Alice 20 horse goes
downhill<00:01:13.670> since<00:01:14.670> there's<00:01:14.970> no<00:01:15.210> saddle<00:01:15.740> tree

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
downhill since there's no saddle tree

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.490 
downhill since there's no saddle tree
that's<00:01:17.340> jamming<00:01:17.970> into<00:01:18.090> his<00:01:18.360> shoulders<00:01:18.930> your

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that's jamming into his shoulders your

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
that's jamming into his shoulders your
horse<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.490> freer<00:01:21.180> going

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
horse is going to be much freer going

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.649 
horse is going to be much freer going
down<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> hill<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.369> horses<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.360> feels

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
down the hill with my horses it feels

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
down the hill with my horses it feels
like<00:01:24.869> they're<00:01:25.049> running<00:01:25.229> down<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.770> when

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
like they're running down here when

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
like they're running down here when
they're<00:01:26.130> actually<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.869> floating<00:01:27.869> downhill

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
they're actually just floating downhill

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.899 
they're actually just floating downhill
and<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.890> wonderful<00:01:29.430> feeling

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
and it's a wonderful feeling

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
and it's a wonderful feeling
but<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> treats<00:01:30.659> out<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:31.110> keep<00:01:31.409> missing

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
but the treats out they keep missing

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.960 
but the treats out they keep missing
steps<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.600> bothering<00:01:34.200> them<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.970> like

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
steps because it's bothering them I like

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.210 
steps because it's bothering them I like
the<00:01:36.210> crapper<00:01:36.509> because<00:01:37.110> when<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:38.070> down

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the crapper because when I do go down

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.710 
the crapper because when I do go down
these<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.729> steep<00:01:38.970> hills<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.479> where<00:01:39.689> I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
these really steep hills because where I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.170 
these really steep hills because where I
live<00:01:40.020> by<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.259> go<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.799> down<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.729> keeps<00:01:42.000> the
