00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.110
 I'm scared 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.650
 There are 3 courses and there are 3 hoses respectively 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.650
 Along with the purpose to each of Koshu 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.579
 To the fact that the groom Mr. Science 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:44.539
 The homeroom teacher and were asked to immerse yourself to understand the personality of each student 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:50.600
 I will give you the appropriate advice for each 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:58.539
 You can question the teacher at any time if there is that you do not know in the staff room before browsing 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.539
 Many teachers use it because teachers also answer questions of each student eagerly 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:24.539
 Our motto is to decide on the course by sticking to the first choice 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:27.420
 We will support you to move on your own path without giving up until the end 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.940
 Supporting the set while 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:37.570
 Time management only manages time 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.680
 By setting a pretty goal and achieving that goal, the goal of the Lord is eventually 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.150
 Go out 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.150
 It is ready to be 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.550
 Minutes are always a place 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.120
 Never neglect this thing 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.580
 I believe in the wind that I want to work hard 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.159
 It is from then by all means if you can afford it 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.460
 If there is an intermediate person 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.840
 I grew up as a rich escape and my groom 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.040
 I'm thinking that I would like you to get an open graduation 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.890
 Including brass band club and large country 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.010
 It is a high school where club activities are very active 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.189
 I also belong to the basketball club 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.500
 I am working hard every day aiming for Kyoto Prefecture high rank 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:27.290
 In addition , I do my best to be able to concentrate on daily classes and to support them on a daily basis 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.680
 I would like to continue making club activities with the liver to those who are enjoying watching in any situation 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.680
 I'm sorry 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.819
 Through club activities 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:41.599
 Cultivation of rich humanity and 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.980
 The Fu called Do I send a fun school life we have be considered to players is good it is 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:48.069

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.069
 I think it would be nice if we could do club activities together
