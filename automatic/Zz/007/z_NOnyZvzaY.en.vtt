00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
pictures but that was 370 pounds so I

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.149

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.260 
guess with the other actors it could
have<00:01:05.250> come<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> something<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.240> I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
