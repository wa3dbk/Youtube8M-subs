00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.120 
like the orientation we're gonna want is
this<00:00:15.840> going<00:00:16.440> towards<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.890> motor<00:00:17.360> so<00:00:19.039> put<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
this going towards the motor so put it

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.920 
this going towards the motor so put it

twist counterclockwise so making the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.610 
twist counterclockwise so making the
plug<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:32.239> and<00:00:33.239> give<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.899> nice<00:00:34.020> twist<00:00:34.290> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
plug go down and give it a nice twist to
