00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
my favorite part of the game was the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.640 
my favorite part of the game was the
boss<00:02:21.060> battles<00:02:21.660> going<00:02:21.960> up<00:02:22.230> against

the<00:02:27.480> crap<00:02:27.690> out<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.500> various<00:02:28.920> gods<00:02:29.190> when<00:02:29.790> I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
the crap out of the various gods when I

I have to admit that I yelled at the
screen<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> lot<00:02:41.940> because<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.330> was<00:02:42.420> pissing<00:02:42.840> me

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
have been nice if the autosave just

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.630 
have been nice if the autosave just

the<00:03:11.880> next<00:03:12.150> thing<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.330> annoyed<00:03:12.720> me<00:03:12.750> was<00:03:12.930> how

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
the next thing that annoyed me was how

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.320 
the next thing that annoyed me was how
long<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.709> takes<00:03:13.920> Kratos<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.610> open<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.060> chest

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
long it takes Kratos to open the chest

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.479 
long it takes Kratos to open the chest
with<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.570> power-ups<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.290> orbs<00:03:16.709> maybe

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
with the power-ups and orbs maybe

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.250 
with the power-ups and orbs maybe
instead<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.880> using<00:03:18.180> one<00:03:18.480> hand<00:03:18.510> like<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> badass

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
instead of using one hand like a badass

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.410 
instead of using one hand like a badass
he<00:03:20.010> should<00:03:20.250> have<00:03:20.370> used<00:03:20.550> two<00:03:20.820> hands<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.330> we

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
he should have used two hands so we

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.420 
he should have used two hands so we
could<00:03:21.600> have<00:03:21.720> opened<00:03:21.959> them<00:03:22.290> faster<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:23.010> know<00:03:23.220> it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
could have opened them faster I know it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.400 
could have opened them faster I know it
uses<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.940> hands<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.480> bigger<00:03:24.690> ones<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.350> I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
uses to hands and the bigger ones but I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.870 
uses to hands and the bigger ones but I
still<00:03:25.680> think<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.070> should<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.489> been<00:03:26.670> an

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
still think it should have been an

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.479 
still think it should have been an
overall<00:03:27.300> faster<00:03:27.810> process<00:03:28.350> since<00:03:28.890> sometimes<00:03:29.340> I

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
overall faster process since sometimes I

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.310 
overall faster process since sometimes I
really<00:03:29.790> needed<00:03:30.090> more<00:03:30.420> help<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.110> took

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
really needed more help and it took

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.740 
really needed more help and it took
forever<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:32.190> get<00:03:32.610> them<00:03:32.850> open<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.450> was

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
forever to get them open it was

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.930 
forever to get them open it was
especially<00:03:34.350> annoying<00:03:34.890> when<00:03:35.190> enemies<00:03:35.610> were

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
especially annoying when enemies were

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.600 
especially annoying when enemies were
attacking<00:03:36.330> me<00:03:36.510> from<00:03:36.840> behind<00:03:37.020> also<00:03:37.860> I<00:03:38.100> thought

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
attacking me from behind also I thought

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.160 
attacking me from behind also I thought
it<00:03:38.760> was<00:03:38.850> lame<00:03:39.120> how<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.390> had<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.600> be<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:40.020> the

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
it was lame how you had to be on the

mode take that much longer some parts of
the<00:04:06.900> game<00:04:07.019> took<00:04:07.290> some<00:04:07.500> figuring<00:04:08.040> out<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.910> I

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
the game took some figuring out and so I

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.600 
the game took some figuring out and so I
died<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.330> lot<00:04:09.660> which<00:04:10.530> caused<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.100> game<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> ask

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
died a lot which caused the game to ask

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.640 
died a lot which caused the game to ask
me<00:04:11.910> if<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.120> wanted<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.450> play<00:04:12.660> an<00:04:12.810> easy<00:04:13.019> instead

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
me if I wanted to play an easy instead

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.880 
me if I wanted to play an easy instead
which<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.489> thought<00:04:14.730> was<00:04:14.940> really<00:04:15.360> annoying<00:04:16.019> if<00:04:16.410> I

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
which I thought was really annoying if I

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.680 
which I thought was really annoying if I
wanted<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.250> play<00:04:17.520> an<00:04:17.669> easy<00:04:17.850> then<00:04:18.270> I<00:04:18.299> would<00:04:18.570> have

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
wanted to play an easy then I would have

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.890 
wanted to play an easy then I would have
just<00:04:18.720> chose<00:04:19.229> easy

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
just chose easy

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.200 
just chose easy
I<00:04:20.139> like<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.829> they<00:04:21.009> give<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.579> option<00:04:21.790> but

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
I like that they give you the option but

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.580 
I like that they give you the option but
I<00:04:22.240> also<00:04:22.540> think<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:22.930> they<00:04:23.169> should<00:04:23.199> have<00:04:23.470> just

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
I also think that they should have just

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.860 
I also think that they should have just
put<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.889> option<00:04:24.310> in<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.550> pause<00:04:24.759> menu<00:04:25.090> instead

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
put the option in the pause menu instead

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.840 
put the option in the pause menu instead
of<00:04:26.080> bugging<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.620> about<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:27.100> every<00:04:27.400> like<00:04:27.580> five

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
of bugging you about it every like five

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.969 
of bugging you about it every like five
deaths<00:04:28.270> or<00:04:28.539> so<00:04:28.780> but<00:04:29.110> really<00:04:29.500> those<00:04:29.710> are<00:04:29.740> just

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
deaths or so but really those are just

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.950 
deaths or so but really those are just
nitpicks<00:04:30.550> compared<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.150> how<00:04:31.270> awesome<00:04:31.780> the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
nitpicks compared to how awesome the

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.080 
nitpicks compared to how awesome the
game<00:04:32.139> is<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.800> trophies<00:04:33.280> were<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.520> lot<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.850> fun

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090
