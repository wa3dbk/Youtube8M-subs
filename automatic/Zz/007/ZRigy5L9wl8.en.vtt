having a hard time separating like

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.100 
having a hard time separating like
copper<00:03:40.380> wire<00:03:41.000> from<00:03:42.000> my<00:03:42.300> Fox<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.570> think<00:03:45.960> I

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
copper wire from my Fox but I think I

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.550 
copper wire from my Fox but I think I
managed<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.650> do<00:03:46.920> that

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.699 

then<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.310> wire<00:03:50.580> comes<00:03:51.090> forward<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:52.170> secure

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
then the wire comes forward to secure

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.110 
then the wire comes forward to secure
that<00:03:52.920> hackle

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.490

you<00:04:48.800> could<00:04:49.010> use<00:04:49.220> a<00:04:49.250> color<00:04:49.669> to<00:04:50.000> match<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:51.639> just

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
you could use a color to match I just

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.100 
you could use a color to match I just
happen<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.030> like<00:04:53.210> white<00:04:53.510> it's<00:04:53.780> kind<00:04:54.020> of

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110

could<00:05:54.330> call<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.810> tail<00:05:57.919> you<00:05:58.919> trim<00:05:59.250> it<00:05:59.400> off

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
could call it a tail you trim it off

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.780 
could call it a tail you trim it off
there<00:05:59.820> you<00:05:59.970> spread<00:06:00.300> it<00:06:00.330> out<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:04.919> if<00:06:05.610> you're

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
there you spread it out and if you're

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.030 
there you spread it out and if you're
fishing<00:06:06.030> really<00:06:07.020> soft<00:06:07.320> we're<00:06:07.530> almost<00:06:07.620> versus
