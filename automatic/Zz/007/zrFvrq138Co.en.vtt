masterpiece<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> I'm<00:00:37.739> explain<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> profile

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
masterpiece so I'm explain the profile

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.209 
masterpiece so I'm explain the profile
briefly<00:00:39.260> basically<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.440> did<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:40.890> simply

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
briefly basically what I did was simply

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.049 
briefly basically what I did was simply
connect<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> bird<00:00:42.750> 5000<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:43.590> pc<00:00:44.100> run<00:00:44.309> the

connect the bird 5000 to my pc run the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.240 
connect the bird 5000 to my pc run the
software<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.079> there's<00:00:46.980> an<00:00:47.100> option

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
software for it and there's an option

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.360 
software for it and there's an option

the machine to the controller which I
did<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.860> profile<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.070> use<00:00:56.219> for

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
did and this is a profile that I use for

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.180 
did and this is a profile that I use for
the<00:00:56.520> bird<00:00:56.699> 4000<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> bird<00:00:58.469> 5000

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190

to<00:00:59.340> deplete<00:00:59.760> lee<00:00:59.850> different<00:01:00.180> machines<00:01:00.510> with

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
to deplete lee different machines with

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.389 
to deplete lee different machines with
different<00:01:01.020> setup<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.219> using

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
different setup so going to be using

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.600 
different setup so going to be using
different<00:01:02.850> temperatures<00:01:04.280> let's<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.460> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
different temperatures let's see this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.290 
different temperatures let's see this
where<00:01:05.820> it's<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.060> blurry

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.330 

and<00:01:13.300> it<00:01:13.570> was<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.810> only<00:01:13.930> change<00:01:14.620> i<00:01:14.830> made<00:01:14.860> was<00:01:15.190> to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
and it was the only change i made was to

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.240 
and it was the only change i made was to
the<00:01:15.460> last<00:01:15.670> slope<00:01:16.140> increased<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.520> temperature

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the last slope increased the temperature

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.800 
the last slope increased the temperature
from<00:01:21.250> I<00:01:21.640> believe<00:01:22.090> was<00:01:22.270> set<00:01:22.480> for<00:01:22.680> 174<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.880> 230

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
from I believe was set for 174 to 230

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.320 
from I believe was set for 174 to 230
Celsius<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.590> increased<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.580> time<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.150> 80

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
Celsius and increased the time to 80

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.830 
Celsius and increased the time to 80
seconds<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.760> basically<00:01:30.760> that's<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.720> that

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
seconds and basically that's it and that

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.270 
seconds and basically that's it and that
gives<00:01:31.990> me<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> target<00:01:32.500> temperature<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.190> I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
gives me a target temperature that I

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.470 
gives me a target temperature that I
want<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.550> reach<00:01:33.700> on<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.000> chip<00:01:34.180> which<00:01:34.360> i

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
want to reach on the chip which i

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.260 
want to reach on the chip which i
calibrated<00:01:35.050> with<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:36.160> digital<00:01:36.430> thermometer<00:01:36.670> at

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
calibrated with a digital thermometer at

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.000 
calibrated with a digital thermometer at
about<00:01:37.450> 185<00:01:40.230> this<00:01:41.230> is<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.410> board<00:01:41.680> that's<00:01:41.770> been

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
about 185 this is a board that's been

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.580 
about 185 this is a board that's been
previously<00:01:42.460> worked<00:01:42.730> on<00:01:42.910> so<00:01:43.330> therefore<00:01:43.870> I

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
previously worked on so therefore I

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.060 
previously worked on so therefore I
suspect<00:01:45.490> there's<00:01:45.670> some<00:01:46.770> spent<00:01:47.770> flux

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
suspect there's some spent flux

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.160 
suspect there's some spent flux
underneath<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.729> GPU<00:01:49.210> it's<00:01:49.660> going<00:01:49.900> to<00:01:49.990> get<00:01:50.080> an

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
underneath the GPU it's going to get an

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.360 
underneath the GPU it's going to get an
ultrasonic<00:01:50.620> bath<00:01:51.010> while<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.550> get<00:01:51.790> started<00:01:53.370> set

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
ultrasonic bath while I get started set

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:09.400 
ultrasonic bath while I get started set
the<00:01:54.460> machine<00:01:54.729> for<00:01:54.940> about<00:01:55.180> an<00:01:55.300> hour

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.660 

ok<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.530> ran<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.160> through<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
ok I just ran this through the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.479 
ok I just ran this through the
ultrasonic<00:02:12.600> cleaner<00:02:12.810> for<00:02:13.050> about<00:02:13.230> an<00:02:13.380> hour

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
ultrasonic cleaner for about an hour

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.890 
ultrasonic cleaner for about an hour
rinsed<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.580> off<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> hot<00:02:15.090> tap<00:02:15.330> water<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
rinsed it off with a hot tap water and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.900 
rinsed it off with a hot tap water and
sprayed<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.010> water<00:02:17.220> off<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:17.640> an<00:02:17.760> air

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
sprayed the water off with an air

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.000 
sprayed the water off with an air
compressor<00:02:18.140> now<00:02:19.140> i'm<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:19.410> letting<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.709> dry

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
compressor now i'm just letting it dry

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.300 
compressor now i'm just letting it dry
