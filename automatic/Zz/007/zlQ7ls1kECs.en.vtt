with your host kmac time now I've

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.800 
with your host kmac time now I've
already<00:00:17.550> got<00:00:17.700> a<00:00:17.790> theory<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
already got a theory on this and I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.330 
already got a theory on this and I
thought<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.530> was<00:00:19.650> really<00:00:19.800> good<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.160> thought

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
thought it was really good but I thought

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.710 
thought it was really good but I thought
this<00:00:20.730> theory<00:00:20.940> is<00:00:21.030> really<00:00:21.120> cool<00:00:21.390> too<00:00:21.540> so<00:00:21.690> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
this theory is really cool too so I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.240 
this theory is really cool too so I
thought<00:00:21.870> I<00:00:21.900> would<00:00:22.050> share<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.440> guys<00:00:22.500> so

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
thought I would share with you guys so

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.470 
thought I would share with you guys so
because<00:00:23.520> I'm<00:00:23.610> not<00:00:23.730> seeing<00:00:23.940> that<00:00:24.060> first<00:00:24.240> year<00:00:24.420> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
because I'm not seeing that first year I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.550 
because I'm not seeing that first year I
did<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.810> I'll<00:00:24.960> leave<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.110> link<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.470> the

in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.940> video<00:00:27.150> go<00:00:27.750> check<00:00:27.780> that<00:00:28.080> theory<00:00:28.290> out<00:00:28.350> as

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
in the video go check that theory out as

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.810 
in the video go check that theory out as
well<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:28.920> let's<00:00:29.310> go<00:00:29.400> ahead<00:00:29.430> and<00:00:29.640> jump<00:00:29.760> right

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
well but let's go ahead and jump right

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.910 
well but let's go ahead and jump right
into<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.350> cartoon<00:00:31.350> conspiracy<00:00:31.740> theory

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
into this cartoon conspiracy theory

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.590 
into this cartoon conspiracy theory
about<00:00:32.039> Foster<00:00:32.699> Home<00:00:32.789> for<00:00:32.879> Imaginary<00:00:32.999> Friends

about Foster Home for Imaginary Friends

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
now I know I say this about every

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.009 
now I know I say this about every
cartoon<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.609> seems<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.879> this<00:00:36.059> was<00:00:36.629> a<00:00:36.719> really

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
cartoon it seems like this was a really

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.899 
cartoon it seems like this was a really
cool<00:00:37.230> cartoon<00:00:37.469> I'll<00:00:37.769> enjoy<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.429> cartoon<00:00:38.760> as

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:38.909 
cool cartoon I'll enjoy this cartoon as

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.239 
cool cartoon I'll enjoy this cartoon as
a<00:00:38.940> kid<00:00:39.210> both<00:00:39.749> of<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.469> theory<00:00:40.710> argues<00:00:41.070> is

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249 
a kid both of what the theory argues is

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.340 
a kid both of what the theory argues is
that<00:00:41.280> Frankie<00:00:42.030> who<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> redheaded<00:00:42.870> one

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
that Frankie who was the redheaded one

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.110 
that Frankie who was the redheaded one
our<00:00:43.469> third<00:00:43.620> gun<00:00:43.769> familiar<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.219> Madame<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.999> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
our third gun familiar is Madame is a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.910 
our third gun familiar is Madame is a
younger<00:00:45.420> version<00:00:45.749> of<00:00:45.809> Madame<00:00:46.140> Foster<00:00:46.679> who<00:00:46.800> was

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
younger version of Madame Foster who was

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
younger version of Madame Foster who was
the<00:00:47.039> old<00:00:47.190> lady<00:00:47.280> right<00:00:47.550> there<00:00:47.609> and<00:00:48.140> basically

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the old lady right there and basically

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
the old lady right there and basically
the<00:00:49.469> theory<00:00:49.710> goes<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:49.949> to<00:00:50.039> argue<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.339> Madame

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the theory goes on to argue that Madame

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.799 
the theory goes on to argue that Madame
Foster<00:00:51.949> imagined<00:00:52.949> Frankie<00:00:53.729> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> younger

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
Foster imagined Frankie to be a younger

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
Foster imagined Frankie to be a younger
version<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.260> herself<00:00:55.409> to<00:00:56.159> take<00:00:56.370> over<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
version of herself to take over the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.379 
version of herself to take over the
house<00:00:57.809> once<00:00:58.350> she<00:00:58.499> is<00:00:58.679> too<00:00:59.519> old<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:00.030> take<00:01:00.179> care

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389 
house once she is too old to take care

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:01.790 
house once she is too old to take care
of<00:01:00.420> herself<00:01:00.659> she<00:01:00.899> cares<00:01:01.229> deeply<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
of herself she cares deeply about the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.469 
of herself she cares deeply about the
imaginary<00:01:02.249> friends<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.729> the<00:01:03.089> house<00:01:03.269> which

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
imaginary friends in the house which

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.030 
imaginary friends in the house which
cares<00:01:03.690> deeply<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:04.019> their<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.500> being<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
cares deeply about their well being and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.819 
cares deeply about their well being and
she<00:01:05.309> does<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> herself<00:01:06.540> being<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.350> old<00:01:07.590> will

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
she does that herself being so old will

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.260 
she does that herself being so old will
not<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.040> able<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> take<00:01:08.790> care<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.149> by

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
not be able to take care of it by

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.770 
not be able to take care of it by
herself

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
herself

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.569 
herself
for<00:01:09.960> very<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.200> longer<00:01:10.259> hence<00:01:11.159> why<00:01:11.340> she

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
for very much longer hence why she

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.940 
for very much longer hence why she
imagined<00:01:12.240> herself<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:13.020> younger<00:01:13.619> version<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
imagined herself a younger version of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.039 
imagined herself a younger version of
herself<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.460> take<00:01:14.670> care<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.969> the<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
herself to take care of the in the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.380 
herself to take care of the in the
future<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.950> Frankie<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> real<00:01:18.180> person

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
future so Frankie is not a real person

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.749 
future so Frankie is not a real person
she<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.899> an<00:01:19.049> imaginary<00:01:19.680> character<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.700> like

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
she is an imaginary character just like

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
she is an imaginary character just like
blue<00:01:21.149> just<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.600> wilt<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.320> any<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> other

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
blue just like wilt or any of the other

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.889 
blue just like wilt or any of the other
characters<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.700> house<00:01:23.880> she<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.329> imaginary

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
characters in the house she is imaginary

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.330 
characters in the house she is imaginary
and<00:01:25.200> there's<00:01:25.649> some<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:25.890> cool<00:01:26.039> evidence

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and there's some pretty cool evidence

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.230 
and there's some pretty cool evidence
for<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.640> well<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:26.969> one<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
for that as well and one of the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.520 
for that as well and one of the
strongest<00:01:27.539> points<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> theory<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
strongest points of the theory is that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
strongest points of the theory is that
Frankie<00:01:28.920> never<00:01:29.159> has<00:01:29.490> any<00:01:29.789> imaginary<00:01:30.210> friends

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
Frankie never has any imaginary friends

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
Frankie never has any imaginary friends
of<00:01:30.689> her<00:01:30.780> own<00:01:31.020> nor<00:01:31.680> does<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.399> show<00:01:32.549> allude<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
of her own nor does the show allude to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.179 
of her own nor does the show allude to
any<00:01:33.270> possibility<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.380> her<00:01:34.530> making<00:01:34.829> up<00:01:35.070> her<00:01:35.159> own

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
any possibility of her making up her own

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.170 
any possibility of her making up her own
imaginary<00:01:35.700> friend

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
imaginary friend

on<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.219> date<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.670> an<00:01:41.759> actual<00:01:42.090> human<00:01:42.210> being<00:01:42.539> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
on a date with an actual human being and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
on a date with an actual human being and
that<00:01:43.469> could<00:01:43.679> be<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.039> know<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
that could be you know kind of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.039 
that could be you know kind of
misconstrued<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.179> little<00:01:45.390> bit<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.840> facts

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
misconstrued a little bit but the facts

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.289 
misconstrued a little bit but the facts
are<00:01:46.289> that<00:01:46.530> she<00:01:47.009> may<00:01:47.219> be<00:01:47.520> unaware<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.969> she's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
are that she may be unaware that she's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
are that she may be unaware that she's
imaginary<00:01:48.840> or<00:01:48.990> what<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.920> consider<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
imaginary or what I like to consider is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
imaginary or what I like to consider is
that<00:01:50.759> she<00:01:50.969> just<00:01:51.149> likes<00:01:51.450> humans<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.320> know

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that she just likes humans you know

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
that she just likes humans you know
there's<00:01:52.649> several<00:01:52.859> incidents<00:01:53.789> in<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.119> show

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
there's several incidents in this show

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.569 
there's several incidents in this show
where<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.710> imaginary<00:01:56.100> friends<00:01:56.399> have

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
where you know imaginary friends have

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.669 
where you know imaginary friends have
crushes<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.210> actual<00:01:57.630> humans<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.530> could

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
crushes on actual humans so this could

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.349 
crushes on actual humans so this could
just<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.829> another<00:01:58.950> instance<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.609> that<00:01:59.670> making

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
just be another instance of that making

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.510 
just be another instance of that making
this<00:02:00.509> an<00:02:00.869> invalid<00:02:01.649> counter-argument<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
this an invalid counter-argument to the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.279 
this an invalid counter-argument to the
theory<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:02.939> that's<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.659> believe<00:02:04.079> is

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
theory and that's what I believe is

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.590 
theory and that's what I believe is
going<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.679> here<00:02:04.950> another<00:02:05.909> important<00:02:06.450> thing<00:02:06.539> to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
going on here another important thing to

going on here another important thing to
point<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.429> explain<00:02:08.909> why

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
point out is this would explain why

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.699 
point out is this would explain why
