00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:13.929
 the character itself 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.669

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.630
 in the us remains in place i think that 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.780
 will say sorry 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.470

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.899
 in the workshop measure 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.489

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.869

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.279
 some parts of the human body 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.239
