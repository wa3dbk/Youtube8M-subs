secure against the leaves then we're

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.810 
secure against the leaves then we're
going<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.030> add<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.320> next<00:02:41.519> rosebuds

an inch and a half down the wire so it

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.900 
an inch and a half down the wire so it
sets<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:43.920> little<00:03:44.190> bit<00:03:44.310> higher<00:03:44.580> on<00:03:44.850> the

backwards so it kind of frames the roses

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.440 
backwards so it kind of frames the roses
so<00:04:03.570> bend<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.990> back<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.200> little<00:04:04.440> bit<00:04:04.710> and<00:04:05.270> tape<00:04:06.270> it
