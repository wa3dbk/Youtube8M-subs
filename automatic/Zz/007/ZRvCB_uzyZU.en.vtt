00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.270
 that is, he went for that door to the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.690
 chapel 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.690
 thank you 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.709

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.810
 we lacked only sincere killer croc 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.810
 access to the execution who is 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:39.890
 closed with inspected perfect chapel 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.890
 from my mother's prison 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.770
 there is a challenge in the church here it is 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:01.700
 what an evening just killed 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:10.569
 if you want me to know another one well 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.569
 alive or this is not fun 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.660
 this is all here 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.820
 I need to know that alone 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.820
 my joy 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.900
 provides just both in that 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:49.630
 fear that if we are both thank you 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:53.470
 to gold surrender you have lost strength 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.470
 joker advantage 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.269
 massacred 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:15.389
 children to repeat their own burst 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.050
 and why you do not you will 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:25.050
 like how it makes you feel 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.600
 strength beautiful beat me until you 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:41.480
 your knuckles bleed because you finish it 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.480
 there you know there is only one way to stop me 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:06.270
 my men would have killed this one 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.630
 city ​​deserves better 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:16.240
 that is, my daughter considers you a hero but 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:26.170
 I still have to stop where they are 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:29.460
 in the chapel we play like me 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.460
 they helped 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:39.010
 I have helped or better done a whole a 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:41.680
 ask me why I did n't arrest him but now 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.070
 I know the truth is that I left it 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:49.060
 go just for you because you believe in 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.500
 I don't know they put me in charge of a 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.490
 police station full of policemen 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.220
 corrupt and I can't change them 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.320
 just like I can't change this 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:05.140
 damn city party 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.140
 or at least that's what I thought 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:20.430
 cardiac arrest and hilarious beautiful move 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:26.689
 we'll have fun 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.689
 a world 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:35.309
 but maybe maybe I can give them something 

00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:35.309
 to believe in 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.660
 maybe he can give them something where 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.660
 to believe 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.930
 mom my boys what a beautiful ending 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.940
 beautiful I thought a clash a little more 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.530
 just manesco with joker lend 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.680
 really frank also because then joker 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:13.850
 it's not really one by fists 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.310
 fighting and one that goes to 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.530
 do all those planning those ones 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.030
 attack those devastations those 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.720
 explosions so it's not really one 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:26.090
 from the final attacks really 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.650
 beautiful I had on the end when 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.660
 presents said must give it 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.510
 something to believe in was 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.030
 really beautiful came to mind 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:37.990
 film banks I've seen is really 

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:41.180

 comments for the appreciation unfortunately 

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.990
 you have seen that in the sense that on this 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.940
 kind of games play little so me 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.530
 I still have to get carried away because 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.169
 he knew the game mainly to 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.880
 shooter though since he told me 

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:00.740

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.960
 many other games that interest me and 

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.270

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.710
 they'll even manage to get better 

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.620
 the gameplay 

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:12.200
 let me know if you have played 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:15.620
