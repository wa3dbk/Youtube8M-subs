00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.780
 To take night portrait shots 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.630
 I think I found the presidents. 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.879
 This building 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.329
 dawn 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:13.289
 Until the first leg 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.189
 Our pool is originally faded, but now it's been a mess through the car. 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.800
 a This street light on the left is a street light 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 Live pitch 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.189
 It seems to be a point of some background 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.569
 And in the case of derivation, it is now time for comrades 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:32.179
 Getting harder 

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:35.670
 What 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.290
 I do not think the exposure will be worse. 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.020
 The north side and the meaning 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.020
 I do not know if I can support you. 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.800
 Time on the shoulder is about seven hours 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.980
 For that reason 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 I took the water out a little. Especially today China can 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.190
 There seems to be. 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.060
 In the case of Korea 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.970
 In this way, 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.280
 There are a few places that are lacking. 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.299
 If you look at 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.660
 Down to 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.040
 This is a little mountain 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 But when you estimate it to be 10,000 won, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.830
 If it is 30 million won, 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.630
 Acting 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.659
 I think I can build a character. 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.000
 It's also highlighted. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 When you go up 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.340
 If there is a figure about this time, it will be okay. 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.660
 And to the left or right, 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.660
 Infinite Challenge - 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.410
 I do not know what to do. 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.689
 etn 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.619
 In the second half of the year, 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.180
 I think it's ok to install 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.789
 And 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.769
 What do you see 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.729
 In the model system 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:13.459
 Reflected 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 burglar 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.609
 If you keep what you put 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.839
 Spread over 10,000 model spindles, 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.309
 Probably not visible 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.709
 I think it's Spansion. 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.419
 Still ready 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.299
 Tomorrow's about tomorrow 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.599
 I have a Halo program.
