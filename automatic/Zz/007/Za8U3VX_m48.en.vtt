00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.909

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.410
 all our colleagues who we otherwise never see who they are not all together so now 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.839
 a year of great fun 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:51.199
 and what times do we have for years I just have much better 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.539
 prices with a watch 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:53.669
 yes because the 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.269
 We are back in the SME animals yes I am still up to date 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.010
 speak also look but I am from now I am now 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.670
 I will tell you that the fire brigade reported the children expecting again 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.839
 thus chance of mist or not 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.749
 but I am cloudy and have a chance of some light rain 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.010
 there it stays at temperatures 3 to 7 degrees 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.609
 little wind a killer 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.000
 it will be another typical Thursday and then with a lot of clouds and the north 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.820
 still have a chance of a better one and in the south maybe a bit of a sun 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:28.730
 Yes it is a bit to count for and the temperature is around 8 or 9 degrees 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.750
 later to find an all that southeast that Monday will be there along the coast and you 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.699
 state if all sails go a little bit so 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.330
 this is true 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.900
 we know you enjoy the test a bit 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.860
 it awkward but after fifteen turn to consideration 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.940
 it is the falling thaw to see us on the channel 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.020
 We are now going to look at the weather of Sunday that will be a day with occasional 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.820
 sun but I am wrong in our resistance in the north it remains 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.320
 cloudy 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.100
 in the northwest of Poland 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.020
 and the temperature was around 7 degrees and a strong wind from the east 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.200
 Northeast powerful wise artist think that it will be colder 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.789
 it can be closed again 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.270
 what a difference with the police becomes too passive in the eighties then 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.759
 known if Johan weeks more and more wintry weather type first of all Monday one 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.599
 temperature around 6 degrees 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.160
 maybe one degree above zero in the night while we are all days 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.789
 if we could go on Tuesday then we would go in a number when grant frost we have 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.129
 Thursday a little rain and Wednesday 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.969
 also a bit of rain 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.179
 with the winter showers I don't only think about the everything 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:40.579
 daytime temperatures around 4 degrees m in some light frosts so chances are 

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:44.619
 smoothness and I think next Thursday we will also be more and more wintry 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:47.860
 showers get happy with quick 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.000
 yes solace gull is fueling feyenoord had to be made soggy 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.910
 in the natural 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.689
 with a deal 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.050
 also supports after another umpteenth 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.889
 but the winter weather still holds a girls' school I think we are going to 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:05.879
 performing for tomorrow 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.249
 First of all the outdoor sport then we get six has to do with a little bit

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:18.069
 for the cyclists further there is the position it is now worth what little wind 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.999
 we can get nice men out there for the sun and steal 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:26.869
