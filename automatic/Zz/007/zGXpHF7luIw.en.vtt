00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 they all know guys welcome back to everything 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.460
 wrong I am Nicola and today we talk 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.370
 to make it look like the seafaring vein 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.040
 the school in short yes because there is a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.460
 boy among you wrote me how 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.250
 never 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.490
 in my part it is said to sail and he 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.359
 it is Sardinian from around the Puglia Molise 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.779
 abruzzo is said to make the loaf ok 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.699
 in Lombardy it is called scavallare or jam 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 it seems because they are ahead of those of the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.890
 lombardy already takes terms 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.230
 English and Italianize in short, like 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.850
 never are all these ways of saying e 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.620
 how did they expand so the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.629
 problematic is that there are so many ways 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 to say but they are so regional 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.370
 geographically localized that is easy 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.309
 there is probably an answer 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.539
 been some van he has 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.359
 created this or these terms is 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.549
 then saw that they were cute from da 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.159
 repeat all others throughout the club 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.250
 of sheep because we know that at school 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.040
 you create this the sheep club has 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.830
 started repeating this this 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.680
 term so that the sheep has 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.040
 began to bleat all together 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.970
 happens happens so their kids 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.790
 terms that I found now welcome 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.380
 i read someone there is also do gallows that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.250
 they should be used in Tuscany 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.040
 exactly like cutting or firing 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.480
 there are term terms that are strange from 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.090
 to say that 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.430
 that do not even link to the fact that 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.730
 skip school somehow because 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.100
 to fuck we can raise a 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.850
 term an Italian term 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.250
 but in fact the basic term e 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.430
 to marinate the school this is kind 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.260
 national what to do if you say a little 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.230
 all the parties indeed let me know in the 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.810
 comments if you say even in yours 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.630
 but let's say from in my area it is 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.660
 always said to make the vein of the six 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.350
 let's always be a branch let's go to 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.710
 baretto so we do the zanatta yes 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.410
 also says those terms that rightly 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.560
 I tell you naza naza we say wet 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.470
 wet however actually means 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.480
 drunk drunkies then it depends on how it is 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.970
 use okay the outside a small one 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 brackets to make you understand how much 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.130
 terms change from region to region 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.200
 let me know in the post in your country 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.630
 in your region in short 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.480
 place of dwelling as they say 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.850
 to marinate the school because in my opinion 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.810
 we'll see and read some good ones here 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.320
 under 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.410
 also this time I end up with the 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.220
 say that probably if it seems to you 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.410
 quite right 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.520
 all wrong but wrong there is not 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.880
 nothing except making pylon can do saw 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.739
 or make gallows or cut I did not go 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.760
 I have no idea to the woodsmen 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.760
 and this is all people
