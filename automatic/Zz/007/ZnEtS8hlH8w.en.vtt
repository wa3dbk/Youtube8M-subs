against the siege the Mongols you new

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.920 
against the siege the Mongols you new
technology<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.710> dwell<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.090> there<00:01:48.360> which

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
technology is dwell you there which

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.170 
technology is dwell you there which
caused<00:01:50.000> 500<00:01:51.000> wood<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.590> 450<00:01:52.590> gold<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> that's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
caused 500 wood and 450 gold so that's

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.060 
caused 500 wood and 450 gold so that's
actually<00:01:54.390> quite<00:01:54.869> cheap<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.470> comparison<00:01:55.950> to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
actually quite cheap and comparison to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.420 
actually quite cheap and comparison to
most<00:01:56.369> other<00:01:56.549> unique<00:01:57.259> technologies<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
most other unique technologies so if I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.490 
most other unique technologies so if I
get<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.729> that<00:02:00.149> gives<00:02:00.450> an<00:02:00.659> extra<00:02:01.020> fifty

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
get that that gives an extra fifty

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.910 
get that that gives an extra fifty
percent<00:02:01.799> speed<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.909> see<00:02:03.329> workshop<00:02:04.049> units<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
percent speed to see workshop units so

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.219 
percent speed to see workshop units so
not<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> trebuchet<00:02:05.939> just<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> c2<00:02:06.899> workshop

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
not the trebuchet just the c2 workshop

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.979 
not the trebuchet just the c2 workshop
unit<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> I've<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.030> gotta<00:02:09.360> figure<00:02:09.539> upgraded

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
unit so I've just gotta figure upgraded

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.510 
unit so I've just gotta figure upgraded
now<00:02:10.379> sees<00:02:10.709> Ram<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.459> moving<00:02:11.910> much<00:02:12.270> faster

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
now sees Ram it's moving much faster

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.090 
now sees Ram it's moving much faster
and<00:02:13.670> it's<00:02:13.850> easy<00:02:14.030> onager<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:15.320> now<00:02:15.500> moves<00:02:15.680> much

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
and it's easy onager it now moves much

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.830 
and it's easy onager it now moves much
faster<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.060> same<00:02:17.420> with<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.690> heavy

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
faster and the same with the heavy

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.500 
faster and the same with the heavy
scorpion<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.150> ability<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.780> move<00:02:21.010> all

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
scorpion so this ability to move all

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.970 
scorpion so this ability to move all
these<00:02:23.510> workshop<00:02:23.960> units<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.500> fifty<00:02:24.770> percent

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
these workshop units of fifty percent

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.000 
these workshop units of fifty percent
faster<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:26.390> have<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.720> manga<00:02:27.260> die<00:02:27.410> as<00:02:27.620> an
