00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.879
 They were at the pediatrician because her baby 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.699
 she does not feel well and cries 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:17.660
 Three liquid chairs a day count her 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.130
 Pediatrician has diagnosed diarrhea 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.910
 Diarrhea disfigured by a virus 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.349
 or by unwanted bacteria that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 usually happens in 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.480
 Digestive tract of a put baby 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.600
 the drunk milk passes through the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.380
 esophagus in the stomach and then in the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.829
 small intestine 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.629
 there are the nutrients of enzymes 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.149
 split up and reach through the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.309
 the bloodstream did not bleed the intestines 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.129
 completely on split nutrients 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.010
 get into the colon the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.440
 the main task of the colon is water 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.780
 to be separated from the leftover food 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.140
 to put you in a half-tight chair 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.170
 At the same time, the colon is in 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.510
 the location and water again in order to deliver 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.540
 so the water content of the chair too 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.670
 regulate 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.950
 that is the process when the movements 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.689
 your baby's bowel are regular 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.420
 he has baby diarrhea is the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.030
 digestive tract with a virus or with 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.579
 unwanted bacteria infects the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.640
 the so-called micro willi in the gut 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.549
 impair 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.799
 too much water remains in the chyme 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.350
 this speeds up the bowel motions and 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.960
 the enzymes prevent the nutrients from doing so 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.789
 split 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.549
 as soon as the inadequately digested 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.229
 will come colon in the chyme 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.259
 this too much water on 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.259
 This makes the chair even more fluid 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.619
 what is the most important thing for solutions 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.820
 is the liquid loss again 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.759
 compensate 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.700
 continue or leave your baby 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.039
 Give your baby an oral reputations 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.810
 drink solution 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.630
 In addition, certain probiotic 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.819
 Bacteria in special foods help the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.540
 regulate bowel movement 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.150
 These good bacteria make viruses and 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.830
 unwanted bacteria harmless us 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.880
 supported the growth of 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.049
 Microwave in the small intestine 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.860
 thus the intestinal movements become 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.069
 slower 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.260
 the nutrients are split up 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.049
 Water balance of the colon is 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.849
 balanced and the chair is not 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:40.590
 more fluid your baby feels better 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.590
 ask your pediatrician to do that
