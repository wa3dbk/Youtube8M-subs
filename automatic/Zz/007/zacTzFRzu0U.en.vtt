00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.100
 poor they presented an explanation 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.269
 Interesting bazán 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.029
 it's called solute 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.489
 i what does what it promises 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:15.379
 6 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.279
 that analyzes 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.650
 the start of the system 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.659
 i help us down 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.869
 We decided not to do it more fair 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.189
 in different ways 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.189
 so that it was installed that the recent here good 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.339
 it works say mandate 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.339
 the next time I restart the computer 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.670
 I do not think it is advisable to do it by accident in any place of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.970
 brotherhood d leave it quiet 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.560
 that is to say how long it takes to start I love 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.420
 in my case as it has not detected that they employed that it takes a minute fifty 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.630
 and one minute 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
 but one minute after the second and weighs 75 kilos 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.740
 lombi interesting is the system that has to move towards this year 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.870
 vodafone 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.610
 there are some that can not be moved 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.600
 48s contract that occupies most of the time 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.410
 are required by the system 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.550
 17 second in 17 explicit they do is potentially 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.710
 and some that you do not have to think about it 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.890
 cely to accept quietly 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950
 think it's urgent according to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.950
 and is that you only vote neat with the computer and good 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.700
 it seems that it is not bad 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 an acceptable time 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.830
 falabella sa work 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.720
 after exhausting nadal 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
 but I like the system you have to teach 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.960
 you are above 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 I want them 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 and he is giving you the information 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.600
 such a cozumel load 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 It explains what is going 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.440
 after the recommendation made by the mayor 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.800
 in the case of the super fear of receiving vital calls 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.320
 has two things 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.010
 to use it 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.240
 it's worth what it does 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.510
 it is not so alarming 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.110
 do not let you start as yearly 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.580
 oo delay it 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.939
 that what affected 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.499
 it did not manage to include the boot but to be able to put good 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.499
 friend, I do not care if you take it off 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:18.009
 one minute later 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.719
 for example the test 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:21.959
 but by law 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.999
 and the day 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.999
 well the same with all not 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:30.749
 Messi arrives better but lacking rhythm 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.569
 they did not need because the action 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.519
 it was in the demo 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.519
 and I do not know little by little later in virginia 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.149
 in theory all your information 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.639
 that is continuously raising the fad 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.489
 satse based on the intelligence of faith 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.649
 the social leader 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:51.119
 shares internet information with what other users have done 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.119
 brian cox 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.829
 timbío was another thing that he certainly does not touch us in the boot 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.829
 I remove in Riga very little time 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 it is not a question 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.399
 that portrays the pain but good 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:11.279
 the curiosity of the application 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.029
 or better on other computers with more applications 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.639
 or to people who do not but the habit 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.989
 setting a lot of success 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.579
 here in this case the antivirus 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.769
 maybe it's not worth it you do not want to have it as soon as possible even if they are seven 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.119
 bortnik britos and a thing field 

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:35.309
 I do not care if they are 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:36.519
 I do not know how he counted 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.519
 actually health screening 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.079
 little by little this too 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.339
 the lhc a test link 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:51.380
 delay it 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.749
 in terms of delays 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:54.009
 for example 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.069
 the webcam software 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.849
 what made me really when 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.849
 7 websites and even 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.549
 maybe these things 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.299
 in the long run the shooting 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.299
 more counterproductive than anything else 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.090
 the best thing is that delaying them does not interest anyone 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.610
 because it's not going well 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.499
 the fact that hatred 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:44.110
 for the couple 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.110
 it may be that by changing something 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340
 in talagante another application 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.460
 suppose that she 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.339
 we have saved ponce according to 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.339
 hypocrites 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.210
 Czech has generated 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.680
 although it was placed in the night 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.069
 as we see grow 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.059
 a formation 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:35.059
 The starting point is usually 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.169
 there are many people with their grill 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.659
 and that takes a long time in the organ donated to caritas offers the application 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.710
 very easy to handle 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.419
 another feature 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.969
 check 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.669
 billing means every time you do 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.279
 restart the computer 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.389
 that the dentist the babalú to all 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.979
 at that point you can even 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.979
 delay it 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.319
 with what they call 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.629
 the intention to try las vegas 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:48.650
 it comes out at night 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.889
 I always say if I had a problem or whatever
