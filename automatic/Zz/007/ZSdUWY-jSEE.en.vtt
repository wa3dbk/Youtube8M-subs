00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 halli hello hallÃ¶chen and one 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.850
 beautiful good morning with good 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.090
 good day anyway 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.210
 wonderful sunday is free because of that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.710
 is also wonderful yes there are some 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.390
 things that I want to cut short 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.439
 among other things we are incredible 7000 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.770
 People meanwhile a bit 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.100
 more 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 You can not do it the same way 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.699
 set but I have today 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.349
 that according to twitter in the course of the night 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.949
 sometime the 7,000 subscribers 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.440
 exceeded exceeded 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 overlapped whatever 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.100
 and I wanted to get warm 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 thanks to all who already for 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.059
 Part very very long with me are so 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 I started when I started 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.160
 never expected in this 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.770
 order of magnitude to come 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.020
 but it seems to be for one 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 relatively broad mass very amusing too 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.020
 just like me every time I play 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.390
 basically very special fail 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.250
 thank you again for giving him me 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.270
 more often you also support them more often 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.310
 in the comments one reads yes 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.080
 so let's have it longer 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 people one among the first 100 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.049
 subscribers or so I read that up 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.380
 Today, among many videos of it 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.259
 Many thanks for thanks for this 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.610
 You can almost say faithfulness and all the same 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.470
 special thanks to all who are 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.439
 from the advertising to ball and shoot 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.159
 without adblocker are completely quite 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.860
 very big thank you 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.020
 because one or the other knows I 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.030
 Turn on advertising and earn money 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 a little bit of money around it somehow 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.670
 also to finance time 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.409
 one or the other also knows that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 I'm currently still one 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.570
 but sometimes quite time consuming 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.689
 Nebenjob have the falls very short 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.800
 Consider 1 hour in principle per 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.260
 day when I interrupt 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.300
 but that does not work from the back 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.290
 not and i would be this time i just 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.340
 actually has to spend it 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.100
 also youtube stuck 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.480
 I can not do that right now 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.380
 simply because I already have that 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.850
 often addressed 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.250
 quite a few just people with a 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.600
 That's why we're so excited about bloggers on the go 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.220
 me always very much when people then 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.080
 write that for you the blogger 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.720
 make out or so on and so on 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.860
 I do, for example, even if I join 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.920
 if I befriend youtube videos of 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.930
 youtube users supported by youtube 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.940
 I would like to help watch 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.840
 my blogger out just because I 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.130
 myself knows how it is and I want 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.600
 not that their videos are simple 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.160
 disappear and that's how I am 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.470
 so grateful to the people for that 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.670
 make out with it my videos 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.070
 not just disappear someday 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.760
 because I think everybody knows that 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.670
 you have to finance that anyway 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.340
 otherwise server costs and I know 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.170
 not everything has to be there anyway 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.090
 be in with it and then you have to 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.940
 Of course, also consider how much time 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.260
 because you are partly in there, I know 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.430
 why do not want to but my vote 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.230
 just not others not who 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.880
 still thinking back and forth too 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.830
 7,000 subscribers I've been thinking about now 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.680
 4000 subscribers to a subscriber special 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.910
 rum and that with the stream is straight 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.520
 I just do not have enough time 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.560
 for that and everything you need me 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.489
 prepare me too much on the front and 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.390
 then I had a very good idea 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.770
 And that will be the coming week 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.300
 be the next week I have one 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.160
 normal regular program 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.780
 that 'll be in the same connection later 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.310
 recite and otherwise we will one 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.620
 Failure to make the loser of 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.620
 7,000 7,000 at 7,000 subscribers and 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.080
 Failure sound is a pun 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.390
 fail as in pants failed and sound 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.040
 like a marathon 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.980
 that will be seven videos and that 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.400
 from monday tenth to sunday the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.130
 16 at seven o'clock in the evening so 19 o'clock 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.190
 a trouser fails at per day 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.010
 that means to say thank you 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.260
 unscheduled full charge 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.920
 of failure i hope one or 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.920
 others can make friends with it 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.190
 livestream I would have if I have one now 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.630
 livestream would want to do then 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.620
 I have something to do with the number 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.850
 and then I would have to be in seven 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.290
 hours of live streaming 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.600
 we can agree on that here 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.770
 if i subscribe to 10,000 or so 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.870
 I'm live in ten hours 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.590
 stream and I'm already sorry 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.500
 I have said in the video 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.030
 otherwise on monday I have 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.310
 Apart from this pants fails at 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.650
 that always does not always happen though 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.690
 from monday to sunday every day 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.240
 I hope I get that way and 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.110
 I'm bad enough in enough games though 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.850
 that you will see then already 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.660
 on monday so tomorrow there are many who have it 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.960
 It continues with a bit of trading 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.060
 small little spoiler in advance I will 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.580
 Now also mention about what's planned 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.110
 is or maybe I prefer it 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.760
 away it is almost too much of that 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.960
 spoilers one or the other has 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.490
 maybe yesterday in the stream of spies 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.260
 I saw that after several 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.430
 utensils and various 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.320
 did things because I have 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.900
 actually something prepared and jan 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.840
 tuesday we have brakes architect and 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:28.820
 came with week feed the beast 110 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.130
 architect and ran on friday led 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.350
 until Saturday is fit and comes and 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.460
 sunday led beez these are indications 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.180
 as always with a pile of torches and 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.120
 no guarantee 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.210
 because it can also be that one has to 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.770
 In a nutshell I will say , of course 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.720
 to record a bit with tosca and 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.130
 so and when exactly that comes in and 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.510
 how that comes in this plan knows that 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.220
 I'm not sure yet I think so 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.330
 It may be good that I am there a bit 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.160
 to push around, whose architect has 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.210
 actually solid on tuesday 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.260
 I'm most likely what I'm doing 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.780
 will move 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.430
 will grids be accordingly each 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.460
 after me with tosca on one 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.930
 some yes otherwise I will 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.009
 Keep that relatively short today 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.149
 in principle, too 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.379
 what else is planned or if 

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:17.919
 what changes while he is, I think 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:21.729
 Many thanks to all 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.379
 7000 that you are here that you are 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.029

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:27.119
 that mean to you the click the on 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.349
 Subscribe was worth 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.789
 many thanks also to all the 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.929
 do not comment so often I know it 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.110
 There are quite a lot of the dome very 

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:36.309
 very much and he comment less 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.629
 these typical quiet spectators 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.759
 that's perfectly alright 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:41.469
 Many thanks to you many thanks 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:44.949
 to all the feedback again and again 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:47.229
 and many thanks also to all the yes 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.149
 through projects like the pants power forum 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.580
 have become part of the community and 

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:52.930
 and so on 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.149
 I am still very happy 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.469
 Any comment so that's how it used to be 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.319
 I think I have no idea how 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:00.939
 many videos and then always have 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.349
 I do not every three days or so to 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:04.589
 comment got and even thought 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:06.999
 a comment had to answer directly 

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:08.860
 yes and you may have too 

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:10.589
 I realized I have about the time 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.999
 I've always said in videos too 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.959
 I read all the comments and the answer 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.219
 on it all comments I can 

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:17.080
 Unfortunately, not everyone anymore 

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:18.459
 comments will answer as soon as there are too many 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.610
 but have become I actually read 

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:23.259
 I still have all the comments 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.189
 also so crazy that 

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:30.789
 When I'm on the road, I do it all 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:32.769
 Just google on smartphone and say okay 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:34.800
 I look me once has the 30 40 

00:07:32.769 --> 00:07:36.939
 I can read comments briefly 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.509
 and from there I can not 

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:42.639
 answer correctly because that has diverse 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:44.439
 So start the youtube app anyway 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:46.119
 shit for that and the mobile site 

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:48.360
 does not work at all else 

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:50.740
 is that just without quasi in replays 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.469
 I know why this is so 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.569
 he changed 

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:57.039
 Well, now I agree with the others 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.809
 Video production especially for the 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:01.059
 make shipping of 7,000 and I hope 

00:07:58.809 --> 00:08:04.649
