unit<00:02:11.220> has<00:02:11.569> sonar<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.410> actually

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
unit has sonar and so it actually

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.150 
unit has sonar and so it actually
Majors<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.820> car<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.320> knows<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.710> exact

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
Majors the car so it knows the exact

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.280 
Majors the car so it knows the exact
distance<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.000> has<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.960> apply<00:02:19.230> the

distance that it has to be to apply the
soap<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.610> right<00:02:20.790> amount<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.150> pressure<00:02:21.450> so

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
soap and the right amount of pressure so

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350 
soap and the right amount of pressure so
that<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.500> gets<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.740> good<00:02:22.920> wash<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:24.000> particular

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
that it gets a good wash this particular

call themselves having a spot free rinse

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.290 
call themselves having a spot free rinse
and<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.220> they<00:03:14.370> actually<00:03:14.520> have<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:15.030> soft

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
and what they actually have is soft

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.540 
and what they actually have is soft
water<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.350> we<00:03:16.500> actually<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.100> reverse

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
osmosis machine inside this wash so it's

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.660 
osmosis machine inside this wash so it's
not<00:03:21.510> only<00:03:21.870> soft<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.710> it<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.980> truly<00:03:23.310> RO

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
not only soft but but it is truly RO

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.450 
not only soft but but it is truly RO
water<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.020> truly<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.710> spot<00:03:26.460> free<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:28.460> now

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
water so it truly is spot free and now

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.320 
water so it truly is spot free and now
you<00:03:29.520> can<00:03:29.880> hear<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.550> dryers<00:03:32.550> are<00:03:32.820> kicking<00:03:33.150> on

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
you can hear the dryers are kicking on

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.130 
you can hear the dryers are kicking on
there's<00:03:34.230> three<00:03:34.710> big<00:03:35.580> dryers<00:03:36.060> at<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.630> end<00:03:36.810> and

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
there's three big dryers at the end and

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.250 
there's three big dryers at the end and
as<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.130> exit<00:03:38.580> there's<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.880> timer<00:03:39.240> and<00:03:40.050> each

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
as you exit there's a timer and each

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.060 
as you exit there's a timer and each
each<00:03:40.610> dry<00:03:41.660> gets<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.440> minute<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.040> a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
each dry gets to be a a minute and a

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.120 
each dry gets to be a a minute and a
half<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.280> they've<00:03:44.700> got<00:03:44.940> 90<00:03:45.420> seconds<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.130> they

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
half so they've got 90 seconds and they

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.130 
half so they've got 90 seconds and they
can<00:03:47.340> kind<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.670> Judge<00:03:48.000> where<00:03:48.390> they<00:03:48.660> need<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.990> be

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
can kind of Judge where they need to be

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.220 
can kind of Judge where they need to be
based<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.830> time<00:03:50.100> so<00:03:50.690> if<00:03:51.690> they've<00:03:51.990> gotten

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
based on the time so if they've gotten

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.650 
based on the time so if they've gotten
halfway<00:03:52.770> through<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.460> 45<00:03:53.850> seconds<00:03:54.450> or

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
halfway through and it's 45 seconds or

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.980 
halfway through and it's 45 seconds or
kind<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.290> doing<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.860> right<00:03:56.040> on<00:03:56.190> schedule<00:03:56.990> and

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
kind of doing the right on schedule and

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.570 
kind of doing the right on schedule and
of<00:03:58.110> course<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.470> does<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.650> good<00:03:58.860> job<00:03:58.920> getting<00:03:59.370> all

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
of course it does a good job getting all

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.660 
of course it does a good job getting all
the<00:03:59.700> waters<00:04:00.120> out<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.330> your<00:04:00.540> door<00:04:00.720> seals<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.740> as

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
the waters out of your door seals and as

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.940 
the waters out of your door seals and as
you<00:04:02.850> can<00:04:02.970> see<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.570> arms<00:04:03.960> move<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.770> one

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
you can see that the arms move the one

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.000 
you can see that the arms move the one
over<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.280> top<00:04:05.430> also<00:04:06.090> moves<00:04:06.530> trying<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.680> get<00:04:07.830> to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
over the top also moves trying to get to

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.390 
over the top also moves trying to get to
shed<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.610> water<00:04:08.820> away<00:04:09.030> from<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.420> vehicle<00:04:10.400> so

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
shed the water away from the vehicle so

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.680 
shed the water away from the vehicle so
the<00:04:11.520> top<00:04:11.760> wash<00:04:12.030> here<00:04:12.450> has<00:04:12.690> nine<00:04:13.350> steps<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:14.130> it

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
the top wash here has nine steps to it

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:24.230 
the top wash here has nine steps to it
this<00:04:15.690> being<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.200> final<00:04:16.380> step

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.430 

they<00:04:24.840> should<00:04:25.080> come<00:04:25.319> out<00:04:25.440> all<00:04:25.710> clean<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.220> shiny
