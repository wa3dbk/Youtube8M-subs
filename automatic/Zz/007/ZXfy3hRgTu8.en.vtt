problem<00:00:36.640> in<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.420> same<00:00:37.600> way<00:00:37.840> as<00:00:37.989> we<00:00:38.230> are<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.680> so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
problem in the same way as we are and so

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.860 
problem in the same way as we are and so
by<00:00:39.130> being<00:00:39.430> an<00:00:39.670> open-source<00:00:40.180> community<00:00:40.300> from<00:00:40.750> a

hardware and software perspective it

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.180 
hardware and software perspective it
really<00:00:43.060> helps<00:00:43.570> us<00:00:43.660> gain<00:00:44.110> higher<00:00:44.560> levels<00:00:45.040> of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
really helps us gain higher levels of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.040 
really helps us gain higher levels of
engagement<00:00:45.370> from<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.270> people<00:00:46.570> who<00:00:46.600> are<00:00:46.810> who

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
engagement from the people who are who

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.590 
engagement from the people who are who
were<00:00:47.200> working<00:00:47.560> with<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.950> and<00:00:48.910> it<00:00:49.300> allows<00:00:49.570> us

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
were working with and and it allows us

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.540 
were working with and and it allows us
to<00:00:49.930> be<00:00:50.110> more<00:00:50.140> innovative<00:00:50.590> have<00:00:51.010> additional

we're able to push all of this data very

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.330 
we're able to push all of this data very
quickly<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.840> other<00:01:47.170> people<00:01:47.530> who<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.920> use<00:01:48.159> it

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
quickly to other people who can use it

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.010 
quickly to other people who can use it
from<00:01:48.640> marketing<00:01:49.060> perspective<00:01:49.330> or<00:01:49.780> from<00:01:49.810> an

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
from marketing perspective or from an

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.600 
from marketing perspective or from an
engineering<00:01:50.439> perspective<00:01:50.650> or<00:01:51.189> from<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.460> video

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
engineering perspective or from a video

engineering perspective or from a video
production<00:01:52.240> perspective<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.439> it<00:01:53.590> makes

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
production perspective and so it makes

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.310
