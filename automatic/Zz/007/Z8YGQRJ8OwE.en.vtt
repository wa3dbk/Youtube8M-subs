and<00:00:12.650> how<00:00:12.830> they<00:00:12.950> work

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
and how they work

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.030 
and how they work
first<00:00:14.299> of<00:00:14.450> all<00:00:14.589> normally<00:00:15.589> when<00:00:15.709> you<00:00:15.799> put<00:00:15.950> the

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
first of all normally when you put the

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.920 
first of all normally when you put the
fruit<00:00:16.189> cage<00:00:16.369> together<00:00:16.700> you<00:00:17.419> can<00:00:17.539> slide<00:00:17.779> the

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
fruit cage together you can slide the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.660 
fruit cage together you can slide the
hinges<00:00:18.259> over<00:00:19.150> like<00:00:20.150> that<00:00:21.099> but<00:00:22.099> if<00:00:22.250> you're

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
hinges over like that but if you're
