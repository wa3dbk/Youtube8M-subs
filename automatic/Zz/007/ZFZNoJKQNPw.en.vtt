00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.050
 a family like are welcome to 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.050
 creative 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.890
 very very easy very simple I think that 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.360
 Most of the materials you have 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.130
 at home and if it's not very economical and very 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.110
 simple especially for those 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.170
 people like me do not have a machine 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.739
 to sew and you have a lot of work to do 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.460
 be handy today let's make this cushion 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.110
 which is made by hand and without seams 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.449
 you can see it you can combine 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.309
 different types of fabric I have put two 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.920
 It is the same design but they are different 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.680
 colors and the best of all is that no 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.049
 need to sew is super easy it is 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.629
 super fast to do I hope that this 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:59.030
 craft you like indeed if you 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.600
 You can decorate it with buttons 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.720
 with some flowers with bows I said 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.350
 well because I like how to do the design 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.810
 but you can add your creativity 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.350
 Well let's see the materials and hands 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.350
 to the work 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.320
 of the polar that is this that is used 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.040
 to make baby blankets or 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.040
 felt of the design that you prefer 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
 scissors 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.799
 a marker 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.799
 pins 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.950
 and stuffing for pillow 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.630
 let's take one of the pieces of the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.880
 fabric and we're going to start dialing with 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.250
 help of a marker the figure that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.960
 we want for our cushion myself 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.840
 I'm going to do like a stain but you 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.720
 you can make a circle a square a 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.720
 Heart a flower or whatever you want 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.980
 let's put our other piece of 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.569
 fabric below this that has the figure 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.700
 checked 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.069
 we are going to put it in such a way that 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.139
 coincide and that the marked figure that 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.139
 is perfectly in the bottom tea 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.880
 and with the help of some pins we're going 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.880
 to join 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.980
 why 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.519
 and we are going to cut over the line 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.849
 marked to have already the base of our 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.849
 cushion 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.800
 since you have cut back we are going to withdraw 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.430
 all the pins but without taking off 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.430
 the fabrics 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.459
 and we are going to replace them but 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.790
 now we are going to place them about 10 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.790
 inward from the edge you can help 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.680
 with a rule or in fact you can do it 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.420
 also like that to eye of good 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.420
 cubero is not necessary that you give me 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.180
 and now we are going to start cutting 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.819
 strips 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.099
 from the edge of our fabric inwards 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.689
 these strips have approximately 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.650
 measuring about 10 centimeters is not 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:48.010
 you need to look at what you can do like this 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.859
 like that at a glance I saw myself and more or 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.200
 less are 4 to 5 scissors sos and you 're going to 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.319
 do the same every two centimeters 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.930
 the same is not necessary that you give me is is 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.969
 as a 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.189
 you have going more or less as is 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.739
 leaving your strips and this you are going to do 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.829
 around all this figure that already 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:11.000
 We mark how you can tell 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.000
 we are doing double 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.650
 why 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.650
 we have cut everything you can give 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.110
 account that each strip of 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.880
 in front has a strip from behind and 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.520
 now what we will still be starting to give 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.380
 these strips a let's take the strip of 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.480
 opposite in the back strip and we're going to 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.880
 make a double knot first we make one 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.010
 and then we do the other one you can download 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.120
 a little bit the strips for you to stay 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.120
 a little longer 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.210
 and so he will do with each of the 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.210
 strips around this figure 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.480
 as you can tell there remains a 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.430
 little bit like pucker do not worry 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.610
 that's why it will correct you when 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.770
 we raise the stuffing and try to make 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.770
 the knots as sticky as possible 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.250
 and the filling does not come out 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.810
 here today more than half and you can give 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.850
 mind that it is like a little wrinkle but 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.680
 As I told you a while ago, do not worry 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.530
 that's going to fix when we take it off 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.889
 the filling meanwhile you follow 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.889
 Helping 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.070
 before it's not all make sure 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.590
 leave a small enough 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.110
 wide to put the filling to our 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.810
 cushion 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.310
 and as it goes going filling this piece 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.980
 go adjusting it 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.230
 so that we do not see balls or spaces 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.650
 where it is filled and it is like that 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.650
 boffo 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.980
 and you have gotten all the king 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.340
 finish knotting the strips that you 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.340
 missing 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.790
 accommodate your reception of some taps 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.790
 and see how it looks 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:50.630
 Y 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:52.640
 and comment in the bottom part if it is that 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.070
