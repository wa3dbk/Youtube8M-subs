00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.020
 hello friends today we have several 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.970
 curiosities of this new money dlc 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.309
 dirty part 2 as you know 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.769
 rockstar has published photographs to two 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.009
 of information has given us say that a 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.560
 sea â€‹â€‹of content in which it has been 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.510
 discovered some curiosities some 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.440
 things that turn out to be very 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.910
 attractive 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.980
 let's go with the first picture this is 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.830
 a photograph of a mitten of a fist 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.080
 american and she know what it's called and so 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.840
 here we make an approach towards where 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.480
 are these v and we see clearly that in 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.089
 the uve on the left is a gun 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.339
 in the one on the right is a rose 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.140
 then this curiosity the truth is 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.839
 very interesting engraving that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.789
 find now we are going to the two v 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.589
 that are on the right side and 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.449
 they also have a very 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.809
 interesting here we are getting closer 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.670
 more and more and we have a rose in the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.870
 which is on the left side and where 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.479
 is on the right side we have a 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.489
 pistol then they are engraved that in 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.319
 reality are very interesting very 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.879
 curious now let's go with curiosity 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:06.640
 what about the name of this 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.750
 superdeportivo project 20 and then 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.390
 Well many will ask 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.340
 how the hell does he put this name of 20 to a 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.050
 auto rockstar because there's a 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.270
 theory that the truth is quite 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.729
 simple and very simple but in reality 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.110
 it's very funny that says good 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.750
 they clearly asked another 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.479
 developer of the game in a letter it 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.580
 the tf happens to him and now he looks for this letter 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.500
 in the English alphabet what number it occupies 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.810
 occupies the number 20 to then stays 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.380
 as of 20 and with this because you already have a 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.840
 name of an author is the t20 in the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.090
 last curiosity this refers to the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.070
 position that these players have is 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.899
 a resting position and many say 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.759
 Well, what's up with this position is a 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.520
 position that is repeated let's say that 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.910
 many images this position if not wrong 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.220
 remembrance was introduced when he came to the dlc 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.700
 of the flight school later it appears 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.140
 in this dirty money part 1 appears 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.840
 also in the money pictures 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.240
 dirty part 2 and then also with what 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.039
 the enema shirt appears this position 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.410
 where is it let's say that the hand 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.929
 right holding the wrist of the hand 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.709
 left then 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.890
 let's say that this position let's say not 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.049
 I know if it is already an exaggeration in trying 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.120
 to discover things or see curiosities 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.950
 but this image has also caused a 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.900
 great excitement of what wave that wants us 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.900
 say rockstar or simply and simply 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.049
 is an image or simply the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.269
 they took to show themselves a little 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.819
 relaxed there the expert showing off the 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.939
 car summarizing the outfits that is in 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.579
 a resting position the truth is not 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.049
 it may be that they just do not have 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.689
 nothing to see and felt in me 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.450
 it's just something that rockstar what 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:53.310
 he took as if nothing and already sing well 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.310
 - These are some curiosities bye bye 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940
 yes 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.850
 Hello 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.480
 yes
