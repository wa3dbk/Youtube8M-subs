slick that breeze settle okay let's see

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
slick that breeze settle okay let's see
how<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:34.460> goes

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.380 

okay<00:00:52.930> there's<00:00:53.170> a<00:00:53.230> bit<00:00:53.590> of<00:00:53.620> wind<00:00:53.860> out<00:00:54.100> here<00:00:54.390> but

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
okay there's a bit of wind out here but

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.470 
okay there's a bit of wind out here but
she's<00:00:55.540> flying<00:00:55.810> not<00:00:56.170> too<00:00:56.380> bad<00:00:56.880> as<00:00:57.880> you<00:00:58.060> can<00:00:58.240> see

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
she's flying not too bad as you can see

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.120 
she's flying not too bad as you can see
I'm<00:00:58.690> about<00:00:58.930> half<00:00:59.230> throttle<00:00:59.560> at<00:00:59.830> the<00:00:59.890> moment

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
I'm about half throttle at the moment

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.820 
I'm about half throttle at the moment
there's<00:01:03.130> half<00:01:03.400> throttle<00:01:03.700> into<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.210> wing

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
there's half throttle into the wing

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:16.880 
there's half throttle into the wing
lifts<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.920> little<00:01:05.950> into<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.490> wind

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:34.060 

birds<00:01:17.460> following<00:01:18.150> her

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.399 

definitely<00:01:35.070> doesn't<00:01:35.280> fight<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
definitely doesn't fight as much as the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.990 
definitely doesn't fight as much as the
bigger<00:01:37.590> things<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:38.760> it<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
bigger things but that's because it is

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.510 
bigger things but that's because it is
an<00:01:39.119> optimal

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:02:11.680 

apart<00:01:46.180> from<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:46.570> she<00:01:46.780> seems<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.140> fly<00:01:47.409> alright

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.840 

I<00:02:11.720> think<00:02:12.380> indoors<00:02:12.830> she's<00:02:13.130> gonna<00:02:13.280> fly<00:02:13.550> really

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
I think indoors she's gonna fly really

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.240 
I think indoors she's gonna fly really
well<00:02:14.180> I'm<00:02:14.510> in<00:02:14.660> palmdale<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.740> say<00:02:15.920> there's<00:02:16.130> only

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
well I'm in palmdale I say there's only

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.620 
well I'm in palmdale I say there's only
a<00:02:16.370> little<00:02:16.520> bit<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.850> wind<00:02:17.000> around<00:02:17.390> at<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
a little bit of wind around at the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.090 
a little bit of wind around at the
moment<00:02:17.960> but<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.140> definitely<00:02:18.290> affects<00:02:18.920> it

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
moment but it definitely affects it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.340 
moment but it definitely affects it
maybe<00:02:19.340> because<00:02:19.520> it's<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:20.000> biplane<00:02:20.690> you've<00:02:21.230> got

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
maybe because it's a biplane you've got

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:31.230 
maybe because it's a biplane you've got
the<00:02:21.410> two<00:02:21.590> weeks<00:02:29.620> nice

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
the two weeks nice

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.490 
the two weeks nice
can't<00:02:32.240> see<00:02:32.450> anything<00:02:32.720> wrong<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:35.500> mind

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
can't see anything wrong with that mind

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.240 
can't see anything wrong with that mind
you<00:02:36.620> wouldn't<00:02:36.830> we<00:02:37.010> love<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.400> be<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> -<00:02:37.820> si
