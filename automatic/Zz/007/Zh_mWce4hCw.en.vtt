soda<00:00:17.670> machine<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:19.050> sort<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.350> machine<00:00:19.710> is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
soda machine this sort of machine is

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.120 
soda machine this sort of machine is
actually<00:00:20.869> let's<00:00:21.869> say<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> couple<00:00:22.500> months<00:00:22.949> old

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130

subscribers but I really don't want to
give<00:00:38.070> out<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.399> mechanism<00:00:39.469> because<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.980> don't

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
give out the mechanism because I don't

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.270 
give out the mechanism because I don't
want<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.540> yeah<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:42.989> kind<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.320> special<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
this is a mock so here is part of the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.569 
this is a mock so here is part of the
