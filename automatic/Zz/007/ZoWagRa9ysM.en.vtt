manmade loops and stuff but I had it a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.289 
manmade loops and stuff but I had it a
little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.770> easy<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.280> wasn't<00:01:14.820> planning<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
little bit easy I wasn't planning the

guess they kind of forced breasts from

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.370 
guess they kind of forced breasts from
not<00:01:23.909> having<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.540> opportunity<00:01:25.020> which<00:01:25.170> mean
