cannot recommend this weapon unless

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.470 
cannot recommend this weapon unless
you're<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.710> situation<00:00:20.119> where<00:00:21.119> there<00:00:21.300> are

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
you're in a situation where there are

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.810 
you're in a situation where there are
multiple<00:00:22.320> multiple<00:00:22.680> multiple<00:00:22.980> enemies

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
multiple multiple multiple enemies

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.490 
multiple multiple multiple enemies
spread<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.480> across<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:25.680> wide<00:00:26.310> area<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:28.140> damage

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
spread out across a wide area the damage

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.830 
spread out across a wide area the damage
reduction<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.519> only<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.630> still

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
reduction is only one but it's still

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.459 
reduction is only one but it's still
it's<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.260> heavy<00:00:31.500> toll<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.940> feel<00:00:33.469> how

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it's a heavy toll as you can feel how

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.560 
it's a heavy toll as you can feel how
many<00:00:35.160> more<00:00:35.309> extra<00:00:35.640> hits<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.000> takes<00:00:36.239> takes

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
many more extra hits it takes takes

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.510 
many more extra hits it takes takes
about<00:00:36.750> two<00:00:37.020> or<00:00:37.140> three<00:00:37.350> maybe<00:00:37.530> four<00:00:37.860> extra<00:00:38.280> hits

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
about two or three maybe four extra hits

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.049 
about two or three maybe four extra hits
and<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> huge<00:00:40.309> discount<00:00:41.309> in

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and that's that is a huge discount in

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
and that's that is a huge discount in
damage<00:00:42.719> which<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.440> exactly<00:00:43.950> something

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
damage which is not exactly something

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.319 
damage which is not exactly something
that<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.489> want<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:45.000> something<00:00:45.300> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that you want with something that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
that you want with something that
spreads<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:45.960> much<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.440> being<00:00:46.770> said<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
spreads to so much that being said the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.979 
spreads to so much that being said the
fire<00:00:47.520> rate<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.879> incredibly<00:00:48.870> high<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> multiple

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
fire rate is incredibly high so multiple

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
fire rate is incredibly high so multiple
enemies<00:00:52.350> fighting<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:52.949> once<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.550> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
enemies fighting you at once it is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.760 
enemies fighting you at once it is
better<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> only

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
better for that but that's the only

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.310 
better for that but that's the only
situation<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.550> could<00:00:56.699> possibly<00:00:57.059> imagine<00:00:57.690> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
situation I could possibly imagine you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.979 
situation I could possibly imagine you
wanting<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> use<00:00:58.949> his<00:00:59.100> weapon<00:00:59.539> for<00:01:00.539> example

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
wanting to use his weapon for example

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.729 
wanting to use his weapon for example
the<00:01:01.309> bacon<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.370> eggs<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:03.120> much<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:04.260> more

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the bacon and eggs was much much more

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.340 
the bacon and eggs was much much more
reliable<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.760> damage<00:01:06.180> despite<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.750> accuracy

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
reliable for damage despite the accuracy

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.590 
reliable for damage despite the accuracy
being<00:01:07.590> shit<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.880> hard<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> hit<00:01:09.299> stuff

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
being shit so it was hard to hit stuff

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.480 
being shit so it was hard to hit stuff
but<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.900> mean<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.070> did<00:01:11.250> hit<00:01:11.460> something

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
but I mean when you did hit something

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
but I mean when you did hit something
you<00:01:11.880> would<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> crazy<00:01:12.510> amount<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.930> damage

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
you would do a crazy amount of damage

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.280 
you would do a crazy amount of damage
now<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.979> because<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.760> lower<00:01:15.000> damage<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.930> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
now this because has lower damage and a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920 
now this because has lower damage and a
higher<00:01:16.470> fire<00:01:16.770> rate<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.490> still<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.540> chance<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
higher fire rate you still the chance of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 
higher fire rate you still the chance of
hitting<00:01:19.080> somewhat<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:20.159> low<00:01:20.400> unless

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
hitting somewhat are really low unless

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
hitting somewhat are really low unless
you're<00:01:21.330> closer<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.290> that's<00:01:22.560> not

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you're closer and that's that's not

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
you're closer and that's that's not
exactly<00:01:23.130> something<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> want<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.150> now

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
exactly something you want to have now

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.050 
exactly something you want to have now
it's<00:01:25.140> still<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.350> great<00:01:25.619> gun<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.970> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it's still a great gun and I think I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
it's still a great gun and I think I
would<00:01:27.210> use<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.509> over<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> normal<00:01:28.080> xmg<00:01:28.470> not

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
would use it over the normal xmg not

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.490 
would use it over the normal xmg not
just<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> way<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> looks<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.320> just<00:01:31.320> for

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
just for the way it looks but just for

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.550 
just for the way it looks but just for
the<00:01:31.530> sheer<00:01:31.970> fire<00:01:32.970> fire<00:01:33.600> power<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> fire

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the sheer fire fire power in the fire

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
the sheer fire fire power in the fire
rings<00:01:34.920> right<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:35.790> that's<00:01:36.600> always

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
rings right so as that's always

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.020 
rings right so as that's always
something<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.619> anyways<00:01:38.460> guys<00:01:38.700> do
