that um daily basis

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.890 
that um daily basis

he suggests just getting a bit of

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.850 
he suggests just getting a bit of
product<00:01:58.470> onto<00:01:59.130> your<00:01:59.700> brush<00:02:00.510> like<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.870> and<00:02:01.800> just

product onto your brush like so and just
literally<00:02:02.490> buffing<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.060> powder<00:02:03.270> into<00:02:03.720> your

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
literally buffing the powder into your

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.410 
literally buffing the powder into your
skin<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.430> feel<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.090> gonna<00:02:06.210> look

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
skin now I feel like this is gonna look

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.760 
skin now I feel like this is gonna look
really<00:02:06.479> cakey<00:02:07.290> I'm<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.520> sure<00:02:08.789> because

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
really cakey I'm not sure because

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.250 
really cakey I'm not sure because
obviously<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> apply<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> lot<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.820> powder

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
obviously when you apply a lot of powder

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.380 
obviously when you apply a lot of powder
makeup<00:02:13.260> does<00:02:13.530> tend<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> look<00:02:14.070> cakey<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.880> he

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
makeup does tend to look cakey and he

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.810 
makeup does tend to look cakey and he
did<00:02:15.570> say<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.230> lot<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.590> people<00:02:17.100> would<00:02:17.700> be

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
did say that a lot of people would be

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.360 
did say that a lot of people would be
too<00:02:18.030> scared<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.020> all<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.770> reason

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
too scared to do this all that reason

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.199 
too scared to do this all that reason
and<00:02:20.670> also<00:02:21.630> because<00:02:22.760> they<00:02:23.760> feel<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and also because they feel that the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.500 
and also because they feel that the
makeup<00:02:24.660> might<00:02:24.900> move<00:02:25.140> now<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.940> I've<00:02:27.090> literally

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
makeup might move now and I've literally

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.250 
makeup might move now and I've literally
today<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:28.320> filmed<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.010> another<00:02:29.930> tutorial<00:02:30.930> on

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
today just filmed a another tutorial on

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.610 
today just filmed a another tutorial on
how<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.709> contour<00:02:32.340> my<00:02:32.370> face<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.350> wanted

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
how I contour my face so if you wanted

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.040 
how I contour my face so if you wanted
to<00:02:34.709> see<00:02:34.890> how<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.100> achieved<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.730> look<00:02:36.060> then

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
to see how I achieved this look then

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.320 
to see how I achieved this look then
I'll<00:02:37.890> link<00:02:38.489> my<00:02:38.610> video<00:02:39.150> below<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:42.120> I'm<00:02:42.180> just

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
I'll link my video below so I'm just

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.960 
I'll link my video below so I'm just
buffing<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.650> he<00:02:43.739> said<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.400> really

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
buffing it in and he said to be really

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.260 
buffing it in and he said to be really
generous<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.720> just<00:02:45.750> keep<00:02:46.140> buffing<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:48.030> so

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
generous and just keep buffing and so

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.229 
generous and just keep buffing and so
far<00:02:48.630> what<00:02:48.870> I'm<00:02:49.050> noticing<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.970> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
far what I'm noticing is that the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.360 
far what I'm noticing is that the
product<00:02:51.630> isn't<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.320> moving<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:53.160> my

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
product isn't really moving like my

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.150 
product isn't really moving like my
blush<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.790> still<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.170> right<00:02:55.350> place<00:02:55.739> and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
blush is still in the right place and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
blush is still in the right place and
when<00:02:56.250> you've<00:02:56.370> toned<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.790> down<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:57.000> bit

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
when you've toned it down a bit

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.259 
when you've toned it down a bit
definitely<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:59.250> added<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.640> bit<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.850> color

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
definitely and it's added a bit of color

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.699 
definitely and it's added a bit of color
I<00:03:00.690> guess<00:03:01.380> if<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.709> use<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.780> plague<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:04.230> a

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
I guess if you use a plague of a

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.759 
I guess if you use a plague of a
translucent<00:03:05.400> setting<00:03:05.610> powder<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:07.560> wouldn't

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
translucent setting powder you wouldn't

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.410 
translucent setting powder you wouldn't
really<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:08.040> adding<00:03:08.370> color<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.700> your<00:03:08.820> face<00:03:08.970> but

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
really be adding color to your face but

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.750 
really be adding color to your face but
I'm<00:03:09.540> just<00:03:09.750> really<00:03:10.709> going<00:03:10.890> for<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.370> really

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
I'm just really going for it and really

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:22.449 
I'm just really going for it and really
pushing<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.750> product<00:03:13.230> into<00:03:13.650> my<00:03:13.769> skin

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.959 

now<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.489> think<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.999> the<00:03:24.180> studio<00:03:24.599> fix<00:03:24.900> powder

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:25.969 
now I think that the studio fix powder

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.160 
now I think that the studio fix powder
wasn't<00:03:26.969> really<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.239> best<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.659> to<00:03:27.780> use

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
wasn't really the best one to use

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.149 
wasn't really the best one to use
because<00:03:28.469> this<00:03:29.099> is<00:03:29.400> actually<00:03:30.680> foundation<00:03:31.680> with

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
because this is actually foundation with

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.059 
because this is actually foundation with
the<00:03:32.459> powder<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:33.150> looking<00:03:33.959> on<00:03:34.079> camera<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.680> can

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
the powder but looking on camera I can

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.160 
the powder but looking on camera I can
still<00:03:35.459> see<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.030> center<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.450> my<00:03:36.569> forehead<00:03:36.629> is

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
still see the center of my forehead is

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.319 
still see the center of my forehead is
highlighted<00:03:37.829> so<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.459> tops<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.849> my<00:03:39.030> cheekbones

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
highlighted so the tops of my cheekbones

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.679 
highlighted so the tops of my cheekbones
and<00:03:40.069> maybe<00:03:41.069> a<00:03:41.189> little<00:03:41.370> bit<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.879> around<00:03:42.180> here

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
and maybe a little bit just around here

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.369 
and maybe a little bit just around here
so<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:44.010> think<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.849> really<00:03:45.000> works<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.659> mean<00:03:45.840> I'm

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
so I think it really works I mean I'm

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.929 
so I think it really works I mean I'm
going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.650> leave<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.889> open<00:03:47.010> I'd<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:47.790> to

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
going to leave it open I'd like you to

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.970 
going to leave it open I'd like you to
tell<00:03:48.150> me<00:03:48.269> what<00:03:48.389> you<00:03:48.629> think<00:03:48.959> from<00:03:49.230> what<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.739> look

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
tell me what you think from what I look

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.119 
tell me what you think from what I look
like<00:03:50.159> at<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> start<00:03:50.609> of<00:03:50.879> this<00:03:51.060> video<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:52.349> how

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
like at the start of this video and how

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.589 
like at the start of this video and how
you<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:53.519> it's<00:03:53.879> worked<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:56.329> just<00:03:57.329> fear<00:03:57.569> that

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
you think it's worked I just fear that

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.750 
you think it's worked I just fear that
by<00:03:57.870> using<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.290> translucent<00:03:59.010> powder<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.609> would

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
by using a translucent powder I would

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.580 
by using a translucent powder I would
look<00:03:59.969> really<00:04:00.419> ghostly<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.290> that's<00:04:01.439> not

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
look really ghostly and that's not

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.770 
look really ghostly and that's not
really<00:04:01.769> what<00:04:01.919> I<00:04:02.069> wanted<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.430> do<00:04:02.579> but<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:03.180> may

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
really what I wanted to do but it may

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.839 
really what I wanted to do but it may
work<00:04:09.230> looking<00:04:10.230> into<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.650> camera<00:04:10.889> I<00:04:11.189> can<00:04:11.430> sort

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
work looking into the camera I can sort

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.629 
work looking into the camera I can sort

the two lines it's not obvious it's not
just<00:04:17.160> sort<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.519> two<00:04:18.269> stripes<00:04:18.750> down<00:04:19.109> my<00:04:19.349> face

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
just sort of two stripes down my face

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.749 
just sort of two stripes down my face
but<00:04:23.419> looking<00:04:24.419> into<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.690> mirror

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
but looking into the mirror

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.760 
but looking into the mirror
to<00:04:26.759> be<00:04:26.820> fair<00:04:27.030> up<00:04:27.389> close<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:28.050> does<00:04:28.409> look<00:04:28.740> a

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
to be fair up close it does look a

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.629 
to be fair up close it does look a
little<00:04:29.130> bit<00:04:29.370> cakey<00:04:29.759> but<00:04:31.070> from<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.159> distance

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
little bit cakey but from the distance

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.379 
little bit cakey but from the distance
it<00:04:32.789> doesn't<00:04:32.940> actually<00:04:33.120> god<00:04:33.449> I<00:04:33.479> suppose<00:04:35.389> so

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
it doesn't actually god I suppose so

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.300 
it doesn't actually god I suppose so
like<00:04:36.539> I<00:04:36.659> said<00:04:36.810> you<00:04:36.870> can<00:04:37.169> use<00:04:37.199> any<00:04:37.500> powder<00:04:37.889> is

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
like I said you can use any powder is

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.480 
like I said you can use any powder is
what<00:04:38.550> he<00:04:38.669> said<00:04:38.909> and<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.720> just<00:04:39.960> use<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.490> domed

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
what he said and to just use a domed

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.320 
what he said and to just use a domed
buffing<00:04:42.240> brush<00:04:42.419> but<00:04:43.229> I<00:04:43.650> actually<00:04:44.220> think<00:04:45.180> this

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
buffing brush but I actually think this

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.450 
buffing brush but I actually think this
technique<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.810> quite<00:04:46.050> good<00:04:46.259> I<00:04:46.530> mean<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:46.860> it

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
technique is quite good I mean it's it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.810 
technique is quite good I mean it's it
has<00:04:47.789> completely<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.900> won't<00:04:49.830> think<00:04:49.979> dumbed<00:04:50.430> down

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
has completely I won't think dumbed down

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.029 
has completely I won't think dumbed down
my<00:04:52.820> makeup<00:04:53.820> but<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.690> has<00:04:54.960> sort<00:04:55.229> of<00:04:55.349> blended<00:04:55.919> it

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
my makeup but it has sort of blended it

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.800 
my makeup but it has sort of blended it
out<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.220> little<00:04:56.460> bit<00:04:56.699> more<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.330> does<00:04:57.539> make

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
out a little bit more and it does make

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.249 
out a little bit more and it does make
it<00:04:57.840> all<00:04:58.729> almost<00:04:59.729> one<00:05:00.240> color<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:00.810> want<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.199> say

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
it all almost one color I want to say

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.760 
it all almost one color I want to say
but<00:05:04.259> it<00:05:04.380> does<00:05:04.560> sort<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:04.979> clip<00:05:05.190> even<00:05:05.940> while

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
but it does sort of clip even while

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.110 
but it does sort of clip even while
still<00:05:07.770> showing<00:05:07.800> these<00:05:08.520> which<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.969> the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
still showing these which of the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.600 
still showing these which of the
contours<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.740> highlights<00:05:11.219> I<00:05:11.370> think<00:05:11.400> the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
contours and the highlights I think the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.300 
contours and the highlights I think the
highlighted<00:05:12.150> areas<00:05:12.419> stand<00:05:12.599> out<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.870> bit<00:05:13.020> more

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
highlighted areas stand out a bit more

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.510 
highlighted areas stand out a bit more
maybe<00:05:14.310> it's<00:05:14.430> just<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.729> camera

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
maybe it's just the camera

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.520 
maybe it's just the camera
sure<00:05:15.789> but<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.509> good<00:05:16.690> thing<00:05:16.870> is<00:05:16.990> it<00:05:17.169> hasn't

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
sure but the good thing is it hasn't

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.869 
sure but the good thing is it hasn't
moved<00:05:17.620> my<00:05:17.830> makeup<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.280> know<00:05:18.370> I<00:05:18.400> haven't<00:05:18.639> got

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
moved my makeup you know I haven't got

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.580 
moved my makeup you know I haven't got
brush<00:05:19.150> on<00:05:19.300> my<00:05:19.330> forehead<00:05:19.840> or<00:05:20.020> on<00:05:20.080> my<00:05:20.199> chin<00:05:20.470> or

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
brush on my forehead or on my chin or

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.610 
brush on my forehead or on my chin or
anywhere<00:05:20.830> that<00:05:20.949> I<00:05:20.979> don't<00:05:21.220> want<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.550> UM<00:05:22.500> and<00:05:23.500> I

anywhere that I don't want to UM and I

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.189 
anywhere that I don't want to UM and I
feel<00:05:23.949> like<00:05:24.129> maybe<00:05:24.340> I<00:05:24.550> added<00:05:24.909> a<00:05:25.000> filter<00:05:25.479> I<00:05:25.720> guess

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
feel like maybe I added a filter I guess

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.659 
feel like maybe I added a filter I guess
I'll<00:05:26.349> have<00:05:26.470> to<00:05:26.530> look<00:05:26.770> back<00:05:26.979> at<00:05:27.039> with<00:05:27.280> video<00:05:27.520> and

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
I'll have to look back at with video and

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.409 
quite see into the viewfinder rings at
that<00:05:32.680> but<00:05:33.009> I'd<00:05:33.669> like<00:05:33.819> you<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.090> let<00:05:34.210> me<00:05:34.330> know

this to go as well because I'm sure by

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.040 
this to go as well because I'm sure by
using<00:05:39.280> different<00:05:39.819> powders<00:05:40.150> you<00:05:40.659> may<00:05:40.810> get

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
different results so I'm not sure but I

of the excess powder on your face too
much<00:06:12.639> this<00:06:13.330> will<00:06:13.539> just<00:06:13.629> dry<00:06:13.900> and<00:06:13.930> settle<00:06:14.500> into

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
much this will just dry and settle into

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.909 
much this will just dry and settle into
my<00:06:14.830> skin<00:06:15.219> kind<00:06:15.909> of<00:06:16.060> give<00:06:16.270> me<00:06:16.419> my<00:06:16.629> skin<00:06:17.080> back<00:06:17.500> if

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
my skin kind of give me my skin back if

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.379 
my skin kind of give me my skin back if
you<00:06:18.099> like<00:06:18.250> and<00:06:18.639> just<00:06:18.789> get<00:06:18.940> rid<00:06:19.030> of<00:06:19.060> any<00:06:19.210> of<00:06:19.270> the

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
you like and just get rid of any of the

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.719 
you like and just get rid of any of the
excess<00:06:19.599> powder<00:06:19.840> but<00:06:20.229> I<00:06:20.590> think<00:06:21.159> it<00:06:21.280> does<00:06:21.490> look

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
excess powder but I think it does look

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:22.170 
excess powder but I think it does look
good

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
good

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.270 
good
so<00:06:22.330> if<00:06:22.569> fix+<00:06:22.900> has<00:06:23.139> had<00:06:23.259> a<00:06:23.289> few<00:06:23.560> seconds<00:06:24.039> just<00:06:24.069> to

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
so if fix+ has had a few seconds just to

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.029 
so if fix+ has had a few seconds just to
sort<00:06:24.460> of<00:06:24.610> settle<00:06:25.030> into<00:06:25.180> my<00:06:25.360> skin<00:06:25.780> and<00:06:26.039> it's

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
sort of settle into my skin and it's

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.570 
sort of settle into my skin and it's
drying<00:06:27.490> now<00:06:27.909> I<00:06:28.240> can<00:06:28.479> see<00:06:28.750> actually<00:06:29.520> giving<00:06:30.520> it

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580

a<00:06:30.639> few<00:06:30.849> seconds<00:06:31.270> I<00:06:31.389> can<00:06:31.449> really<00:06:31.960> see<00:06:32.259> that<00:06:32.529> my

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
a few seconds I can really see that my

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.920 
a few seconds I can really see that my
skin<00:06:33.130> does<00:06:33.550> look<00:06:33.819> flawless<00:06:34.120> I<00:06:34.419> mean<00:06:34.569> I've

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
skin does look flawless I mean I've

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.300

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
and they aren't raids raised so you

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.059 
and they aren't raids raised so you
can't<00:06:39.310> actually<00:06:39.550> hide<00:06:40.380> texture<00:06:41.380> or<00:06:41.590> skin
