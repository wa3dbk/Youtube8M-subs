that<00:04:12.519> involves<00:04:13.000> turning<00:04:13.209> off<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.600> auto

that involves turning off the auto

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.650 
that involves turning off the auto
screen<00:04:14.200> orientation<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:14.950> turning<00:04:15.220> off

it<00:04:16.019> seems<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.650> work<00:04:16.830> kind<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.459> most<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
it seems to work kind of most of the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.479 
it seems to work kind of most of the
time<00:04:18.360> but<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.959> know<00:04:19.200> there<00:04:19.800> are<00:04:19.830> also<00:04:20.070> some

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
time but you know there are also some

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.910 
time but you know there are also some
other<00:04:20.700> bugs<00:04:21.120> on<00:04:21.480> this<00:04:21.720> android<00:04:22.230> version<00:04:22.650> too

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
other bugs on this android version too

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.100 
other bugs on this android version too
so<00:04:23.190> really<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:23.580> not<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.300> great<00:04:24.840> as<00:04:25.080> a

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
so really it's not that great as a

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.860 
so really it's not that great as a
day-to-day<00:04:25.650> Android<00:04:26.280> tablet<00:04:26.730> but<00:04:27.000> quite<00:04:27.540> nice

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
day-to-day Android tablet but quite nice

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.600 
day-to-day Android tablet but quite nice
as<00:04:28.170> an<00:04:28.290> emulation<00:04:28.680> station<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.430> get<00:04:29.550> some

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
as an emulation station to get some

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.120

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
old-school gaming on the go going and

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.010 
old-school gaming on the go going and
what<00:04:32.550> is<00:04:32.670> even<00:04:32.940> more<00:04:32.970> awesome<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:33.750> the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
what is even more awesome is that the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.810 
what is even more awesome is that the
device<00:04:34.230> also<00:04:34.380> features<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.980> HDMI<00:04:35.550> out<00:04:35.790> port

device also features a HDMI out port

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.610 
device also features a HDMI out port
which<00:04:36.390> means<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.780> can<00:04:36.900> also<00:04:37.110> get<00:04:37.470> your
