ways actually now however before I get

ways actually now however before I get
on<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.960> next<00:03:42.170> victory<00:03:42.470> type<00:03:42.740> which<00:03:42.950> will

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
on to the next victory type which will

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.760 
on to the next victory type which will
do<00:03:43.190> culture<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:44.140> just<00:03:45.140> want<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.380> make<00:03:45.470> one

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
do culture I just want to make one

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.130 
do culture I just want to make one
little<00:03:46.160> point<00:03:46.700> about<00:03:46.970> on<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.360> space<00:03:47.660> Victoria

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
little point about on the space Victoria

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.640 
little point about on the space Victoria
there<00:03:48.380> um<00:03:49.330> with<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.420> space<00:03:50.690> victory<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.470> is

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
there um with the space victory it is

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.400 
there um with the space victory it is
actually<00:03:52.010> not<00:03:52.040> necessary<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.300> build<00:03:54.020> all

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
actually not necessary to build all

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.400 
actually not necessary to build all
those<00:03:54.680> abundance<00:03:55.040> space<00:03:55.520> parts<00:03:56.140> all<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.290> have

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
those abundance space parts all you have

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.520 
those abundance space parts all you have
to<00:03:57.530> do<00:03:57.709> is<00:03:58.040> get<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.280> spacecraft<00:03:59.000> is<00:03:59.440> build<00:04:00.440> the

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
to do is get a spacecraft is build the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.680 
to do is get a spacecraft is build the
spacecraft<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.430> get<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.270> Alpha<00:04:02.510> Centauri

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
spacecraft and get it to Alpha Centauri

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.860 
spacecraft and get it to Alpha Centauri
before<00:04:03.410> anyone<00:04:03.890> else<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:05.030> it's<00:04:05.330> just<00:04:05.570> a<00:04:05.690> matter

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
before anyone else so it's just a matter

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.270 
before anyone else so it's just a matter
of<00:04:05.959> getting<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.260> ship<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.620> Alpha<00:04:06.830> Centauri<00:04:06.950> it

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
of getting a ship to Alpha Centauri it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.120 
of getting a ship to Alpha Centauri it
doesn't<00:04:07.490> matter<00:04:07.640> how<00:04:07.820> developed<00:04:08.360> or<00:04:08.570> how

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
doesn't matter how developed or how

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.230 
doesn't matter how developed or how
undeveloped<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.220> is<00:04:10.340> as<00:04:10.580> long<00:04:10.700> as<00:04:10.760> it's<00:04:10.970> able

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
undeveloped it is as long as it's able

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.690 
undeveloped it is as long as it's able
to<00:04:11.390> launch<00:04:11.630> which<00:04:11.900> it<00:04:12.140> takes<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.740> minimum<00:04:13.459> of

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
to launch which it takes a minimum of

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.630 
to launch which it takes a minimum of
one<00:04:13.880> of<00:04:14.030> each<00:04:14.180> part<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.860> quickest<00:04:16.280> way<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.430> do

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
one of each part the quickest way to do

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.539 
one of each part the quickest way to do
that<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:18.650> mega<00:04:18.799> shell<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.160> craft<00:04:19.370> its

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
that is the mega shell to craft its

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.780 
that is the mega shell to craft its
fastest<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:21.080> want<00:04:21.320> one<00:04:21.890> of<00:04:22.100> every<00:04:22.520> piece

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
fastest is you want one of every piece

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.400 
fastest is you want one of every piece
the<00:04:23.600> habitation<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:25.540> life-support<00:04:26.540> and<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
the habitation the life-support and the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.210 
the habitation the life-support and the
fuel<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:28.430> give<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:28.730> four<00:04:29.120> different<00:04:29.390> engines

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
fuel but give it four different engines

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.200 
fuel but give it four different engines
yeah<00:04:31.220> all<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.610> other<00:04:31.760> stuff<00:04:31.970> it's<00:04:32.120> really

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
yeah all the other stuff it's really

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.630 
yeah all the other stuff it's really
honestly<00:04:32.900> just<00:04:32.990> cosmetics<00:04:33.890> it's<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> engines

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
honestly just cosmetics it's the engines

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.390 
honestly just cosmetics it's the engines
that<00:04:34.700> make<00:04:34.940> all<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.150> difference<00:04:35.830> but<00:04:36.830> as<00:04:37.100> you

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
that make all the difference but as you

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.460 
that make all the difference but as you
see<00:04:37.610> here<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.030> took<00:04:38.150> me<00:04:38.330> six<00:04:38.750> turns<00:04:39.050> even

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
see here it took me six turns even

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.380 
see here it took me six turns even
though<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.620> had<00:04:39.860> four<00:04:40.100> engines<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.850> that's

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
though I had four engines and that's

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.940 
though I had four engines and that's
because<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.780> more<00:04:41.960> parts<00:04:42.260> you<00:04:42.350> add<00:04:42.470> on<00:04:42.680> the

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
because the more parts you add on the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.040 
because the more parts you add on the
space<00:04:43.220> station<00:04:43.250> gets<00:04:43.700> heavier<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.330> while

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
space station gets heavier and while

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.960 
space station gets heavier and while
technically<00:04:45.530> it's<00:04:46.100> weight<00:04:46.430> shouldn't<00:04:46.850> matter

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
technically it's weight shouldn't matter

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.580 
technically it's weight shouldn't matter
in<00:04:47.210> space<00:04:47.330> because<00:04:47.930> of<00:04:48.230> no<00:04:48.590> gravity<00:04:50.590> adding

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
in space because of no gravity adding

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.770 
in space because of no gravity adding
more<00:04:51.770> parts<00:04:52.220> does<00:04:52.640> slow<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.000> space<00:04:53.360> station

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
more parts does slow the space station

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.140 
more parts does slow the space station
down<00:04:54.050> so<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.680> actual<00:04:54.950> reality<00:04:55.280> is<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:55.910> when

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
down so the actual reality is that when

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.580 
down so the actual reality is that when
you<00:04:56.300> will<00:04:56.540> develop<00:04:57.320> a<00:04:57.530> spacecraft<00:04:58.130> entirely

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
you will develop a spacecraft entirely

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.540 
you will develop a spacecraft entirely
it's<00:05:00.590> really<00:05:01.520> just<00:05:02.710> just<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:03.800> way<00:05:03.919> to<00:05:03.979> kind<00:05:04.430> of

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
it's really just just a way to kind of

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.070 
it's really just just a way to kind of
rub<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:04.820> in<00:05:05.000> your<00:05:05.150> opponent's<00:05:05.540> face<00:05:05.660> is<00:05:05.900> that

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
rub it in your opponent's face is that

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.920 
rub it in your opponent's face is that
yeah<00:05:06.320> I<00:05:06.350> had<00:05:06.919> the<00:05:07.280> time<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.210> resources<00:05:08.390> to

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
yeah I had the time and the resources to

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.469 
yeah I had the time and the resources to
make<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.650> fully<00:05:10.070> developed<00:05:10.400> craft<00:05:10.880> and<00:05:11.150> still

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
make a fully developed craft and still

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.500 
make a fully developed craft and still
beat<00:05:11.690> you<00:05:12.430> so<00:05:13.430> yeah<00:05:13.820> if<00:05:13.940> you<00:05:14.030> want<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.300> rush<00:05:14.479> a

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
beat you so yeah if you want to rush a

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.719 
beat you so yeah if you want to rush a
victory<00:05:14.960> just<00:05:17.470> build<00:05:18.470> up<00:05:18.740> one<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.340> each<00:05:19.460> and

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
victory just build up one of each and

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.820 
victory just build up one of each and
then<00:05:19.940> just<00:05:20.180> get<00:05:20.450> as<00:05:20.570> many<00:05:20.900> engines<00:05:21.500> on<00:05:21.650> that

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
then just get as many engines on that

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.100 
then just get as many engines on that
thing<00:05:22.070> as<00:05:22.220> you<00:05:22.310> can<00:05:22.340> up<00:05:22.789> to

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
thing as you can up to

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.690 
thing as you can up to
for<00:05:25.500> now<00:05:26.500> actually<00:05:26.920> interestingly<00:05:27.130> right

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
for now actually interestingly right

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.750 
for now actually interestingly right
before<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.030> did<00:05:28.120> this<00:05:28.330> recording<00:05:28.870> I<00:05:29.080> just<00:05:29.470> did<00:05:29.650> a

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
before I did this recording I just did a

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.700 
before I did this recording I just did a
finished<00:05:30.760> a<00:05:30.850> multiplayer<00:05:31.330> um<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.960> three-way

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
finished a multiplayer um a three-way

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.700 
finished a multiplayer um a three-way
with<00:05:33.130> to<00:05:33.520> a<00:05:33.550> eyes<00:05:33.850> with<00:05:34.240> um<00:05:34.480> some<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:35.620> my

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
with to a eyes with um some of my

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.920 
with to a eyes with um some of my
friends<00:05:36.250> who<00:05:36.490> are<00:05:36.520> really<00:05:37.240> really<00:05:37.390> skilled<00:05:37.840> at

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
friends who are really really skilled at

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.140 
friends who are really really skilled at
this<00:05:38.080> game<00:05:38.340> I'd<00:05:39.340> actually<00:05:39.700> argue<00:05:39.970> they're

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
this game I'd actually argue they're

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:48.090 
this game I'd actually argue they're
probably<00:05:40.480> better<00:05:40.750> than<00:05:40.900> I<00:05:41.050> am<00:05:45.630> but<00:05:46.630> uh<00:05:46.950> on<00:05:47.950> a

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
probably better than I am but uh on a

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.890 
probably better than I am but uh on a
second<00:05:48.400> we<00:05:48.460> have<00:05:48.490> to<00:05:48.730> reset<00:05:49.060> this<00:05:49.180> game<00:05:51.900> okay

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
second we have to reset this game okay

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.060 
second we have to reset this game okay
any<00:05:53.020> case<00:05:53.200> I've<00:05:53.350> actually<00:05:53.500> argued<00:05:53.890> that<00:05:53.950> they

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
any case I've actually argued that they

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.760 
any case I've actually argued that they
might<00:05:54.220> be<00:05:54.340> better<00:05:54.490> than<00:05:54.790> I<00:05:54.880> am<00:05:56.520> but<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:58.650> was<00:05:59.650> able

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
might be better than I am but I was able

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.440 
might be better than I am but I was able
to<00:05:59.890> win<00:06:00.100> because<00:06:00.370> they<00:06:00.520> got<00:06:00.670> deadlocked<00:06:01.210> in<00:06:01.330> a

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
to win because they got deadlocked in a

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.840 
to win because they got deadlocked in a
war<00:06:01.810> and<00:06:02.140> I<00:06:02.770> was<00:06:02.920> able<00:06:03.070> to<00:06:03.220> pull<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.580> spacecraft

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
war and I was able to pull a spacecraft

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.700 
war and I was able to pull a spacecraft
victory<00:06:04.540> right<00:06:04.870> from<00:06:05.080> underneath<00:06:05.410> their

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
victory right from underneath their

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.320 
victory right from underneath their
noses<00:06:05.740> because<00:06:06.250> they<00:06:06.400> underestimated<00:06:07.240> the

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
noses because they underestimated the

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.780 
noses because they underestimated the
amount<00:06:07.540> of<00:06:07.600> resources<00:06:08.110> I<00:06:08.230> had<00:06:08.440> so<00:06:09.370> I<00:06:09.400> was<00:06:09.640> able

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
amount of resources I had so I was able

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.610 
amount of resources I had so I was able
to<00:06:10.740> get<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:12.370> the<00:06:12.400> file<00:06:13.060> technology<00:06:13.810> actually

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
to get the the file technology actually

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.290 
to get the the file technology actually
I<00:06:14.650> will<00:06:15.220> take<00:06:15.370> well<00:06:15.700> take<00:06:15.910> a<00:06:15.940> look<00:06:16.060> at<00:06:16.150> some<00:06:16.270> of

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
I will take well take a look at some of

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.670 
I will take well take a look at some of
that<00:06:16.390> stuff<00:06:16.630> later<00:06:16.810> while<00:06:17.080> we<00:06:17.230> after<00:06:17.650> we

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
that stuff later while we after we

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.040 
that stuff later while we after we
reload<00:06:20.790> and<00:06:21.790> in<00:06:21.880> case<00:06:22.060> I<00:06:22.300> was<00:06:22.420> able<00:06:22.540> to<00:06:22.630> in<00:06:22.900> this

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
reload and in case I was able to in this

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.470 
reload and in case I was able to in this
multiplayer<00:06:23.590> game<00:06:23.890> I<00:06:24.250> consider<00:06:24.910> recording<00:06:25.210> it

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
multiplayer game I consider recording it

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.180 
multiplayer game I consider recording it
but<00:06:25.660> it<00:06:25.960> was<00:06:26.200> boring<00:06:26.620> from<00:06:26.770> my<00:06:26.890> perspective

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
but it was boring from my perspective

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.250 
but it was boring from my perspective
since<00:06:27.580> I<00:06:27.700> was<00:06:27.820> sticking<00:06:28.510> under<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:28.810> radar<00:06:28.990> for

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
since I was sticking under the radar for

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.650 
since I was sticking under the radar for
most<00:06:29.470> of<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:29.710> but<00:06:30.430> they<00:06:30.610> got<00:06:30.790> into<00:06:30.940> a<00:06:31.060> big<00:06:31.360> war

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
most of it but they got into a big war

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.750 
most of it but they got into a big war
and<00:06:32.020> lasted<00:06:32.650> forever<00:06:32.800> and<00:06:33.250> it<00:06:33.310> was<00:06:33.400> a<00:06:33.430> total

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
and lasted forever and it was a total

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.790 
and lasted forever and it was a total
stalemate<00:06:34.030> which<00:06:34.930> bought<00:06:35.170> me<00:06:35.350> enough<00:06:35.590> time<00:06:35.770> to

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
stalemate which bought me enough time to

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.580 
stalemate which bought me enough time to
get<00:06:36.070> space<00:06:36.370> victory<00:06:36.790> I<00:06:37.090> get<00:06:37.360> the<00:06:37.720> spaceflight

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
get space victory I get the spaceflight

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.460 
get space victory I get the spaceflight
and<00:06:38.830> then<00:06:39.070> I<00:06:39.100> just<00:06:39.600> rushed<00:06:40.600> all<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.050> spaceship

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
and then I just rushed all the spaceship

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.680 
and then I just rushed all the spaceship
parts<00:06:41.650> in<00:06:41.950> one<00:06:42.310> turn<00:06:42.640> because<00:06:42.940> I<00:06:43.030> had<00:06:43.150> 6<00:06:43.450> City

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
parts in one turn because I had 6 City

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.290 
parts in one turn because I had 6 City
so<00:06:43.900> I<00:06:43.930> had<00:06:44.080> three<00:06:44.290> engines<00:06:44.740> one<00:06:45.640> habitation

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
so I had three engines one habitation

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.120 
so I had three engines one habitation
one<00:06:46.540> life-support<00:06:46.780> and<00:06:47.610> one<00:06:48.610> fuel<00:06:48.970> and<00:06:49.300> I<00:06:50.170> just

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
one life-support and one fuel and I just

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.220 
one life-support and one fuel and I just
slipped<00:06:51.850> that<00:06:51.940> space<00:06:52.240> victory<00:06:52.600> right<00:06:52.960> out

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
slipped that space victory right out

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.200 
slipped that space victory right out
from<00:06:53.470> underneath<00:06:53.800> their<00:06:54.100> noses<00:06:54.130> first<00:06:55.030> one

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
from underneath their noses first one

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.740 
from underneath their noses first one
Alpha<00:06:55.540> Centauri<00:06:55.720> easy<00:06:56.470> win<00:06:57.570> and<00:06:58.570> I<00:06:58.630> was

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
Alpha Centauri easy win and I was

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.630 
Alpha Centauri easy win and I was
actually<00:06:58.900> playing<00:06:59.320> them<00:06:59.470> a<00:06:59.590> bit<00:06:59.800> to<00:07:00.040> one<00:07:00.550> of

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:00.640 
actually playing them a bit to one of

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.160 
actually playing them a bit to one of
them<00:07:00.730> actually<00:07:00.880> got<00:07:01.090> him<00:07:01.390> to<00:07:01.420> trade

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170 
them actually got him to trade

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.560 
them actually got him to trade
technologies<00:07:02.800> with<00:07:02.950> them<00:07:03.130> to<00:07:03.760> boost<00:07:04.090> his<00:07:04.300> war

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
technologies with them to boost his war

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.270 
technologies with them to boost his war
economy<00:07:04.810> because<00:07:05.260> he<00:07:05.410> really<00:07:05.740> needed<00:07:05.950> it<00:07:06.160> to

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
economy because he really needed it to

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.820 
economy because he really needed it to

him but simultaneously he gave me lots
of<00:07:12.040> the<00:07:12.160> valuable<00:07:12.610> technologies<00:07:13.150> I<00:07:13.180> needed<00:07:13.600> to

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
of the valuable technologies I needed to

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.870 
of the valuable technologies I needed to
get<00:07:13.780> space<00:07:14.020> flight<00:07:14.320> quickly<00:07:14.710> so<00:07:15.130> it<00:07:15.670> was

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
get space flight quickly so it was

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.730 
get space flight quickly so it was
really<00:07:16.180> really<00:07:16.450> good<00:07:16.870> actually<00:07:17.320> as<00:07:17.530> a<00:07:17.560> matter

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 
really really good actually as a matter

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.380 
really really good actually as a matter

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
of fact I gave him the nucular I gave

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.440 
of fact I gave him the nucular I gave
him<00:07:19.510> the<00:07:19.600> Manhattan<00:07:20.110> Project<00:07:20.140> by<00:07:20.800> trading<00:07:21.160> him

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
him the Manhattan Project by trading him

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.150 
him the Manhattan Project by trading him
atomic<00:07:22.450> theory<00:07:22.690> and<00:07:22.900> he<00:07:22.990> rushed<00:07:23.230> it<00:07:23.560> but<00:07:24.010> then

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
atomic theory and he rushed it but then

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.930 
atomic theory and he rushed it but then
he<00:07:24.280> used<00:07:24.490> it<00:07:24.700> to<00:07:24.730> nuke<00:07:25.260> a<00:07:26.490> city<00:07:27.490> that<00:07:27.670> didn't

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:27.940 
he used it to nuke a city that didn't

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.090 
he used it to nuke a city that didn't
belong<00:07:28.090> to<00:07:28.150> me<00:07:28.420> and<00:07:28.450> that<00:07:28.780> just<00:07:28.810> uh<00:07:29.320> that<00:07:29.860> was

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.100 
belong to me and that just uh that was

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.490 
belong to me and that just uh that was
his<00:07:31.000> worst<00:07:31.300> mistake<00:07:31.750> ever<00:07:31.930> because<00:07:32.200> I<00:07:32.320> just

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500 
his worst mistake ever because I just

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.880 
his worst mistake ever because I just
slipped<00:07:32.800> right<00:07:32.890> in<00:07:33.070> there<00:07:33.400> the<00:07:33.550> space<00:07:33.760> victory

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:34.890 
slipped right in there the space victory

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.510 
slipped right in there the space victory
alright

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 
alright

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.480 
alright
enough<00:07:36.639> of<00:07:36.759> that<00:07:36.789> in<00:07:37.449> part<00:07:38.319> 5<00:07:38.560> actually<00:07:39.069> these

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490 
enough of that in part 5 actually these

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.559 
enough of that in part 5 actually these
videos<00:07:39.819> are<00:07:39.940> getting<00:07:40.000> a<00:07:40.120> little<00:07:40.210> short<00:07:40.449> now

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:40.569 
videos are getting a little short now

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:41.640 
videos are getting a little short now
because<00:07:40.990> we're<00:07:41.110> just<00:07:41.139> going<00:07:41.319> over<00:07:41.500> the

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:41.650 
because we're just going over the

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.379 
because we're just going over the
victory<00:07:41.889> types<00:07:42.129> in<00:07:42.569> part<00:07:43.569> 5<00:07:43.840> we<00:07:44.530> will<00:07:44.710> go<00:07:44.860> over

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:45.389 
victory types in part 5 we will go over

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:49.199 
victory types in part 5 we will go over
