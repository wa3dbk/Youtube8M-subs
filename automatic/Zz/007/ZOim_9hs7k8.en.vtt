00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:11.170
 from welcome again to your channel 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.059
 of technology mister friend you now 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.260
 in the applications segment we are going to 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.449
 talk about os-7 beta 50 very very very 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.769
 happy many people did not ask for it and I had 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.150
 than to record what at work we 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.429
 we took a little bit because we wanted 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.859
 really bring you the new things that 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.500
 batres tablet and really it's almost there 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.330
 90% everything works is very, very good 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.910
 but let's talk a little bit about how 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.520
 you can install if you are in version 4 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.440
 you only have activity to perform at 5 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.450
 it leaves you but it allows you very 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.340
 easily from the cell phone licks if 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.289
 you are in beta 3 very careful that 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.030
 they're going to start blocking is they're already 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.670
 blocking then go to the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.559
 fourth and fifth and also yes yes 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.199
 you are a developer, you can do it 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.090
 from scratch and if you want what is not 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.859
 developer and you want to install there 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.600
 a way to download it but it's going to 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.969
 have a video of that explaining everything 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.949
 how to install that in the description and if 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.330
 is not ready the video come back and now 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.500
 when you 're ready you saw you can only 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.740
 leave the description mario is going to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.140
 explain more in depth how 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.149
 good and as I mentioned them it is already very 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.619
 well that of the beta the truth works very 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.659
 well and one of the applications that 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.549
 I was previously affected and everything 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.100
 world was talking was twitter since 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.619
 enter some functions not working 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.990
 to twitter to really see that everything 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.759
 works perfectly the truth is seen 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 very well the application and the little buttons 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.570
 from below that were the ones that were 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.580
 affected already work to totality 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.670
 completely then if you touch them 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.770
 already working on this version of the beta 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.259
 we are also going to talk about what they are going to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.140
 make the colors that you already see that 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.270
 supports is adjusting that is going to be in what 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.929
 which is adjustments and we go into adjustments 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.659
 we will find that the colors already 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.789
 They differ by category if we 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.159
 we see let's go for bluetooth wifi are 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.170
 blue but mobile communications are 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.720
 in green and so the colors change 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.880
 but you already look a little more separated at 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.130
 that we looked at before then we 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.229
 it's better for the eye and all that looks 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.330
 much more orderly now let's go into what 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.160
 which is the bar below that already 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.590
 they work different now we are going to 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.319
 explain to them who really is what 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.499
 it's work 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.299
 now you enter your settings you go to 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:21.129
 be able to block this option from this 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.920
 notifications bar that you drag 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.230
 from the bottom up and why we 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.959
 this serves there are going to be two versions if 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.299
 also on the lock screen what 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.659
 you can disable now we enter 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.569
 adjustments and there you can block these two 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.680
 options so that works that let's say 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.450
 you do not want someone to be 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.150
 By modifying something, you can deactivate it 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.499
 from a home screen and also if 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.930
 you enter an application imagine that 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.700
 you are playing a game like ninja fruit 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.409
 and that bar is affecting you because 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.010
 every time you pass the finger of this 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.109
 News 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.760
 alan doss to the bar below, you can 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.430
 block it inside the applications 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.870
 inside the cell phone usually do not tell 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.060
 will block but will work very 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.799
 well the next thing we're going to see is 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.469
 hopefully we drag the bar 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.299
 top notifications 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.129
 we find that below says that all this 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.290
 information is searched by yahoo and 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.449
 we know what to separate from google 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.359
 then he is occupying traveled as his 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:18.639
 main browser then it takes you 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.410
 directly and makes you look for them 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.830
 through and together we are well 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.840
 is separating google from websites also if 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.270
 we enter photos we can notice that the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.160
 twitter icon has changed this being 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.200
 so that I can better modify the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.300
 colors with that look action the next 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.280
 option is going to be the microphone this is going 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.870
 to allow being able to enter settings and 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.700
 deactivate we enter our 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.040
 settings and sound now going to say 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.290
 microphone and he will give us the list of 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.330
 applications that require microphone and 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.690
 you can deactivate it now really not 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.140
 I know why we occupied no microphone but 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.300
 you have to see exactly how they or what 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.740
 that those promotions can occupy your 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.840
 microphone but it can be interesting 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.310
 to say let's record a video but 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.740
 taking advantage of that we are in adjustments 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.690
 let's go to accessibility is now let's go 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.910
 to find a much bigger listing 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.830
 of things that you can modify we are not going to 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.960
 go into detail in each one since they are 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.630
 many but you see that Paul is also 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.310
 has much more effort especially to 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.320
 those people who need a little more than 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.060
 help with your phone may have been 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.950
 bigger the text and things and that already 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.620
 we looked at earlier but they bring 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.460
 many more similar options in another 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.039
 place that we can notice 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.020
 design is going to be in calls since 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.389
 all the icons have become round 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.340
 to assimilate what the buttons are 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.080
 number that were already round by those of 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.300
 down that they gave like squares then 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.160
 like they're already fixing things for 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.870
 that the design looks a bit cleaner 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.030
 something new also that we found are 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.750
 the strips or flags of the center 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.919
 notifications this will change since 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.620
 it shows us every time we 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.449
 we send a message as we are here in 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.889
 screen that will appear on the part 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.050
 from above not only a part of 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.180
 notification what you can drag and 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.520
 read the message and do not go directly to 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.590
 the application as it did in the ibc 6 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.660
 then a little different we are going to 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.669
 to see the messages and be able to read them 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.500
 there in the notification bar before 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.910
 enter the application that you're going to 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.580
 be able to do from the lock screen 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.020
 and also inside the cell phone and what 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.210
 last we find in this new 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.580
 version of beta 5 is the way 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.889
 turn it off nothing very big but now you go 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.199
 to be able to slide to turn it off which is 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.599
 something the look looks a little bit different 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.520
 to what we saw earlier but not 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.110
 it's a matter of the other world and these are all 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.700
 the notifications that we could 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.610
 find in the beta without 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.260
 If you already have exploits leave your 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.600
 comment below that no other things 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.630
 other secrets found the beta 5 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.390
 we are very close should I really see 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.460
 this finished if you would like to have a 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.380
 Leave a memory to be in our 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.970
 geek night that is all lighting 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.410
 also in our podcast always 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.670
 We are giving away a license out there 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.190
 because we have a license 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.930
 developer and we're giving him away 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.430
 our audience then be very 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.460
 Slopes follow us because these networks 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.560
 socials also to my mac mx which is what 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.850
 who is in charge of production for what 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.070
 what is this 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.900
 then many applications segment 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.760
 thank you for the great support of the truth 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.620
 I recommend that you download it now

 a 90 is running the battery very well 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.090
 and all the applications is already seen 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.520
 much better you can read much better the 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.650
 design is no longer as complicated as the 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.020
 first clear beta this will develop 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.880
 I do not know what we expect and be very soon 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.920
 in the latest version that already throws the 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.750
 new device is going to be the
