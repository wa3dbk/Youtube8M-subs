00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.249 
by an out outpouring of public support
and<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.049> already<00:02:01.200> has<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> big<00:02:01.829> enough

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
and I think it already has a big enough

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.020 
and I think it already has a big enough
public<00:02:04.259> backing<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.759> make<00:02:05.880> that

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
public backing but if we can make that

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.310 
public backing but if we can make that
even<00:02:06.240> more<00:02:06.540> substantial

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
even more substantial

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.559 
even more substantial
I<00:02:07.350> feel<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.009> Sony<00:02:08.250> they<00:02:08.910> could<00:02:09.179> afford<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
I feel like Sony they could afford to

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.969 
I feel like Sony they could afford to
look<00:02:09.720> away<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.110> that's<00:02:10.349> their<00:02:10.770> big

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
look away because that's their big

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.740 
look away because that's their big
company<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:11.790> it'd<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.030> really<00:02:12.270> hard<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.629> them

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
company but it'd be really hard for them

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.340 
company but it'd be really hard for them
to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.370 
to
nor<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.770> fact<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.970> idea<00:02:15.750> carries<00:02:16.290> a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
nor the fact that this idea carries a

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.650 
nor the fact that this idea carries a
lot<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.620> weight<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.210> it<00:02:18.210> will<00:02:18.330> help<00:02:18.510> them

lot of weight and it will help them

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.750 
lot of weight and it will help them
