00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.329
 offer good mixing so for the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.870
 download did you make yourself 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.550
 make a world there is disappointment 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.120

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.559
 copy the capa on the left 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.090
 or wait for 60 seconds and you 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.859
 click on generate link from 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.050
 downloading 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.850
 and then when it's crazy luc hees click 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.329
 here to start your download 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.289
 au mans I do not do I already have my 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.320
 downloaded file 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.750
 so it's a zip file and narjissi 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.640
 I do not unpack the archive 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.790
 just know that you are 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.880
 7zip programs or a rare area 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.960
 if you did not look for them on 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.670
 google you will have a lot of results 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.579
 so you open your archive me 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.229
 I use this these snippets your 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.070
 folder on your desk 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.350
 like I do it for a moment you can 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.750
 delete the rxi4 mandate will have more of the 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.850
 all needed 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.470
 then you have a folder this folder 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.960
 will you open it 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.280
 so you have a folder creaks to two 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.380
 centuries and plugins to put the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.330
 program in French the installer is 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.090
 a fake account does not care what plays the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.729
 subject so we will start well 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.049
 obviously by installing virtual dj hero 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.640
 I launch it here the installer is in 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.380
 English but do not worry we 're gonna 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 of course our French program 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.280
 forgot his ex you go to an exhibition 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.990
 beautiful you can do the installation 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.019
 normal 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.780
 install so you're going to wait 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.209
 during installation 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.040
 I'm going to cut the video and get 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.360
 found immediately after 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.850
 no 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.090
 so more when the murderer finished 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.990
 you check one of the dj and you 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.630

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.209
 many programs that spit I am 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.690
 not too much written deaths to be able to 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.910
 rider your dvd I have you presenter 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.650

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.840
 your dvd and especially this one 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.520
 apparently I still tested I you 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.720
 will say in the description this is not 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.610
 badly not 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.130
 rip vinyl is for if you have any 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.650
 mdd old disk designated and you 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.770
 want to keep them on your pc in the format 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.180
 mp3 but you just grind your 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.520
 platinum on the input the line input 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.640
 the microphone input of your pc 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.850
 and you launch rivlin and and you can 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.239
 directly recorded 1 your video 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:18.130
 and our virtual dj file our 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.130
 forgiveness program if you said that takes 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.990
 this program when it launches them you 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.510
 ask for your activation key 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.650
 so we're not going here your number is 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.410
 series 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.860
 so you crash does not work with 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.259
 a key so you close these 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.990
 you can delete shortcuts too 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:45.409
 per year you can delete shortcut 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.610
 since it's the shortcut of one of 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.919
 those I just showed you 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.919
 tivo times the keys you do not have 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.520
 we are going to launch 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.670
 2 if normally I think there 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.400
 did not start - what I did 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:05.430
 to not complicate my life 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.590
 the social atomic file dj pro 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.080
 Download me frozen simply 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.760
 moved forgiveness move here 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.000
 like that I 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:22.560
 yes huh is what we will launch 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.870
 so it's going to go into the golden folder 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.830
 crack and we will launch this one 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.680
 virtual during and virtual dj pro b 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.210
 sailor so here is asking for your 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.560
 username and password 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.570
 of course we do not have any, so I want 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.490
 me neither I have not complicated there 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.320
 will be zero and it goes absolutely nothing 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:49.380
 changed to the program so here apparently 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.530
 it's time it's up to the French but 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.100
 for you I think that being in English 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.210
 so you go in issia to confetti 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.250
 skins 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.190
 and the Greeks she confesses under the 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.539
 whistles me he is already at the French 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.430
 because they were already installed 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:09.030
 before then in my opinion the custody and 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.280
 conspiracies therefore sees a hurry and 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.110
 dj ready to salty note Jacques 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.479

 renamed virtual dj where the recovery is there 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.509
 where he always was so well now 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.270

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.860

 jet set you find the programs that 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:49.229
