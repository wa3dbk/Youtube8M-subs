fructose<00:00:24.600> corn<00:00:24.840> syrup<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:26.070> grocery<00:00:26.519> store

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
fructose corn syrup in the grocery store

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.019 
fructose corn syrup in the grocery store
and<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.570> your<00:00:27.720> cupboards<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:29.490> question<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and in your cupboards now one question I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
and in your cupboards now one question I
always<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.929> why<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.500> manufacturers<00:00:32.430> put

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
always get is why do manufacturers put

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.790 
always get is why do manufacturers put
hot<00:00:32.969> fructose<00:00:33.450> corn<00:00:33.660> syrup<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.260> my<00:00:34.500> food

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
hot fructose corn syrup in my food

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.370 
hot fructose corn syrup in my food
instead<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.550> sugar<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:36.480> much<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:37.320> cheaper

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
instead of sugar it's much much cheaper

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.250 
instead of sugar it's much much cheaper
for<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.610> use<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.090> chemical<00:00:39.690> high

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
for them to use this chemical high

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.440 
for them to use this chemical high
fructose<00:00:40.500> corn<00:00:40.770> syrup<00:00:41.070> than<00:00:41.700> natural<00:00:42.000> sugar

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
fructose corn syrup than natural sugar

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.200 
fructose corn syrup than natural sugar
so<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:43.649> their<00:00:44.070> food<00:00:44.430> items<00:00:44.850> will<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so actually their food items will be a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
so actually their food items will be a
little<00:00:45.420> bit<00:00:45.600> cheaper<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.350> you're<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> one

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
little bit cheaper for you're the one

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.549 
little bit cheaper for you're the one
that<00:00:47.010> suffers<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.660> number<00:00:49.079> one<00:00:49.260> place

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that suffers so the number one place

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.900 
that suffers so the number one place
most<00:00:49.920> people<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.340> getting<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.730> high

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
most people are getting that high

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.439 
most people are getting that high
fructose<00:00:51.120> corn<00:00:51.390> syrup<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.800> soda<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:54.090> the

ingredients list on this coke is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
ingredients list on this coke is
carbonated<00:00:58.170> water<00:00:58.320> high<00:00:59.219> fructose<00:00:59.550> corn

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
carbonated water high fructose corn

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.510 
carbonated water high fructose corn
syrup<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> second<00:01:01.410> ingredient<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.250> here

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
syrup so the second ingredient in here

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.850 
syrup so the second ingredient in here
is<00:01:02.699> high<00:01:03.000> fructose<00:01:03.390> corn<00:01:03.629> syrup<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.290> there

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
is high fructose corn syrup and there

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.789 
is high fructose corn syrup and there
are<00:01:04.979> 40<00:01:05.489> grams<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.210> sugar<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.680> of

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
are 40 grams of sugar in this one can of

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.039 
are 40 grams of sugar in this one can of
coke<00:01:08.070> which<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> equivalent<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.630> 10

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
coke which is the equivalent of 10

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.679 
coke which is the equivalent of 10
teaspoons<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.799> sugar<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.729> imagine<00:01:11.970> putting<00:01:12.299> 10

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
teaspoons of sugar so imagine putting 10

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.140 
teaspoons of sugar so imagine putting 10
teaspoons<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.380> sugar<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.070> cup<00:01:14.310> adding<00:01:14.939> some

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
teaspoons of sugar in a cup adding some

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
teaspoons of sugar in a cup adding some
water<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.659> then<00:01:16.049> drinking<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.920> even

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
water and then drinking that or even

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.700 
water and then drinking that or even
worse<00:01:17.520> giving<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.630> kids<00:01:18.900> now

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
worse giving that to your kids now

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.399

having Gatorade yourself and you think
it's<00:01:36.570> actually<00:01:36.780> healthier<00:01:37.380> than<00:01:37.619> soda<00:01:37.920> you're

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
it's actually healthier than soda you're

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.160 
it's actually healthier than soda you're
