00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.879
 yet she is handicapped several times and this child and represents the life of this 

00:00:16.879 --> 00:00:21.009
 Family upside down she questions everything that lives on like that 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.109
 Many parents probably already had to ask all active questions 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.730
 discussing it ruthlessly and openly and honestly like Lena 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.810
 changed her life and how she can continue to live and pass on today 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.829

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.160

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.710

 but then Anna gives birth to a handicapped child 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.570

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.110
 today they have our art from 90 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.520
 That's what makes them that way 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.660
 but she was very 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.870
 and Khalil 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.600
 I have a goal when I go up when they go up 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.560

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.260
 Münster St 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.390
 because she hardly had any tension 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.580
 I thought 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.400
 since my life is over for such a nice life as a music producer 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.010
 Musicians have traveled the world and percent their performance on the show 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.430
 percent 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.970
 and then you realize on the open week the child is handicapped 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.149
 with special needs 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.869
 several times severely handicapped the small Lina aviator Buyten the die

 operated three months intensive care unit Katie Holmes has lead offenders 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.730
 They each struck 4 they commanded and seafood to one 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.160
 rare photos they would have and 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.340
 what you have to do with it 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.030
 not much scope 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.000
 &amp; Cie 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 Suddenly with her huge eyes on and I had the feeling that she 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.599
 that does not help approx 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.700
 three months in the hospital make the other very tired 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:21.420
 No, after home with Fehmarn she has to take a syringe with her 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.109
 Hose fed through the nose will last for hours of torture 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.180
 the doctors say Lena could get Eppinger Tisch seizures and after 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.489
 to suffocate 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.489
 Her mother has always been in the mood for protests like never before 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.409
 how do you say something like that I did not have much 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.689
 now one thinks so now wants a bad one 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.419
 happened is picture 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.439
 the roof 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.779
 Tests and tests do you have this responsibility 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.779
 Henkel has so far been school martial arts piece is it tastes 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.849
 she stands by for months 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.849
 then Anna becomes the burden too big 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.929
 I suddenly knew 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:08.929
 that's the way back I think it's important 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.419
 I can not do that I do not dare I do not really care 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.289
 I can not do it 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.119
 hold if I'm not careful Berlin 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:21.119
 then she falls youth 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.729
 the terrible realization that is 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.199
 I want to keep going and I was totally exhausted by the day 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.509
 after that breaks down must go to psychiatry 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:35.990
 after six weeks she comes home again 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.170
 she wants to do everything differently so separates herself from Hermann 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.439
 but after a few weeks Sina asks me to come back and decide 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.439
 The unthinkable Lehner must Sinsheim 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:49.290
 it does not exist at all and 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.499
 like war still percent today 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.799
 Volker Auwärter to think because that was a howling without end also with me 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.829
 you do not give it a kid just way 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.829
 you feel guilty and 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.549
 you just do not do that so it will be over 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.629
 the whole world falls to a no 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.629
 and then I truly learned how the right day 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:16.469
 that made us 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.749
 what you as a mother farthest from me I gave my child fat 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.279
 and that's a decision 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.309
 Karben is to wear 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.749
 Lehner already lives here in the home for six years 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:35.629
 She has learned to walk during this time and can eat herself and a few sentences 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.759
 say 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.650
 she shares a room with Janina the only one as well no the reason for 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.210
 the talk came no 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.860
 s 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.610
 here in Bernburg has again become a happy child 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.590
 and her mother Anna 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.840
 has regained her strength 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.110
 I do not want to be an Olympian I am happy if I succeed my children 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.949
 to the two lives 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:04.059
 to make two happy people 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.779
 and if I really have the duty and once more has more 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.159
 can hold 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.159
 then I'm nominated again victories until then 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.469
 and that makes her very admirable li Well, now she has two family she still has us 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.580
 so it's the right camera 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.900
 and who she dares today more than the doctors last married the project 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.659
 So that would still have to this story
