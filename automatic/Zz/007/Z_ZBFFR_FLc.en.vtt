 we want to 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:56.880
 maybe to accommodate 20 to 30 children 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.090
 The children should be natural young as possible if you take them 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.030
 Failure to get out of the play can not be here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.770
 The kids need to come up with that situation at some point 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.760
 Street children meet but that as soon as possible 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.210

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.940
 and change a few things had been bought to bring people 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.180
 Aachen in the summer there, the women come curiously to the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 arrivals 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.430

 Head coach one corner the other country strong 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.479
 that each family should receive the same amount, sometimes it comes to a dispute 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.710
 a novel feels unfairly treated and the coffers everything like 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.260
 because one believes that others have taken more than they deserve 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.480

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.249
 after years of being a banana 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:18.059
 he is only allowed to do that in part 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.569
 after leaving his team at the net five fat years longer 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.420
 somebody thinks you've been there for a long time, or maybe it is 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.209
 It's almost impossible to believe that it's important to do something like that 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.859
 Everything was organized was of course but could but for a 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.079
 awesome race justified every his point of view come at the same age 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.689
 October opens in the village and is dismayed by the states like 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.979
 Village chief at a time when actually her house 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.509
 it is noticeable 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.509
 and 40 years old 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.829

 five six square meters are ten children 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.260
 Dollar expected 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.430
 and the rest of the family travel parents and grandparents 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.489
 France take note of the mucking here 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.229
 »Continue to shout 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:15.339
 In conversation with the 34-year-old finds out where is the incredible 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.050
 the Iraqi there said that percent 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.230
 many children are sold here apply other countries 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.989
 and they get money for it again so even heard 5000 euros for one 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.169
 child 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.169
 so that the rest of the interests of the rest of the swiss but lives 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.909
 can 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.469
 I think here should also problem area children still expand 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.219
 on the one hand are there for families to support but and that 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.669
 sees here also from the point of child trafficking 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.429
 The child traders buy mainly infants up to one year 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:52.160
 15 days later, these devices succeeded abroad 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.129
 he is since July 19 clock 92, the trade in Romania punishable 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.019
 until then, it was estimated that about 40 children were sold every day 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.289
 Hans Thoma 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.779
 Half of all children are illegal adoptions to Germany 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.549
 be arrived 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.820
 next time problems with the Romanian house construction 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.609
 here worlds collide 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.309
 without large machines and everything by hand the construction of the children's home is delayed 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.309
 and the costs go beyond the budget 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.610
