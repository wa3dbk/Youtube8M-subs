00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
instead of having XP 1st and Vista 2nd

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.710 
instead of having XP 1st and Vista 2nd
or<00:01:18.659> vista<00:01:19.020> 1st<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.920> XP<00:01:20.400> 2nd<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.119> change

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
or vista 1st and XP 2nd you can change

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960 
or vista 1st and XP 2nd you can change
that<00:01:21.960> around<00:01:22.080> by<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.939> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that around by going in here and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.480 
that around by going in here and
modifying<00:01:24.659> those<00:01:24.810> entries<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.369> very

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
modifying those entries so it's very

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.649 
modifying those entries so it's very
simple<00:01:26.759> you're<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.390> change

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
simple you're just going to change

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.109 
simple you're just going to change
settings<00:01:28.110> which<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> default<00:01:29.430> OS<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
settings which one is a default OS that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
settings which one is a default OS that
you<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> show<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> first<00:01:31.470> boots<00:01:32.100> up

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you want to show when it first boots up

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.999 
you want to show when it first boots up

entries<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.430> well<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.939> let's<00:02:03.149> go<00:02:03.270> into<00:02:03.420> add<00:02:03.869> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
entries as well so let's go into add and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.590 
entries as well so let's go into add and
remove<00:02:04.560> entries<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.969> example<00:02:06.390> if

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
remove entries here so for example if

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.109 
remove entries here so for example if
you<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> dual<00:02:07.140> boot<00:02:07.439> machine<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> you've

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you have a dual boot machine and you've

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.390 
you have a dual boot machine and you've
got<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> Windows<00:02:09.840> Vista<00:02:09.989> bootloader<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.039> it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
got the Windows Vista bootloader and it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.979 
got the Windows Vista bootloader and it
shows<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> two<00:02:12.030> operating<00:02:12.450> systems<00:02:12.810> but

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
shows you the two operating systems but

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.710 
shows you the two operating systems but
you<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.410> all

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you have all

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.840 
you have all
so<00:02:13.840> Linux<00:02:14.650> installed<00:02:15.130> but<00:02:15.370> it's<00:02:15.520> hidden<00:02:15.730> from

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
so Linux installed but it's hidden from

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.910 
so Linux installed but it's hidden from
view<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.480> Windows<00:02:16.840> boot<00:02:17.140> loader<00:02:17.380> doesn't<00:02:17.650> know

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
view so Windows boot loader doesn't know

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.550 
view so Windows boot loader doesn't know
you<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.610> actually<00:02:18.760> use<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.330> utility<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.320> add

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
you can actually use this utility to add

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.040 
you can actually use this utility to add
another<00:02:21.040> entry<00:02:21.640> for<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.090> different<00:02:22.570> operating

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
another entry for a different operating

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.390 
another entry for a different operating
system<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.740> might<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:24.100> also

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
system that you might have also

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.610 
system that you might have also
installed<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.750> maybe<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.080> have<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> dual

installed and maybe you have a dual

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.670 
installed and maybe you have a dual
triple<00:02:27.040> boot<00:02:27.430> whatever<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:29.080> not<00:02:29.410> on

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.570 
where the operating system information
is<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:40.990> for<00:02:41.380> example<00:02:41.740> if<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.070> bun<00:02:42.400> -

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
is so for example if you have a bun -

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.640 
is so for example if you have a bun -
there's<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.240> grub<00:02:43.480> menu<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.110> there's<00:02:44.500> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
there's the grub menu and there's the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.840 
there's the grub menu and there's the
grub<00:02:44.890> boot<00:02:46.650> record<00:02:47.650> there<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.580> for

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
grub boot record there you have for

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.370 
grub boot record there you have for
Ubuntu<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.480> can<00:02:49.630> specify<00:02:49.900> which

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
Ubuntu and you can specify which

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.070 
Ubuntu and you can specify which
partition<00:02:50.830> it's<00:02:51.100> installed<00:02:51.580> on<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.150> then<00:02:52.840> add

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
partition it's installed on and then add

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.550 
partition it's installed on and then add
that<00:02:53.470> entry<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.250> there<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.180> now<00:02:55.360> when<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.930> boot

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
that entry in there so now when I boot

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.440 
that entry in there so now when I boot
up<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.709> machine<00:02:57.190> for<00:02:57.430> example<00:02:57.580> instead<00:02:58.360> of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
up the machine for example instead of

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.150 
up the machine for example instead of
just<00:02:58.600> seeing<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.990> Windows<00:02:59.440> XP<00:02:59.920> and<00:02:59.980> Vista

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
just seeing the Windows XP and Vista

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.870 
just seeing the Windows XP and Vista
option<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.209> will<00:03:01.690> see<00:03:01.900> now<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.620> Linux<00:03:03.100> option

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
option I will see now the Linux option

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.940 
option I will see now the Linux option
the<00:03:04.060> Neo<00:03:04.270> smart<00:03:04.720> Linux<00:03:05.080> option<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.650> course<00:03:05.860> you

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
the Neo smart Linux option of course you

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.590 
the Neo smart Linux option of course you
can<00:03:06.070> rename<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.640> whatever<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.420> that

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
can rename that to whatever it is that

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.250 
can rename that to whatever it is that
you<00:03:07.690> want<00:03:07.959> but<00:03:08.500> here<00:03:08.740> quickly<00:03:09.100> shows<00:03:09.490> you

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
you want but here quickly shows you

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.449 
you want but here quickly shows you
after<00:03:11.260> rebooted<00:03:11.709> just<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.070> took<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> quick

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
after rebooted just that took a quick

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.760 
after rebooted just that took a quick
snapshot<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:13.180> give<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.450> an<00:03:13.510> idea<00:03:13.630> here<00:03:14.200> right

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
snapshot to give you an idea here right

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.290 
snapshot to give you an idea here right
and<00:03:14.950> also<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.310> order<00:03:15.490> right<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:15.970> can<00:03:16.090> switch

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
and also the order right you can switch

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.880 
and also the order right you can switch
the<00:03:16.450> order<00:03:16.630> in<00:03:16.840> which<00:03:16.959> these<00:03:17.170> things<00:03:17.380> appear

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
the order in which these things appear

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.790 
the order in which these things appear
so<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.970> way<00:03:19.090> if<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.360> defaults<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:19.930> 15<00:03:20.320> seconds

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
so that way if it defaults in 15 seconds

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.460 
so that way if it defaults in 15 seconds
to<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.010> boot<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.670> operating<00:03:22.060> system<00:03:22.470> it

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
to a boot up and operating system it

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.530 
to a boot up and operating system it
boots<00:03:23.769> up<00:03:23.920> into<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.220> one<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.550> want<00:03:24.790> more

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
boots up into the one that you want more

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.479 
boots up into the one that you want more
options<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:26.260> here<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.680> course<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.459> can

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
options in here of course that you can

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.610 
options in here of course that you can
go<00:03:27.730> in<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.000> tweak<00:03:28.239> some<00:03:29.140> of<00:03:29.170> these<00:03:29.350> are

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
go in and tweak some of these are

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.350 
go in and tweak some of these are
advanced<00:03:30.160> settings<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:30.880> if<00:03:31.030> you're<00:03:31.180> not<00:03:31.300> sure

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
advanced settings so if you're not sure

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.140 
maybe you've got problems with your
bootloader<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.540> want<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.780> reinstall<00:03:47.290> or

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
bootloader and you want to reinstall or

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.090 
bootloader and you want to reinstall or
get<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:49.299> back<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.049> original<00:03:50.440> settings<00:03:50.860> and

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
get it back to the original settings and

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.120 
get it back to the original settings and
for<00:03:51.940> some<00:03:52.120> reason<00:03:52.480> your<00:03:53.049> Vista<00:03:53.590> disappeared

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
for some reason your Vista disappeared

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.979 
for some reason your Vista disappeared
from<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.430> menu<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:54.880> you<00:03:55.000> just<00:03:55.150> have<00:03:55.330> XP<00:03:55.750> or

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
from the menu and you just have XP or

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.990 
from the menu and you just have XP or
maybe<00:03:56.680> when<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.190> installed<00:03:57.489> Ubuntu<00:03:57.580> or

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
maybe when you installed Ubuntu or

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.030 
maybe when you installed Ubuntu or
another<00:03:58.360> operating<00:03:58.720> system<00:03:58.799> certain<00:03:59.799> things

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
another operating system certain things

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.520 
another operating system certain things
on<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.340> menu<00:04:00.459> disappeared<00:04:01.390> so<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.230> can<00:04:02.380> try

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
on the menu disappeared so you can try

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.250 
on the menu disappeared so you can try
to<00:04:02.590> get<00:04:02.769> things<00:04:03.160> back<00:04:03.330> right<00:04:04.330> and<00:04:04.570> rescue<00:04:05.080> them

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
to get things back right and rescue them

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.009 
to get things back right and rescue them
basically<00:04:05.709> by<00:04:06.310> using<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:07.150> utility<00:04:07.660> as<00:04:07.780> well

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
basically by using this utility as well

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.560 
basically by using this utility as well
so<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.830> is<00:04:08.890> another<00:04:09.220> reason<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.150> use<00:04:10.360> this

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
so this is another reason to to use this

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.660 
so this is another reason to to use this
not<00:04:10.840> just<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.170> modify<00:04:11.650> things<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.580> are

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
not just to modify things that are

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.060 
not just to modify things that are
working<00:04:12.850> fine<00:04:13.239> but<00:04:13.930> also<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:14.350> try<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.709> rescue

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
working fine but also to try to rescue

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.270 
working fine but also to try to rescue
and<00:04:15.430> repair<00:04:15.880> things<00:04:16.120> that<00:04:16.900> have<00:04:17.709> basically

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and repair things that have basically

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.599 
and repair things that have basically
been<00:04:18.790> either<00:04:19.090> erased<00:04:20.019> removed<00:04:20.919> when<00:04:21.400> you

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
been either erased removed when you

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.310 
been either erased removed when you
installed<00:04:22.090> another<00:04:22.390> operating<00:04:22.780> system<00:04:22.840> and

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
installed another operating system and

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.110 
installed another operating system and
now<00:04:23.440> it's<00:04:23.620> no<00:04:23.770> longer<00:04:23.979> there<00:04:24.250> on<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.460> menu<00:04:24.789> so

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
now it's no longer there on the menu so

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.640 
now it's no longer there on the menu so
it's<00:04:25.660> a<00:04:25.720> little<00:04:25.810> bit<00:04:25.960> tricky<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.320> mean<00:04:26.470> there's

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
it's a little bit tricky I mean there's

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.600 
it's a little bit tricky I mean there's
different<00:04:26.950> scenarios

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
different scenarios

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.490 
different scenarios
obviously<00:04:28.060> there's<00:04:28.210> too<00:04:28.330> much<00:04:28.479> to<00:04:28.719> really<00:04:28.960> go

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
obviously there's too much to really go

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.679 
obviously there's too much to really go
through<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.280> try<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.520> fix<00:04:30.849> every<00:04:31.479> single

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
through to try to fix every single

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.320 
through to try to fix every single
problem<00:04:32.139> but<00:04:32.560> obviously<00:04:33.099> they've<00:04:34.090> thought

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
problem but obviously they've thought

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.629 
problem but obviously they've thought
about<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.080> easy<00:04:35.259> BCD<00:04:36.159> folks<00:04:36.460> who

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
about this the easy BCD folks who

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.790 
about this the easy BCD folks who
created<00:04:36.969> this<00:04:37.210> know<00:04:37.719> that<00:04:37.750> there's<00:04:38.259> potential

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
created this know that there's potential

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.929 
created this know that there's potential
issues<00:04:39.129> when<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.370> install<00:04:39.610> different

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:39.939 
issues when you install different

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:41.249 
issues when you install different
operating<00:04:40.300> systems<00:04:40.659> and<00:04:40.750> you<00:04:40.870> might<00:04:41.020> want<00:04:41.199> to

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
operating systems and you might want to

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.899 
operating systems and you might want to
restore<00:04:41.560> things<00:04:41.830> so<00:04:42.009> that's<00:04:42.490> why<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.759> gives

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:42.909 
restore things so that's why it gives

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:44.580 
restore things so that's why it gives
you<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.180> option<00:04:43.569> there<00:04:43.689> in<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:43.870> Diagnostics

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
you the option there in the Diagnostics

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.820 
you the option there in the Diagnostics
so<00:04:44.770> very<00:04:45.400> nice<00:04:45.610> little<00:04:45.789> utility<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.830> if

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
so very nice little utility and if

bootloader this definitely is the best
program<00:04:53.379> to<00:04:53.409> do<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:53.979> I<00:04:54.699> hope<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.389> enjoyed
