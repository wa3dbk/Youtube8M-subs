00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.790
 hello everyone welcome to the channel is 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.500
 girls secrets today I'm going to give you some 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.480
 tips to be able to choose a good 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.009
 dryer for our hair first 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.170
 that we will look is that you have the cable 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.570
 long to be manageable and you have to 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.970
 be light we are from the most 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.609
 light from 400 grams to the most 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.689
 heavy of the kilo 200 of a kilo 300 like this 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.850
 which is a point that you have to have 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.740
 present especially if we have a lot 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.779
 hair we have it very long because if 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.880
 it will not be very here we have to look at the 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.619
 power of the dryer never or if it's 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.570
 what they tell us here with some letters 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.850
 big and striking because many times 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.830
 they cheat us we have to look at the part 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.140
 from behind or on the side by a letter 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.960
 very small I recommend a power 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.970
 minimum of 1,600 watts it is important that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.100
 allow to adjust the temperature and the 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.869
 power with two buttons to be able 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.000
 adapt to the quality of our hair 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.680
 the cold air button is essential 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.780
 the heat what it does is leave the hair 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.089
 more moldable and that's why we can give 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.949
 form if after we apply cold air 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.680
 we set if we keep the shape during 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.370
 much longer a dryer that has 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.320
 power 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 will have more durability since they are 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.070
 manufactured to keep high 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.960
 temperatures for a long time 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.509
 we found infinity of dryers of 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.549
 brands of designs and materials can 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.259
 Ceramic be what it does 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.360
 is that the air is always at the same 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.610
 temperature facilitating the drying 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.950
 They can also be the tourmaline 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.229
 tubulina gives us a lot of brightness and 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.119
 accelerates drying and finally the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.430
 download billions that avoids the 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.259
 static electricity and also we 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.060
 contributes which I recommend investing 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.860
 little bit more in a professional dryer 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.530
 because it's going to be profitable because it 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.300
 let's give a lot more use the only thing 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.399
 what we need are nozzles 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.350
 flat nozzles are for straightening and 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.780
 normally they already come with the dryer 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.300
 and the diffuser you have to buy 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.009
 apart the diffuser is not expensive so no 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.840
 Do not worry if the dryer is 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.940
 professional you will not have problem in 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.060
 find these pieces because they are 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.399
 universal but if you do not have it in mind 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.740
 because if they break down or get lost 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.690
 they will be a problem, I hope you have 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.520
