00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 do not 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello how are you fine thank you today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.299
 let's do one of those things that do not 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.670
 they can be simpler and they remain 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.099
 also the face a piece of furniture in this case 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.080
 a door if you are not initiated into the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.430
 world the DIY I explain the face 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.980
 a piece of furniture serves to provide the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.800
 Surface a smooth and perfect finish 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.300
 today we're going to face it but first thing 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.250
 it comes first and we will see that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.739
 we need to be able to take out the furniture 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.169
 first the titan what is a glaze 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.660
 polyurethane lacquer this enamel has 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.420
 to be diluted in water ras also 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.219
 we will need sandpaper of the number 400 os 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.640
 I remember that the number indicates the thickness 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.730
 of the sandpaper we will also be a rag 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.070
 a foam roller placed 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.990
 a bucket 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.540
 a palentina 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.950
 and bodybuilder tape if you follow us 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.080
 habitually you will have noticed 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.480
 two things the first there are many 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.800
 types of rollers so I advise you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.390
 that before any kind of doubt 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.790
 ask in your distributor 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 titans nearer and the second that without 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.840
 bodybuilder's tape you will not be anyone in the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 DIY world and now that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.190
 we know all this we are going to take our 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 accompanying door 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.140
 good here we have the door as 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.640
 you can see it needs a good lacquer like that 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.740
 that the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.790
 remove all those things that we can 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.420
 remove 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.420
 how 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.290
 next what we will do is catch 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.430
 the bodybuilder's tape and protect all 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.530
 those areas that we do not want that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.040
 come into contact neither with the painting nor 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.040
 with enamel 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 remember that the bodybuilder's tape is 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.939
 as the parsley of the fight can not be 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.360
 use for a thousand things in this case 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.360
 to protect 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.940
 that is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.430
 And I like 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 ah 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.400
 well and now we can proceed to sanding 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.020
 there are people who can not stand this noise 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.180
 especially Do not come over with sandpaper 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.750
 try to file rough edges, not stay 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 without door 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.170
 yes 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.640
 once we have finished sanding there 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.000
 than removing all the dust adhering in 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.000
 the door 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.760
 or not 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.080
 I remind you that if the Palencia is new 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.060
 you have to wash it well with soap and water 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.260
 before using it you also have to leave it 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.659
 dry off 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.049
 And now we can move on and open the 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.049
 enamel 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.730
 and now that we have it open what 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.470
 stir well 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.470
 now and so we make arms 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.360
 and now we take it and put it in the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.360
 bucket 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.960
 and I remember that this enamel has to be 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.190
 dilute in water but only a little 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.560
 every boy 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.110
 and it is already 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.239
 and now as I always say Palencia and 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.239
 roll let's start with palencia 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.970
 for the most delicate areas like the little 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.569
 how 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.780
 very carefully so that everything is 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.780
 first 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.200
 ah 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.670
 or not 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.650
 Y 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.009
 do not 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.550
 but 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.550
 here 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 ah 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.979
 and now it's the turn of the roller to 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.979
 finish the play 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.990
 remember that starting comes the enamel 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.990
 evenly over the entire surface 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.300
 Well, this is already here and now 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.160
 wait about 8 hours or so to a 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.840
 thing if you want instead of using the 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.580
 enamel that we have used you can use 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.050
 also the titan which effect wood 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.570
 that mimics the finish of the wood 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.880
 natural if you use you have to know 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.230
 two things the first thing that this enamel does not 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.450
 it has to be diluted in any product 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.840
 the second that the correct way to 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.030
 use it is the following 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.889
 with a palentina we will distribute the 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.750
 z-shaped enamel throughout the 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.550
 surface once distributed all the 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.160
 enamel and before ten 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.139
 minutes we will think gently with the 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.940
 tip of the palentina drained from below 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.310
 up along the entire surface 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.590
 so we will not interrupt the vein of the 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.150
 wood and if you want there is a trick to 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.729
 further enhance the grain of the wood 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.160
 it's as simple as trimming the ends 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.510
 of the Palencia unequally as 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.510
 modern people are combing today 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.789
 well then the after eight hours of 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:43.340
 dried a fine sandpaper and a second layer 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.740
 We already have our door well 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.139
 prepared now only remains to enjoy 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.039
 she remember see you in titanlux 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.039
 point tv 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.650
 we find 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.660
 i 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.860
 days
