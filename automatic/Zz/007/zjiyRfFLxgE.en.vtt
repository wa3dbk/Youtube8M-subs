like<00:05:21.280> tender<00:05:21.670> to<00:05:21.820> cook<00:05:22.000> real<00:05:22.720> bad<00:05:22.930> memory<00:05:23.290> but

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
like tender to cook real bad memory but

like tender to cook real bad memory but
yeah<00:05:24.010> I'm<00:05:24.220> i'll<00:05:25.150> probably<00:05:25.419> put<00:05:25.660> it<00:05:25.810> with

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
yeah I'm i'll probably put it with

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.940 
yeah I'm i'll probably put it with
extreme<00:05:27.790> conditioning<00:05:28.419> or<00:05:28.690> flood<00:05:28.990> of<00:05:29.110> Han<00:05:29.260> yes

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
extreme conditioning or flood of Han yes

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.320 
extreme conditioning or flood of Han yes
it's<00:05:30.280> with<00:05:30.460> this<00:05:30.610> room<00:05:30.790> condition<00:05:30.970> on<00:05:31.210> this

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
it's with this room condition on this

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.570 
it's with this room condition on this
map<00:05:31.540> since<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.900> a<00:05:31.960> bit<00:05:32.139> bigger<00:05:32.440> it<00:05:33.040> feels<00:05:33.250> on<00:05:33.550> a

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
map since is a bit bigger it feels on a

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.720 
map since is a bit bigger it feels on a
smaller<00:05:33.910> map<00:05:34.180> I'll<00:05:34.360> definitely<00:05:34.570> use<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.800> slight

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
smaller map I'll definitely use a slight

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.370 
smaller map I'll definitely use a slight
of<00:05:36.820> hand<00:05:36.880> just<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.300> quickly<00:05:37.510> reload<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:38.230> get

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
of hand just to quickly reload and get

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.770 
of hand just to quickly reload and get
back<00:05:38.530> in<00:05:38.650> the<00:05:38.740> action<00:05:38.889> and<00:05:39.400> face<00:05:40.360> like<00:05:40.630> I

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
back in the action and face like I

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.040 
back in the action and face like I
always<00:05:40.960> do<00:05:41.320> and<00:05:41.650> like<00:05:42.220> you<00:05:42.400> guys<00:05:42.580> always<00:05:42.880> do<00:05:43.150> so

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
um yeah it's a wonderful per question

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.320 
um yeah it's a wonderful per question
them<00:05:47.500> it's<00:05:47.860> pretty<00:05:48.070> much<00:05:48.250> just<00:05:48.330> experiment

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
them it's pretty much just experiment

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.159 
them it's pretty much just experiment
with<00:05:49.450> different<00:05:49.780> combinations<00:05:50.230> and<00:05:52.169> second
