00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello to all but today I 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.769
 would like to make a video in fact for 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.070
 show you we can make a recipe 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.810
 quite quickly with products from 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.330
 end of raw materials are actually 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.949
 fresh produce and coming out of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.480
 training not too much wasting time 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.640
 and succeed in doing something to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.430
 eat fairly balanced and especially 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.009
 effective when you practice muscles 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.370
 so I'm going to use sweet potato 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.020
 pepper organic games and a little 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.270
 of olive oil and garlic 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.059
 we're going to leave we'll start already 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 sweet potato so the sweet potato has 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.399
 done and I'm going to cook it in the microwave 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.050
 or what I'm going to do already I'm going 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.890
 cut the sweet potato into pieces 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.110
 is that half 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.110
 because it's enough for me 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.449
 so in fact what are you doing you the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.449
 cut into small pieces 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.670
 I leave the skin it does not bother me 

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:10.020
 if you do not have the criminal court v good 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.130
 it does not bother me at all to eat the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:22.740
 especially skin than vick celio but there 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:24.299
 not too many pesticides of course a 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.409
 advantage is that it can be cooked 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.729
 microwave does not need to add 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.349
 of water so me what I do I put it 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:35.520
 I did not have it at the thermostat at the bottom 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:39.299
 yellow is a little uncomfortable the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.999
 power the penultimate power and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.159
 I have to say for between five or 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.659
 ten minutes after you have to see the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.459
 texture for proof puts it directly 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.419
 in the microwave because that's what 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.419
 takes the longest to cook 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 at 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.560
 after I put my stove to heat so 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:11.519
 that's the same hour for the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.519
 heat with olive oil 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.110
 I am part organic olive oil the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.290
 surface that's not understand this at 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.290
 point 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:36.430
 I compose kinds of circle like that 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.430
 that I put to heart directly 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.310
 so the rest I run in small 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.310
 parts 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.730
 the little piece I put them in the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.730
 small circles 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.269
 y'en in my opinion that already note 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.099
 know the recipe what it is not 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:44.200
 I asked him 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:47.680
 that's where it's known so there for that 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.220
 it's good so we'll put a little bit 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.220
 garlic semolina 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.650
 I now show you 100 lots already 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:19.239
 there we see that small deer with 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:22.110
 inside the fairs have so 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.110
 now what am I going to do 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.230
 the best 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.410
 just the organic eggs and I'm going to 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.000
 the White 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.000
 if black blocks of which 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.220
 we'll try 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.990
 hop there 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.780
 in small circles 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.110
 good it will come out from below it's 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.110
 normal 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:01.010
 German once before the groups 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:03.760
 ultra right but not yellow but 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.760
 you will understand why 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.430
 so that's the first part doc 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.370
 so this one so that put pretty much 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.320
 sco angers at 3-4 minutes to cook so 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.060
 this is the recipe actually determine what 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.860
 that I did I added after the 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.160
 raw egg yolks over it's over 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.070
 cooked 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.750
 so I added a little salad and that 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.870
 will make me my meal tonight at 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.550
 less the dish of the day what so that's it 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.260
 it's the quick little recipe 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.870
 so to see the time you look at the 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.490
 time down there on the video it's 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.490
 about the time it takes for the 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.050
 do I think I had finished 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.700
 heart peppers and apples 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.750
 land finally sweet potatoes it's 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.060
 not the potatoes the potatoes 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.940
 sweet I put them seven minutes a 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.260
 like that 7 8 minutes 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.560
 so it takes at least 10 minutes to 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.720
 prepare this dish so that is more 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.000
 excuse now to eat between 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.560
 Quotes healthy at home even 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.150
 when we do not have a lot of time 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.150
 go to later
