00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.880 

the<00:00:02.669> swallow<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> nice<00:00:03.629> traditional<00:00:04.560> paper

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
the swallow is a nice traditional paper

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.639 
the swallow is a nice traditional paper
plane<00:00:05.220> it<00:00:05.370> does<00:00:05.569> really<00:00:06.569> cute<00:00:06.899> loopings<00:00:07.440> and

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
plane it does really cute loopings and

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.860 
plane it does really cute loopings and
you<00:00:07.740> can<00:00:07.950> use<00:00:08.280> a4<00:00:08.940> or<00:00:09.269> letter<00:00:09.330> format<00:00:11.540> start<00:00:12.540> by

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you can use a4 or letter format start by

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.220 
you can use a4 or letter format start by
folding<00:00:13.429> the<00:00:14.429> sheet<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.849> half<00:00:14.880> along<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.049> long

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
folding the sheet in half along the long

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:28.429 
folding the sheet in half along the long
edge<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:26.630> open<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> whole<00:00:27.900> thing<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.260> again

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
edge and open the whole thing up again

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.479 
edge and open the whole thing up again
and<00:00:29.390> fold<00:00:31.309> the<00:00:32.309> small<00:00:32.520> edge<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.570> long<00:00:33.809> edge

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
and fold the small edge to the long edge

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.990 
and fold the small edge to the long edge
so<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.570> diagonal<00:00:40.760> open<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.850> up

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so you get a kind of diagonal open it up

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.650 
so you get a kind of diagonal open it up
and<00:00:43.640> do<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> same<00:00:44.850> thing<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> other<00:00:45.629> side

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.270 

what<00:00:51.660> will<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.590> similar<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
what will then do is similar to a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
what will then do is similar to a
waterbomb<00:00:53.820> base<00:00:54.170> if<00:00:55.170> you're<00:00:55.379> familiar<00:00:55.530> with

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
waterbomb base if you're familiar with

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.979 
waterbomb base if you're familiar with
it<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.340> next<00:00:56.610> step<00:00:56.789> will<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.000> easy<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.539> turn

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it the next step will be easy so turn

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.070 
it the next step will be easy so turn
around<00:00:58.140> first<00:00:58.590> and<00:01:00.079> fold<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.820> corners<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
around first and fold the corners to the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.039 
around first and fold the corners to the
corners<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> new<00:01:05.489> creases<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> crease

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
corners of the new creases so the crease

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.539 
corners of the new creases so the crease
goes<00:01:07.610> through<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.820> intersection<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:10.049> all

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
goes through the intersection of all

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
goes through the intersection of all
creases<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.990> open<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
creases like this then open it up and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.109 
creases like this then open it up and
turn<00:01:14.490> again<00:01:14.760> push<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> center<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
turn again push in the center and

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.539 
turn again push in the center and
collapse<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> bring<00:01:20.369> up

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
collapse it like this so bring up

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.590 
collapse it like this so bring up
together<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.420> edges<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:23.390> flatten<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> whole

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
together the edges and flatten the whole

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.230 
together the edges and flatten the whole
thing<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:27.860> this<00:01:28.860> form<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> take

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
thing then you have this form and take

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.710 
thing then you have this form and take
the<00:01:30.479> upper<00:01:30.890> flaps<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.250> fold<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> top

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the upper flaps and fold them to the top

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.970 
the upper flaps and fold them to the top
corner

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.420 

simple<00:01:39.980> plan<00:01:40.370> we<00:01:41.240> make<00:01:41.480> on<00:01:41.750> rabbit<00:01:42.320> ear<00:01:42.620> that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
simple plan we make on rabbit ear that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.030 
simple plan we make on rabbit ear that
goes<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.930> following<00:01:45.380> way<00:01:45.560> fold<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:48.680> angle

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
goes the following way fold the angle

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.750 
goes the following way fold the angle
bisector<00:01:49.640> in<00:01:49.880> both<00:01:50.120> ways<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.980> then<00:01:51.980> fold<00:01:52.490> both

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
bisector in both ways and then fold both

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.450 
bisector in both ways and then fold both
at<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.210> same<00:01:53.480> time<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:54.110> pinch<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:55.070> corner

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
at the same time and pinch the corner

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.000 
at the same time and pinch the corner
together<00:01:55.610> like<00:01:56.480> this<00:01:58.750> very<00:01:59.750> simple<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.350> then

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
together like this very simple and then

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.859 
together like this very simple and then
the<00:02:01.550> same<00:02:01.760> thing<00:02:01.790> on<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.210> other<00:02:02.240> side<00:02:05.800> and

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
the same thing on the other side and

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.370 
the same thing on the other side and
pinch<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.170> corner<00:02:09.560> together<00:02:10.930> that<00:02:11.930> might<00:02:12.140> be

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
pinch the corner together that might be

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.930 
pinch the corner together that might be
a<00:02:12.410> little<00:02:12.620> hard<00:02:12.950> because<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.490> have<00:02:13.610> several

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
a little hard because you have several

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.810 
a little hard because you have several
layers<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.390> top<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.720> each<00:02:15.080> other<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:16.550> it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
layers on top of each other but it

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:27.250 
layers on top of each other but it
should<00:02:17.150> be<00:02:17.480> manageable<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.880> man<00:02:26.230> make<00:02:27.230> a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
should be manageable and man make a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.160 
should be manageable and man make a
crease<00:02:27.680> here<00:02:27.709> along<00:02:28.700> where<00:02:29.270> now<00:02:29.570> your<00:02:29.780> ears

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
crease here along where now your ears

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.020 
crease here along where now your ears
are<00:02:31.209> like<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.959> ears<00:02:33.200> become<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:34.820> tip

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
are like this so the ears become the tip

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.320 
are like this so the ears become the tip
of<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:36.200> plane<00:02:37.630> nice<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.930> fear<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.560> then<00:02:40.330> fold

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
of the plane nice and fear and then fold

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.750 
of the plane nice and fear and then fold
the<00:02:41.480> model<00:02:41.630> in<00:02:41.810> half<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.620> way<00:02:42.770> we<00:02:42.980> used<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.640> do

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
the model in half the way we used to do

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.040 
the model in half the way we used to do
it<00:02:43.910> before

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.820 

fold<00:02:48.050> down<00:02:48.260> both<00:02:49.040> layers<00:02:50.170> along<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.380> corner

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
fold down both layers along the corner

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.280 
fold down both layers along the corner
of<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:53.000> swallow<00:02:53.360> head<00:02:53.660> here<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:56.140> on<00:02:57.140> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
of the swallow head here and on the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.660 
of the swallow head here and on the
other<00:02:57.410> side<00:02:57.560> too<00:03:01.989> then<00:03:02.989> we'll<00:03:03.260> make<00:03:03.670> small

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
other side too then we'll make small

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.710 
other side too then we'll make small
wings<00:03:04.940> down<00:03:05.540> here<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:07.940> is<00:03:08.060> threat<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.510> flight

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
wings down here for is threat of flight

path<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:10.220> both<00:03:10.489> sides<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:11.120> orientate

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
path on both sides just orientate

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.729 
path on both sides just orientate
yourself<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.010> first<00:03:13.250> one<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.610> did<00:03:14.739> and

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
yourself on the first one you did and

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.110 

and<00:03:28.430> pinch<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:29.090> together<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:31.120> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
and pinch it together like this and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.479 
and pinch it together like this and
there<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.540> go

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
there you go

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.820 
there you go
just<00:03:34.489> arrange<00:03:34.880> it<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.390> little<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:36.680> is

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
just arrange it a little and that is
