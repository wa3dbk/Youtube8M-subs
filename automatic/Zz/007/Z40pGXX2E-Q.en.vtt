00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
shooters alike it's very glitchy and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.700 
shooters alike it's very glitchy and
very<00:00:26.730> buggy<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:28.789> overall<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.410> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

so<00:00:32.989> for<00:00:33.989> people<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.559> thinking<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.750> this

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
so for people going thinking that this

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.040 
so for people going thinking that this
is<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.360> game<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.570> Trump<00:00:39.809> call

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
is going to be the game the Trump call

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.389 
is going to be the game the Trump call
duty<00:00:40.430> highly<00:00:41.430> unlikely<00:00:41.820> there's<00:00:42.809> no<00:00:43.620> way<00:00:43.920> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
duty highly unlikely there's no way this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.360 
duty highly unlikely there's no way this
game<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.030> comes<00:00:45.870> even<00:00:46.020> close<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.680> call<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.100> duty

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
game is comes even close to call of duty

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.920 
game is comes even close to call of duty
standards<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.329> terms<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.930> quality<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:52.850> polish

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
standards in terms of quality and polish

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.340 
standards in terms of quality and polish
so<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:57.030> doesn't<00:00:57.360> even<00:00:57.390> come<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> battlefield

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
so it doesn't even come to battlefield

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.400 
so it doesn't even come to battlefield
tues<00:00:59.149> quality<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.239> polish<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> game<00:01:01.379> was

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
tues quality of polish and that game was

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.469 
tues quality of polish and that game was
until<00:01:01.890> today<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:04.760> okay<00:01:05.760> let's<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> little

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
like that like Call of Duty does it was

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.270 
like that like Call of Duty does it was
more<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.009> realistic<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.079> I<00:01:31.079> heard<00:01:31.710> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the Taliban and changed it to the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.130 
the Taliban and changed it to the
opposing<00:01:40.500> force<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> game<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.960> don't<00:01:42.960> know

missions<00:02:40.120> there<00:02:41.120> were<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.270> lot<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.480> fun<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
missions there were a lot of fun but a

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.620 
missions there were a lot of fun but a
few<00:02:42.890> problems<00:02:43.160> during<00:02:43.760> those<00:02:43.940> missions<00:02:44.420> where

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
few problems during those missions where

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.610 
few problems during those missions where
they<00:02:44.780> wouldn't<00:02:45.020> give<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.380> clear

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
they wouldn't give you clear

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.560 
they wouldn't give you clear
instructions<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.370> what<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.820> half<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.360> time

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
instructions on what to do half the time

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.750 
instructions on what to do half the time
and<00:02:47.959> you'd<00:02:48.560> have<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.980> keep<00:02:49.190> starting<00:02:49.580> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
and you'd have to keep starting the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.930 
and you'd have to keep starting the
mission<00:02:50.060> over<00:02:50.450> because<00:02:51.010> they<00:02:52.010> keep<00:02:52.250> failing

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
mission over because they keep failing

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.550

place to place at one point where I got

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.150 
place to place at one point where I got
onto<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.390> ATV<00:03:11.930> instead<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.620> taking<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.070> to

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
onto the ATV instead of taking it to

onto the ATV instead of taking it to
drive<00:03:13.370> somewhere<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:13.910> would<00:03:14.420> press<00:03:14.720> X<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.380> get

drive somewhere I would press X to get

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.680 
drive somewhere I would press X to get
on<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.070> my<00:03:16.700> gun<00:03:16.910> would<00:03:17.090> still<00:03:17.299> be<00:03:17.420> drawn

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
on it and my gun would still be drawn

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.840 
on it and my gun would still be drawn
and<00:03:17.959> I'd<00:03:18.560> be<00:03:18.709> stuck<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.220> wouldn't<00:03:19.519> be<00:03:19.610> able<00:03:19.700> to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
and I'd be stuck I wouldn't be able to

from checkpoint or anything to get it to

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.850 
from checkpoint or anything to get it to
fix<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.239> would<00:03:29.360> just<00:03:29.510> keep<00:03:29.720> doing<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:30.709> I'd

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
fix it would just keep doing that so I'd

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.500
