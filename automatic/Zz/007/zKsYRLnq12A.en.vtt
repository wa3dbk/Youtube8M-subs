00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.920
Nobody can pinpoint coffee’s appearance.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.200
Figuring out when the smell of this brew

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.520
began drifting through dusty roads and villages

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.160
is a huge undertaking.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.120
We do know that Coffea Arabica plants

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.680
are indigenous to Africa,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.720
more specifically to Ethiopia.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.600
Ethiopia’s peoples have known coffee

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.640
for over five centuries.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.720
They have tried it in all its forms

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.960
and this has led to the beverage

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.880
we know and enjoy today.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.920
Coffee’s first appearance

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.440
is surrounded by lore and legend.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.800
Most sources mention the legend

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.920
of Kaldi the shepherd,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.520
set in Ethiopia in 400 BC.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.080
The boy noticed that his goats

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.680
were all excited after eating some wild berries.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.840
He tried some too and immediately

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.280
he felt his strength surge.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.520
Drawn by young Kaldi’s liveliness,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.360
a passing monk tried the red berries too.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.000
He, too, suddenly felt empowered

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.440
over all his senses

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.400
and was so perceptive he couldn’t sleep.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.560
He was so focussed that he was able

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.360
to pray until sunset.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.000
So the monk passed the secret of coffee

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.560
on to his brothers

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.600
and soon to all the monks in Ethiopia.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.120
Legend or not, with time coffee became

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.680
the official drink in Islamic countries.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.040
For centuries, coffee was used

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.560
as food and not as a drink.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440
Coffee beans were eaten

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.320
either whole or ground

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.280
and mixed with ghee (clarified butter).

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.000
This unique ritual was accompanied

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
by prayer and meditation

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.120
and still takes place in the far-off areas

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.960
of Kaffa and Sidamo.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.640
In the late 19th century,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.200
thanks to the trade routes established

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.640
between the West and the Arab civilisations,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.760
the use of toasted coffee beans became popular

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.320
among non-Islamic communities as well,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.840
especially after the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.280
which believed brew o be dangerous and immoral,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.000
lifted its ban.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.480
In the villages of Ethiopia the women see

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.720
to the various stages of coffee-making.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.920
They skilfully dry the berries,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.440
crush the skin in a mortar

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.520
and sieve the coffee.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.960
The toasted and crushed beans

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.440
are then used to make the precious brew

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.640
for the entire community.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.560
When we think of Ethiopia

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.560
we often imagine a poor land

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.320
made mostly of desert,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.360
plagued by hunger and war.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.320
We often forget that this country

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.040
has a long and rich history and culture,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.720
among East Africa’s most fascinating.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.520
It is a stunning mosaic

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.360
of races and ethnicities

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.440
brought together

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.520
by their great passion for coffee.
