 sandwiched between the seats and the front panel

 twenty five another 10 centimeters he 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.340
 went up so much to the left and when

 opened the driver's door with a crowbar 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.099
 saw that the driverâ€™s legroom is almost

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.019
 it turned out in the cabin meanwhile one of

 in English it sounds like a fig

 criteria or abbreviated figs made 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.500
 600 40 units although dangerous critical 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.129
 the value is 1000 units, it means everything is not 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.049
 so bad 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.180
 Alas, the fact is that these are relatively not 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.129
 big overloads acted on the head 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.500
 which was barely holding onto the body 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.629
 the neck is broken because the steering wheel continues 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.400
 move inside the cabin holding my head 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.620

 forward let's call a spade a spade with 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.639
 great likelihood 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.650
 the accident will lead to the death of the driver zone

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.680
 why such a terrible result in
