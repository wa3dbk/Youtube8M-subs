00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
I see he's trying to shake boots again

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.690 
I see he's trying to shake boots again
on<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.569> Drive<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.200> go<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.680> my<00:03:13.859> formation<00:03:14.250> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
on this Drive I go to my formation and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.339 
on this Drive I go to my formation and
he<00:03:14.910> stops<00:03:15.209> shake<00:03:15.510> boots<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.959> he<00:03:16.079> knows<00:03:16.319> that

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
he stops shake boots and he knows that

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.750 
he stops shake boots and he knows that
I'm<00:03:16.739> gonna<00:03:16.829> throw<00:03:17.069> right<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.459> flats

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
I'm gonna throw right to the flats

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.240 
I'm gonna throw right to the flats
however<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.840> still<00:03:19.319> do<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.739> probably<00:03:19.950> could

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
however I still do it I probably could

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.819 
however I still do it I probably could
have<00:03:20.280> ran<00:03:20.609> a<00:03:20.639> draw<00:03:21.000> or<00:03:21.419> changes<00:03:22.169> it<00:03:22.290> up<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.650> him

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
have ran a draw or changes it up on him

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.830 
have ran a draw or changes it up on him
but<00:03:23.190> basically<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.639> got<00:03:23.790> him<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.239> his<00:03:24.389> heels<00:03:24.630> he

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
but basically I got him on his heels he

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.199 
but basically I got him on his heels he
doesn't<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.560> his<00:03:25.829> normal<00:03:26.220> strategy<00:03:26.639> which

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
doesn't have his normal strategy which

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.629 
doesn't have his normal strategy which
is<00:03:27.359> probably<00:03:27.720> solely<00:03:28.049> shake<00:03:28.440> Woodsen<00:03:28.919> which

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
is probably solely shake Woodsen which
