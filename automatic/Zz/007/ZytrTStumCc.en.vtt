 antonio ganas is from the corporation by 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.350
 the chili kitchens wait for a 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.449

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.980
 Antonio, we remember this change a little bit 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.320
 in these typical breakfasts is not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.210
 We really want the potato broth 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.100
 Rolling demo we see everything 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.739

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.800
 look at the good thing is that every day is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.899
 retaking more the theme of the kitchen is 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.399
 full that a pity that there is 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.320
 rescue her in Trenton because something that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.079
 it must be installed in all of our 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.969
 houses 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.710
 good part of the subject the Chilean kitchen 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.600
 the breakfast the people who start casting 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.630
 with nothing at 4 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.060
 already is now practically 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.119
 show but that is a typical breakfast 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.280
 chilean breakfast that las 11 a 1 with 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.430
 campoo breakfast we also have a 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.500
 urban wave also breakfast we 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.080
 it would be the blunt breakfast 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.800
 Enjundious that leaves you standing for the 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.290
 rest of the day 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.290
 calientito much much pot broth 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.189
 well fine with your general mind well 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.229
 energy because we have reached the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.729
 another reality I'll put José Antonio here 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.409
 in the reality of the complete who is 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.600
 Who did not send a full breakfast 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.700
 good morning that my friend posts 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.740
 save him just like that with his dirty hand 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.570
 matter with your hand full of work in 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460
 quality that is preparing and scratched 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.630
 all I remove that is the one that more breakfast to 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.200
 the people here eat I threw blood from 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.270
 baby food 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.719
 and the loin steak is what later 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.490
 there is a champion is the cook we 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.039
 we are going to throw it on the cloth and antonia is 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.250
 a breakfast of champions did not mix 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.229
 a churrasco and is that can not wait 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.530
 less strong for the morning but it is rich 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.810
 it leaves you up from one to me 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.430
 love it can be medium strong but the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.870
 meat is pure protein that gives you the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.500
 energy to keep running during 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.959
 the morning that supposedly exactly 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.330
 other than good and your vegetables 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.190
 heading to tomato things that have to 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.959
 be on the menu every day and that 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.739
 better than with a table with a 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.810
 churrasquito different jose antonio 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.030
 good the marraqueta in the queen me 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.540
 I imagine you have talked from that of 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.690
 churrasco of the wick in the marraqueta 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.510
 he takes her not like that because of the marraqueta 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.610
 and I'm going to tell you that 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.120
 does not bring butter, therefore, within 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.010
 the truth of the other breads 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.690
 in which less weighs and is here in 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.160
 truth is actually true the 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.930
 nutritionists recommend then on the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.000
 rain for example that brings us 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.629
 that rich day that you see how much they are worth 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.680
 who will vega 2000 for you and everything I am 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.959
 very cheap here everything cheap and fresh 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.310
 energies to charge and little everything 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.310
 which is a non-commercial fair 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:25.659
 antonia please there is a wave of the 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.159
 chefs or the cooks someone told me 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.629
 once the word was very mischievous 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.329
 they like they want them to cook 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.700
 to recover our kitchen you as 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.819
 young chefs expect that trend that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.349
 line also looks at today's 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.150
 leaders mainly those who are 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.980
 focusing on enhancing the kitchen theme 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.030
 is Chilean and these leaders are the ones 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.060
 they also drag all the young people 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.950
 like me that I was driven say 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.900
 different faces that for me mark in 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.400
 trend and that I looked up and 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.459
 that motivated me to also encourage the 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.919
 Chilean cuisine and we are now 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.510
 reimbursing revalorizing taking out 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.579
 Float all our traditions more 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.870
 beyond the kitchen the dancing came 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.790
 all the things that are a little lost 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.330
 and that they resume with luck once to the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.590
 month of September 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.390
 very much and I thank you also that the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.130
 Chilean haute cuisine has come down from the square 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.380
 Italy stop because there is the richest 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.600
 that is the most tasty missing tomato 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.880
 for a breakfast of champions between 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.410
 we have no entity, I'm not even going to 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.470
 say that it is like one because 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.850
 surely already happened there for a churrasco 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.530
 but you know me very well because I'm going to 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.660
