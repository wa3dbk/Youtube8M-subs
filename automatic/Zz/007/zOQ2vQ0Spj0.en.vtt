00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.860
 yes article with you, Sergei, we continue 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.330
 his video sketches 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.880
 to which construction but here 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.849
 data video dedicated 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.599
 modernization stove stoves 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.100
 so what we are seeing now 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.590
 you are watching the box 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.550
 from respectful air 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.470
 280 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.019
 milligram now given resident gives 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.460
 volume on 28 cubes 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.140
 so let's say it generates 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 share in the air so let's say in south park 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.640
 now we 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.620
 in conditions we observe this miracle of technique 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 what goals will we have it intended 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.910
 we will have it 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.510
 stand in a crane 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.690
 left corner 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.090
 and fed percent 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.790
 generated cold steam 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.780
 for there twenty thirty minutes too 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.180
 it will begin to heat very well 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.780
 and almost rosppechat appear 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.910
 hot steam 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.060
 that is, it is very good 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.180
 respect what we tell breaks 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.970
 With my help, this is a divorce 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.370
 and we have very small fractions 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.890
 dusty now here we have two blanks 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.330
 which one of them will go up 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 and the other 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.490
 in the lower part 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490
 with two holes we will have a blank 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.990
 in the lower part 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.350
 lav which will be fleet placed 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.070
 but let's say its tube will be fed into it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.940
 water 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.200
 i.e 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.630
 on 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.880
 Well, here I am 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 20 centimeters 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.320
 put the court here this brush 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.870
 the situation is ti meters long that is 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.590
 twisted 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.380
 that is, from this person we will be 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.530
 so let's say 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.960
 what kind of activator is he 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.280
 the same here 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.220
 just over 100 thousand meters in my 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.330
 15 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.040
 and here stealing 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.970
 and the lower part we will have in the house 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.270
 holes 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.679
 on the sides, that is, their number is about 30 ti 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:07.530
 pieces 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.399
 and here we will approximately 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.499
 that is, options burning 80 centimeters 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.659
 length diameter of 45 millimeters 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.979
 internal slop 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.639
 quarrel full with penny points 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.709
 less 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.249
 and here in this pipe we have holes 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.519
 Lord, I can not see anything companies 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.519
 percent here we have holes 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.129
 she crashes holes but fives tires then 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.949
 have improve osh back broke 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.629
 what are our center holes then if their 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.989
 by quantity leads 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.579
 40 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.749
 term with something that 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.099
 exactly the same 80 body length 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.209
 looked to have us over 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.299
 m which gives 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.159
 important topics for everyone 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.539
 divided into four sectors 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.019
 and about a year of shooting 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.719
 this is what saved the trio 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.749
 at about 1 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:05.359
 of four sectors the course of which 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.459
 the number of such familiar 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.599
 of hope 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.279
 at the husband at 4 and received quantity 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.840
 roughly which will not require 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.400
 so that I was not here 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.939
 the more resistance 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.939
 now we will turn on 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.379
 but inhabitants of the air 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.379
 and his under the seat 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:30.110
 in the tube 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.110
 with the central signal of beeps, that is 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.669
 because I was an assistant place 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.789
 vendor activity and honesty 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:41.340
 failure 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.439
 in particular us 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.459
 it's located 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.459
 for that no 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.459
 wet 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.229
 its functions 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.129
 all things couples 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.119
 cold 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:00.819
 and here it is 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.819
 we will feed the flame 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.910
 and will burn 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.449
 that is, we will provide full 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.019
 so let's say 90 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.840
 percentage of feet practicality furnaces 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.349
 asked the times when we set the hatches 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.359
 to the nation 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.270
 the maximum was 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.889
 tightly 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.159
 oven m 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.639
 which will be burning 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.639
 now i 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.090
 in another resign 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.120
 and see 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.360
 as far as here 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.349
 in favor 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.069
 air supply here due to the fact that 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:42.569
 fewer holes 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.020
 feed rate 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.159
 a little more 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.830
 junior jet 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.800
 the leader as if to look at my example 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.229
 what 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.539
 right he is much more active 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.499
 evaluation is in progress 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:00.069
 that is, we will have it in 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.870
 lower part 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.870
 probably will generate already 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.629
 boiling water 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.120
 by means of 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.449
 so let's say my technical solution 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.449
 yes on the technical solution nowhere 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:12.719
 watched 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.270
 let's say senz 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.770
 rhino 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.770
 now than later 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:21.659
 now we are with you 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.919
 still do extra here 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.680
 stoves that could 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.120
 put 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.999
 over here 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.029
 up the pipe 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.009
 make a barrier 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.569
 put metal plate 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:38.539
 so we have 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.289
 hot air 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.949
 completely did not fly into the tube we somewhere 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.479
 here and put 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.199
 30 meters 10 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.529
 to the bottom it will not reach 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.519
 and we will be signed by the camera 

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:51.409
 combustion 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.800
 in which will increase after our meeting 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.169
 in my opinion 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.169
 now proceeded to the manufacture of doors 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.710
 and for this purpose will be done 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.460
 here is the partition 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.099
 and we can run cars 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.099
 innovativeness 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.180
 its among
