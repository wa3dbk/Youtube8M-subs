I<00:06:06.900> would<00:06:07.620> not<00:06:07.800> however<00:06:08.100> suggest<00:06:08.940> it<00:06:09.060> if<00:06:09.210> you

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
I would not however suggest it if you

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.820 
I would not however suggest it if you
are<00:06:09.390> running<00:06:09.720> air<00:06:09.900> is<00:06:09.990> this<00:06:10.169> shield<00:06:10.560> and

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
are running air is this shield and

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.650 
are running air is this shield and
that's<00:06:11.280> simply<00:06:11.490> because<00:06:11.880> your<00:06:12.030> resist<00:06:12.330> shield

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
that's simply because your resist shield

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.420 
that's simply because your resist shield
is<00:06:12.870> available<00:06:13.020> more<00:06:13.620> often<00:06:14.010> than<00:06:14.220> other

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
is available more often than other

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.430 
is available more often than other
shield<00:06:14.760> types<00:06:15.000> so<00:06:15.600> your<00:06:15.780> flak<00:06:15.960> armor<00:06:16.290> will

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
shield types so your flak armor will

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.840 
shield types so your flak armor will
basically<00:06:16.650> be<00:06:17.070> sitting<00:06:17.370> there<00:06:17.520> doing<00:06:17.700> nothing

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
basically be sitting there doing nothing

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.800 
basically be sitting there doing nothing
useful<00:06:18.360> for<00:06:19.140> the<00:06:19.200> majority<00:06:19.620> of<00:06:19.770> the<00:06:19.890> time<00:06:20.810> the

only two classes that I really wouldn't

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.520 
only two classes that I really wouldn't

like I said at the start of all this the

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.249 
like I said at the start of all this the
episode<00:06:45.180> was<00:06:45.330> going<00:06:45.509> to<00:06:45.599> be<00:06:45.690> pretty<00:06:45.870> short

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
episode was going to be pretty short

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.110 
episode was going to be pretty short
because<00:06:46.440> there's<00:06:46.830> honestly<00:06:47.250> not<00:06:47.460> a<00:06:47.520> whole<00:06:47.879> lot
