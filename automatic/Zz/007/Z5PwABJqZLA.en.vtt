00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and really get a maximum contraction as

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.270 
and really get a maximum contraction as
you're<00:01:16.200> trying<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.530> pull<00:01:16.740> those<00:01:16.920> elbows<00:01:17.039> back

and you're doing the pull-ups so when

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.149 
and you're doing the pull-ups so when
you're<00:01:20.789> doing<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> press<00:01:21.330> push<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.320> try<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you're doing the press push up try and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.440 
you're doing the press push up try and
force<00:01:23.340> those<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.700> look<00:01:23.850> back<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.179> you<00:01:24.270> come

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
force those and up look back as you come

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
force those and up look back as you come
to<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:24.630> top<00:01:24.810> then<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> weight<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to the top then put the weight on the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.279 
to the top then put the weight on the
back<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.330> you're<00:01:27.539> doing<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.780> pull-up<00:01:28.050> that

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
back and you're doing the pull-up that

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.479 
back and you're doing the pull-up that
you're<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.649> squeezing<00:01:28.950> those<00:01:29.280> rear<00:01:29.459> delts

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:29.489 
you're really squeezing those rear delts

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:33.199 
you're really squeezing those rear delts
again<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.179> like<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> dual<00:01:32.060> double<00:01:33.060> hit

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
again so this is like a dual double hit

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.330 
again so this is like a dual double hit
basically<00:01:33.660> on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.899> rear<00:01:34.080> delts<00:01:34.349> it's<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
basically on the rear delts it's a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
basically on the rear delts it's a
really<00:01:35.580> cool<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.910> really<00:01:36.119> works<00:01:36.330> well<00:01:36.569> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
really cool it really works well and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
really cool it really works well and
you'll<00:01:37.289> see<00:01:37.470> exactly<00:01:37.679> how<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.099> it<00:01:38.250> right

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
you'll see exactly how to do it right

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.899 
you'll see exactly how to do it right
now

from<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.489> bottom<00:03:45.230> like<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.410> push<00:03:46.920> up

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
from the bottom like this push up

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.370 
from the bottom like this push up
Mercurio<00:03:48.480> hulls<00:03:48.750> are<00:03:48.870> getting<00:03:49.049> forced

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
Mercurio hulls are getting forced

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
Mercurio hulls are getting forced
backwards<00:03:49.799> because<00:03:49.950> that's<00:03:50.069> what's<00:03:50.220> going<00:03:50.340> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
backwards because that's what's going to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.160 
backwards because that's what's going to
activate<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.849> rear<00:03:50.970> delts<00:03:51.299> once<00:03:52.049> you're

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
activate the rear delts once you're

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.140 
activate the rear delts once you're
locked<00:03:52.349> out<00:03:52.530> shift<00:03:53.340> your<00:03:53.489> whole<00:03:53.610> body<00:03:53.790> forward

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
is no Barnet's the rails and then do the

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.240 
is no Barnet's the rails and then do the
pull-up<00:03:57.290> using<00:03:58.290> your<00:03:58.410> toes<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.860> help<00:03:58.980> spot

pull-up using your toes to help spot

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.160 
pull-up using your toes to help spot
yourself<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.180> really<00:04:00.420> focus<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.049> pulling

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
yourself and really focus on pulling

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.140 
yourself and really focus on pulling
those<00:04:01.500> elbows<00:04:01.739> back<00:04:01.890> as<00:04:02.640> you're<00:04:02.910> pulling

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
those elbows back as you're pulling

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.190 
those elbows back as you're pulling
yourself<00:04:03.209> up<00:04:03.540> because<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:03.840> what's<00:04:04.049> going

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
yourself up because that's what's going

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.690 
yourself up because that's what's going
to<00:04:04.230> really<00:04:04.349> activate<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.069> rear<00:04:05.220> delts<00:04:05.459> again

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
to really activate the rear delts again

00:04:05.700 --> 00:06:02.470 
to really activate the rear delts again
set<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.780> bar<00:04:06.930> down<00:04:07.110> shift<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.190> away

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:18.170 

yeah

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.830 

so<00:06:19.180> that's<00:06:19.330> the<00:06:20.010> two-phase<00:06:21.010> movement<00:06:21.840> hitting

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
so that's the two-phase movement hitting

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.240 
so that's the two-phase movement hitting
both<00:06:22.990> the<00:06:23.140> rear<00:06:23.290> delts<00:06:23.590> and<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.890> rear<00:06:24.040> delts

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
both the rear delts and the rear delts

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.030 
both the rear delts and the rear delts
in<00:06:24.340> both<00:06:24.490> phases<00:06:25.450> of<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.690> movement<00:06:26.050> it's<00:06:26.950> a

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
in both phases of the movement it's a

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.460 
in both phases of the movement it's a
really<00:06:27.400> really<00:06:27.490> powerful<00:06:27.760> combination<00:06:28.210> I<00:06:28.840> can

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
really really powerful combination I can

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.860 
really really powerful combination I can
feel<00:06:29.590> my<00:06:29.740> rear<00:06:29.920> delts<00:06:30.160> lighten<00:06:30.370> up<00:06:30.460> like<00:06:30.700> it

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
feel my rear delts lighten up like it

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.020 
feel my rear delts lighten up like it
really<00:06:31.870> not<00:06:32.110> ever<00:06:32.230> felt<00:06:32.500> before<00:06:33.030> because

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
really not ever felt before because

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.660 
really not ever felt before because

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.010 
say is that one of the muscle is the
common<00:07:09.010> denominator<00:07:09.040> between<00:07:09.610> two<00:07:10.030> big

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
common denominator between two big

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.110 
common denominator between two big
muscle<00:07:11.350> movements<00:07:11.770> and<00:07:12.520> it's<00:07:12.760> really<00:07:13.030> going

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
muscle movements and it's really going

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.940 
muscle movements and it's really going
to<00:07:13.180> get<00:07:13.330> pushed<00:07:13.540> hard<00:07:13.780> when<00:07:14.680> you're<00:07:14.800> doing

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
to get pushed hard when you're doing

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.250 
to get pushed hard when you're doing
these<00:07:15.070> in<00:07:15.220> combination<00:07:15.370> like<00:07:15.820> this<00:07:15.940> so<00:07:16.360> this

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260 
these in combination like this so this

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.100 
these in combination like this so this
is<00:07:17.320> any<00:07:18.220> rear<00:07:18.400> delt<00:07:18.640> weakness<00:07:18.940> or<00:07:19.840> if<00:07:19.960> you<00:07:20.020> just

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110 
is any rear delt weakness or if you just

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.060 
is any rear delt weakness or if you just
want<00:07:20.290> to<00:07:20.350> build<00:07:20.500> your<00:07:20.560> shoulder<00:07:20.830> strength

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
want to build your shoulder strength

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.690 
want to build your shoulder strength
this<00:07:22.000> is<00:07:22.060> a<00:07:22.180> killer<00:07:22.390> combination
