00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
their own experience that really hasn't

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.190 
their own experience that really hasn't
ever<00:01:29.430> been<00:01:29.520> replicated<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.750> mix<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
ever been replicated so it's that mix of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.100 
ever been replicated so it's that mix of
adventure<00:01:32.130> exploration<00:01:32.630> puzzle<00:01:33.630> solving

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
adventure exploration puzzle solving

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230 
adventure exploration puzzle solving
that's<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> core<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.430> zelda

usually there's some kind of theme in
games<00:01:41.009> for<00:01:41.509> link<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> past<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.229> could

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
games for link to the past you could

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
games for link to the past you could
switch<00:01:43.710> between<00:01:43.890> times<00:01:44.369> minish<00:01:44.850> cap<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
switch between times minish cap you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.740 
switch between times minish cap you
could<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.899> big<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.170> small<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.570> anything
