00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.450 
essentially
the<00:02:13.830> game<00:02:14.010> has<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.550> beautiful<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:16.280> think<00:02:17.280> it's

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
the game has this beautiful I think it's

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.280 
the game has this beautiful I think it's
actually<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.790> was<00:02:17.910> sort<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.240> hand-drawn<00:02:18.960> map

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
actually it was sort of hand-drawn map

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.390 
actually it was sort of hand-drawn map
of<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.620> United<00:02:19.890> States

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
of the United States

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.830 
of the United States
one<00:02:20.850> thing<00:02:21.000> that's<00:02:21.090> you're<00:02:21.300> gonna<00:02:21.420> see<00:02:21.720> is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
one thing that's you're gonna see is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780 
one thing that's you're gonna see is
you're<00:02:21.960> gonna<00:02:22.050> see<00:02:22.680> all<00:02:22.770> these<00:02:22.830> rivers

you're gonna see all these rivers

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.820 
you're gonna see all these rivers
there's<00:02:24.300> a<00:02:24.420> lot<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.660> significance<00:02:25.320> back<00:02:25.680> in

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
there's a lot of significance back in

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.590 
there's a lot of significance back in
the<00:02:25.920> American<00:02:26.220> Civil<00:02:26.370> or<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:27.180> far<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.480> military

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
strategy goes we don't only think about

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.580 
strategy goes we don't only think about
it<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.880> much<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.440> across<00:02:31.440> them

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
it so much because you just across them

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.040 
it so much because you just across them
in<00:02:31.650> bridges<00:02:32.040> today<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:35.030> basically<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.240> you're

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
in bridges today and basically if you're

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.500 
in bridges today and basically if you're
eastern<00:02:37.320> seaboards<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.400> main<00:02:38.640> map<00:02:38.850> ends<00:02:39.120> on
