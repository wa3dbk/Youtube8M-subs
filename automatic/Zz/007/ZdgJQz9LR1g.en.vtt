closure i think it's 14 inches i'm not

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.119 
closure i think it's 14 inches i'm not
sure<00:01:02.820> i<00:01:03.329> think<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> closures<00:01:04.170> 14<00:01:04.559> inches<00:01:04.949> I

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
sure i think the closures 14 inches I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.649 
sure i think the closures 14 inches I
would<00:01:05.400> let<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> description<00:01:06.450> bar

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
would let you know the description bar

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
would let you know the description bar
so<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.439> said<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.100> closure<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.700> body

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
so they said that the closure was body

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.670 
so they said that the closure was body
wave<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.869> honest<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
wave but to be honest with you the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.490 
wave but to be honest with you the
closure<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.220> definitely<00:01:11.760> not<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.420> body<00:01:13.229> weight

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
closure is definitely not a body weight

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.160 
closure is definitely not a body weight
that's<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:15.030> loose<00:01:15.810> loose

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that's more of like a really loose loose

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.550 
that's more of like a really loose loose
curl<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.860> maybe<00:01:17.070> wavy<00:01:17.450> it's<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
curl or maybe wavy it's really not it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
curl or maybe wavy it's really not it
doesn't<00:01:20.189> match<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> bundles<00:01:21.030> that's<00:01:21.270> one

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
doesn't match the bundles that's one

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570 
doesn't match the bundles that's one
down<00:01:22.020> side<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> hair<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.130> doesn't<00:01:23.310> match

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
down side of the hair it doesn't match

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
down side of the hair it doesn't match
the<00:01:23.729> bundles<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.110> able<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.590> up

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the bundles but I was able to put up

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.899 
the bundles but I was able to put up
with<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> wear<00:01:26.640> my<00:01:26.759> hair

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
with it because I like to wear my hair

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.090 
with it because I like to wear my hair
straight<00:01:26.939> anyway<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.829> wear<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
straight anyway and if I was to wear it

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
straight anyway and if I was to wear it
curly<00:01:29.310> I'll<00:01:29.610> probably<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.540> know<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
curly I'll probably you know use a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
curly I'll probably you know use a
curling<00:01:32.009> wand<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.490> something<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.479> wasn't

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
curling wand or something so it wasn't

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.560 
curling wand or something so it wasn't
really<00:01:33.990> much<00:01:34.290> big<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.950> deal<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.430> me<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:36.329> if

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
really much big of a deal for me but if

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.590 
really much big of a deal for me but if
you<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:37.079> want<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.860> two<00:01:38.159> textures<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.850> match<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you do want the two textures to match I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
you do want the two textures to match I
guess<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.229> straight<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> kinky

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
guess get straight or get the kinky

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.569 
guess get straight or get the kinky
because<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.810> body<00:01:43.020> wave<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.220> wasn't

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
because the body wave was not it wasn't

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.950 
because the body wave was not it wasn't
it<00:01:44.700> wasn't<00:01:44.880> doing<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.210> from<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.630> mousse

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it wasn't doing it from the other mousse

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.289 
it wasn't doing it from the other mousse
way<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.439> loose<00:01:46.590> wave<00:01:46.860> actually<00:01:47.399> matches<00:01:47.850> when

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
way the loose wave actually matches when

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.179 
way the loose wave actually matches when
I<00:01:48.329> got<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> hair<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> brown<00:01:49.860> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
I got the hair it was like a brown it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
I got the hair it was like a brown it
was<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.729> was<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> natural<00:01:51.180> black<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:51.930> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
was like it was a natural black but it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.200 
was like it was a natural black but it
was<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.320> towards<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.250> brown<00:01:53.579> color<00:01:53.850> because

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
was more towards a brown color because

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.200 
was more towards a brown color because
my<00:01:54.420> hair<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:55.320> black<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:56.969> hair

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
