Hey everyone, I'm Justin with americanmuscle.com.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.820
This is my breakdown of the Power Stop cross
drilled and slotted rotor and pad kit available

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.289
for all 1994 to 2014 Mustangs.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.250
Power Stop is a company that specializes in
producing quality braking components for a

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.599
wide variety of applications, all with the
goal of increasing your stopping power for

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.659
a very affordable price.

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.419
We have had some recent experience with Power
Stop's kit on our 2014 GT project car named

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.010
Project Coyote, and if you guys want, you
can click on that link below.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.010
You can check out all of our project car builds
and also subscribe to our YouTube channel

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.190
while you're there to check out more in depth
detailed product overviews.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.280
This particular Power Stop kit, as I mentioned
earlier, is available for just about every

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.300
generation Mustang there is, including the
newer Brembo cars, and really is a great bang

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.960
for your buck mod.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.480
With this kit, you do get both the front and
rear cross drilled and slotted rotors in addition

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.920
to the brand new ceramic pads for the same
price other companies are charging just for

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.379
the front two rotors alone.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.590
Now that you know what's included with the
kit, let's break down the individual components

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.590
a little further.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.810
As I mentioned earlier, you do get the front
and rear rotors, both of which have been cross

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.280
drilled and slotted.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.460
If you're not aware of the benefits of running
a cross drilled and slotted rotor, here's

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.460
the deal.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.040
They will actually prevent a little excess
heat from building up, and it also reduces

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.250
some brake fade after a few repetitive hard
stops.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.880
The rotors have also been silver zinc coated
to help prevent any possible rust or corrosion

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.320
from building up and to ensure that the rotors
themselves remain looking good for years to

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.320
come.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.770
Speaking of looking good, it's hard to deny
the fact that a set of cross drilled and slotted

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.470
rotors just look amazing on any car and add
a much more aggressive look to the car itself.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.361
In fact, don't take my word for it.

00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:49.640
You can always click on the link below to
check out the customer submitted images and

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.100
reviews of these rotors on our very own customer
pages.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.400
That way, you get a good look at what these
rotors might look like on your very own Mustang.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.370
Again, click on the link below to check out
the products page, if you're not there already.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.460
Moving on to the pads, the Power Stop kit
does include the Evolution carbon ceramic

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.880
brake pad which will help you in a couple
of different ways.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.319
For starters, that carbon ceramic compound
will allow for higher brake temperatures but

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.840
with less brake fade, increasing your overall
stopping power.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.590
In addition, these pads will be a little bit
more quiet, and they will also produce less

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.840
brake dust, helping to keep your wheels a
lot cleaner.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.810
Installing a new set of brakes and rotors
on any Mustang is actually a pretty straightforward

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.280
job that just about any owner should feel
confident in tackling using some basic hand

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.050
tools and a lift or jack.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.170
You have to keep in mind, guys, you are tackling
all four corners here, so expect to spend

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.370
about three hours at least, or a nice Saturday
or Sunday afternoon, in the garage to get

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.500
everything knocked out.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.500
You definitely want to follow the manufacturer's
recommended vetting process with the new set

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.060
of pads and rotors to get the optimal performance
and wear out of your setup.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.490
If you need more info about this, you can
always check out the product page, or do not

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.710
hesitate to get in touch with one of our award
winning customer service agents by phone or

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.710
by email.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.000
If you're looking to upgrade the brakes on
your '94 and newer Mustang for a very affordable

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.109
price, well then you have to check out the
