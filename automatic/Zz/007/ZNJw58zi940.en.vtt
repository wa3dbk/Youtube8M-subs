00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 new video of how to install the for the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.300
 counter strike 1.6 good worth first thing 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.699
 of everything that we are going to have that is something that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.349
 to do is go to the link that I'm going to leave the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.930
 video description 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.570
 on the 7 we download it by half farc 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.140
 let's see the download and download it to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.940
 our mental that I paint mannarino and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.789
 this will take a little bit late 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 personado to make a day 15 of saved 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.429
 It also depends on the means you have 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.429
 our 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.969
 downloaded 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.320
 there is reloaded we paid for 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.070
 desk hits me this we can already 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.340
 close if you want and will not climb a 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.119
 rar file and we'll bring it 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.119
 extract well 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.679
 and there will not be this folder that puts something 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.800
 for 61 points 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:27.130
 we opened an hour earlier this 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.840
 we give here to this file that the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.750
 application that has a sheet of 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.210
 marijuana and we execute it 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.360
 this is a little window 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.720
 that the scepter activated thanks to this 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.850
 image although we follow the numbers of 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.390
 this image and we are putting them 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.800
 others here on the marijuana leaf 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.100
 good to install I feel that I have to 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.390
 do back the folder that you put here in 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.700
 beaches we copy to copy and paste 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.130
 where we look for where you have 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.640
 your point is I have in the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.190
 desk 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.050
 actually seeking not be satisfied 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:15.120
 folder that is the first one we are going to move 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.120
 to grind and paste it here it's worth 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.980
 once we have 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.490
 we stick it will have a perfect player 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.070
 good exemplary cooking 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.700
 and once you already have copied whom 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.450
 you want 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:39.350
 in cs strike and in the tanners already 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.630
 they have activated, but remember very 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.410
 important to put this as it is in 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.340
 this photo here for revolution and everything 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.340

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.030
 and nothing else fuck 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.920

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.790
