in<00:00:25.800> my<00:00:25.980> opinion<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.609> think<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.150> definitely

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
in my opinion I think it is definitely

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.349 
in my opinion I think it is definitely
obviously<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> winnable<00:00:29.220> game<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:30.210> over

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
obviously a winnable game but going over

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.640 
obviously a winnable game but going over
to<00:00:30.480> Crystal<00:00:30.810> Palace<00:00:31.019> especially<00:00:31.470> since

to Crystal Palace especially since

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.080 
to Crystal Palace especially since
they've<00:00:31.830> got<00:00:31.980> their<00:00:32.130> new<00:00:32.279> manager<00:00:32.399> Tony<00:00:32.790> PS

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
they've got their new manager Tony PS

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.760 
they've got their new manager Tony PS
they're<00:00:33.270> very<00:00:33.570> hard<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.870> break<00:00:34.110> down<00:00:34.290> they

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
they're very hard to break down they

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.830 
they're very hard to break down they
scrapped<00:00:35.280> they<00:00:35.460> cuddle<00:00:35.940> they're<00:00:36.300> very<00:00:36.450> much<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
scrapped they cuddle they're very much a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.110 
scrapped they cuddle they're very much a
Tony<00:00:37.079> Pulis<00:00:37.530> team<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.550> cannot<00:00:38.850> go

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
Tony Pulis team so you just cannot go

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.819 
Tony Pulis team so you just cannot go
there<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.690> give<00:00:39.899> them<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.559> I

there and just give them you know I

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.200 
there and just give them you know I
don't<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.850> those<00:00:41.940> games<00:00:42.090> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
don't think it's one of those games that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.930 
don't think it's one of those games that
we<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.450> go<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.170> one-nil<00:00:43.649> win<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
we can go and get a one-nil win and you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670 
we can go and get a one-nil win and you
know<00:00:44.969> dangle<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.809> carrot<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.469> frightened

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
know dangle a carrot and frightened

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.529 
know dangle a carrot and frightened
because<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:46.950> are<00:00:47.219> teams<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.329> will

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
because they are teams that they will

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.600 
because they are teams that they will
fight<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.289> goal<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.430> we're

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
fight for that goal so I think we're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
fight for that goal so I think we're
going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> need<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.059> go<00:00:51.239> there<00:00:51.539> hit<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.079> quick

going to need to go there hit and quick

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.689 
going to need to go there hit and quick

doesn't<00:02:52.930> make<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.080> difference<00:02:53.110> who<00:02:53.530> plays<00:02:53.860> up

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
doesn't make a difference who plays up

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.250 
doesn't make a difference who plays up
there<00:02:54.400> they<00:02:55.300> all<00:02:55.450> Perez<00:02:55.690> give<00:02:55.840> us<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.019> same

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
there they all Perez give us the same

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.560 
there they all Perez give us the same
apart<00:02:56.620> from<00:02:56.680> metal<00:02:57.070> at<00:02:57.160> home<00:02:57.340> at<00:02:57.580> home<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.330> think

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
apart from metal at home at home I think

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.270 
apart from metal at home at home I think
he's<00:02:58.660> by<00:02:58.810> far<00:02:58.840> right<00:02:59.560> clearly<00:02:59.860> our<00:03:00.070> best

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
he's by far right clearly our best

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.860 
he's by far right clearly our best
striker<00:03:00.550> but<00:03:00.820> away<00:03:01.000> from<00:03:01.030> he<00:03:01.330> still<00:03:01.540> at<00:03:01.630> school

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
striker but away from he still at school

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.870 
striker but away from he still at school
for<00:03:02.019> Chelsea<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.220> we<00:03:03.340> are<00:03:03.459> away<00:03:03.640> from<00:03:03.700> home

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
for Chelsea so and we are away from home

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.940 
for Chelsea so and we are away from home
so<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.630> don't<00:03:05.170> think<00:03:05.230> that's<00:03:05.350> like<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.709> major

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
so I don't think that's like a major

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.979 
so I don't think that's like a major

Ramirez you know so I think that could

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.710 
Ramirez you know so I think that could
be<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.670> missing<00:04:28.790> ingredient<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.420> maybe<00:04:29.570> she's

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
be the missing ingredient so maybe she's

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.420 
be the missing ingredient so maybe she's
the<00:04:29.750> confidence<00:04:30.320> but<00:04:30.740> I'm<00:04:31.040> telling<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:31.400> now

allows<00:04:39.470> seven<00:04:39.860> games<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.370> think<00:04:40.880> we<00:04:40.970> will<00:04:41.090> win

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
allows seven games I think we will win

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.420 
allows seven games I think we will win
majora<00:04:41.780> through<00:04:41.990> those<00:04:42.110> games<00:04:42.430> unfortunately

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
majora through those games unfortunately

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.100 
majora through those games unfortunately
I<00:04:43.640> don't<00:04:44.120> think<00:04:44.300> that's<00:04:44.510> going<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.660> happen<00:04:44.750> and

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
I don't think that's going to happen and

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.200 
I don't think that's going to happen and
i<00:04:45.140> think<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:45.470> i<00:04:45.770> think<00:04:46.340> this<00:04:46.670> game<00:04:46.850> tomorrow

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
i think that i think this game tomorrow

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.820 
i think that i think this game tomorrow
is<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.420> potential<00:04:47.900> back<00:04:48.020> banana<00:04:48.380> skin<00:04:48.680> so

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
is a potential back banana skin so

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.960 
is a potential back banana skin so
hopefully<00:04:49.130> Mourinho<00:04:49.460> has<00:04:49.490> whipped<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.820> boys

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
hopefully Mourinho has whipped the boys

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.810 
hopefully Mourinho has whipped the boys
into<00:04:50.270> shape<00:04:50.630> before<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.980> Aston<00:04:52.280> Villa<00:04:52.430> game<00:04:52.700> I

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
into shape before the Aston Villa game I

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.250 
into shape before the Aston Villa game I
would<00:04:52.880> say<00:04:53.060> look<00:04:53.270> we've<00:04:53.870> had<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.020> week<00:04:54.230> to

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
would say look we've had a week to

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.660 
would say look we've had a week to
prepare<00:04:54.500> for<00:04:54.800> this<00:04:54.860> game<00:04:55.040> I<00:04:55.250> think<00:04:55.430> would<00:04:55.520> do

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
prepare for this game I think would do

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.160 
prepare for this game I think would do
well<00:04:55.850> but<00:04:56.030> we<00:04:56.120> had<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.270> week<00:04:56.420> to<00:04:56.600> prepare<00:04:56.810> for

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
well but we had a week to prepare for

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.780 
well but we had a week to prepare for
the<00:04:57.230> Aston<00:04:57.500> Villa<00:04:57.680> game<00:04:57.890> and<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.490> went<00:04:58.700> all

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
the Aston Villa game and that went all

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.310 
the Aston Villa game and that went all
bad<00:04:58.940> but<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.210> good<00:04:59.390> image<00:04:59.630> nasa<00:04:59.810> nevada<00:05:00.110> game

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
bad but the good image nasa nevada game

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.720 
bad but the good image nasa nevada game
is<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.500> lot<00:05:00.590> people<00:05:00.770> overreacted<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.520> because

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
is a lot people overreacted that because

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.580 
is a lot people overreacted that because
that<00:05:01.760> probably<00:05:02.150> has<00:05:02.360> cost<00:05:02.660> us<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.900> title<00:05:03.050> the

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
that probably has cost us the title the

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.780 
that probably has cost us the title the
one<00:05:03.740> thing<00:05:03.800> I<00:05:03.920> will<00:05:04.100> say<00:05:04.160> though<00:05:04.430> we<00:05:04.580> played

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.370 
bright I think we're in the same
category<00:05:28.880> like<00:05:29.300> Brendan<00:05:29.930> Rodgers<00:05:30.200> at<00:05:30.320> the

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
category like Brendan Rodgers at the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.510 
category like Brendan Rodgers at the
moment<00:05:30.620> is<00:05:30.680> saying<00:05:30.860> like<00:05:30.980> oh<00:05:31.160> we're<00:05:31.310> ahead<00:05:31.400> of
