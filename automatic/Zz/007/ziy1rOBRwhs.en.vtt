your external hard drive to your

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.339 
your external hard drive to your
computer<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.640> you'll<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.539> documentation

computer and you'll have documentation
with<00:00:31.980> external<00:00:32.489> hard<00:00:32.850> drive<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.090> shows<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
with external hard drive that shows you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.080 
with external hard drive that shows you
how<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.670> when<00:00:35.670> you've<00:00:35.820> done<00:00:35.850> that

how to do that and when you've done that
an<00:00:36.570> external<00:00:37.290> hard<00:00:37.559> drive<00:00:37.649> icon<00:00:38.100> will<00:00:38.790> pop<00:00:39.059> up

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
an external hard drive icon will pop up

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.069 
an external hard drive icon will pop up
on<00:00:39.480> your<00:00:39.540> desktop<00:00:40.020> let's<00:00:40.950> say<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.430> my

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
on your desktop let's say this is my

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.830 
on your desktop let's say this is my
icon<00:00:43.079> for<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.440> external<00:00:43.860> hard<00:00:44.070> drive<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
icon for that external hard drive so the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080 
icon for that external hard drive so the
first<00:00:46.110> thing<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.250> into<00:00:47.910> your

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
first copy the iPhoto library over to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.260 
first copy the iPhoto library over to
the<00:01:49.170> external<00:01:49.619> hard<00:01:49.829> drive<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.090> by

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the external hard drive what you do by

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.780 
the external hard drive what you do by
dragging<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.350> icon<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.250> drop

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
dropping it in there and it could take

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.389 
dropping it in there and it could take
some<00:01:56.969> time<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.600> copy<00:01:57.840> over<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.469> depending

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
some time to copy over there depending

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.920 
some time to copy over there depending
on<00:01:59.520> how<00:01:59.670> much<00:01:59.850> how<00:02:00.119> many<00:02:00.329> pictures<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.840> the
