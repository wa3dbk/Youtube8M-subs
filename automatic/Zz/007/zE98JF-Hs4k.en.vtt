a<00:05:24.970> few<00:05:25.720> years<00:05:25.750> ago<00:05:25.960> I<00:05:26.350> think<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:27.010> was<00:05:27.070> about<00:05:27.220> 300

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
a few years ago I think it was about 300

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.990 
a few years ago I think it was about 300
pounds<00:05:28.930> from<00:05:29.250> 700<00:05:30.250> or<00:05:30.370> something<00:05:30.610> so<00:05:30.730> is<00:05:30.850> about

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
pounds from 700 or something so is about

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.480 
pounds from 700 or something so is about
half<00:05:31.210> off<00:05:31.420> and<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:32.290> really<00:05:32.650> really<00:05:32.770> like<00:05:33.070> it<00:05:33.100> and

I<00:05:33.760> haven't<00:05:34.060> used<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:34.450> for<00:05:34.630> a<00:05:34.690> long<00:05:34.930> time<00:05:35.260> so<00:05:35.800> I

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
I haven't used it for a long time so I

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.050 
I haven't used it for a long time so I
thought<00:05:36.040> I'd<00:05:36.190> dig<00:05:36.340> it<00:05:36.430> out<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:36.670> really<00:05:36.820> nice
