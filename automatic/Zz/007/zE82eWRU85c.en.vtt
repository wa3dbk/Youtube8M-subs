00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.569
 so you know now my voice reminds me 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.360
 again or still in the ass 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.550
 I noticed again from lake Wörthersee 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.349
 he marie old videos are partly like 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.320
 far as we are already the last point 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.640
 with the cars of those of you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.199
 come back at all times 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.199
 I was only at the desk 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.349
 spend 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.760
 Another topic and always around the theme 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.690
 performance now we have it 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.130
 Chassis Staring Original Chassis 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.110
 The original bike is in itself 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.329
 really really needs a good setup 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.930
 you say car very very deep and very 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.370
 agile 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.070
 I I said times the measurement 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.800
 from the car is very very pointed and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.930
 very sensitive and makes the car very much 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.879
 It happens very fast that you happen 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 you have to pay attention to the rear axle of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.930
 ford a life car by with relative 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.879
 a lot of crash if the rear axle with a lot 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 fall arrives at a front wheel drive 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.620
 car and the fans in the curve purely 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.329
 year of life the whole question important cars 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 the curve in 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.720
 Thus tends the car, for example 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 Right at the moment I have to go to the right 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.140
 Sorry in short moment where the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.360
 Pad surface of the tire because of the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.880
 The fall of the rich certainly difficult 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.470
 not full-contact fan which means that we 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.250
 slip over the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.560
 flank come we must have noticed how 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.409
 You can easily do this tutoring if he does 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.030
 rear tire with a lot of fall is the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.009
 means unit does not exist so 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.170
 street but slightly sloping 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.570
 we drive a lot on the inside 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.100
 flank of the tire and also the in 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.979
 edge of the lined up not so much 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.890
 grip level like the tire with 0 6 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.780
 degrees or 0 9 degrees rear axle drives and 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.479
 then the mature many planners will fly up 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.070
 and a certain degree on Sundays it is 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.420
 not negative knows you can not 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.280
 forgot that he was the vehicle weight 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.320
 also works against the tire pressure 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.469
 thus a certain one is similar to itself 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.290
 Fall off the rear axle due to 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.130
 of pressure in a tire of air pressure and 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.649
 then the circulation from this 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.420
 Now we have the following point 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.310
 This survey is the car for the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.890
 front of a car very very much 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.750
 unstable but for the body 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.470
 also very active you have to do that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:25.860
 imagine you look here 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.930
 I can accept the customers 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.580
 the curve in 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.500
 we catch the turns in turn 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.269
 this moment where we have a left sld 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.450
 Chorus as she goes on 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.110
 The car now has to be every inch 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.299
 drive every angle before making a turn 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.130
 the air the gas gives up, so to speak 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.349
 dragged the first time by pulling 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.970
 at the moment on the support 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.099
 rear axle shifts the tail of the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.739
 vehicle in the wonder of the tail of 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.810
 vehicle breaks out we have one and 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.280
 Positioning of the vehicle direction 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.220
 starting point of the curve 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.340
 that means we can be artificial 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.200
 abbreviate 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.810
 we do not have to drive everything but 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.269
 Verein the curves and then notice 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.030
 The vehicle quasi behind ass almost 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.329
 with obsolete if we cut artificially 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.579
 almost from the vehicle because a lot 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.290
 continue eco business positioning 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.380
 normally pass through 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.150
 even if that comes here now we have 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.980
 here an angle of the angle to 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.720
 starting point of the curve changes 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.880
 in the moment and thus we have 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.230
 less advises to drive and one 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.639
 save more active 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.739
 for the laity it is the first moment 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.660
 Super uncomfortable because you think 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.100
 müller heck breaks out and my way 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.510
 Driven cars can be seen through glass 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.359
 and many things if catch again 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.209
 in a friend of a drifted cars 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.250
 car you catch a little bit 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.870
 with a lot of feeling and a lot of glass he has to 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.540
 to catch the suitcases again and with much 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.700
 train through and to the theory of the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.310
 Car factories can fix that is good 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.720
 but it's a little too slow and something 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.140
 too much of her hearer of 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.510
 vehicle is quite native 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.080
 that's why this landing gear comes now 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.790
 purely have bilstein b14 chassis that is 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.500
 from the setup he already firmly configures us 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.760
 can not finish it even adjust 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.049
 That's not what I think about it 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.260
 Good deal or put your vehicles 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.000
 to think negatively the car drives great 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.790
 It was great after that 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.700
 Series 1000 times 1000 times better 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:33.660
 now that's the sticking point many 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.930
 threaded suspensions are installed 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.880
 and if he screwed under like stupid 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.380
 the can also make but 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.420
 Working area of a shock absorber 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.760
 if you can now command the lamb 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.140
 Calcium is the work area 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.570
 from the damper 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.690
 something in here wants to be repressed and 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.130
 So we have the workspace below 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.720
 at displacement where the damper of 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.770
 shock absorbers are not sprung or push the 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.660
 can handle 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.250
 if this the vehicle 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.730
 screwed down one seems now 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.260
 in front 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.390
 the coilover who as long as 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.940
 this damper so the following problem 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.710
 the so the piston by the lowering 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.750
 if you keep dusting under here 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.590
 below goes deeper into the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.720
 cartridge purely 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.400
 that is the working area under the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.900
 Shoe itself is super super little but 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.550
 the damper must be able to work what 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.350
 he needs area under the damper 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.080
 Cartridge so we do follow the 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.100
 to achieve a reduction is in the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.660
 screen like 14 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.580
 the whole thing from the outset already 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.770
 shorter thus achieve the deepening 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.710
 once through the higher of the damper 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.110
 general and thus have the important 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.760
 work area again that is ours 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.190
 the case is in fact policeman here he 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.410
 has super much commuting under the 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.810
 still need the piston to steam 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.310
 can go on steaming and highspeed 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.840
 offers a very important thing like 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.560
 he can quickly 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.389
 how sensitively nobody reacts and there 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.750
 I do something it has a lot of fun 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.270
 could make or so pure popping up 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.660
 and here 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.910
 you see her like the series because 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.380
 on the other hand politically stockel and he 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.729
 always try to stay in contact with 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.280
 keep if you can not forget 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.740
 each one thrust from bottom to top 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.000
 makes sure that for a short time the 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.470
 ground contact is lost 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.360
 if in that moment when he bumps and 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.310
 the feather must come up here 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.960
 work against it must be as fast as 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.250
 possible contact to the street again 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.350
 and then for example now 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.150
 incomparable the bilstein damper 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.639
 the middle of the fall is always the case 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.930
 endeavored in contact so evenly and so 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.850
 Build as fast as possible 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.380
 here comes not only on speed as 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.330
 comes out of here quickly but also how 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.680
 even because that's the feedback that you do 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.050
 get into the steering wheel 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.820
 this ground contact you have how exactly that 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.590
 own behavior if for example a 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.539
 ground wave comes in the input phase 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.190
 and all these little things do that 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.860
 we see how beautiful again 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.120
 processed makes his thing must of 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.539
 Buyer still the solution afterwards 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.539
 and how you look good that's ideal 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.560
 on
