I<00:00:10.410> just<00:00:11.410> have<00:00:11.559> to<00:00:11.650> say<00:00:11.799> cheese

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.650 

okay<00:00:22.620> so<00:00:22.680> we're<00:00:22.830> cutting<00:00:22.950> off<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.190> strip<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
okay so we're cutting off a strip so and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.080 
okay so we're cutting off a strip so and
then<00:00:25.410> rub<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.710> cornstarch<00:00:26.190> off<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
then rub the cornstarch off of it is

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.270 
then rub the cornstarch off of it is
mine<00:00:27.420> yeah<00:00:27.900> advice<00:00:28.440> that<00:00:28.860> strippers<00:00:29.160> like

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
mine yeah advice that strippers like

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.730 
mine yeah advice that strippers like
half<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.550> centimeter<00:00:29.940> wide<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.110> that<00:00:31.290> it's

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
half a centimeter wide so that it's

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.420 
half a centimeter wide so that it's
about<00:00:32.010> the<00:00:32.160> same<00:00:32.400> height<00:00:33.060> as<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.510> wide<00:00:34.430> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
about the same height as it is wide so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.700 
about the same height as it is wide so
it's<00:00:35.580> about<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.600> four<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> five

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's about what you know four to five

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.920 
it's about what you know four to five
millimeters<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.580> all<00:00:38.700> directions<00:00:38.900> it's<00:00:39.900> a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
millimeters in all directions it's a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.130 
millimeters in all directions it's a
very<00:00:40.110> elastic<00:00:40.350> Joe<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.809> we<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.900> this<00:00:42.960> nice

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
very elastic Joe I we have this nice

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
very elastic Joe I we have this nice
flat<00:00:43.320> surface

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
flat surface

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.080 
flat surface
my<00:00:44.309> hands<00:00:44.520> are<00:00:44.640> old<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.950> rolling<00:00:47.880> that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
my hands are old and I'm rolling that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.200 
my hands are old and I'm rolling that
you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.330> see<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.600> elastic<00:00:48.900> and<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
you can see it's elastic and and that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.490 
you can see it's elastic and and that
it's<00:00:51.330> starting<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> roll<00:00:51.870> even<00:00:52.140> though<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> was

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it's starting to roll even though it was

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.210 
it's starting to roll even though it was
actually<00:00:52.739> quite<00:00:53.010> square<00:00:53.400> before<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.559> now

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
actually quite square before so it's now

about half as thick as it used to be and
I'm<00:00:59.970> holding<00:01:00.120> part<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.660> place<00:01:00.839> rolling

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I'm holding part of it in place rolling

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.790 
I'm holding part of it in place rolling
out<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> rest<00:01:01.470> then<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:02.550> gonna<00:01:02.670> keep<00:01:02.879> on

out the rest then I'm gonna keep on
getting<00:01:04.800> out<00:01:05.100> getting<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> extending

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
getting out getting more of it extending

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.320 
getting out getting more of it extending
it<00:01:07.250> that's<00:01:08.250> part<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.520> its<00:01:08.670> done<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.210> move

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it that's part of its done you can move

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
it that's part of its done you can move
out<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.630> next<00:01:09.810> part<00:01:10.580> sketching<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:16.700> it's

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
out to the next part sketching out it's

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.570 
out to the next part sketching out it's
actually<00:01:17.820> quite<00:01:18.150> large<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.340> stay

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
actually quite large and and it can stay

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.080 
actually quite large and and it can stay
long<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.360> thick<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.659> chewy<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
long because it's thick and chewy and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
long because it's thick and chewy and
will<00:01:24.090> enable<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> break<00:01:24.870> in<00:01:25.050> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
will enable it not to break in the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
will enable it not to break in the
