later<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.500> pou<00:00:53.090> EDC<00:00:54.770> everyday<00:00:55.770> carry<00:00:56.039> blade

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
later so pou EDC everyday carry blade

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
later so pou EDC everyday carry blade
you<00:00:57.000> don't<00:00:57.120> want<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> carry<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.629> everyday<00:00:58.109> on

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you don't want to carry this everyday on

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
you don't want to carry this everyday on
you<00:00:58.469> its<00:00:58.949> small<00:00:59.309> enough<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.090> do

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you its small enough so that you can do

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.420 
you its small enough so that you can do
so<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:01.109> slides<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.710> into<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> pocket

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so this slides right into the pocket

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.420 
so this slides right into the pocket
easy<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.940> deploy<00:01:03.120> quick<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.080> work<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.559> has<00:01:05.400> a

easy to deploy quick to work and has a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
easy to deploy quick to work and has a
nice<00:01:05.820> cutting<00:01:06.180> edge<00:01:06.830> let's<00:01:07.830> talk<00:01:08.040> about

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
nice cutting edge let's talk about

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
nice cutting edge let's talk about
ergonomics<00:01:09.450> ergonomics<00:01:10.549> are<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:11.970> good<00:01:12.390> for

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
ergonomics ergonomics are very good for

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.480 
ergonomics ergonomics are very good for
this<00:01:12.810> knife<00:01:13.049> better<00:01:13.590> than<00:01:13.890> most<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.310> would<00:01:14.369> say

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this knife better than most I would say

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.649 
this knife better than most I would say
because<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.850> flipper<00:01:17.850> tab<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.509> one

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
because of the flipper tab this is one

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.330 
because of the flipper tab this is one
of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> reasons<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.830> flipper<00:01:20.070> taps

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
of the reasons I'm in the flipper taps

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.300 
of the reasons I'm in the flipper taps
is<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.630> flipper<00:01:21.930> tab<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.380> acts<00:01:22.950> as

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
is because this flipper tab here acts as

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.590 
is because this flipper tab here acts as
a<00:01:23.640> finger<00:01:24.090> stop<00:01:24.560> see<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.600> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
a finger stop see this right here that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.880 
a finger stop see this right here that
gives<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.990> good<00:01:28.200> grip<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:30.890> so

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
gives you a good grip on it the so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.350 
gives you a good grip on it the so
there's<00:01:32.130> jimping<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:32.939> around<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
there's jimping all the way around the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.620 
there's jimping all the way around the
blade<00:01:33.570> jumping<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.799> moving<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
blade jumping up here moving here and it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
blade jumping up here moving here and it
just<00:01:36.810> gives<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.170> nice<00:01:37.530> purchase<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
just gives a really nice purchase on the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.840 
just gives a really nice purchase on the
blade<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> would<00:01:40.409> say<00:01:40.530> economics<00:01:41.189> fantastic

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
blade so I would say economics fantastic

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.520 
blade so I would say economics fantastic
what<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.150> let's<00:01:42.780> talk<00:01:42.930> about<00:01:43.049> lockup

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
what about let's talk about lockup

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
what about let's talk about lockup
lockup<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> liner<00:01:44.759> lock<00:01:45.000> design<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.659> course

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
lockup is a liner lock design of course

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.210 
lockup is a liner lock design of course
with<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> liner<00:01:46.409> lock<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> need<00:01:46.979> steel

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
with the liner lock you need steel

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.539 
with the liner lock you need steel
liners<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.560> some<00:01:49.560> guys<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> problem<00:01:50.280> with

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
liners and some guys have a problem with

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.219 
liners and some guys have a problem with
steel<00:01:50.759> liners<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.479> don't

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
steel liners I don't

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.420 
steel liners I don't
I<00:01:52.700> like<00:01:53.700> steel<00:01:54.000> liners<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.799> think<00:01:55.799> steel<00:01:56.040> liners

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
I like steel liners I think steel liners

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.740 
I like steel liners I think steel liners
look<00:01:56.670> cool<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.119> adds<00:02:00.420> durability

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
look cool and I think it adds durability

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.600 
look cool and I think it adds durability
I<00:02:01.439> don't<00:02:01.710> care<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.430> bit

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
I don't care if it's a little bit

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.520 
I don't care if it's a little bit
heavier<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.570> steel<00:02:03.840> liners<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:07.320> yeah

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
heavier I like steel liners but yeah

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.800 
heavier I like steel liners but yeah
that<00:02:07.740> lockup<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.280> fairly<00:02:09.030> good<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.509> thumb

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
that lockup is fairly good this thumb

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.640 
that lockup is fairly good this thumb
stud<00:02:10.110> acts<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> stop<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> blade<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
stud acts as the stop for the blade and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.160 
stud acts as the stop for the blade and
I<00:02:12.680> don't<00:02:13.250> detect<00:02:13.640> any<00:02:13.940> wiggle<00:02:14.420> there<00:02:14.959> might<00:02:15.140> be

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
I don't detect any wiggle there might be

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.280 
I don't detect any wiggle there might be
slight<00:02:15.530> wiggle<00:02:16.040> up<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:16.310> down<00:02:16.459> but<00:02:16.730> I'm<00:02:16.970> not

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
slight wiggle up and down but I'm not

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.990 
slight wiggle up and down but I'm not
I'm<00:02:18.290> not<00:02:18.349> sure<00:02:18.560> no<00:02:19.129> there's<00:02:19.370> no<00:02:19.519> wiggle

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
I'm not sure no there's no wiggle
