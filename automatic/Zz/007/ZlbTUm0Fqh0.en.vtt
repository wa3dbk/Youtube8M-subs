00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
team is if when you look at it closely a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.160 
team is if when you look at it closely a
lot<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> teams<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.390> past<00:01:09.659> few<00:01:09.840> years

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
lot of the teams of the past few years

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.510 
lot of the teams of the past few years
there<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.500> been<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.890> experience

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
there have been really experience

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
there have been really experience
they've<00:01:11.640> had<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.820> lot<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.060> talented<00:01:12.540> guys<00:01:12.780> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
they've had a lot of talented guys that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
they've had a lot of talented guys that
have<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.560> had<00:01:13.830> experienced<00:01:14.490> this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
have you know had experienced this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
have you know had experienced this
team's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> little<00:01:15.720> bit<00:01:15.869> different<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.409> think

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
team's a little bit different I think

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.320 
team's a little bit different I think
when<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.040> look<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> team<00:01:17.850> where<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
when you look at the team where it is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
when you look at the team where it is
now<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.840> there's<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.200> lot<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.500> really

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
now I think there's a lot of really

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
now I think there's a lot of really
really<00:01:20.520> outstanding<00:01:20.909> young<00:01:21.360> talent<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.049> think

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
really outstanding young talent I think

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
really outstanding young talent I think
that<00:01:22.740> maybe<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.700> young<00:01:23.939> talents<00:01:24.390> possibly<00:01:25.200> as

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that maybe the young talents possibly as

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.140 
that maybe the young talents possibly as
good<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.740> ever<00:01:25.860> been<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.580> again<00:01:26.880> it's

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
good as it's ever been but again it's

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
good as it's ever been but again it's
inexperienced<00:01:27.840> its<00:01:28.229> young<00:01:28.439> talent<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.009> are

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
inexperienced its young talent there are

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.499 
inexperienced its young talent there are
a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.280> question<00:01:29.759> marks<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.240> team

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
a lot of question marks on this team

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.789 
a lot of question marks on this team
you're<00:01:30.630> talking<00:01:30.869> about<00:01:30.960> even<00:01:31.470> starting<00:01:31.740> out

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
you're talking about even starting out

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.350 
you're talking about even starting out
at<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> quarterback<00:01:32.340> spot<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.820> mean<00:01:33.150> there's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
at the quarterback spot I mean there's

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.670 
at the quarterback spot I mean there's
certainly<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.869> question<00:01:34.229> marks<00:01:34.259> there

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
certainly some question marks there

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
certainly some question marks there
because<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.070> don't<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.250> any<00:01:35.490> experience<00:01:35.909> at

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
because you don't have any experience at

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969 
because you don't have any experience at
all<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.320> look<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.920> the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and the most important thing playing

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.730 
and the most important thing playing
quarterback<00:02:12.629> at<00:02:12.810> Alabama<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.349> taking

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
quarterback at Alabama is taking

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.680 
quarterback at Alabama is taking
care<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> ball<00:02:14.160> managing<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.150> turnovers

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
care of the ball managing the turnovers

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780 
care of the ball managing the turnovers
doing<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> little<00:02:16.620> thing<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.100> maybe<00:02:17.400> that's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
doing the little thing so maybe that's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.340 
doing the little thing so maybe that's
what<00:02:18.030> people<00:02:18.330> should<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.570> focusing<00:02:18.990> on<00:02:19.110> rather

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
what people should be focusing on rather

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.960 
what people should be focusing on rather
than<00:02:19.500> who<00:02:19.800> has<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.100> strongest<00:02:20.430> arm<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.910> who

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
than who has the strongest arm and who

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.340 
than who has the strongest arm and who
can<00:02:21.120> throw<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.630> down<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> field<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.080> all<00:02:22.200> that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
can throw it down the field and all that

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.660 
can throw it down the field and all that
stuff<00:02:22.440> well<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.830> think<00:02:22.980> when<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.430> look<00:02:23.460> at

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
stuff well I think when you look at

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.730 
stuff well I think when you look at
Alabama<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:24.300> now<00:02:24.420> offensively<00:02:24.990> first<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
Alabama right now offensively first of

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
Alabama right now offensively first of
all<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.860> want<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.190> have<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> strong<00:02:26.550> offensive

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
all you want to have a strong offensive

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.580 
all you want to have a strong offensive
line<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.450> goes<00:02:27.480> without<00:02:27.840> question<00:02:28.020> but<00:02:28.500> if

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
line that goes without question but if

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.290 
line that goes without question but if
those<00:02:28.800> guys<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.520> control<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.150> line

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
those guys can really control the line

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.760 
those guys can really control the line
of<00:02:30.330> scrimmage<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.200> running<00:02:31.590> game

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
of scrimmage you have the running game

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.380 
of scrimmage you have the running game
with<00:02:32.220> those<00:02:32.370> running<00:02:32.760> backs<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.270> be

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
with those running backs that can be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.200 
with those running backs that can be
lethal<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:34.020> mean<00:02:34.380> TJ<00:02:34.620> Yeldon<00:02:35.250> Kenyan<00:02:36.060> Drake

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
lethal I mean TJ Yeldon Kenyan Drake

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.970 
lethal I mean TJ Yeldon Kenyan Drake
Derrick<00:02:36.930> Henry<00:02:37.110> certainly<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.740> could<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
Derrick Henry certainly that could be a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.890 
Derrick Henry certainly that could be a
very<00:02:38.190> potent<00:02:38.700> not<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.120> mention<00:02:39.270> josten<00:02:39.720> Fowler

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
very potent not to mention josten Fowler

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.990 
very potent not to mention josten Fowler
could<00:02:40.110> be<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> certainly<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.920> very<00:02:41.370> potent

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
could be a certainly a very potent

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.610 
could be a certainly a very potent
running<00:02:42.390> game<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.810> don't<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.380> kind<00:02:43.590> of

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
running game so you don't you kind of

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.170 
running game so you don't you kind of
take<00:02:43.830> pressure<00:02:44.130> off<00:02:44.250> your<00:02:44.520> quarterback<00:02:44.970> and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
take pressure off your quarterback and

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.910 
take pressure off your quarterback and
you<00:02:45.510> don't<00:02:45.690> put<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.020> much<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.320> him<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:46.740> least

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
you don't put so much on him at least

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.340 
you don't put so much on him at least
early<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.880> again<00:02:48.210> it's<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.480> guy<00:02:48.660> who<00:02:48.690> manages

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
