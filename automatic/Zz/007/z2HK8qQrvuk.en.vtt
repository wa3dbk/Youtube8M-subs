have<00:01:38.009> no<00:01:38.369> idea<00:01:38.400> how<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.119> sure<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> guy<00:01:39.960> he<00:01:40.320> dies

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and team Cal encore mode it makes what's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.399 
and team Cal encore mode it makes what's
really<00:01:44.700> no<00:01:44.850> sense<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.600> guy<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.200> team

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
switched this is the only logical

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.679 
switched this is the only logical
explanation<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:49.950> think<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.579> for<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> just

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
explanation I can think of for that just

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.060 
explanation I can think of for that just
happening<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.380> he<00:01:52.530> must<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:52.920> good

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
happening right there he must have good

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
same in Hunter series I don't know why I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.849 
same in Hunter series I don't know why I

didn't do half of these assignments

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.500 
didn't do half of these assignments
because<00:02:47.220> some<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.430> them<00:02:47.609> are<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:47.909> easy<00:02:48.239> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
because some of them are really easy and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.839 
because some of them are really easy and
all<00:02:48.659> they<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.959> all<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.709> cake<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.190> just<00:02:50.609> for<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
to read what you need to do and then

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.259 
to read what you need to do and then
just<00:02:52.739> do<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.549> fact<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:54.060> haven't

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
just do it the fact that I haven't

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.360 
just do it the fact that I haven't
worked<00:02:54.540> up<00:02:54.840> how<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.109> do<00:02:55.440> half<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.709> assignments

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
worked up how to do half the assignments

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.220 
worked up how to do half the assignments
is<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.579> only<00:02:56.700> reason<00:02:57.090> why<00:02:57.569> I<00:02:57.599> haven't<00:02:57.780> done

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
is the only reason why I haven't done

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.860 
is the only reason why I haven't done
half<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.530> assignments<00:02:59.189> and<00:02:59.609> also<00:02:59.939> I<00:03:00.359> haven't

but you know those games sometimes it's

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.300 
but you know those games sometimes it's
the<00:04:45.930> other<00:04:45.960> way<00:04:46.290> around<00:04:46.320> where<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:46.830> haul<00:04:47.040> pawn

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
there was a few ways to approach certain

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.130 
there was a few ways to approach certain
scenarios<00:05:48.180> when<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.390> comes<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.690> operation

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
scenarios when it comes to operation

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.800 
scenarios when it comes to operation
marker<00:05:49.560> and<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:50.490> lot<00:05:50.670> of<00:05:50.700> these<00:05:51.060> things<00:05:51.630> just

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
marker and a lot of these things just

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.930 
marker and a lot of these things just
happen<00:05:52.080> all<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.770> time<00:05:53.010> it's<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:53.400> map<00:05:53.640> is<00:05:53.880> very

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
happen all the time it's a map is very

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.780 
happen all the time it's a map is very
repetitive<00:05:54.810> in<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.890> way<00:05:56.040> that<00:05:56.220> each<00:05:56.370> game

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
repetitive in the way that each game

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.150 
repetitive in the way that each game
pans<00:05:57.180> out<00:05:57.510> so<00:05:57.990> it's<00:05:58.380> good<00:05:58.560> to<00:05:58.680> sort<00:05:58.830> of<00:05:58.950> think

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
pans out so it's good to sort of think

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.390 
pans out so it's good to sort of think
up<00:05:59.370> how<00:05:59.550> to<00:05:59.610> counteract<00:06:00.150> certain<00:06:01.190> sort<00:06:02.190> of

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
up how to counteract certain sort of

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.250 
up how to counteract certain sort of
positions<00:06:03.000> when<00:06:03.270> your<00:06:03.390> team<00:06:03.570> just<00:06:03.720> get<00:06:03.930> walked

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
positions when your team just get walked

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.830 
positions when your team just get walked
down<00:06:04.740> and<00:06:05.390> this<00:06:06.390> one<00:06:06.630> here<00:06:06.900> is<00:06:07.020> it<00:06:07.320> happened

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
down and this one here is it happened

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.510 
down and this one here is it happened
every<00:06:08.199> game<00:06:08.380> when<00:06:08.590> you're<00:06:08.710> in<00:06:08.830> this<00:06:09.010> room<00:06:09.160> and

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
every game when you're in this room and

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.560 
every game when you're in this room and
they're<00:06:09.669> just<00:06:09.850> the<00:06:09.970> other<00:06:10.120> sending<00:06:10.389> out

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570
