 Hello everyone and I think it will be 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.309
 the shortest your life podcast 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.870

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.279

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.750
 Shane's speeches because I'm just tired and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.000
 I don't want to do that anymore 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.559

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.920
 overcome now this one 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.260
 period 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 This is the most difficult period in my life 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.939
 never did shit like that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.790

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.810
 I wanted to say something that recently appeared 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.880
 youtube gaming need to be tested 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.310
 This site because I have long wanted 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.899
 streamer but somehow it didnâ€™t work 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.270
 then the duties are so much the last 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.100
 time fell on the shoulders of this time not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.259
 enough almost not that well, 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.210
 let's summarize in the general meeting i'm not 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.880
 parting meetings on both the curtain and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.009
 We will know if some help me 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.320
 I need him so I think that I 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.659
 will help in the group here and I myself probably 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.360
 I will not appear I will stay there but 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.160
 I will appear very rarely and indeed 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.080
 VKontakte on its official page 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.390
 so if someone wants to keeps an eye on 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.950
 news please i have a sweater 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.220
 come to twitter I'll tell you everything 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.350
 ask questions you want know other 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.870
 about the fate of previous projects 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.970
 which I was more precisely can hug I 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.040
 I think just the main audience for the sake of 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.800
 this program and came I do not know whether 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.410
 she is in the future because many are tired 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.480
 here is this concept concept of criticism 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.250
 videos yes even more gta san 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.470
 andreas because basically nothing 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.480
 I can not show the new 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.780
 Well, there is no moment for so many disgusting 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.840
 video of course of course I'm not mistaken they 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.970
 I have a whole folder but it's just 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.820
 people stop liking like already 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.040
 content and more and more often they tell me what to do 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.620
 and it's time to tie it up 1 can't 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.510
 continue more until I myself think that 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.790
 exhausted in general already all your vocabulary 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.800
 stock and I have nothing more to say for 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.110
 On this occasion, I always come back to 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.200
 well who knows who knows 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.570
 Further, I still will return 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.519
 In general, I wanted to do voice acting just 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.830
 for myself I tried to voice a couple 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.019
 video clips engri video game nerds 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.269
 and in the opinion of my friends turned out 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.549
 pretty good so maybe i 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.680
 lay these videos on the beta channel to 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.560
 find out your independent opinion on this 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.200
 about and maybe I'll take the voice acting 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.019
 unless of course my voice is allowed and not 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.580
 It seems so irritating and even on 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.910
 about that channel, I recently 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.920
 an active post there videos MCC released 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.860
 only three issues I actually thought 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.080
 that will go much more in my 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.570
 first hit the time second to me 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.519
 just didn't like that anymore 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.950
 the engine that happens on this channel 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.350
 so I am waiting for everyone here for everyone 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.540
 I will be very happy I hope I hope 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.160
 your support and I hope that everything 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.380
 will be fine and everything will be fine in 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.900
 the end about the army dudes and me 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.519
 don't say anything ok so let's not 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.299
 We will address this issue 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.250

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.380
