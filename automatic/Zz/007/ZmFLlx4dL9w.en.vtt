so I pick up too much cap now what I do

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.960 
so I pick up too much cap now what I do
is<00:01:29.909> say<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.960> sewing<00:01:32.810> right<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.400> you<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.670> I'm

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
is say I'm sewing right here you see I'm

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.410 
is say I'm sewing right here you see I'm
sewing<00:01:36.329> across<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.549> what<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.579> did<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
sewing across here and what I did was I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.870 
sewing across here and what I did was I
pulled<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.170> cap<00:01:40.530> over<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.159> stretched<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
pulled this cap over and I stretched it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
pulled this cap over and I stretched it
and<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:43.140> why<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.649> punched<00:01:44.040> over

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
and that's why it's punched over

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.109 
and that's why it's punched over
basically<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.540> prevent<00:01:45.810> me<00:01:46.259> from

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
basically this is to prevent me from

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.580 
basically this is to prevent me from
