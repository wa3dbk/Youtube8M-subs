couldn't find a lot one of a good enough
examples<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:54.199> thought<00:05:54.380> this<00:05:54.469> was<00:05:54.590> more

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
examples I thought this was more

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.999

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
interesting but in dungeons you might go

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.620 
interesting but in dungeons you might go
