00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.480
(gunshot)
Palomo: Missed...

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.360
(gunshot)

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.420
Missed...

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.320
(gunshot)

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.980
Missed...

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.680
Bitters: Palomo, I know when I miss.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.260
(gunshot)

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.820
Palomo: Are you missing on purpose?

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.800
Bitters: Alright, that's it!

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.700
(Sounds of Bitters beating up Palomo)

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.100
Palomo: IT WAS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION!
Bitters: Am I missing now?!

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.140
Jensen: *sigh*

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040
Smith: Well...I spoke with Kimball...

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.120
Search and rescue has been denied...

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.860
Bitters: Yeah, well, good riddance.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.080
They never cared about us anyway.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.480
Jensen: How could you say that?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.360
They left because they didn't want us getting hurt.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.820
Bitters: Yeah, what would you call this?

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.880
They didn't take us to get shot but they sure as hell left us to die!

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.400
Jensen: W-we don't know that...

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.080
they could come back.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.360
Smith: Their message didn't exactly specify.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.720
Palomo: They'll come back.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.040
I KNOW they'll come back

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.140
(gunshot)

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.560
Bitters: Nice shot

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.460
Palomo: Wasn't me.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.540
Felix: You shouldn't be so hard on the guys.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.540
They did what they thought was best.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.880
Can't fault 'em for that.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.160
Still.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.920
I'm going to beat the living shit out of those four when I find them.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.300
Smith: When you find them?

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.900
Felix: Tell Kimball I'm buying back one of the warthogs I sold her.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.940
Jensen: But Felix! She said we weren't allowed to go after them!

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.500
It was a DIRECT ORDER.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.380
Felix: Well orders only works on soldiers!

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.740
I am a mercenary.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.120
Simmons: This is it.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.580
According to our data, the federal army base is just on the other side of this wall.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.480
Tucker: About time!

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.600
My ass was asleep for so long i though it slipped into a coma!

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.320
Grif: So we're here...now what?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.660
Tucker: We bust our way in!

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.940
Anyone have any ideas?

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.320
Simmons: We could try scaling the wall.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.560
Tucker: Ehh, that's a little too obvious,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.620
think DUMBER.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.940
Grif: We could knock on their door.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.660
Tucker: TOO dumb.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.520
Grif: I was joking.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.760
Caboose: We could knock on their door.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.840
Grif: I just said that!

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.700
Caboose: Yeeeah, but you were joking...

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.200
I felt the plan deserved more serious consideration.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.240
Tucker: Hmmm....

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.740
how do you break into an evil ice fortress?

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.920
Caboose: You melt it!

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.600
Like evil ice cream!

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.520
Tucker: Holy. Shit.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.140
We MELT our way in!

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.420
Caboose: Wha- Wai- Rea- YES! I WIN!

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.120
Grif: WHAT.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.400
Tucker: We can't go through the wall, and going over is what most people would do

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.920
so lets just go UNDER it.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.820
Grif: That's retarded.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.140
Tucker: EXACTLY!

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.820
Damn...

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.540
I never thought I'd say this,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.000
I mean, EVER,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.400
seriously,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.660
but...good job Caboose!

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.300
Caboose: Yeah well i'm just really glad someone appreciates my genius...

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.480
now lets start MELTING!

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.380
*haaaah*

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.880
*inhale*

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.660
*haaaaah*

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.500
Tucker: Caboose you're wearing a helmet

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.640
that is not doing anything

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.640
Caboose: Okay well fine, then how do you explain my sudden light-headed

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.960
...nesss...

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.140
Tucker: what about friction?

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.980
All the ladies tell me I light a fire between their legs.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.800
Grif: That’s chlamydia.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.160
SImmons: Friction won’t work. It’s gotta be negative forty degrees Celsius out here.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.840
That’s negative forty degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840
Tucker: Jesus, that's cold!
Grif: That’s freezing!

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.620
Simmons: You people are idiots.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.280
Grif: Well say it in American next time.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.880
Tucker: Oh! I've got it!

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.040
STAB!

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.180
Simmons: Is it working?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.740
Grif: Aah!
*THUD*

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.260
Simmons: Ahh, it worked!

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.080
Grif: Where are we?!

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.320
Unnamed voice: Hey! What was that noise?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.900
Tucker: Oh shit, we’re inside!

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.120
Caboose: I think bad guys are coming!

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.080
Simmons: What do we do? What do we do?!

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.660
Tucker: I don’t know! I didn't think this far ahead!

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.440
Simmons: Damn it! This is why winging it is a bad idea! No more winging it!

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.960
Voice: I swear, I heard something just around the corner.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960
Grif: Let’s get out of here!

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.800
Tucker: There could be more guards! We’ll be caught!

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.160
Simmons: Well we gotta do something!

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.960
Voice: Just a few more feet and I’ll be there.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.720
Caboose: Tucker!

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.320
Voice: What the--?

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.920
Huh.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.360
Well would you look at that, just a couple of harmless snowmen.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.620
You guys wouldn’t happen to be the ones making all that racket now, would ya? Heh heh....

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.680
Well, time for some target practice

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.480
But

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.580
why, snowman?

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.040
*blergh*

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.320
Tucker: I cannot believe that worked.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.480
Grif: Uh, you're welcome.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.420
Tucker: How did you do that?

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.420
Grif: I used the same trick to hide from Sarge all the time back in Blood Gulch.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.620
Tucker: You constructed, and then hid inside of...a snowman.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.360
In the middle of a hot canyon

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.100
Simmons: Hey Sarge! I found him!

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.100
Grif: It wasn't always a perfect plan.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.200
Simmons: According to our intel

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.440
there’s not much standing between the end of this tunnel and the detention facility.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.400
Tucker: That’s awesome.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.100
Simmons: No

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.860
I mean, there’s literally NOTHING between us.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.780
We'll be spotted as soon as we leave the tunnel.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.200
Tucker: I don’t know, doesn't look like anyone's around to me.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.220
*Air horn*

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.480
Announcement: Alright, lunch break's over. Back to your stations, people.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.260
Soldier: Come on maggots, get the lead out! Move! Move! Move!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.380
Soldiers: Hut hut hut hut hut...

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.820
Soldier: Woo! Brand new tank, coming in! This will kill ANY intruders for sure!

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.700
Tucker: I hate my stupid mouth.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.500
Grif: I hate it more.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.400
Simmons: How are we gonna sneak past that?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.220
Tucker: We're not.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.940
Grif: Glad to hear you’re finally making sense, Tucker.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.040
Let’s go home. Good effort everybody!

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.560
We came, we saw, we realized it was impossible.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.920
no shame in that.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.260
Grif: Can’t help but realize we haven't left yet.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.000
Tucker: We can’t sneak past those guys

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
so instead, we're gonna make as much noise as possible.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
If we can cause enough trouble somewhere else

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.480
we can draw them away from the prison!

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.200
What do you guys think?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.140
Simmons: Well, it fits with the dumb ideas theme.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.140
Tucker: I think here if we fuck up these important looking pipes and then haul ass

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.520
we can make it into the building!

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.980
Grif: Ugh, we have to run?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.860
Tucker: We have to try.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.820
Worst case scenario,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.780
we end up in jail with everyone else and just wait for this whole civil war thing to blow over.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.440
Simmons: I think worst case scenario is getting shot.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.880
Or Grif getting shot and we have to carry him.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.460
There’s only three of us.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.960
Tucker: Fuck it.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.160
Caboose, do your thing.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.540
Caboose: Time to cleAN THE PIPES!

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.800
*Alarm*

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.120
Announcement: Alert. Catastrophic breach detected in sewage pipeline. Sector 3.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.420
Soldier: *Scoff* Sucks to be maintenance.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.620
Announcement: Warning. Sewage breach detected in the barracks.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.320
Soldiers: Oh shit! My stuff! Noooo!

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.540
Tucker: Now’s our chance, run!

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.240
Simmons: Here goes nothing!

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.080
Caboose: Let's race!

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.340
Grif: Uh Urghhh.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.140
Soldier: Come on guys, gotta save our shit!

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.820
From the SHIT!

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.420
*Distressed soldiers yelling*

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.120
Soldier: Jesus Christ! Last night was TACO NIGHT!

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.740
Caboose: Yeah, first place!

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.200
Grif: *Heavy breathing* Oh my god... I’m gonna die.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.200
I hope...I die.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.900
Tucker: Simmons, do something about this door!

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.560
Simmons: What do you mean?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.820
Tucker: It’s locked. Hack the door controls or something!

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.380
Simmons: What makes you think I can just hack a door?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.360
Tucker: You're the smart one!

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.840
All you're good for is hacking things, and making me look more handsome in comparison!

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.860
Simmons: I don't have any intel! I don't have any tools! I-I-I can’t just do it, I need time!

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.360
Grif: We don’t have time, genius! Just pretend like it’s a timed math test or something!

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.180
Simmons: I don’t work well under pressure!

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.200
You know that!

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.980
Tucker: Oh shit…

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.680
Wash: Tucker?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.440
Tucker: Wash?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.440
Sarge: What in sam hell are you boys doing here?

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.680
Simmons: We came to save you!

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.160
Donut: But, we were supposed to save YOU!

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.640
Caboose: BUM BUM Buuummmm……

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.860
CLIFFHANGER!

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.740
Caboose: Where am I?

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.200
Oh well that looks nice!

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.740
OH. MY. GOD!

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.240
A GIANT PERSON!
