00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.459
 Hello everyone after so long 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.410
 waiting here on rock brings strike 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.930
 effectively with three touches to the channel and 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.330
 It's a mission 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.330
 as I do not fit the yellow and such 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.300
 we started well is a 7.7 in obama 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 as small as the one you are seeing 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.660
 and good to comment that my mission 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.720
 in this game it will be to be the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.579
 first of all no longer win that comes out 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.640
 It is also the other, if not the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.640
 First 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.150
 what I do not know is why is it so so 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.150
 Quick 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.649
 look bad 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.170
 I'm recording and it's going faster than if 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.750
 yes yes I do not record amazing 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.259
 once the day before done another part 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.259
 Also here 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.030
 given the same and jeff is fighting 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.950
 with me but then I already won a lot and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.110
 good and then bring another game in this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.750
 map also because I do not have some others 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.480
 downloaded maps is that I have I have 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.350
 alphabets maps that have with the game 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.700
 and I will make a vision of those of only 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.159
 against the world 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.490
 something that does not do that I do not do very much 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.490
 of that 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.600
 good kid, stop knowing 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.550
 well I'm 42 I do not usually look at the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.550
 end of each round and during and all 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.579
 what you discover is true is that it's going 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 faster so 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.610
 and do not believe that it is better or nothing 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.950
 graffiti there is almost in your area 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.010
 good 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.980
 adepts 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.710
 but now we're left with the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.800
 machine gun be like this 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.310
 and it's a contraption is a kind of goal 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.310
 lightly 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.120
 good minus has killed another one more 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.200
 10 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.050
 he wins me from two casualties 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.959
 is the very exciting thing he knew see the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.180
 a long time ago it was not going up 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.099
 and good in the calendar I said 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.379
 would go up clear instead of black ops that 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.580
 one thing is very difficult to record new 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.739
 parts is also difficult to record 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.170
 because they give me a little more of their game if 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.060
 so now since it comes to me a lot 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.300
 better when cats has not charged to 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.300
 Youtube 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.489
 well almost all of me do not 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.489
 effectively there I am first 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.090
 let's also graffiti in your area haha 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.800
 but the gun took me another 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.800
 good lad 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.420
 Then, from behind, the bullets shout to the seas 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.850
 Discard the low envelope 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.890
 I am complete with success my goal 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.880
 the first you already know that you are winning the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.620
 heading that we go 81 I mean that 191 now 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.270
 and another thing is that the first one what 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.750
 I'm doing it but there's the thing 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.750
 warm 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.630
 once it goes to normal fast 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.870
 and notarios you but I'm going 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.060
 fast and one studying anything quick is 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.150
 I'm recording live 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.650
 so be not curious 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.650
 from here he has made many friends 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.170
 re -done the envelope I charge 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.750
 three triple low good good this is the 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.930
 enjoyed father 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.460
 what to get first is also going to be no 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.460
 it is clear that it will turn out 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.250
 changed by others 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.380
 that's how to get from behind 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.380
 care 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.930
 What a pity my life has to go forward 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.740
 has to go forward until the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.950
 shoot him that would have been better but 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.950
 good 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.920
 the fuck this one has more bullets than 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.900
 He says 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:34.180
 graffiti in your area 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:38.130
 is a 10 kilos load to win since 11 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.130
 lower than you and 3 fewer deaths 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.250
 and what penalties did one make 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.569
 second he charged it that second I charge 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.909
 this guy 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.880
 and then equal to these would have occurred 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.220
 time but good does not matter 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.780
 so nothing answers and you will have 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.630
 weekly gameplays 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.030
 to gazar 2 how will I try to play part 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.650
 then in the last room there was no place 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.960
 to bring once trained ring but 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.930
 well I'm not sorry 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.060
 but you will have in general bogart 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.110
 bales with teresa 'brings as warfare 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.360
 three crazy weekly good maybe you 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.230
 bring some day but pray for it to happen 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.220
 that 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.220
 and speaking to me 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.919
 with me on the team is that no 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.919
 There are those who do not win 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.880
 that's what they pay for this round 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:01.140
 and I almost had to be there back good 40 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:05.910
 26 has been devastated in fact look at know 21 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:07.680
 30 31 no but I've done an incredible the 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.160
 that less me times I die along with 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.110
 the most wild sometimes be killed so 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.860
 that nothing a greeting and until the next what 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.860
 that will serve is not such
