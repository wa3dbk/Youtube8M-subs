can tell the difference between the two

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.680 
can tell the difference between the two
colors<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:46.980> got<00:02:47.099> both<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.580> them<00:02:47.730> here

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
colors is if you got both of them here

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.380 
colors is if you got both of them here
at<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> same<00:02:49.110> time<00:02:49.879> it's<00:02:50.879> like<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.239> know

at the same time it's like you know
authentic<00:02:52.290> replica<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:53.489> see<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.730> like<00:02:53.849> a

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
authentic replica you see it like a

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.960 
authentic replica you see it like a
little<00:02:54.239> shine<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.069> low<00:02:56.250> dollar<00:02:56.489> but

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970
