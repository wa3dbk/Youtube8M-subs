going and going and that's exactly what

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.560 
going and going and that's exactly what
I<00:01:06.510> got<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.930> thickness<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.950> blade<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
I got the thickness of this blade is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.910 
I got the thickness of this blade is
very<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.080> put<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> lot<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.680> pressure

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
very good you can put a lot of pressure

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.120 
very good you can put a lot of pressure
on<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.880> also<00:01:12.090> pretty<00:01:12.420> thick<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
on it it's also pretty thick this way I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
on it it's also pretty thick this way I
think<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.610> about<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.790> tenth<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
think that's about just over a tenth of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.850 
think that's about just over a tenth of
an<00:01:18.659> inch<00:01:18.840> probably<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:20.090> I'll<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.860> ruler

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
an inch probably more I'll have a ruler

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.130 
an inch probably more I'll have a ruler
to<00:01:23.130> check<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.520> though<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.869> really

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to check it though so I was really

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.539 
to check it though so I was really
comfortable<00:01:25.320> being<00:01:25.799> able<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> lot<00:01:26.400> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
comfortable being able to put a lot of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.830 
comfortable being able to put a lot of
pressure<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.970> cut<00:01:27.119> through<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.420> stuff<00:01:27.630> tough

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
pressure to cut through some stuff tough

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
pressure to cut through some stuff tough
stuff<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.439> point<00:01:28.590> even<00:01:28.890> cut<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.250> hole<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909

stuff at one point even cut a hole and
some<00:01:30.240> plywood<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> could<00:01:32.250> run<00:01:32.909> some<00:01:33.150> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
some plywood so I could run some you

this down and if you look this is a

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.430 
this down and if you look this is a
locking<00:02:52.970> liner<00:02:53.180> obviously<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.230> puts<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:55.060> this

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440

little thing right here and what that
does<00:02:59.900> is<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.170> stops<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.580> blade<00:03:01.880> from

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
does is that stops the blade from

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.170 
does is that stops the blade from
closing<00:03:03.070> while<00:03:04.070> you're<00:03:04.280> using<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:04.850> got<00:03:05.060> to

highly recommend using the sheath that

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.140 
highly recommend using the sheath that

basically<00:04:13.250> my<00:04:13.400> review<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.180> this<00:04:14.690> knife<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.380> is

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
basically my review of this knife it is

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.800 
basically my review of this knife it is
a<00:04:15.850> very<00:04:16.850> good<00:04:17.090> knife<00:04:18.280> only<00:04:19.280> problem<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:20.030> I

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
a very good knife only problem that I

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.510 
a very good knife only problem that I
would<00:04:21.109> say<00:04:21.349> is<00:04:21.590> that<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:23.000> handles

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
would say is that the handles

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.950 
would say is that the handles
is<00:04:23.759> not<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.000> greatest<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.419> do<00:04:24.539> have<00:04:24.750> these

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
is not the greatest you do have these

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.140 
is not the greatest you do have these
ridges<00:04:25.889> right<00:04:26.099> here<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.639> can<00:04:26.759> get<00:04:26.849> a<00:04:26.910> grip

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
ridges right here so you can get a grip

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.659 
ridges right here so you can get a grip
with<00:04:27.180> your<00:04:27.389> forefinger<00:04:28.259> and<00:04:28.410> thumb<00:04:28.520> but<00:04:29.520> the

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
with your forefinger and thumb but the

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.969 
with your forefinger and thumb but the
rest<00:04:29.879> of<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.360> very<00:04:30.750> smooth<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.560> especially

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
rest of it is very smooth and especially

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.649 
rest of it is very smooth and especially
if<00:04:32.190> you're<00:04:32.310> wearing<00:04:32.400> gloves<00:04:32.580> which<00:04:33.180> we<00:04:33.419> have

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
if you're wearing gloves which we have

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.110 
if you're wearing gloves which we have
to<00:04:33.840> do<00:04:34.020> whenever<00:04:34.919> we're<00:04:35.220> climbing<00:04:35.789> up<00:04:35.909> in<00:04:36.030> a

ceiling<00:04:36.479> or<00:04:36.539> anything<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.229> does<00:04:38.180> doesn't<00:04:39.180> feel

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300

possibly have on the knife they could

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.029 
possibly have on the knife they could
have<00:04:43.050> done<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.169> little<00:04:43.409> bit<00:04:43.650> better<00:04:43.800> with<00:04:44.009> the

have done a little bit better with the
handle<00:04:44.520> but<00:04:44.759> they<00:04:45.509> were<00:04:45.569> in<00:04:46.050> addition<00:04:46.830> to

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
handle but they were in addition to

making<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.250> good<00:04:47.430> knife<00:04:47.610> they<00:04:47.789> were<00:04:47.849> also

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
making a good knife they were also

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.670 
making a good knife they were also
trying<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.539> stay<00:04:48.690> true<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.139> original<00:04:49.169> and

this<00:05:44.009> time<00:05:44.250> because<00:05:44.580> as<00:05:44.969> I<00:05:45.569> went<00:05:45.719> over<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:45.990> was

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
this time because as I went over I was

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.300 
this time because as I went over I was
using<00:05:46.469> this<00:05:46.590> knife<00:05:46.800> for<00:05:46.949> nine<00:05:47.130> months

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
using this knife for nine months

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.580 
using this knife for nine months
straight<00:05:47.580> in<00:05:48.330> Afghanistan<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.080> used<00:05:49.289> it<00:05:49.409> almost

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
straight in Afghanistan I used it almost

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.129 
straight in Afghanistan I used it almost
every<00:05:50.009> day<00:05:50.250> I<00:05:50.520> did<00:05:51.449> have<00:05:51.569> to<00:05:51.659> put<00:05:51.810> an<00:05:51.930> edge<00:05:52.080> on

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
every day I did have to put an edge on

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.350 
every day I did have to put an edge on
it<00:05:52.229> at<00:05:52.380> one<00:05:52.529> point<00:05:52.770> using<00:05:53.250> my<00:05:53.520> triangle<00:05:54.150> sharp

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
it at one point using my triangle sharp

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.200 
it at one point using my triangle sharp
maker<00:05:54.569> from<00:05:54.779> Spyderco<00:05:55.319> but<00:05:55.710> at<00:05:56.340> this<00:05:56.610> point<00:05:56.880> it

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
maker from Spyderco but at this point it

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.140 
maker from Spyderco but at this point it
is<00:05:57.319> extremely<00:05:58.319> dull<00:05:58.590> I've<00:05:59.159> used<00:05:59.490> it<00:05:59.639> a<00:05:59.699> lot<00:05:59.849> and

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
is extremely dull I've used it a lot and

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.990 
is extremely dull I've used it a lot and
it<00:06:00.750> would<00:06:00.960> be<00:06:01.139> a<00:06:01.469> disservice<00:06:02.069> to<00:06:02.279> try<00:06:02.729> to<00:06:02.789> show

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
it would be a disservice to try to show

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.899 
it would be a disservice to try to show
how<00:06:03.779> sharp<00:06:04.139> it<00:06:04.289> is<00:06:04.380> because<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:05.250> been<00:06:05.490> used<00:06:05.759> a

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
how sharp it is because it's been used a

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.939 
how sharp it is because it's been used a
lot<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.389> that<00:06:06.569> would<00:06:06.719> just<00:06:06.750> be<00:06:06.949> completely

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
lot and that would just be completely

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.279 
lot and that would just be completely
out<00:06:08.520> of<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.729> point<00:06:09.029> even<00:06:09.539> if<00:06:09.630> I<00:06:09.690> did<00:06:09.900> sharpen

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
out of the point even if I did sharpen

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.540 
out of the point even if I did sharpen
it<00:06:10.349> I<00:06:10.380> saw<00:06:10.560> one<00:06:10.770> because<00:06:11.039> it<00:06:11.130> wouldn't<00:06:11.370> show

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
it I saw one because it wouldn't show

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.760 
it I saw one because it wouldn't show
the<00:06:11.969> edge<00:06:12.150> that<00:06:12.719> verb<00:06:12.960> reporter<00:06:13.319> wanted<00:06:13.500> what

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
the edge that verb reporter wanted what

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.990 
the edge that verb reporter wanted what
she<00:06:13.800> got<00:06:14.009> to<00:06:14.130> take<00:06:14.250> my<00:06:14.340> word<00:06:14.370> for<00:06:14.520> it<00:06:14.789> was<00:06:14.969> a

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
she got to take my word for it was a

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.600 
she got to take my word for it was a
great<00:06:15.330> edge<00:06:15.860> it<00:06:16.860> would<00:06:16.949> just<00:06:17.159> show<00:06:17.279> the<00:06:17.490> edge

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
great edge it would just show the edge

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.089 
great edge it would just show the edge
that<00:06:17.789> I<00:06:17.880> put<00:06:18.150> on<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.449> and<00:06:18.630> be<00:06:19.289> more<00:06:19.469> view<00:06:19.919> of

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
that I put on it and be more view of

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.550 
that I put on it and be more view of
both<00:06:21.029> my<00:06:21.300> sharpening<00:06:21.719> skills<00:06:22.020> and<00:06:22.289> how<00:06:22.349> good

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
both my sharpening skills and how good

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.890 
both my sharpening skills and how good
my<00:06:22.740> triangle<00:06:23.400> sharpener<00:06:23.759> is<00:06:24.029> what<00:06:24.330> I'm

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
my triangle sharpener is what I'm

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.379 
my triangle sharpener is what I'm
probably<00:06:25.169> do<00:06:25.259> a<00:06:25.289> review<00:06:25.560> of<00:06:25.650> that<00:06:25.680> too<00:06:25.979> but

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
probably do a review of that too but

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.080 
probably do a review of that too but
