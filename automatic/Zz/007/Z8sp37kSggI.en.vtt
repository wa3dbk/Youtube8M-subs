I<00:01:21.479> think<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.540> show<00:01:22.720> isn't<00:01:22.899> just<00:01:23.049> about

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
I think the show isn't just about

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.080 
I think the show isn't just about
dancing<00:01:23.770> there's<00:01:24.159> so<00:01:24.310> much<00:01:24.369> more<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:25.000> you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
dancing there's so much more to it you

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.340 
dancing there's so much more to it you
know<00:01:25.180> we've<00:01:25.390> learned<00:01:25.600> in<00:01:25.720> past<00:01:25.899> experiences

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
know we've learned in past experiences

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.260 
know we've learned in past experiences
that<00:01:26.530> you<00:01:27.100> know<00:01:27.220> sometimes<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:28.000> more

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
that you know sometimes the more

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.420 
that you know sometimes the more
experienced<00:01:28.600> dancers<00:01:28.720> haven't<00:01:29.229> won<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:30.310> know

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
experienced dancers haven't won you know

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.899 
experienced dancers haven't won you know
Mario<00:01:30.729> Lopez<00:01:31.210> Maya<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.710> think<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.159> in

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
Mario Lopez Maya and I think that in

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.460 
Mario Lopez Maya and I think that in
that<00:01:33.970> sense<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:34.720> could<00:01:34.810> almost<00:01:34.960> look<00:01:35.170> at<00:01:35.259> as<00:01:35.439> a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
that sense you could almost look at as a

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.260 
that sense you could almost look at as a
disadvantage<00:01:36.009> because<00:01:36.189> you<00:01:36.520> know<00:01:36.670> it's

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
disadvantage because you know it's

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.120 
disadvantage because you know it's
really<00:01:37.390> up<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.659> keep<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.960> public<00:01:38.439> vote<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.920> if

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
really up to keep the public vote and if

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.830 
really up to keep the public vote and if
the<00:01:39.220> public<00:01:39.460> vote<00:01:39.610> don't<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.420> know<00:01:40.539> it<00:01:40.689> dear

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
the public vote don't you know it dear

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.300 
the public vote don't you know it dear
to<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.140> then<00:01:41.380> if<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.009> don't<00:01:42.070> must<00:01:42.220> be

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
to that then if you don't must be

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.560 
to that then if you don't must be
disadvantaged<00:01:42.850> if<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:43.090> look<00:01:43.240> at<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.360> that<00:01:43.450> way

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
disadvantaged if you look at it that way

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.450 
disadvantaged if you look at it that way
so<00:01:43.929> you<00:01:44.170> never<00:01:44.259> know<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.710> think<00:01:45.100> right<00:01:45.250> now<00:01:45.399> the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
so you never know I think right now the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.330 
so you never know I think right now the
biggest<00:01:45.759> competition<00:01:46.299> is<00:01:46.420> uh<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:48.100> know<00:01:48.220> is
