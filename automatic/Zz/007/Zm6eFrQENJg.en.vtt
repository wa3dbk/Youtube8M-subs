00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that lived in the oceans were probably

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.679 
that lived in the oceans were probably
very<00:01:09.900> very<00:01:10.470> big<00:01:10.710> perhaps<00:01:11.250> 80<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.729> 100<00:01:12.150> feet<00:01:12.180> in

very very big perhaps 80 or 100 feet in
length<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:14.010> why<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.610> don't

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
length you know why is it that we don't

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.660 
length you know why is it that we don't
find<00:01:14.939> any<00:01:15.119> fossils<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.900> sharks<00:01:16.530> well<00:01:17.280> exactly

find any fossils of sharks well exactly

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.969 
find any fossils of sharks well exactly
for<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> reason<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
for the reason that that that is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
today of course in this in the form of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
today of course in this in the form of
sharks<00:01:41.729> had<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.570> very<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:43.020> primitive<00:01:43.259> form

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
sharks had this very very primitive form

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.730 
sharks had this very very primitive form
of<00:01:43.829> bone<00:01:44.310> structure<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> turtle<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
of bone structure but like the turtle it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.460 
of bone structure but like the turtle it
seems<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> ultimate<00:01:47.850> design<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
seems to be the ultimate design and and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
seems to be the ultimate design and and
so<00:01:49.680> there's<00:01:49.860> been<00:01:50.040> never<00:01:50.280> any<00:01:50.490> reason<00:01:51.030> for

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so there's been never any reason for

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.600 
so there's been never any reason for
nature<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.659> see<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.290> change<00:01:52.590> well<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
nature to see that it change well you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.789 
nature to see that it change well you
know<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.119> shark<00:01:54.659> sore<00:01:54.899> something<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.439> we

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
know I'm a shark sore something that we

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.410 
know I'm a shark sore something that we
we<00:01:56.070> don't<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.369> much<00:01:56.670> about<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.360> we

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
we don't know that much about and we

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090 
we don't know that much about and we
really<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:57.810> know<00:01:57.990> how<00:01:58.140> old<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:59.070> are

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
really don't know how old they are

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.590 
really don't know how old they are
either<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.790> any<00:01:59.909> idea<00:02:00.240> how<00:02:00.420> long

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
either do you have any idea how long

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.819 
either do you have any idea how long
sharks<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.170> been<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.500> they've<00:02:01.799> been

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
sharks have been here they've been

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.260 
sharks have been here they've been
around<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.369> millions<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.880> millions<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
around for millions and millions of

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.060 
around for millions and millions of
years<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.810> your<00:02:04.020> turtle<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.770> they

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
years just like your turtle because they

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
years just like your turtle because they
are<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> ultimate<00:02:05.640> form<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:06.180> design

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
are the ultimate form of design

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
are the ultimate form of design
they've<00:02:07.920> been<00:02:08.070> around<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.490> millions<00:02:08.520> and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
they've been around for millions and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.760 
they've been around for millions and
millions<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.649> must

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
millions of you you know we must

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.650 
millions of you you know we must
remember<00:02:11.070> that<00:02:11.220> over<00:02:11.700> two-thirds<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
remember that over two-thirds of the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.690 
remember that over two-thirds of the
Earth's<00:02:13.170> surface<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:14.100> covered<00:02:14.340> with<00:02:14.520> water

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
Earth's surface is covered with water

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.870 
Earth's surface is covered with water
and<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:16.260> amount<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.740> land<00:02:17.010> that's<00:02:17.730> available

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and the amount of land that's available

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.870 
and the amount of land that's available
is<00:02:18.570> very<00:02:18.840> precious<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.650> us<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.520> should<00:02:20.700> try

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
is very precious to us so we should try

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.940 
is very precious to us so we should try
to<00:02:21.000> take<00:02:21.270> very<00:02:21.960> good<00:02:22.260> care<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.620> it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
to take very good care of it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.130 
to take very good care of it
and<00:02:23.070> one<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.090> things<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.570> would<00:02:24.990> like

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
and one of the things that I would like

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.640 
and one of the things that I would like
to<00:02:25.350> mention<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.940> while<00:02:27.720> ago<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.230> had

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
to mention now is that a while ago I had

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.700 
to mention now is that a while ago I had
a<00:02:28.680> chance<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.430> out<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.940> Warner<00:02:30.930> Alberta<00:02:31.350> and

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
a chance to go out to Warner Alberta and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.040 
a chance to go out to Warner Alberta and
there<00:02:32.130> was<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> recent<00:02:32.790> discovery<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.570> about

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
there was a recent discovery there about

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.070 
there was a recent discovery there about
not<00:02:34.740> only<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.850> know<00:02:35.970> just<00:02:36.209> more<00:02:36.420> dinosaurs

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
not only you know just more dinosaurs

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.540 
not only you know just more dinosaurs
but<00:02:37.530> they<00:02:37.740> found<00:02:38.130> an<00:02:38.520> area<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.480> kind<00:02:40.230> of

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
but they found an area that kind of

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.400 
but they found an area that kind of
proved<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.760> maybe<00:02:41.970> dinosaurs<00:02:42.600> were<00:02:42.810> nesters

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
proved that maybe dinosaurs were nesters

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.170 
proved that maybe dinosaurs were nesters
now<00:02:43.860> what<00:02:44.010> I'd<00:02:44.100> like<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.550> right<00:02:44.730> now<00:02:44.790> is
