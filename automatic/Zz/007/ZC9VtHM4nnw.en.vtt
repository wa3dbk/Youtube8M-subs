missed some varnish you get little bits

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.300 
missed some varnish you get little bits
of<00:01:29.130> shiny<00:01:29.400> spots<00:01:29.930> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.220> bit

of shiny spots if you have a little bit

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.190 
of shiny spots if you have a little bit
it's<00:01:32.430> not<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> big<00:01:32.820> deal<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> lot<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it's not a big deal if you have a lot it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800 
it's not a big deal if you have a lot it
is<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> big<00:01:34.560> deal<00:01:35.119> like<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> back<00:01:36.479> there

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
is a big deal like in the back there

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.370 
is a big deal like in the back there
we'll<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:38.400> here<00:01:38.900> lots<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> shininess

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
we'll see right here lots of shininess

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.719 
we'll see right here lots of shininess
there<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.400> stripped

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
there so that's going to be stripped

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.289 
there so that's going to be stripped
again<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.860> gives<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.159> some<00:01:44.340> idea<00:01:44.369> and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
again so that gives you some idea and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
again so that gives you some idea and
this<00:01:45.630> stage<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.979> some<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> these

this stage to you know some of these

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.710 
this stage to you know some of these
cabinets<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:48.000> been<00:01:48.090> reglued<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.630> the

cabinets have been reglued in the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.260 
cabinets have been reglued in the
corners<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.530> reglue<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.670> seam<00:01:50.970> here

said you glue is in here okay so let's
look<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> final<00:02:57.600> product<00:02:57.959> this

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
look at this to the final product this

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.500 
look at this to the final product this
is<00:02:58.319> what<00:02:58.500> we're<00:02:58.620> shooting<00:02:58.650> for<00:02:58.950> here<00:02:59.250> gosh

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
okay you can see that the actual

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.289 
okay you can see that the actual
surfaces<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.519> still<00:03:02.790> little<00:03:02.970> bit<00:03:03.209> of

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
surfaces is still little bit of

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.420 
surfaces is still little bit of
roughness<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.319> said<00:03:04.530> again<00:03:04.769> because<00:03:05.130> of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
roughness and I said again because of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.460 
roughness and I said again because of
what<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> was<00:03:06.360> doing<00:03:06.660> wrong<00:03:06.870> with<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.200> actual

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
what I was doing wrong with the actual

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.360 
what I was doing wrong with the actual
varnish<00:03:07.920> actually<00:03:08.840> what<00:03:09.840> i<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.140> do<00:03:10.349> is<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:11.250> a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
varnish actually what i can do is in a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.880 
varnish actually what i can do is in a
future<00:03:11.880> video<00:03:12.030> show<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.599> exactly<00:03:13.470> what<00:03:13.650> i<00:03:13.709> did

some abnormalities here like right here
that's<00:03:29.790> easy<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.540> fix<00:03:30.769> what<00:03:31.769> we<00:03:31.890> will<00:03:32.069> do<00:03:32.190> is

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
that's easy to fix what we will do is

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.849 
that's easy to fix what we will do is
will<00:03:32.430> take<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.640> little<00:03:32.790> bit<00:03:32.910> of<00:03:33.000> stain<00:03:33.329> on<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.859> on

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
will take a little bit of stain on a on

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.789 
will take a little bit of stain on a on
a<00:03:34.920> rag<00:03:35.690> soaked<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.840> stand<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.290> there<00:03:37.470> for<00:03:37.769> a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
with sandpaper just with that rag like

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
with a lint-free rag and it'll pull the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.080 
with a lint-free rag and it'll pull the
excess<00:03:45.269> stain<00:03:45.540> out<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.780> salmon<00:03:46.230> here<00:03:46.940> Sam<00:03:47.940> in

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
excess stain out of salmon here Sam in

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.090 
excess stain out of salmon here Sam in
here<00:03:48.389> so<00:03:48.989> this<00:03:49.260> little<00:03:49.380> bit<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.620> excess<00:03:49.889> name

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
here so this little bit of excess name

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.129 
here so this little bit of excess name
of<00:03:50.220> that's<00:03:50.340> okay<00:03:50.549> but<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.480> practically

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
of that's okay but this is practically

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.870 
of that's okay but this is practically
ready<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.799> be<00:03:54.560> varnished<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.950> little<00:03:56.730> bit<00:03:56.819> of

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
ready to be varnished a little bit of

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.960 
ready to be varnished a little bit of
refuge<00:03:57.209> on<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.480> surface<00:03:57.810> here<00:03:58.519> for<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.670> I

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
refuge on the surface here for that I

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.650 
refuge on the surface here for that I
could<00:04:00.510> take<00:04:00.829> to<00:04:01.829> avoid<00:04:01.950> sandpaper<00:04:02.730> like<00:04:03.630> a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
could take to avoid sandpaper like a

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.460 
could take to avoid sandpaper like a
plastic<00:04:05.090> scrapie<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.269> mentioned<00:04:07.230> in<00:04:07.319> one<00:04:07.350> of

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
plastic scrapie I mentioned in one of

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.099 
plastic scrapie I mentioned in one of
the<00:04:07.590> articles<00:04:07.730> using<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.480> plastic<00:04:09.900> pot

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
the articles using the the plastic pot

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.110 
the articles using the the plastic pot
scrubbers<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:11.280> don't<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.670> any<00:04:11.819> abrasive

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
scrubbers that don't have any abrasive

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.330 
scrubbers that don't have any abrasive
grit<00:04:12.420> in<00:04:12.569> them<00:04:12.720> they're<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:13.650> abrasive

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
grit in them they're just abrasive

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.860 
grit in them they're just abrasive
enough<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.850> doesn't<00:04:14.880> really<00:04:15.329> change<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
enough that it doesn't really change the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.229 
enough that it doesn't really change the
texture<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.289> the<00:04:16.380> wood<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:17.060> would<00:04:18.060> probably

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
texture of the wood I would probably

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.790 
texture of the wood I would probably
akin<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.780> using<00:04:19.320> like<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.389> 600<00:04:21.389> grit<00:04:21.800> sandpaper

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
akin to using like a 600 grit sandpaper

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.130 
akin to using like a 600 grit sandpaper
that's<00:04:23.220> how<00:04:23.370> but<00:04:23.970> its<00:04:24.330> aggressive<00:04:24.840> enough

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
that's how but its aggressive enough

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.990 
that's how but its aggressive enough
that<00:04:25.349> you<00:04:26.250> can

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
that a surface a bit ok now it's really

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.140 
that a surface a bit ok now it's really
nice<00:04:30.920> you<00:04:31.920> can<00:04:32.100> see<00:04:32.220> how<00:04:32.310> standing<00:04:32.790> this<00:04:32.940> side
