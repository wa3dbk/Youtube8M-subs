00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:31.009
 focus much health much photoshop is a 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.720
 little roll the truth if you simply 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.110
 I'm being this more than anything because I do not 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.630
 I have work, what do I look for because 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.509
 18 years since I matriculated in 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.040
 university and I have this year should 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.760
 finish the communication career 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.710
 audiovisual 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.140
 only doctor deliver the work of order 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.680
 of career 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.030
 which took less than half in fact 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.030
 and I have to present it in a month 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.610
 and what do I do here talking to you without 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.710
 to do the good the truth is that it is that 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.330
 this motivates me a lot more than work 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.740
 end of career is a mere procedure for 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.480
 have a degree and nothing since I studied 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.710
 audiovisual communication 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.290
 I was working as an intern3 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.110
 then wow on fellowship antenna3 yes 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.510
 well I was there on the page of the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.340
 website more than anything was in the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.070
 zero wave section that belongs to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.990
 antenna3 and well then I was there 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.730
 I met famous people I was with nadal 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.440
 that day that was antena3 and all the 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.620
 roll was entertaining but 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.100
 clear as all the fellows spend 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.100
 three months 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.400
 door and that step look for another fellow and 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.040
 is already taking a marketing intern and 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.180
 as well as in the mouth and nothing because I stayed 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.790
 without curro 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.750
 with nothing to do but try 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.000
 study something else and that's why I'm here 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.180
 something that I'm not liking too much 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.129
 yes if I could leave it right now what 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.680
 I left but it's better than being in 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.739
 home I'll have to do something and well 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.930
 new in the afternoon because in try 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.220
 earn a little money with something that yes 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.680
 like 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.130
 what is basketball I'm a coach 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.300
 basketball I have official title and 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.030
 I train children in the afternoon here in san 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.500
 sebastián de los reyes and in alcobendas 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.990
 in san sebastián de los reyes I have a 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.720
 The gentle galvan school that was my school 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.220
 and that now that it was where I learned to 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.730
 play basketball and now I wear it 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.420
 I am very excited about the truth 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.610
 and nothing because I have a children's school 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.830
 I teach them from scratch from the inputs 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.090
 do until all the little things that 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.700
 you learn when you can not play 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.330
 basketball 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.540
 I have boys and girls since 3rd grade of primary school 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.200
 up to 6º 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:01.099
 and I have a great time with them and then 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.219
 alcobendas I have two teams 21 of 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.409
 small also small primary school in 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.120
 which also come boys and girls 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.250
 mixed and the same as in the tender 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.420
 but in another school and then I have one 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.780
 which is the most motivating that is a 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.820
 children are 13 years old the kids 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.859
 in which we compete here in Madrid 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.630
 we are first and we have passed the 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.220
 quarterfinals of the playoffs that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.520
 we play this Saturday by the way to see what 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.349
 happens and then I moved a lot more 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.880
 with the little girl until the roll is a lot 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.590
 more fun ah I like it more than the 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.180
 small but also small 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.150
 are other things that do not have the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.710
 big and nothing because that's what 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.680
 I do in the afternoon now in a 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.110
 I'll have to go to the little ones and 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.660
 well from Monday to Sunday because in addition 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.000
 apart at night at 9 o'clock in the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.289
 night in game I train myself in the lord 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.699
 from here a school here we are already 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.950
 all retired because I was before 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.350
 well now 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.730
 there we are little by little doing what 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.740
 you can more than anything to do something 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.210
 sport and not lose the hook because it is 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.450
 that if I do not die without which basketball 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.820
 damage and nothing is there and we train by 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.440
 the nights of 9 to 11 and the weekends of 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.480
 week match as expected 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.340
 that so in the end he finished basketball 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.240
 in the evenings 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.750
 complete and nothing good, little more than that 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.670

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.380
