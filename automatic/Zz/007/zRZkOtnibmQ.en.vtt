00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
that is it's a lot cheaper to buy that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.280 
that is it's a lot cheaper to buy that

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
can find them and I think if I didn't

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.620 
can find them and I think if I didn't
say<00:03:03.800> already<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.160> think<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:04.940> stove<00:03:05.210> will<00:03:05.450> heat

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630

if I remember right a 2,500 foot home

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.470 
if I remember right a 2,500 foot home
they<00:03:09.890> really<00:03:10.370> throw<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.640> tremendous<00:03:11.120> amount<00:03:11.330> of

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
they really throw a tremendous amount of

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.670 
they really throw a tremendous amount of
heat<00:03:11.630> more<00:03:11.900> than<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.230> would<00:03:12.320> think<00:03:12.560> they

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
heat more than you would think they

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.860 
heat more than you would think they
would<00:03:12.890> for<00:03:13.070> their<00:03:13.190> size<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:13.850> have<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.750> ever

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870
