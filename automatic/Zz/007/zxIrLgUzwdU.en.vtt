 Click here to introduce today 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 d digital torque wrench 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.750
 We introduce types of registration measurement range of 20 to 200 Newton 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.289
 Set the measurement town of today's registration 30 Newton 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.590
 Next set the alarm for the alarm sound 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.970

 This warning alarm is 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.090
 For measured value 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.390
 Warning sound from around 25% 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.520
 It will inform you that it is approaching the measured value

 Because today's measurement value is 30 newtons 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.730
 Set the sounds from around exceeding the 22.5 Newton 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.730
 Let's set it up 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.940

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.370
 Please press the button 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.789
