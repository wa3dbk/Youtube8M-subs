Queen takes on at six King to f8 and
there<00:05:16.380> is<00:05:16.530> checkmate<00:05:17.310> in<00:05:17.970> one<00:05:18.240> can<00:05:18.960> see<00:05:19.200> it

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
there is checkmate in one can see it

Bishop<00:05:21.780> 286<00:05:23.210> checkmate<00:05:24.320> they<00:05:25.320> say<00:05:26.030> if<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.180> see

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210

Bishop 286 checkmate they say if you see
a<00:05:27.570> good<00:05:27.870> move

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
a good move

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.950 
a good move
think<00:05:30.750> again<00:05:31.290> maybe<00:05:31.830> there<00:05:32.730> is<00:05:32.850> even<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.420> better

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
think again maybe there is even a better

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.700 
think again maybe there is even a better
move<00:05:34.310> so<00:05:35.310> this<00:05:35.700> may<00:05:35.970> be<00:05:36.030> a<00:05:36.120> good<00:05:36.360> move<00:05:36.570> but<00:05:37.440> this

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
move so this may be a good move but this

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.870 
move so this may be a good move but this
is<00:05:37.920> certainly<00:05:38.340> a<00:05:38.910> better<00:05:39.540> one<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.760> is

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
is certainly a better one and that is

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.120 
is certainly a better one and that is
