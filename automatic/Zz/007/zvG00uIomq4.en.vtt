00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
putting this down that water also helps

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.230 
putting this down that water also helps
that<00:02:17.450> tissue<00:02:17.720> curve<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:19.220> tissue<00:02:19.550> forms<00:02:20.150> a

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
that tissue curve that tissue forms a

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.990 
that tissue curve that tissue forms a
lot<00:02:20.420> better<00:02:20.660> when<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.110> little<00:02:21.319> bit<00:02:21.440> wet

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
lot better when it's a little bit wet

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000 
lot better when it's a little bit wet
this<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.330> dry<00:02:23.570> technique<00:02:24.170> with<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> glue

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
this is the dry technique with a glue

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.970 
this is the dry technique with a glue
stick<00:02:28.930> there's<00:02:29.930> lots<00:02:30.320> of<00:02:30.470> different<00:02:30.830> ways<00:02:30.950> to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
stick there's lots of different ways to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.720 
stick there's lots of different ways to
cover<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:32.470> haven't<00:02:33.470> quite<00:02:33.980> learned<00:02:34.040> how<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.459> do

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
cover I haven't quite learned how to do

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.280 
cover I haven't quite learned how to do
that<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.120> might<00:02:35.270> have<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.540> slice<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.080> right

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
that you might have to slice that right

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.350 
that you might have to slice that right
there<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.590> corner<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.069> get<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.310> over<00:02:37.550> so

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
there in the corner to get it over so

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:50.250 
there in the corner to get it over so
you<00:02:38.450> get<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.050> wrinkle<00:02:41.440> there<00:02:42.440> yeah

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.460 

there<00:02:50.739> we<00:02:50.920> go<00:02:51.659> I'm<00:02:52.659> I<00:02:52.840> wanna<00:02:53.080> do<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.349> other

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
there we go I'm I wanna do the other

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.119 
there we go I'm I wanna do the other
side<00:02:53.769> too

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
side too

here too as well yep and try to push it
down<00:03:16.360> a<00:03:16.390> little<00:03:16.720> bit<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.670> order<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.790> get<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
down a little bit to order to get the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.990 
down a little bit to order to get the
form<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.860> get<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.190> glue<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.880> stick

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
form of it and to get the glue to stick

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.940 
form of it and to get the glue to stick
on<00:03:22.450> here<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.110> little<00:03:23.560> more<00:03:23.739> one<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:26.230> yet<00:03:26.560> one

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
on here a little more one and yet one

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
more and yet again you want to use a

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.610 
more and yet again you want to use a
little<00:03:29.530> bit<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.800> water<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:31.170> keep<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:32.319> straight

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
little bit of water to keep it straight

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:49.059 
little bit of water to keep it straight
down<00:03:34.830> for<00:03:35.830> it<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.190> form

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.670 

this<00:03:49.640> like<00:03:49.909> this<00:03:50.209> tissue<00:03:50.659> right<00:03:50.989> here<00:03:51.049> I<00:03:51.319> got

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
this like this tissue right here I got

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.640 
this like this tissue right here I got
is<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.920> little<00:03:52.159> tricky<00:03:52.999> for<00:03:53.329> me<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.689> force<00:03:54.290> stick

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
is a little tricky for me to force stick

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:13.150 
is a little tricky for me to force stick
on<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:59.269> right<00:03:59.900> here

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.430 

yeah

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.370 

you're<00:04:17.950> doing<00:04:18.250> fine<00:04:18.810> when<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:19.900> shrink<00:04:20.110> it<00:04:20.350> a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
you're doing fine when you shrink it a

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.720 
you're doing fine when you shrink it a
lot<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.680> them<00:04:20.800> little<00:04:21.010> wrinkles<00:04:21.430> will<00:04:21.520> go<00:04:21.550> away

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
lot of them little wrinkles will go away

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.010 
lot of them little wrinkles will go away
yeah<00:04:22.420> this<00:04:23.200> yes<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.220> again<00:04:24.610> this<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.150> part<00:04:25.870> of

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
yeah this yes and again this is part of

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.750 
yeah this yes and again this is part of
one<00:04:26.230> of<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.410> most<00:04:26.530> trickiest<00:04:26.980> parts<00:04:27.400> when<00:04:27.670> it

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
one of the most trickiest parts when it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.910 
one of the most trickiest parts when it
comes<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.210> putting<00:04:28.420> a<00:04:28.720> tissue<00:04:29.590> on<00:04:29.890> your

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
comes to putting a tissue on your

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.510 
comes to putting a tissue on your
airplane<00:04:30.550> is<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:32.470> think<00:04:33.160> it's<00:04:33.280> gonna<00:04:33.430> work

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
airplane is that I think it's gonna work

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.430 
airplane is that I think it's gonna work
out<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:34.060> bomb<00:04:34.360> though<00:04:34.690> when<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.110> comes<00:04:35.290> to

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
out this bomb though when it comes to

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.350 
out this bomb though when it comes to
doing<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.770> round<00:04:36.010> parts<00:04:36.430> right<00:04:36.640> here<00:04:36.970> it's<00:04:37.210> a

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
doing the round parts right here it's a

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.710 
doing the round parts right here it's a
little<00:04:37.630> tricky<00:04:37.960> they're<00:04:38.320> always<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.770> hardest

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
little tricky they're always the hardest

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.650 
little tricky they're always the hardest
I'm<00:04:40.720> gonna<00:04:40.900> try<00:04:42.270> stretching<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.390> out<00:04:43.450> a

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
I'm gonna try stretching that out a

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.510 
I'm gonna try stretching that out a
little<00:04:43.990> bit<00:04:44.230> it's<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.560> little<00:04:44.590> hard<00:04:45.100> for<00:04:45.160> me<00:04:45.400> to

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
little bit it's a little hard for me to

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.620 
little bit it's a little hard for me to
get<00:04:45.670> over<00:04:45.700> here<00:04:46.390> because<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:48.730> low<00:04:49.240> pieces

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
get over here because of the low pieces

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.800 
get over here because of the low pieces
ooh<00:04:49.750> isn't<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.680> way<00:04:50.800> yeah<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.460> plus<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.480> got<00:04:52.660> it

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
ooh isn't the way yeah and plus I got it

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.980 
ooh isn't the way yeah and plus I got it
and<00:04:52.960> plus<00:04:53.170> later<00:04:53.680> I'm<00:04:53.950> gonna<00:04:54.100> put<00:04:54.340> these<00:04:54.640> uh

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
and plus later I'm gonna put these uh

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.110 
and plus later I'm gonna put these uh
these<00:04:55.990> windows<00:04:56.530> right<00:04:56.800> here<00:04:56.830> in<00:04:57.370> them<00:04:57.520> which

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
these windows right here in them which

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.140 
these windows right here in them which
is<00:04:58.270> gonna<00:04:58.420> be<00:04:58.510> really<00:04:59.140> tricky<00:04:59.380> but<00:05:00.150> hopefully

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
is gonna be really tricky but hopefully

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.270 
is gonna be really tricky but hopefully
I'll<00:05:01.330> be<00:05:01.360> able<00:05:01.630> to<00:05:01.780> put<00:05:02.050> a<00:05:02.080> video<00:05:02.350> on<00:05:02.770> here<00:05:03.040> on

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
I'll be able to put a video on here on

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.220 
I'll be able to put a video on here on
how<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.580> get<00:05:03.940> you<00:05:04.120> on<00:05:04.270> how<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.480> show<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:04.870> how<00:05:05.170> to

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
how to get you on how to show you how to
