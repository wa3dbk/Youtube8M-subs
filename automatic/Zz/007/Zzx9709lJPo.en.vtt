00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:20.039
 madagascar 3 wanted in bluray 2d 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.150
 3d and with the wig the controversial edition of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.619
 wig 11 and today how you can 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.189
 editing is controversial because I made a post 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 about this release a while ago the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.750
 jc and so I was misinterpreted not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.120
 it looks like I was disapproving editing 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 in fact I was just criticizing that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.489
 we have these gifts to children right 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 it's clearly children's toys 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:50.430
 including free child passport for 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.750
 the beto back row also size 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 unique for children and appeared there as 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.960
 I would interpret everything I had 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.680
 writing that he was criticizing this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.109
 launch 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.250
 on the contrary i was praising 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.140
 children's launches but did not want to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.680
 Also, adult releases in Brazil are 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 that Brazilians are very childish 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.080
 sometimes 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.780
 most of the time saying it best and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.549
 are rare editions that really have 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.060
 adults but we will see then how 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.280

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:56.130
 United States is a similar box 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:02:00.119
 the one that comes to open the packaging and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.060
