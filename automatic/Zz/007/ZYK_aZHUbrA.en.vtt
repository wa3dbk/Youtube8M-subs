00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
quickly how to build this this is what

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.040 
quickly how to build this this is what
the<00:00:47.680> standard<00:00:47.920> kit<00:00:48.340> comes<00:00:48.640> with<00:00:48.760> they<00:00:49.750> mostly

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.480 
drill the nail through they'll run a
wire<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.660> have<00:04:43.169> no<00:04:43.380> wax<00:04:43.710> there<00:04:44.010> then<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.310> bees

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
wire and have no wax there then the bees

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.159 
wire and have no wax there then the bees
just<00:04:44.669> build<00:04:44.910> off<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.120> but<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:45.870> gives<00:04:46.050> them

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
just build off that but this gives them

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.750 
just build off that but this gives them
a<00:04:46.290> head<00:04:46.410> started<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.950> mean<00:04:47.130> they're<00:04:47.370> there<00:04:47.729> you

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
a head started I mean they're there you

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.310 
a head started I mean they're there you
got<00:04:48.000> most<00:04:48.419> of<00:04:48.510> their<00:04:48.600> comb<00:04:48.780> are<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:48.990> fell<00:04:49.140> for

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
got most of their comb are you fell for

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.140 
got most of their comb are you fell for
them<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:50.280> we're<00:04:50.580> hoping<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:50.790> get<00:04:50.880> some<00:04:51.060> honey

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
them so we're hoping to get some honey

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.960 
them so we're hoping to get some honey
quick<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:52.710> here<00:04:53.250> I'll<00:04:53.340> show<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:53.790> is

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
quick and here I'll show you this is

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.430 
quick and here I'll show you this is
what<00:04:54.120> we've<00:04:54.240> been<00:04:54.300> working<00:04:54.479> on<00:04:54.750> for<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.350> past

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
what we've been working on for the past

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.440 
what we've been working on for the past
few<00:04:55.830> days<00:04:56.010> we<00:04:56.640> built<00:04:56.880> this<00:04:57.000> thing<00:04:57.060> straight

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
few days we built this thing straight

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.380 
few days we built this thing straight
from<00:04:57.630> scratch<00:04:58.490> like<00:04:59.490> these<00:04:59.760> these<00:05:00.120> are<00:05:00.240> called

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
from scratch like these these are called

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.969 
from scratch like these these are called
super<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:00.870> I've<00:05:00.930> got<00:05:01.050> two<00:05:01.200> big<00:05:01.410> supers<00:05:01.800> one

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
super so I've got two big supers one

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.060 
super so I've got two big supers one
small<00:05:02.340> super<00:05:02.760> we<00:05:03.030> built<00:05:03.210> three<00:05:03.479> of<00:05:03.570> those<00:05:04.070> each

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
small super we built three of those each

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.740 
small super we built three of those each
one's<00:05:05.340> got<00:05:05.520> like<00:05:05.669> ten<00:05:05.880> frames<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.390> each<00:05:06.510> one

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
one's got like ten frames in each one

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.040 
one's got like ten frames in each one
and<00:05:08.090> these<00:05:09.090> just<00:05:09.330> have<00:05:09.570> together<00:05:09.720> like<00:05:09.990> a

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
and these just have together like a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.630 
and these just have together like a
puzzle<00:05:10.080> really<00:05:10.710> easy<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:11.100> come<00:05:11.310> around<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.550> the

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
puzzle really easy to come around to the

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.270 
puzzle really easy to come around to the
front<00:05:11.960> we<00:05:12.960> built<00:05:13.229> these<00:05:13.380> here<00:05:13.710> this<00:05:13.890> is<00:05:14.010> a<00:05:14.070> big

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
front we built these here this is a big

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.430 
front we built these here this is a big
hole<00:05:14.520> there<00:05:14.729> for<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.030> bees<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:16.050> what

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
hole there for the bees and what

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.510 
hole there for the bees and what
actually<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.890> I<00:05:17.040> could<00:05:17.190> do<00:05:17.280> is<00:05:17.400> they'll

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
actually that I could do is they'll

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.620 
actually that I could do is they'll
stand<00:05:17.790> in<00:05:17.880> there<00:05:18.000> they'll<00:05:18.180> flap<00:05:18.419> their<00:05:18.600> wings

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
stand in there they'll flap their wings

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.730 
stand in there they'll flap their wings
like<00:05:18.900> crazy<00:05:19.200> and<00:05:19.470> they'll<00:05:19.590> actually

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
like crazy and they'll actually

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.310 
like crazy and they'll actually
air-conditioned<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.610> inside<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:21.090> the

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
air-conditioned the inside of the

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.060 
air-conditioned the inside of the
beehive<00:05:22.430> I'll<00:05:23.430> take<00:05:23.580> this<00:05:23.669> telescoping<00:05:25.070> it's

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
beehive I'll take this telescoping it's

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.430 
beehive I'll take this telescoping it's
all<00:05:26.250> scoffing<00:05:26.550> lid<00:05:26.880> on<00:05:27.000> here

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
all scoffing lid on here

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.520 
all scoffing lid on here
go<00:05:28.590> all<00:05:28.800> this<00:05:28.920> ourselves<00:05:29.160> too<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:30.120> seems

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
go all this ourselves too it seems

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.160 
go all this ourselves too it seems
pretty<00:05:31.530> nice<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.950> shoot<00:05:32.190> we<00:05:32.430> got<00:05:32.610> going<00:05:33.170> about

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
pretty nice to shoot we got going about

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.070 
pretty nice to shoot we got going about
the<00:05:34.290> small<00:05:34.790> small<00:05:35.790> supers<00:05:36.210> on<00:05:36.360> top<00:05:36.630> will

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
the small small supers on top will

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.750 
the small small supers on top will
actually<00:05:37.380> add<00:05:37.500> this<00:05:37.710> later<00:05:38.040> will<00:05:38.520> let<00:05:38.640> them

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
actually add this later will let them

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.070 
actually add this later will let them
build<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:39.120> little<00:05:39.300> build<00:05:39.660> the<00:05:39.720> honey<00:05:39.870> in<00:05:39.990> the
