00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 my name is joice bressanin your wife 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.900
 daniel knows an online site method to have 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.880
 a wife changing expenses or less 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.170
 totally because I 'm a physiotherapist 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.599
 and hypertrophy 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 we have learned to a certain point 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.720
 the hypertrophy of the bodybuilder was this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.769
 here to my mind 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 This helped me train. Helped me 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.230
 understand the world of bodybuilding 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.040
 decent way in the right way 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.460
 a beautiful career does not eat well if 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.739
 train well, rest well if it 's another 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.140
 world was wonderful to me changed in the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.500
 things have changed in your family 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.120
 because the first 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.640
 the first contact I had with 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.590
 Bodybuilding was not very good because 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.379
 unfortunately there are professional websites 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.430
 They are very picks in the area and go right 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.160
 for you in a totally 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 different when Daniel told me about 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.750
 sardines there is no method only a 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.020
 still do not think 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.140
 but we are already accompanying some 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.970
 videos on youtube some talks and I 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.640
 I think it's really cool because I'm a 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.420
 physical educator based theoretical increase 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 very large that he knew in practice 30 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.230
 years of career and chewed smil soico 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.030
 so powder for you 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.090
 it works the most sense and I felt both 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.980
 in me as daniel daniel is the bearer of 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.520
 been a bearer of five years of 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.360
 disk and when we learn the method 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.670
 jorginho the principles of the game ida is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.740
 especially the super slow and after the 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.950
 zero point which is a discovery of the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.230
 sardine that caused Dani to have 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.990
 a regression in the disk rules 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.550
 he has a small increase he does all 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.310
 the exercises 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.740
 thence with the reconstruction surgery of 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.830
 crossed previous two months walking here 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.869
 I drove from here to here, too. 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.030
 I have a herniated disc due to 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.700
 many years of ballet and I can train 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.970
 precisely because of this 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.430
 zero-coupling with superlow and 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.610
 today the demonstration he gave of his 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.970
 technique was only the stamp 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.870
 Speaking at home, open this and send it. 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.110
 bullet 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:35.610
 I accuse the course of knowing 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.140
 the maximum is 1 most generous person 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.870
 altruistic because the other person that she 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.750
 give without waiting to get back because 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.240
 he takes everything that is best and gives 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.860
 for you to evolve to be happy as 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.670
 He in the sport that he loves for me. 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.010
 audience generosity daniel bressanin 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.020
 daniel ferrey where I came from the city 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.480
 from valinhos sÃ£o paulo daniel you 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.200
 know the sardine method online that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.270
 change that companies say ball me 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.340
 I always saw I was always self-taught 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.180
 so I always really enjoyed watching 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.300
 videos downloaded on internet from mister 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.480
 olympia and a lot of black great for 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.480
 learn and there is a certain exercise 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.910
 do not understand why it is but they 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.880
 make a big one and after I made a 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.030
 sardine method I could understand 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.550
 each in each meter of each principle 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.980
 That alone explained I started to call 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.230
 with the videos I had watched and 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.370
 I started to understand each one of them. 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:43.209
 so I'm very grateful for sardines 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.130
 learn to put my mind into everything that 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.040
 I think I watched and did not understand and 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.410
 cleaning and in your understanding and I found 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.569
 also interesting is that this scheme 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.420
 of phishing from academia 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.670
 it is always the physical educators and 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.409
 academy advocated was not better 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.870
 for me and after I applied the 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.430
 method it all changed for me I 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.780
 I can make myself understand that 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.030
 Can you understand why I'm 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.639
 doing what I 'm working then 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.450
 that's what has changed and been moving 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:14.950
 on body 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.769
 Look, I got it a long time ago, I 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.479
 I do gym like that, but of course I had 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.349
 to stop for some setbacks haiti 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.599
 a surgery in the middle but it's my year I 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.990
 I started to really see in the mirror 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:33.099
 change after I started doing the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:35.979
 online site because before I saw little 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.259
 thing I managed to lose a lot of weight 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.150
 It was very very slim down chubby okay 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.919
 doing exactly the right thing for 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.259
 I learned that I can change the 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.970
 their mentality completely 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.520
 I think he's one of the most 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.720
 that he can play with us and 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.630
 mind 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.400
 so he can have a minimum of 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.620
 we all need because of the 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.900
 pressure in the world of stress work 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.729
 testing system and it gets a 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.099
 motivation because even comes home 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.380
 tired of bursting from work and 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.270
 will get motivation your snout there 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.490
 watch a piece of glass because I 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.050
 I need this and I'll go there and he 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.840
 I can stay an hour an hour and a half. 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.669
 the walks being stepped on by accident 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.970
 motivation for them is like 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.580
 mayor receives serves as experience 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.460
 own, then who is the result of this 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.830
 squeeze for you today he's a teacher 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.729
 and he was my teacher is my best 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.009
 teacher 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.449
 I have had many many, not even being 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:36.430
 online even without name means everything 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.440
 I meant 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:43.170
 I could not apply to teaching in the first place. 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.170
 understand then there is no master teacher
