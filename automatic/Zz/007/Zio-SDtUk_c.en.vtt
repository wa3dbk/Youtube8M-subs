00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.320 

at<00:02:38.330> any<00:02:38.810> rate<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:40.670> we're<00:02:40.850> here<00:02:41.000> when<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.180> was

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
at any rate that we're here when I was

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.910 
at any rate that we're here when I was
picking<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.840> so<00:02:42.140> I'm<00:02:42.320> gonna<00:02:42.500> spray<00:02:42.740> them

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
picking it so I'm gonna spray them

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.370 
picking it so I'm gonna spray them
anyway<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:46.540> haven't<00:02:47.540> seen<00:02:47.750> any<00:02:47.960> of<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.170> little

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
anyway I haven't seen any of the little

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.560 
anyway I haven't seen any of the little
eggs<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.580> squash<00:02:49.970> bug<00:02:50.240> would<00:02:50.420> light

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
eggs like a squash bug would light

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.320 
eggs like a squash bug would light
underneath<00:02:51.460> the<00:02:52.460> thing<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:52.970> think<00:02:53.090> it's

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
underneath the thing so I think it's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.770 
underneath the thing so I think it's
pretty<00:02:53.540> relatively<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:55.280> new<00:02:55.780> infestation

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
pretty relatively a new infestation
