00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
I'm saying wink wink but if you're not

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.890 
I'm saying wink wink but if you're not
rolling<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:14.040> cash<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:15.180> I've<00:01:15.330> said<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.570> lot<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
rolling in cash like I've said a lot of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410 
rolling in cash like I've said a lot of
times<00:01:16.049> before<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.250> always<00:01:17.670> snipe<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
times before you can always snipe the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.850 
times before you can always snipe the
Gold's<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:19.080> they're<00:01:19.259> much<00:01:19.439> easier<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
Gold's because they're much easier to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.370 
Gold's because they're much easier to
snipe<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.869> probably<00:01:22.200> make<00:01:22.320> more

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
snipe and you can probably make more

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.800 
snipe and you can probably make more
money<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> long<00:01:23.040> run<00:01:23.330> not<00:01:24.330> even<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
money in the long run not even in the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.060 
money in the long run not even in the
long<00:01:24.990> run<00:01:25.020> i'm<00:01:25.350> gonna<00:01:25.409> go<00:01:25.530> ahead<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.830> say<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
long run i'm gonna go ahead and say that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.560 
long run i'm gonna go ahead and say that
you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.250> probably<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:26.640> more<00:01:26.700> money<00:01:26.970> but

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
you can probably make more money but

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.270 
you can probably make more money but
that<00:01:27.750> depends<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.439> good<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> positional

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
that depends on how good the positional

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.050 
that depends on how good the positional
hero<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.000> i<00:01:30.810> think<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> price<00:01:32.430> for

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
hero is and i think that the price for

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.539 
hero is and i think that the price for
tight<00:01:33.390> ends<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:33.750> gone<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.049> quite<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.829> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
tight ends has gone up quite a bit so

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
tight ends has gone up quite a bit so
people<00:01:35.880> are<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.390> excited<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> i

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
people are really excited for this i

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
people are really excited for this i
know<00:01:37.799> i<00:01:37.950> am<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:38.579> Gronk<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.150> doesn't<00:01:39.509> cut
