00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:08.200
 hello everyone I hope you walk from what 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.650
 better all day and welcome to the 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.080
 another episode of the 5 curiosities very 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.559
 curious about minecraft that maybe not 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.559
 you knew 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.520
 well let's start this is the first 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.230
 about a house I do not know if they knew if 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.720
 you put sand soul strip here 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.180
 to be able to leave can be used as 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.140
 traps as you want 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.140
 know they get 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 problem 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.280
 and jumping 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.050
 ducking like the ga are not going to be able 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.660
 leave here 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.570
 unless you 're in the blocks 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.860
 but you can put something on it, do not be 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.340
 something that can not be traced with 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.150
 oxidiana we have adventure mode if not the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.900
 they will be able to cross 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.900
 not so 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.480
 the next one is about this as way 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.979
 with ice 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.750
 I do not know why but it's something very curious 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.290
 they can use it as a means of 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.000
 transport me I know why what do you 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.930
 you go up 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.220
 you climb and run and jump at the same 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.990
 weather 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.470
 the bar are the speed 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.470
 Y 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.810
 too fast you can use it if you 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.130
 They do not like to use carts because they can 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.250
 put together a sometimes say super faster 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.040
 the next one is about I do not know if they knew 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.950
 maybe not 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.890
 I did not know, they did not know, please, no 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.170
 me the street is about when you burn the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.270
 animals the piglets the cows 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.570
 If the burn food and goeth 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.570
 made 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.770
 Burn 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.670
 whores 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.540
 the food is not even nor is dollar to put 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.099
 Baked alone comes out 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.099
 it was cooked 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.290
 and ready to eat 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.650
 an 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.840
 good the room on good dynamite 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.550
 save constructions as you want can 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.990
 put water but the dynamite is not going to 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.870
 do nothing any harm and so you do not 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.820
 multiply because someone a friend of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.570
 you troll that arrives and desmadre all 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.570
 Well, no 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.330
 Dynamite does nothing when there is little 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.480
 water where it will fall if it is a hole what 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.480
 plus 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.370
 or is a picture filled with water if they put it 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.810
 and they will not destroy anything 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.660
 latest 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.500
 ignore the chaos that I have that the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.090
 the last one is the water 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.650
 maybe they did not know it but they can 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.819
 with torches or stairs can 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.819
 catch breath under water 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.780
 that is, you are valid to advocate normally 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.770
 again more months 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.680
 well here and it's off but I'll re 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.730
 you generate 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.760
 the breathing 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.150
 the other one is on the stairs you 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.710
 can a ladder here 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.660
 yes 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.180
 and they have restoration wherever it is 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.750
 let them have breath and they will be able to 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.250
 draw everything faster 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.900
 Under water 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.360
 if there is gold I do not know 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.360
 then cut everything faster 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.030
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.150
 is the other chapter of the things 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.170
 curious that maybe beings so
