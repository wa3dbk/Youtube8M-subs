00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.719
 hello friends i'm fixing yuri 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 I greet you on carpenter's channel 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.340
 substance are many of my subscribers 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.740
 asking me to do surveys of what we are 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.930
 as if the given tikhonu on the branch is not 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.580
 there is always time to shoot something but 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.630
 today we ended up at our old 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.730
 the customer we are doing very much 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.890
 so just want to catch a glimpse of 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.410
 some interesting features in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.680
 In this case, it will go to the doors 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.489
 nightstand under the washing machine but 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.239
 at first the table is also our works and blue and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.460
 the grounds 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.379
 sliding table there is a mechanism well not 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.469
 I will show that it is not very convenient 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.160
 all now do this table 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.100
 massive connected here it is on spikes and 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.859
 plus there inside the gain goes well here 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.530
 meeting with because i'm sliding tables 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.300
 and wood countertops are not the case but the most 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.180
 the main course did not want to show you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.979
 one interesting thing we are 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.520
 made for the bedside table under the washing 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.270
 typewriter these are the doors that are 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 move in what sense 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.320
 at the door the meaning of these goals is that they themselves 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.159
 they are put here these columns they 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.500
 put on full sliding mechanisms 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.450
 which were bolted rectangles 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.570
 with four screw holes 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.200
 then on these strips were put 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.350
 these doors and they were calculated so 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 way to pushing here to the end 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.520
 and when they close their corner 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.030
 barely seemed to rest on this one 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.290
 decoration thickening which goes that is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.690
 she's there if you see more 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.340
 see here nothing here 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.860
 no thickening just worth it 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.710
 decoration but these are visible on the floor wet 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.530
 winds how does it happen like in 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.520
 door engine, you can safely work with 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.520
