00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it as a group so hopefully our following

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
record to because I do think it's one of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.570 
record to because I do think it's one of
the<00:01:20.759> nicer<00:01:21.149> albums<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:22.770> we've<00:01:22.920> done<00:01:23.099> really

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the nicer albums that we've done really

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
the nicer albums that we've done really
since<00:01:23.910> probably<00:01:24.149> no<00:01:24.420> need<00:01:24.599> to<00:01:24.690> argue<00:01:24.720> first

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
since probably no need to argue first

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
since probably no need to argue first

I think with the cranberries it's just
that<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.489> know<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:37.019> all<00:03:37.169> gets<00:03:37.470> done<00:03:37.739> and

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
that you know it all gets done and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
can work so well yeah it's a no-brainer

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.250 
can work so well yeah it's a no-brainer
in<00:03:44.159> like<00:03:44.819> genera<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.389> entender<00:03:46.049> where

pre-production<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:29.490> preparing<00:05:30.300> things<00:05:30.800> like

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
pre-production so preparing things like

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.550 
pre-production so preparing things like
for<00:05:32.460> example<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.389> freezer<00:05:33.719> is<00:05:34.050> very<00:05:34.259> good

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
for example the freezer is very good

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.740 
for example the freezer is very good
because<00:05:35.279> you<00:05:35.400> can<00:05:35.550> make<00:05:35.759> lots<00:05:36.000> of<00:05:36.180> food<00:05:36.449> and

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
because you can make lots of food and

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.079 
because you can make lots of food and
you<00:05:36.870> can<00:05:37.020> freeze<00:05:37.349> lots<00:05:37.650> of<00:05:37.800> things<00:05:38.039> you<00:05:38.940> know

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
you can freeze lots of things you know

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.170 
you can freeze lots of things you know
and<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:40.110> think<00:05:40.199> just<00:05:41.039> doing<00:05:41.400> things<00:05:41.610> in<00:05:41.789> advance

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180
