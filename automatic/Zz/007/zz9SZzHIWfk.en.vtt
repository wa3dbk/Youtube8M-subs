set<00:00:30.579> and<00:00:30.820> pyramid<00:00:31.390> basically<00:00:32.259> what<00:00:32.500> this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
set and pyramid basically what this

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.740 
set and pyramid basically what this
entails<00:00:33.130> what<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.550> benefit<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.300> guys<00:00:34.510> is

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
entails what the benefit to you guys is

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.860 
entails what the benefit to you guys is
and<00:00:35.500> how<00:00:36.370> we<00:00:36.430> can<00:00:36.670> really<00:00:36.910> best<00:00:37.239> go<00:00:37.390> about<00:00:37.420> it

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
and how we can really best go about it

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.680 
and how we can really best go about it
so<00:00:38.020> I'm<00:00:38.560> using<00:00:38.800> shorter<00:00:39.399> press<00:00:39.610> as<00:00:39.790> a<00:00:40.210> perfect

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
so I'm using shorter press as a perfect

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.870 
so I'm using shorter press as a perfect
example<00:00:40.809> and<00:00:41.320> you<00:00:41.770> can<00:00:41.920> see<00:00:42.100> over<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.850> next

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
example and you can see over the next

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.140 
example and you can see over the next
three<00:00:43.570> sets<00:00:43.840> I<00:00:44.110> start<00:00:44.830> off<00:00:44.950> with<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.400> pretty

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
three sets I start off with a pretty

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.780 
three sets I start off with a pretty
heavy<00:00:46.630> weight<00:00:46.870> 25<00:00:47.650> pounds<00:00:47.980> on<00:00:48.040> each<00:00:48.280> side<00:00:48.550> it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
heavy weight 25 pounds on each side it's

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.470 
heavy weight 25 pounds on each side it's
enough<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:49.840> get<00:00:49.990> me<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.350> 15<00:00:51.190> repetitions<00:00:51.480> now

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
enough to get me to 15 repetitions now

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.420 
enough to get me to 15 repetitions now
I'll<00:00:52.660> say<00:00:52.810> here<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.200> most<00:00:53.380> people<00:00:53.710> typically

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
I'll say here that most people typically

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.570 
I'll say here that most people typically
when<00:00:54.580> they<00:00:54.670> do<00:00:54.820> pyramids<00:00:55.300> it's<00:00:55.510> 12<00:00:56.050> 10<00:00:56.440> 8<00:00:56.740> for

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
when they do pyramids it's 12 10 8 for

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.790 
when they do pyramids it's 12 10 8 for
me<00:00:57.700> that's<00:00:57.940> too<00:00:58.240> much<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:58.900> a<00:00:59.050> shorter<00:00:59.380> spectrum

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
me that's too much of a shorter spectrum

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.370 
me that's too much of a shorter spectrum
I<00:00:59.920> like<00:01:00.160> to<00:01:00.340> expand<00:01:00.820> it<00:01:00.940> out<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.360> do<00:01:01.720> 15<00:01:01.960> reps

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
I like to expand it out and do 15 reps

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.730 
I like to expand it out and do 15 reps
10<00:01:03.190> reps<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:03.670> 6<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.689> this<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:04.989> because<00:01:05.560> it

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
10 reps and 6 and this is because it

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.710 
10 reps and 6 and this is because it
typically<00:01:06.189> works<00:01:06.369> more<00:01:07.090> muscular<00:01:07.420> endurance

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
typically works more muscular endurance

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.469 
typically works more muscular endurance
for<00:01:08.259> those<00:01:08.350> 15<00:01:08.799> reps<00:01:09.009> then<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.909> little<00:01:10.240> bit<00:01:10.329> more

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
for those 15 reps then a little bit more

the increments of the weights

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.289 
the increments of the weights
I'm<00:01:23.590> not<00:01:24.130> simply<00:01:24.490> putting<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.969> biggest

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
I'm not simply putting on the biggest

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.029 
I'm not simply putting on the biggest
weight<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.630> can<00:01:25.689> and<00:01:26.140> trying<00:01:26.679> to<00:01:26.740> get<00:01:26.859> a<00:01:26.889> few

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
weight I can and trying to get a few

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.429 
weight I can and trying to get a few
more<00:01:27.189> reps<00:01:27.249> I'm<00:01:27.639> being<00:01:28.329> somewhat<00:01:28.899> scientific

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
more reps I'm being somewhat scientific

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.309 
more reps I'm being somewhat scientific
about<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.889> I'm<00:01:30.340> using<00:01:30.609> smaller<00:01:31.149> increments<00:01:31.539> to

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
about it I'm using smaller increments to

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.039 
about it I'm using smaller increments to
add<00:01:32.469> weight<00:01:33.369> on<00:01:33.689> increasing<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.780> amount<00:01:34.960> of

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
add weight on increasing the amount of

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.719 
add weight on increasing the amount of
poundage<00:01:35.409> I'm<00:01:35.560> lifting<00:01:35.950> but<00:01:36.520> it's

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
poundage I'm lifting but it's

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.999 
poundage I'm lifting but it's
proportional<00:01:37.359> to<00:01:37.569> the<00:01:37.689> reps<00:01:37.899> you<00:01:38.469> see<00:01:38.649> if<00:01:38.920> you

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
proportional to the reps you see if you

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.830 
proportional to the reps you see if you
think<00:01:39.189> about<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:40.030> still<00:01:40.240> want<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.479> keep

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
think about it you still want to keep

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.379 
think about it you still want to keep
that<00:01:40.990> intensity<00:01:41.560> high<00:01:41.889> even<00:01:42.490> if<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:42.909> may<00:01:43.119> only

that intensity high even if you may only

that intensity high even if you may only
be<00:01:43.539> doing<00:01:43.659> six<00:01:44.079> or<00:01:44.350> seven<00:01:44.829> eight<00:01:45.069> reps<00:01:45.399> I<00:01:45.670> still

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
be doing six or seven eight reps I still

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.059 
be doing six or seven eight reps I still
want<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.509> be<00:01:46.630> using<00:01:46.810> all<00:01:47.139> of<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.409> correct<00:01:47.770> form

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069

which really are the growth fibers and

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.010 
which really are the growth fibers and
if<00:01:54.639> I'm<00:01:54.759> simply<00:01:55.119> just<00:01:55.270> putting<00:01:55.509> on<00:01:55.659> more<00:01:55.840> and

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
if I'm simply just putting on more and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.230 
if I'm simply just putting on more and
more<00:01:56.139> weight<00:01:56.380> my<00:01:57.039> former<00:01:57.459> technique<00:01:57.819> starts

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
more weight my former technique starts

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.510 
more weight my former technique starts
to<00:01:58.359> suffer<00:01:58.779> so<00:01:59.159> even<00:02:00.159> if<00:02:00.249> we<00:02:00.340> were<00:02:00.399> putting

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
to suffer so even if we were putting

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.059 
to suffer so even if we were putting
small<00:02:00.969> increments<00:02:01.569> on<00:02:01.689> it's<00:02:01.929> still<00:02:02.560> extra

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
small increments on it's still extra

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.590 
small increments on it's still extra
weight<00:02:03.219> that<00:02:03.459> you<00:02:03.579> need<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.969> be<00:02:04.090> able<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.389> lift

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
weight that you need to be able to lift

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.410 
weight that you need to be able to lift
so<00:02:05.289> think<00:02:05.679> about<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.340> amount<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.209> weight

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
so think about that the amount of weight

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.350 
so think about that the amount of weight
that<00:02:07.659> goes<00:02:07.779> on<00:02:08.080> use<00:02:08.560> smaller<00:02:08.950> plates<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:10.119> way

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
that goes on use smaller plates this way

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.570 
that goes on use smaller plates this way
it's<00:02:10.630> easier<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.349> strip<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.770> weight<00:02:11.920> off<00:02:12.160> or

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
it's easier to strip the weight off or

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's easier to strip the weight off or
see<00:02:13.569> how<00:02:13.750> much<00:02:13.900> extra<00:02:14.080> weight<00:02:14.530> you're<00:02:14.890> adding

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
see how much extra weight you're adding

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.059 
see how much extra weight you're adding
to<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:16.000> training<00:02:16.690> threshold<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:17.920> can

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
to that training threshold that you can

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.980 
to that training threshold that you can
no<00:02:18.160> longer<00:02:18.220> lift<00:02:18.550> anymore<00:02:18.940> obviously<00:02:19.540> these

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
no longer lift anymore obviously these

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.660 
no longer lift anymore obviously these
kind<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.290> exercises<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.190> need<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.370> training

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
kind of exercises you need a training

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.160 
kind of exercises you need a training
partner<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.240> that's<00:02:22.690> where<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.990> can<00:02:23.110> really
