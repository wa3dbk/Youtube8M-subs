I want I don't know what that is down

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.990 
I want I don't know what that is down
there<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.210> anyways<00:02:03.490> here<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.880> beginning

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
there but anyways here is the beginning

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.240 
there but anyways here is the beginning
fence<00:02:05.930> jumping<00:02:06.380> I'm<00:02:06.649> not<00:02:06.829> going<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.039> show<00:02:07.159> you

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
fence jumping I'm not going to show you

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.699 
fence jumping I'm not going to show you
it<00:02:07.340> will<00:02:07.549> talk<00:02:07.759> forever<00:02:07.939> go<00:02:08.330> through<00:02:08.539> this<00:02:08.709> you

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
it will talk forever go through this you

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.320 
it will talk forever go through this you
shouldn't<00:02:09.979> go<00:02:10.069> through<00:02:10.250> all<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.030> then

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
shouldn't go through all this and then

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.350 
shouldn't go through all this and then
I'm<00:02:11.599> guessing<00:02:11.989> won't<00:02:12.110> jump<00:02:12.349> onto<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.650> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
I'm guessing won't jump onto that and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.699 
I'm guessing won't jump onto that and
you<00:02:14.360> go<00:02:14.450> through<00:02:14.629> all<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.930> ice<00:02:15.050> obstacles

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
you go through all the ice obstacles

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.140 
you go through all the ice obstacles
I've<00:02:15.950> already<00:02:16.099> done<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.489> ice<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.849> just<00:02:17.030> like

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
I've already done the ice you just like

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.509 
I've already done the ice you just like
gotta<00:02:17.360> climb<00:02:17.569> through<00:02:17.840> all<00:02:17.930> these<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.620> then

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
gotta climb through all these and then

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.690 
gotta climb through all these and then
go<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.940> ladder<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:21.040> did<00:02:22.040> all<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.280> easy<00:02:22.430> ones

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
go to the ladder I did all the easy ones

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.880
