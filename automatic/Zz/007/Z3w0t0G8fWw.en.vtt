really does because you have all these

once<00:02:22.690> again<00:02:22.840> you've<00:02:23.440> got<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.980> idea<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.459> like

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
once again you've got this idea of like

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.150 
once again you've got this idea of like
okay<00:02:24.970> people<00:02:25.209> are<00:02:25.330> creating<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:26.920> what

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
okay people are creating this but what

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.750 
okay people are creating this but what
is<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.580> reason<00:02:28.120> is<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.140> show<00:02:29.170> these<00:02:29.760> gods

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
is the reason is it to show these gods

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.009 
is the reason is it to show these gods
in<00:02:31.410> aerial<00:02:32.410> vehicles<00:02:33.040> land<00:02:33.970> here<00:02:34.420> kind<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.930> a

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
in aerial vehicles land here kind of a

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.100 
in aerial vehicles land here kind of a
thing<00:02:35.260> because<00:02:35.680> we<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.670> don't<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.780> good

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
thing because we just don't have a good

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.840 
thing because we just don't have a good
idea<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.500> why<00:02:39.250> people<00:02:39.850> would<00:02:40.810> do<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.890> it

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
idea of why people would do this and it

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.699 
idea of why people would do this and it
really<00:02:43.150> does<00:02:43.450> seem<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.959> they're<00:02:44.110> trying<00:02:44.530> to

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
really does seem that they're trying to

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.780 
really does seem that they're trying to
signal<00:02:45.370> people<00:02:45.989> who<00:02:46.989> are<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:48.340> air<00:02:48.489> in

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
signal people who are in the air in
