00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello this is a new video review 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.080
 weapons will appear as many as four units 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.210
 new and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.519
 easy to see here they are left here 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.519
 on top of the arsenal that they are all limited in 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.180
 quantity but don't worry and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.730
 to think that they will once again be in the trunk in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.480
 the menu and you will see them once a week no 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.240
 it is likely to fall more often 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.250
 because it will not show up in 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.349
 main menu 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.160
 not even in the store can not be bought 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 for rubies 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.340
 but only during the fight found in his box 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.550
 the husband will not be that is, the more no way 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.790
 can not be purchased and stable 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.070
 can't 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.270
 the very same update with this beautiful 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.700
 puddle they will be released the second half of August 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.879
 Well, in extreme cases, already in early September 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.590
 but don't be afraid for so long and 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.930
 I start review means the very first 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.110
 weapons at least on my list 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.510
 for some reason, the description does not appear in 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.150
 print resurrection resurrects character 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.610
 from the grave who later fights 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.350
 on your side like a zombie resurrection 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.259
 possible only on the next turn after 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.979
 death and spends the course is very primitive and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.670
 already killing the enemy and he next turn 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.040
 resurrects himself let's see how 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.890
 this is what works, and most importantly 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 then kill someone because of the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.110
 you canâ€™t kill yourself 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:45.020
 not to kill shorter right now sledgehammers 8 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:45.020
 we must sadly just give take 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.530
 out of habit I go beyond the base clouds otherwise 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.010
 just can not always come out 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.200
 when you just kill yourself 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.700
 it is impossible not to see more damage 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.700
 all he has 40 left is what 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:09.610
 It turns out now goes red means 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.160
 all right red happens dope well and 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.380
 now goes green can save his 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.300
 like this next turn if 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.930
 uses it perfectly the shotgun works 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.780
 but only near as far as possible 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.530
 there is no my soul written nearby 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.860
 with dense 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.660
 our lines here to get out zombies always 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.500
 there is such a bag of such 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.420
 health and that 60 armor 0 but it 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.150
 a typical minion of such a game exists 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.970
 since 2011 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.100
 as soon as zombies appeared so did he 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.510
 works 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.810
 principle to kill him too without losing very 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.810
 easy 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.560
 cool demon like under water and 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.299
 can not be saved if you drowned resort 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.330
 if you call a zombie under water then he 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:00.180
 instantly he dies not a demon 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.440
 just no what else to say 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.790
 probably absolutely nothing is the most 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.980
 simple and legalist and 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.769
 although there still is it primary just not 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.040
 here it is already slightly more difficult radio mast 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.440
 following the course after installation 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.540
 Increases Air Attack Damage by 50 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.690
 percent if at the bottom not from the ground not 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.790
 spends the course very honest and installation and 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.019
 at all 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.519
 the use of radio masts she this card 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.989
 such in the world there will be no problems among 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:31.060
 first it can not be put on some 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.459
 difficult terrain can only be put 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.470
 if here you are the land of different here 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.780
 trying to install fails here 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.180
 also not a year to look for something 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.670
 like such a beam 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.130
 well or just positive yet here and 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.420
 set it on has and health right 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.070
 as android engineer the enemy is not clear 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.880
 can destroy put it will be up 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.290
 end of battle 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:06.939
 that is, time 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:06.939
 doesn't have anyone working only on 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.230
 green 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:25.210
 name will increase by 50 percent 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:25.210
 damage and set to increase 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.960
 about 30 to 30 I have and no longer 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.240
 on the verge means you should damage like 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.180
 the default is about 50 units 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.930
 45 still see how many are already shooting and 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.320
 parties katya 60 70 percent even if 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.990
 count 45 and 60 plus 50 percent 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.690
 just such a number and it turns out so 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.190
 it works great and is very interesting 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.440
 what count how many now 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.780
 defaults off a point punch 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:12.409
 if you just take off 255 rocket by 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.199
 50 somehow plus 50 percent is each 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:22.630
 the rocket will shoot at 75 and 5 multiply 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:22.630
 on the 75th it turns out 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:34.220
 425 he is a default monster just when 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.229
 you but I did but take off the armor 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.120
 monster so even against some throws 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.159
 there or on missions and complete from the island 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.500
 you can easily accomplish achievements 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:45.580
 doing monster will increase something because 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.770
 just huge damage and if you attack 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.630
 Issue 30 and 10 in the armor you need to enemy 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.550
 generally completely kill the whole Persian 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.940
 like the once creative sheep 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.220
 that's 11 5 is popular because not yet 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.830
 there was an improvement why no one 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.800
 enjoyed at least strong 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.050
 accurate players 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.240
 also erase radio tower just whether they 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.150
 weapon 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.210
 forget anichin strong yes and drop it 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.930
 radio mast and in the box it is yes so no 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.690
 neither do perform such upon reaching not 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.240
 endless 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:25.539
 fire injection without losing 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.909
 pay attention it's cool because the game 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.650
 it gets harder each turn is necessary 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:32.340
 every second to use because 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.440
 a lot of weapons without losing 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.620
 removes all negative effects 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:42.009
 restricting movement to allies not 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.440
 spends a move even show nothing 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:47.020
 you take this thing looks like a taxi 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.629
 coming to your pepper which 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.930
 married or slow remington there 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:55.020
 think mind shocker and click spaces 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.250
 just not defrosting census 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.020
 the slowdown is removed by spiders not 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.240
 works maybe here in the description yet 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:06.180
 OK to write exactly by 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:09.759
 freezing and slowing down because 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.909
 injection remove the spider can not be well 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:14.500
 last gun and antidotes 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:16.719
 I shoot an escaped ally and 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.360
 sets 10 percent of its current from 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:22.240
 others spend weaning primitively 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:25.389
 it is clear now I will demonstrate it to you 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:38.849
 mini games for which to study for five 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:38.849
 hours nothing has learned it will not be 

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:48.310
 forced their own or their 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:53.580
 restored his 10 percent health in 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:58.289
 he had 621 10 society 2162 they 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:01.750
 added as well as removed by management 

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:04.539
 easy and simple on this all hope you 

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:07.090
 liked the tour already left you can 

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:08.080
 leave and discussions in the official 

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:13.169
 group 

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.169
 Well, the link will be trained
