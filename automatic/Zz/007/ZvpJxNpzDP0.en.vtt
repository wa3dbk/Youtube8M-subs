00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hey what's up guys this is trimer the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.349 
hey what's up guys this is trimer the
framerate<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.810> laggy<00:00:04.200> but<00:00:04.879> i'll<00:00:05.879> try<00:00:06.299> to

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
framerate is laggy but i'll try to

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.129 
framerate is laggy but i'll try to
explain<00:00:06.740> what<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.950> thing<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.309> i<00:00:08.840> call<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.019> an

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
explain what this thing is i call it an

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.910 
explain what this thing is i call it an
energy<00:00:10.830> creator<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.809> creates<00:00:13.170> blaze<00:00:13.590> rods

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
energy creator and it creates blaze rods

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.400 
energy creator and it creates blaze rods
that<00:00:14.309> know<00:00:14.490> what<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.730> does<00:00:14.910> I've<00:00:15.179> set<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.289> up

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that know what it does I've set it up

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.010 
that know what it does I've set it up
here<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.920> i'll<00:00:17.490> try<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.850> explain<00:00:18.000> its<00:00:18.539> step<00:00:18.869> by

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
here and i'll try to explain its step by

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.359 
here and i'll try to explain its step by
step<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.300> well<00:00:21.300> first<00:00:21.960> off<00:00:22.170> you've<00:00:23.039> got

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
step for you well first off you've got

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.540 
step for you well first off you've got
barrel<00:00:24.330> or<00:00:24.779> either<00:00:25.019> chest<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:26.010> blaze<00:00:26.279> rods

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
barrel or either chest with blaze rods

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.390 
barrel or either chest with blaze rods
then<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.599> follows<00:00:27.869> them<00:00:28.230> into<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
then it follows them into the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.089 
then it follows them into the
masqueraders<00:00:30.090> I've<00:00:30.779> used<00:00:31.170> tree<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
masqueraders I've used tree in this

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.000 
masqueraders I've used tree in this
example<00:00:32.520> which<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.510> add<00:00:33.690> more<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
example which you can add more and a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.819 
example which you can add more and a
macerator<00:00:35.640> gives<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.480> back<00:00:36.690> five<00:00:37.260> place

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
macerator gives you back five place

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.840 
macerator gives you back five place
powders<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.719> every<00:00:39.719> blaze<00:00:39.960> rod<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.440> put<00:00:40.680> in

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
powders for every blaze rod you put in

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.940 
powders for every blaze rod you put in
and<00:00:41.850> also<00:00:42.260> recommend<00:00:43.260> putting<00:00:43.469> entry

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and also recommend putting entry

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.940 
and also recommend putting entry
overclockers<00:00:44.670> /<00:00:45.000> macerator<00:00:45.480> cuz<00:00:46.379> can't<00:00:46.710> keep

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
overclockers / macerator cuz can't keep

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.389 
overclockers / macerator cuz can't keep
up<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> input<00:00:48.030> speed<00:00:48.270> otherwise<00:00:49.399> now

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
up with the input speed otherwise now

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.000 
up with the input speed otherwise now
here<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.899> bit<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> mess<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
here it's a bit of a mess and you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.250 
here it's a bit of a mess and you
normally<00:00:53.460> put<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> back<00:00:54.180> side<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:55.230> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
normally put it on the back side but I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.569 
normally put it on the back side but I
wanted<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> show<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> set<00:00:56.190> up<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.550> guys

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
wanted to show to set up to you guys

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
wanted to show to set up to you guys
loads<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.390> Viron<00:00:57.690> pipes<00:00:57.930> which<00:00:58.680> could<00:00:58.890> also

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
loads of Viron pipes which could also

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.400 
loads of Viron pipes which could also
put<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.940> distance<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.930> between<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
put more distance in between the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
put more distance in between the
masqueraders<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.460> i<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> keep<00:01:02.940> small

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
masqueraders but i like to keep small

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.010 
masqueraders but i like to keep small
well<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.729> trick<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.750> right

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
well the trick to all of this is right

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.510 
well the trick to all of this is right
here<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.560> chest<00:01:08.659> with<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> philosopher's<00:01:10.350> stone

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
here a chest with a philosopher's stone

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
here a chest with a philosopher's stone
so<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.580> could<00:01:11.790> also<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:12.600> name's<00:01:12.900> down

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
so you could also use a my name's down

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.840 
so you could also use a my name's down
near<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> automated<00:01:16.740> crafting<00:01:17.430> table

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
near and the automated crafting table

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.719 
near and the automated crafting table
set<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.040> only<00:01:20.250> need<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
set up like this now you only need to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.929 
set up like this now you only need to
blaze<00:01:21.299> by<00:01:21.540> Otis<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> new<00:01:22.409> blaze<00:01:22.680> rod<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> as

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
blaze by Otis for a new blaze rod and as

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.990 
blaze by Otis for a new blaze rod and as
you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.659> blaze<00:01:25.140> rod<00:01:25.700> produces<00:01:26.700> energy

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you can see a blaze rod produces energy

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.960 
you can see a blaze rod produces energy
and<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.829> basically<00:01:29.070> how<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.880> works<00:01:31.970> for

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and that is basically how it works for

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.719 
and that is basically how it works for
every<00:01:33.390> Rod<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:34.020> put<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.799> macerator<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
every Rod you put in the macerator you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.899 
every Rod you put in the macerator you
get<00:01:35.909> two<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> half<00:01:36.630> rotten<00:01:36.990> return

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
get two and a half rotten return

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.890 
get two and a half rotten return
effectively<00:01:38.909> more<00:01:39.240> than<00:01:39.390> doubling<00:01:39.750> your

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
effectively more than doubling your

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.969 
effectively more than doubling your
energy<00:01:40.320> supply<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.770> pretty<00:01:43.770> awesome

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
energy supply this is a pretty awesome

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.030 
energy supply this is a pretty awesome
for<00:01:45.020> well<00:01:46.159> powering<00:01:47.159> machines<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:49.040> things

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
for well powering machines and things

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.090 
for well powering machines and things
like<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.509> MFE<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:53.180> quarries<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.600> back<00:01:55.470> boxes

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
like the MFE and quarries and back boxes

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.530 
like the MFE and quarries and back boxes
and<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:58.619> i<00:01:58.740> used<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.460> MFE<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> set

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and so on and i used the MFE in the set

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.429 
and so on and i used the MFE in the set
up<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.530> low<00:02:01.710> voltage<00:02:02.060> transformer<00:02:03.060> just

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
up with the low voltage transformer just

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.749 
up with the low voltage transformer just
because<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> MFE<00:02:04.950> can<00:02:05.130> store<00:02:05.310> more<00:02:05.490> power

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
because the MFE can store more power

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.059 
because the MFE can store more power
than<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> bat<00:02:06.180> box<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.689> i<00:02:07.229> also<00:02:07.350> used<00:02:07.680> piece

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
than the bat box and i also used piece

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.029 
than the bat box and i also used piece
of<00:02:08.099> diamonds<00:02:08.640> pipe<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.989> distribute<00:02:10.590> two<00:02:10.800> rods

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
of diamonds pipe to distribute two rods

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.040 
of diamonds pipe to distribute two rods
more<00:02:11.489> evenly

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
more evenly

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.140 
more evenly
between<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.290> masqueraders<00:02:14.740> so<00:02:15.670> it's<00:02:15.820> easy<00:02:16.030> to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
between the masqueraders so it's easy to

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.700 
between the masqueraders so it's easy to
welcome<00:02:16.540> more<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.910> yeah<00:02:19.090> that's<00:02:19.630> basically<00:02:20.320> it

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
welcome more so yeah that's basically it

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:27.900 
welcome more so yeah that's basically it
I<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.870> hope<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.290> enjoyed<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.890> if<00:02:27.130> there<00:02:27.790> are
