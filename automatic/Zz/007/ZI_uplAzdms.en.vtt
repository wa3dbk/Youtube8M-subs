when I go to camera three
I'm<00:04:27.210> gonna<00:04:27.390> get<00:04:27.600> an<00:04:27.690> icon<00:04:28.080> right<00:04:28.290> here<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.590> PTZ

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
I'm gonna get an icon right here a PTZ

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.970 
I'm gonna get an icon right here a PTZ
icon<00:04:29.520> once<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:29.850> click<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.420> my<00:04:31.050> virtual<00:04:31.470> PTZ

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
icon once I click on it my virtual PTZ

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.410 
icon once I click on it my virtual PTZ
control<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.490> gonna<00:04:32.700> pop<00:04:32.940> up<00:04:34.190> now<00:04:35.190> now<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:35.940> set<00:04:36.270> my

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
control is gonna pop up now now I set my

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.730 
control is gonna pop up now now I set my
address<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.140> one<00:04:37.520> bit<00:04:38.520> on<00:04:38.850> some<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:39.960> GV<00:04:40.290> and

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
address to one bit on some of the GV and

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.200 
address to one bit on some of the GV and
geo<00:04:40.920> vision<00:04:41.190> software<00:04:41.460> I<00:04:41.550> believe<00:04:41.790> it's<00:04:42.000> all

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
geo vision software I believe it's all

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.800 
geo vision software I believe it's all
of<00:04:42.360> them<00:04:42.540> there<00:04:43.080> minus<00:04:43.530> one<00:04:43.910> which<00:04:44.910> means<00:04:45.180> if<00:04:45.600> I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
of them there minus one which means if I

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.840 
of them there minus one which means if I
have<00:04:45.840> physically<00:04:46.410> set<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.890> address<00:04:47.070> one<00:04:47.580> on

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
have physically set it to address one on

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.750 
have physically set it to address one on
my<00:04:48.090> PTZ<00:04:48.660> camera<00:04:49.140> geo<00:04:50.040> vision<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.550> gonna

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
my PTZ camera geo vision is gonna

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.740 
my PTZ camera geo vision is gonna
recognize<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.450> as<00:04:52.130> address<00:04:53.130> zero<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:54.450> minus

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
recognize it as address zero so minus

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.440 
recognize it as address zero so minus
one<00:04:55.110> one<00:04:55.710> of<00:04:55.920> one<00:04:55.950> is<00:04:56.340> going<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.550> be<00:04:56.670> zero<00:04:56.970> so

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
one one of one is going to be zero so

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.640 
one one of one is going to be zero so
let's<00:04:57.660> say<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.840> set<00:04:58.140> your<00:04:58.290> ID<00:04:58.530> to<00:04:58.950> address<00:04:59.910> two

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
let's say you set your ID to address two

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.470 
let's say you set your ID to address two
minus<00:05:01.650> one<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:01.980> that<00:05:02.070> is<00:05:02.250> gonna<00:05:02.460> be<00:05:02.580> one<00:05:02.790> so

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
minus one of that is gonna be one so

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.360 
minus one of that is gonna be one so
whatever<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.230> physically<00:05:04.770> whatever<00:05:05.040> your

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
whatever you physically whatever your

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.880 
whatever you physically whatever your
addresses<00:05:05.850> on<00:05:06.120> your<00:05:06.150> PTZ<00:05:06.810> camera<00:05:07.170> if<00:05:07.350> you're

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
addresses on your PTZ camera if you're

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.800 
addresses on your PTZ camera if you're
using<00:05:08.100> on<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.340> geo<00:05:08.670> vision<00:05:08.970> software<00:05:09.300> just<00:05:09.630> do

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
using on a geo vision software just do

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.250 
using on a geo vision software just do
minus<00:05:10.290> one<00:05:10.530> so<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.790> said<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.240> address<00:05:12.540> one<00:05:12.780> it's

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
minus one so I said to address one it's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.940 
minus one so I said to address one it's
really<00:05:13.590> gonna<00:05:13.710> be<00:05:13.890> zero<00:05:14.310> on<00:05:14.610> my<00:05:15.410> on<00:05:16.410> my<00:05:16.470> geo

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
really gonna be zero on my on my geo

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.740 
really gonna be zero on my on my geo
vision<00:05:17.310> system<00:05:20.000> so<00:05:21.000> what<00:05:21.150> I'm<00:05:21.240> doing<00:05:21.300> if<00:05:21.630> I

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
vision system so what I'm doing if I

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.340 
vision system so what I'm doing if I
click<00:05:22.190> right<00:05:23.510> it's<00:05:24.510> gonna<00:05:24.690> move<00:05:24.960> over<00:05:25.140> a

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
click right it's gonna move over a

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.540 
click right it's gonna move over a
little<00:05:25.530> bit<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:27.530> if<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:28.590> click<00:05:28.800> laughs<00:05:29.040> you

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
little bit and if I click laughs you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.070 
little bit and if I click laughs you
know<00:05:29.640> it's<00:05:29.910> gonna<00:05:30.030> move<00:05:30.240> over<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.660> left

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
know it's gonna move over to the left

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.260 
know it's gonna move over to the left
Saamy<00:05:31.470> it's<00:05:32.100> it's<00:05:32.490> basically<00:05:32.910> pretty<00:05:33.150> simple

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
Saamy it's it's basically pretty simple

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.100 
Saamy it's it's basically pretty simple
once<00:05:34.170> you<00:05:34.290> have<00:05:34.470> all<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.770> right<00:05:34.920> information

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
once you have all the right information

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.630 
once you have all the right information
and<00:05:37.110> that's<00:05:37.380> basically<00:05:37.680> how<00:05:37.860> you<00:05:37.920> add<00:05:38.100> a<00:05:38.130> PTZ

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
and that's basically how you add a PTZ

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.020 
and that's basically how you add a PTZ
camera<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.150> your<00:05:39.270> geo<00:05:39.420> vision<00:05:39.750> system<00:05:41.030> make

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
camera to your geo vision system make
