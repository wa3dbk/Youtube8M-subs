modified nerf strongarm
I'll<00:00:04.920> go<00:00:05.130> over<00:00:05.250> all<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.850> internal

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
I'll go over all of the internal

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.379 
I'll go over all of the internal
modifications<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.980> paint<00:00:08.340> job<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.880> show<00:00:09.330> you

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
modifications the paint job and show you

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.209 
modifications the paint job and show you
at<00:00:09.599> firing

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.770 

first<00:00:14.219> I'll<00:00:14.490> start<00:00:14.639> off<00:00:14.910> by<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.360> over<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
first I'll start off by going over the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050 
first I'll start off by going over the
internal<00:00:16.260> modifications<00:00:17.099> I<00:00:17.430> didn't<00:00:17.910> actually

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
internal modifications I didn't actually

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.029 
internal modifications I didn't actually
do<00:00:18.450> anything<00:00:18.689> to<00:00:19.080> enhance<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.650> performance

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
do anything to enhance the performance

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.179 
do anything to enhance the performance
so<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.000> shooting<00:00:21.210> like<00:00:21.540> a<00:00:21.570> stock<00:00:21.990> stolen<00:00:22.560> but

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
so it's shooting like a stock stolen but

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.359 
so it's shooting like a stock stolen but
I<00:00:23.369> did<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:24.240> drop<00:00:24.660> clip<00:00:25.080> mod<00:00:25.320> which<00:00:25.950> allows

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I did do the drop clip mod which allows

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.580 
I did do the drop clip mod which allows
you<00:00:26.669> to<00:00:26.700> take<00:00:27.300> your<00:00:27.450> cylinder<00:00:27.930> completely<00:00:28.470> out

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
you to take your cylinder completely out

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
you to take your cylinder completely out
of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.770> blaster<00:00:29.270> if<00:00:30.270> you<00:00:30.509> have<00:00:30.720> multiple

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
of the blaster if you have multiple

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.090 
of the blaster if you have multiple
turrets<00:00:31.860> so<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.730> reload<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.239> faster

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
turrets so that you can reload it faster

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.620 
turrets so that you can reload it faster
the<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.640> out<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:35.969> turret<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.450> like

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the way you take out your turret is like

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.080 
the way you take out your turret is like
normal<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.410> push<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.950> orange<00:00:38.399> button<00:00:38.430> and

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
normal you push this orange button and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.930 
normal you push this orange button and
then<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:40.200> turret<00:00:41.070> will<00:00:41.219> come<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.550> except

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
then your turret will come out except

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.900 
then your turret will come out except
you<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.239> slide<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.700> then<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you can slide it out now and then you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.660 
you can slide it out now and then you
take<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.449> fresh<00:00:45.929> turret<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.589> insert<00:00:47.339> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
take your fresh turret and insert the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.040 
take your fresh turret and insert the
tip<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.649> turret<00:00:50.070> into<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.239> gray

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
tip of the turret into this little gray

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.259 
tip of the turret into this little gray
piece<00:00:52.350> right<00:00:52.620> there<00:00:52.859> and<00:00:53.070> it'll<00:00:53.489> swing<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.120> in

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
piece right there and it'll swing up in

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.000 
piece right there and it'll swing up in
there<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.109> have<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.469> press<00:00:55.769> the<00:00:55.980> button

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
there but you have to press the button

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
there but you have to press the button
in<00:00:56.550> order<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.210> push<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.659> back<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
in order to push it back in like that I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.970 
in order to push it back in like that I
made<00:00:59.249> this<00:00:59.489> turret<00:00:59.969> by<00:01:00.329> first<00:01:00.929> taking<00:01:01.499> apart

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
made this turret by first taking apart

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.820 
made this turret by first taking apart
the<00:01:02.159> thing<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.870> two<00:01:04.290> screws

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the thing because there are two screws

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.790 
the thing because there are two screws
in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.610> bottom<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.690> and<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.680> you

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
in the bottom right here and if you

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.560 
in the bottom right here and if you
unscrew<00:01:08.280> both<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.610> those<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.120> pull<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
unscrew both of those you can pull the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
unscrew both of those you can pull the
turret<00:01:09.900> apart<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.340> need<00:01:11.550> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
turret apart and then you need to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.760 
turret apart and then you need to
unscrew<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> screw<00:01:12.960> that's<00:01:13.140> holding<00:01:13.290> this

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
unscrew a screw that's holding this

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
unscrew a screw that's holding this
piece<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.340> once<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.870> take

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
piece in once you do that you can take

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.450 
piece in once you do that you can take
off<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.320> gray<00:01:16.979> piece<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.360> actually<00:01:19.460> glued

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
off that gray piece and I actually glued

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.300 
off that gray piece and I actually glued
it<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.149> so<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.990> guides<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.710> orange

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it to there so that it guides the orange

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.060 
it to there so that it guides the orange
piece<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.079> that's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
piece in on the back and that's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.880 
piece in on the back and that's
basically<00:01:26.549> how<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.939> made<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.439> took

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
basically how I made this I just took

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.340 
basically how I made this I just took
out<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.399> piece<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:30.060> usually<00:01:30.600> swings<00:01:31.079> out

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
out the piece that usually swings out

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.600 
out the piece that usually swings out
and<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.490> also<00:01:32.820> had<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> cut<00:01:33.659> down<00:01:33.899> this<00:01:34.770> part<00:01:35.159> so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and I also had to cut down this part so

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.999 
and I also had to cut down this part so
that<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.939> swings<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.479> further<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.680> said

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that it swings out further and I said

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.889 
that it swings out further and I said
and<00:01:38.159> did<00:01:38.369> down<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.149> little<00:01:39.329> nub<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
and did down the little nub that

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.260 
and did down the little nub that
prevents<00:01:40.289> you<00:01:40.380> from<00:01:40.439> pulling<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.009> out<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.180> if

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
prevents you from pulling it out so if

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.389 
prevents you from pulling it out so if
you<00:01:42.390> want<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.719> make<00:01:43.049> these<00:01:43.289> they're<00:01:43.799> actually

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you want to make these they're actually

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.440 
you want to make these they're actually
quite<00:01:44.670> simple<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.869> take<00:01:46.079> them<00:01:46.229> apart<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
quite simple just take them apart and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
quite simple just take them apart and
just<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> play<00:01:49.200> around<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.829> until

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
just kind of play around with it until

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.310 
just kind of play around with it until
they<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:52.079> kind

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
they look kind of like this I was kind

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.060 
they look kind of like this I was kind
of<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.869> spectacular

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
of going for not a spectacular

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.440 
of going for not a spectacular
performing<00:01:56.070> blaster<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.240> just

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
performing blaster but one that just

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510 
performing blaster but one that just
looked<00:01:57.659> very<00:01:57.750> cool<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.799> think<00:01:59.039> this<00:01:59.219> looks

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
looked very cool and I think this looks

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.209 
looked very cool and I think this looks
very<00:01:59.759> cool<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.619> droplet<00:02:01.619> mod<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.009> very

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
very cool and the droplet mod is very

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.370 
very cool and the droplet mod is very
unique<00:02:02.609> now<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.570> I've<00:02:03.689> gone<00:02:03.899> over<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
unique now that I've gone over the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.980 
unique now that I've gone over the
modifications<00:02:05.130> I'll<00:02:05.429> tell<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.630> paints

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
modifications I'll tell you what paints

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
modifications I'll tell you what paints
I<00:02:07.049> used<00:02:07.289> for<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> paint<00:02:07.799> job<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.000> strong

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
I used for the paint job so this strong

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.140 
I used for the paint job so this strong
arm<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.750> painted<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:11.130> stock<00:02:11.370> strong<00:02:11.700> arm<00:02:11.940> is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
arm is painted the stock strong arm is

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.110 
arm is painted the stock strong arm is
usually<00:02:12.570> blue<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.990> white<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.830> I<00:02:14.160> put<00:02:14.550> down<00:02:14.760> a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
usually blue and white so I put down a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.750 
usually blue and white so I put down a
rust-oleum<00:02:15.660> gray<00:02:16.200> primer<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.250> base<00:02:17.460> coat

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
rust-oleum gray primer as the base coat

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.390 
rust-oleum gray primer as the base coat
and<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.690> went<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.080> very<00:02:19.350> well<00:02:19.710> I've<00:02:20.130> been

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
and that went on very well I've been

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.309 
and that went on very well I've been
using<00:02:20.640> rust-oleum<00:02:21.180> paints<00:02:21.780> because<00:02:22.140> they're

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
using rust-oleum paints because they're

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.020 
using rust-oleum paints because they're
a<00:02:22.349> little<00:02:22.650> cheaper<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.280> then<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.519> vinyl<00:02:23.849> dye

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
a little cheaper and then the vinyl dye

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.089 
a little cheaper and then the vinyl dye
stuff<00:02:24.409> actually<00:02:25.409> there

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
stuff actually there

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.330 
stuff actually there
half<00:02:26.700> as<00:02:26.989> expensive<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.290> I'm<00:02:28.590> starting<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.159> use

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
half as expensive so I'm starting to use

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.199 
half as expensive so I'm starting to use
this<00:02:29.609> and<00:02:29.939> it<00:02:30.749> applied<00:02:31.469> very<00:02:31.769> well<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.400> I'm

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
this and it applied very well and I'm

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.809 
this and it applied very well and I'm
pretty<00:02:33.989> happy<00:02:34.170> with<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.439> finish<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.040> then<00:02:35.609> on

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
pretty happy with the finish and then on

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.399 
pretty happy with the finish and then on
top<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.480> gray<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.139> have<00:02:37.530> red<00:02:38.280> detailing<00:02:38.760> in

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.709 
top of the gray I have red detailing in
wildrider<00:02:40.409> read<00:02:40.829> by<00:02:41.099> Citadel<00:02:41.609> then<00:02:42.389> after

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
wildrider read by Citadel then after

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.080 
wildrider read by Citadel then after
that<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.139> did<00:02:43.409> a<00:02:43.620> dry<00:02:44.310> brushing<00:02:44.790> which<00:02:44.969> is

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
that I did a dry brushing which is

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.390 
that I did a dry brushing which is
basically<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.750> dip<00:02:46.530> my<00:02:46.560> brush<00:02:46.889> in<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.159> little

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
basically I dip my brush in a little

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.149 
basically I dip my brush in a little
paint<00:02:47.639> and<00:02:47.849> then<00:02:48.060> dried<00:02:48.329> it<00:02:48.480> off<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:49.159> brushed

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
paint and then dried it off and brushed

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.569 
paint and then dried it off and brushed
over<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.609> so<00:02:50.819> it<00:02:50.909> gets<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.799> silver<00:02:52.799> kind<00:02:53.400> of

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
over it so it gets this silver kind of

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.239 
over it so it gets this silver kind of
brushed<00:02:54.150> texture<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.799> makes<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.219> look

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:56.249 
brushed texture and it makes it look

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:09.610 
brushed texture and it makes it look
pretty<00:02:56.579> cool<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.510> now<00:02:57.659> onto<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.230> firing<00:02:58.469> demo

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.309 

and<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:12.239> course<00:03:12.480> once<00:03:12.719> you're<00:03:12.870> done<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.290> can

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
and of course once you're done you can

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.789 
and of course once you're done you can
remove<00:03:13.919> your<00:03:14.189> cylinder<00:03:14.669> completely<00:03:15.299> and

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
remove your cylinder completely and

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.619 
remove your cylinder completely and
insert<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.829> new<00:03:16.949> one<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.519> have<00:03:17.699> one<00:03:20.480> keep<00:03:21.480> in

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
insert a new one if you have one keep in

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.809 
insert a new one if you have one keep in
mind<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.169> stock<00:03:22.560> strong<00:03:22.949> arm<00:03:23.189> so<00:03:23.519> it's

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
mind it is a stock strong arm so it's

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.849 
mind it is a stock strong arm so it's
not<00:03:24.030> shooting<00:03:24.359> better<00:03:24.659> than<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.169> stock<00:03:25.500> form

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
not shooting better than in stock form

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.399 
not shooting better than in stock form
but<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.699> think<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.419> dropped<00:03:27.719> clip<00:03:27.989> mod<00:03:28.169> is

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
but I think that you dropped clip mod is

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.550 
but I think that you dropped clip mod is
very<00:03:28.650> unique<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:30.269> really<00:03:31.049> fun<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.319> play
