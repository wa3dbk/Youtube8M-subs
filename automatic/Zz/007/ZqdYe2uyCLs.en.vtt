health food or troll dolls let's just

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.210 
health food or troll dolls let's just
all<00:01:27.180> agree<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.840> forget<00:01:28.470> about<00:01:28.500> climate<00:01:29.190> change

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
all agree to forget about climate change

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.650 
all agree to forget about climate change
and<00:01:29.730> hope<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.150> goes<00:01:30.300> away

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
and hope it goes away

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.620 
and hope it goes away
I<00:01:30.900> had<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.860> great<00:01:32.220> troll<00:01:32.790> doll<00:01:33.000> collection<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I had a great troll doll collection I

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
had one with a bikini wind is God's way

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
of balancing heat wind is the way you

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.910 
of balancing heat wind is the way you
shift<00:01:39.360> heat<00:01:39.660> from<00:01:39.900> areas<00:01:40.260> where<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.650> hotter

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
shift heat from areas where it's hotter

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.260 
shift heat from areas where it's hotter
to<00:01:41.130> areas<00:01:41.490> where<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.820> cooler

that's what wind is wouldn't it be

that's what wind is wouldn't it be
ironic<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:45.300> in<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.690> interest<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.229> global
