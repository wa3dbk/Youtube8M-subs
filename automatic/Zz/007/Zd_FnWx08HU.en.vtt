 Mrs Claire, we want to go with her

 There are questions from the journalists beginning 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.610

 party to any fear opponents and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.459
 if so, how do you handle it? 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.030
 as an opponent I think there is everywhere 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.400
 We also have some but you go 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.010
 the game because I exactly one 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.670
 other players also bottles 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.100
 a little more elan and a little more 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.190
 This feeling necessarily win 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.190
 have to 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.680
 what do you have in common ? 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.720
 move team 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.459
 some of us go shut mountain school 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.470
 no more 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.180
 So that's how many of these schools are 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.769
 go to the neighborhood school together 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.489
 they are all always 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.299
 well shit a lot else think 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.360
 I actually all reasonably good 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:01.030
 Soccer 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.280
 schmidt from the strong folder of the vbb question 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.319
 to claire you are a pure one 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.099
 girl team which tell the guys to 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.440
 your play 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.670
 So there are two sides that say one 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.670
 The knicks are just for men 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.890
 and guys thought was with because there are 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.269
 cool to say I find the people 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.239
 great combo once or so can see 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:31.829
 the atoms interact and because he is 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:34.180
 one that people do not always hear nothing 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.359
 what can you get involved with 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.980
 to dream girl football forward so we 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.519
 can do a lot of advertising 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.130
 go to school and say if we 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.269
 middle teams that's where people come from 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.150
 and I think it's still fun 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.480
 to train with it and how it stands 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:58.150
 because to the women national team 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:01.870
 I'm so interested in the others 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.329
 have already looked partially has 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.040
 you have the time and I think so 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.540
 good that meanwhile more 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.160
 is shown as earlier and I have to 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.049
 also a bit more for advertising 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
 do 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.030
 Some things will be done by women 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.030
 just nothing 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.970
 they still have a pure one 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.130
 girl's team why do not you have one ? 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.600
 they have eberhard team internal 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.970
 details are not blurred 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.290
 But it does interest our audience like that 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.730
 very much they betray something 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.730
 I do not care what the audience 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.650
 No comment 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.720
 in the picture on sunday you often hear 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:56.120
 hasbergen play this one men 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:56.120
 call what betrayed 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.690
 I stand here in front of the cabin 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.620
 girl team success times have seen 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.400
 me something about the eberhard 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.400
 find out 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.419
 So I have from the beginning very much 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.830
 well felt all were nice to me and 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.820
 I immediately tried the game 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.030
 integrate 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.860
 schmidt from steel in heven league 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.450
 already heard together and 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.440
 she had as a community 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.570
 come together 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.190
 So the team was founded in 2008 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.940
 and was in different mixed 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.160
 men 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.020
 and then we had part of us now 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.940
 Already then played together and came 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.040
 even from the circle of friends is the 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.440
 School classes and of course there were 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.840
 departures again but yes it does happen 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.130
 quite a few new ones 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.380
 no one else asks then I thank you 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.550
 very cordial with the lokalisten and 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:04.199
 also as we said for that for the 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:06.250
 press conference and even if new 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.710
 do you think it makes and football? 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.750
 difference where you come so it goes 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.870
 it is not about origin that you 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.130
 play together and have fun 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.110
 Well not really so I think 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.900
 Football should be fun in the foot ways 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.979
 all the same I do not think so 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.630
 on the place that does not matter 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.010
 it does not matter who you just come 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.010
 that you become a game
