00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.670 
crazy when you combine the two together
and<00:01:09.940> that's<00:01:10.659> why<00:01:10.869> I'm<00:01:11.049> making<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.470> chocolate

peanut<00:01:12.190> butter<00:01:12.220> tart<00:01:12.759> we're<00:01:13.750> going<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:14.020> start

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
peanut butter tart we're going to start

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.260 
peanut butter tart we're going to start
by<00:01:14.440> making<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.950> peanut<00:01:15.250> butter<00:01:15.280> crust<00:01:15.850> it's<00:01:16.180> a

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
by making the peanut butter crust it's a

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.139 
by making the peanut butter crust it's a
cookie<00:01:16.600> crust<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.740> start<00:01:18.190> by<00:01:18.460> weighing<00:01:18.909> the

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
cookie crust and I start by weighing the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.999 
cookie crust and I start by weighing the
flower<00:01:19.509> of<00:01:19.840> course<00:01:20.170> you<00:01:20.259> can<00:01:20.409> measure<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.770> too

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
flower of course you can measure it too

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.160 
flower of course you can measure it too
but<00:01:21.430> weighing<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.850> faster<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.570> always<00:01:22.960> more

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
but weighing is faster and always more

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.830 
but weighing is faster and always more
precise<00:01:23.619> i'm<00:01:24.550> using<00:01:25.030> bleached<00:01:25.300> all-purpose

half ounces right on the nose okay and

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.609 
half ounces right on the nose okay and
I'm<00:01:32.590> going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.009> combine<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.670> with<00:01:34.320> baking<00:01:35.320> soda

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
I'm going to combine it with baking soda

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.779 
I'm going to combine it with baking soda
and<00:01:35.830> salt<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:38.410> it's<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.649> baking<00:01:39.009> soda<00:01:39.310> that's

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
and salt and it's a baking soda that's

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.400 
and salt and it's a baking soda that's
going<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.210> make<00:01:40.330> this<00:01:40.509> quest<00:01:40.810> a<00:01:40.960> beautiful

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
going to make this quest a beautiful

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.219 
going to make this quest a beautiful
rich<00:01:41.649> reddish<00:01:42.399> color<00:01:42.750> sift<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:43.899> together

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
rich reddish color sift it together

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.290 
rich reddish color sift it together
because<00:01:44.500> baking<00:01:45.340> soda<00:01:45.580> is<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.789> tendency<00:01:46.000> to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
because baking soda is a tendency to

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.350 
because baking soda is a tendency to
clump<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.899> by<00:01:47.380> sifting<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:48.039> it<00:01:48.759> will<00:01:48.909> break<00:01:49.119> it

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
clump and by sifting it it will break it

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.570 
clump and by sifting it it will break it
up<00:01:49.509> but<00:01:50.319> if<00:01:50.440> you<00:01:50.710> won't<00:01:50.890> mix<00:01:51.130> one<00:01:51.310> hundred

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
up but if you won't mix one hundred

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.740 
up but if you won't mix one hundred
percent<00:01:51.610> evenly<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.200> do<00:01:53.350> with<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.770> whisk

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
percent evenly that I do with the whisk

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.510 
percent evenly that I do with the whisk
this<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:55.990> very<00:01:56.319> quick<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.860> simple<00:01:57.039> crust

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
this is a very quick and simple crust

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.130 
this is a very quick and simple crust
and<00:01:57.700> it's<00:01:58.149> just<00:01:58.330> going<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.479> be<00:01:58.539> pressed<00:01:58.960> into

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and it's just going to be pressed into

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.859 
and it's just going to be pressed into
the<00:01:59.319> shell<00:01:59.619> so<00:01:59.890> nothing<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.640> be<00:02:00.759> afraid<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:01.060> but

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
the shell so nothing to be afraid of but

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.210 
the shell so nothing to be afraid of but
what<00:02:01.989> makes<00:02:02.200> it<00:02:02.349> really<00:02:02.500> delicious<00:02:02.920> because

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
what makes it really delicious because

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.889 
what makes it really delicious because
it's<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.429> peanut<00:02:03.700> butter<00:02:03.789> cookie<00:02:04.060> basically<00:02:04.750> is

it's a peanut butter cookie basically is

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.790 
it's a peanut butter cookie basically is
that<00:02:05.649> I<00:02:05.709> used<00:02:05.950> part<00:02:06.340> light<00:02:06.610> brown<00:02:06.880> sugar<00:02:06.910> and

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
that I used part light brown sugar and

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.820 
that I used part light brown sugar and
part<00:02:08.800> refined<00:02:09.280> sugar<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:11.349> a<00:02:11.380> refined

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
part refined sugar and with a refined

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.630 
part refined sugar and with a refined
sugar<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:13.000> already<00:02:13.330> very<00:02:13.450> fine<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:15.160> the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
sugar it's already very fine but the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.550 
sugar it's already very fine but the
brown<00:02:15.910> sugar<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.480> coarser<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.170> I'm<00:02:17.260> going<00:02:17.440> to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
brown sugar is coarser so I'm going to

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.770 
brown sugar is coarser so I'm going to
process<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.129> two<00:02:18.280> together<00:02:18.430> until<00:02:19.270> they're

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
process the two together until they're

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.930 
process the two together until they're
really<00:02:20.140> nice<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.590> super<00:02:21.010> fine<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.520> that's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
really nice and super fine and that's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.520 
really nice and super fine and that's
what<00:02:22.120> makes<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.510> cookie<00:02:22.870> or<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.260> cookie

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
what makes the cookie or the cookie

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.340 
what makes the cookie or the cookie
crust<00:02:23.910> really<00:02:24.910> tender

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.590 

so<00:02:28.710> let's<00:02:28.920> just<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.280> processed<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> minute

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
so let's just get processed for a minute

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.020 
so let's just get processed for a minute
or<00:02:30.750> two<00:02:30.960> until<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.800> really<00:02:32.130> fun<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.700> then

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
or two until it's really fun and then

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.120 
or two until it's really fun and then
with<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.720> motor<00:02:33.960> going<00:02:34.290> I'm<00:02:34.650> going<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.010> add

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
with the motor going I'm going to add

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.070 
with the motor going I'm going to add
the<00:02:35.280> butter<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.410> cut<00:02:37.650> into<00:02:37.890> two<00:02:38.070> pieces

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.810 

and<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.530> can<00:02:42.710> see<00:02:42.860> immediately<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.640> gets

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
and you can see immediately it gets

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.790 
and you can see immediately it gets
absorbed<00:02:44.060> into<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.720> sugars<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.780> now<00:02:48.770> a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
absorbed into the sugars and now a

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.220 
absorbed into the sugars and now a
peanut<00:02:49.400> butter<00:02:49.520> goes<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.930> creamy

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
peanut butter goes in and this is creamy

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
mixture it just gets pulsed together

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.870

you want to make cookies instead of the
crust<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.580> roll<00:03:31.790> them<00:03:31.940> into<00:03:32.030> little<00:03:32.209> balls

and<00:03:32.840> bake<00:03:33.440> them<00:03:33.650> on<00:03:33.740> a<00:03:33.770> cookie<00:03:33.950> sheet<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:40.010> can

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
and bake them on a cookie sheet you can

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.370 
and bake them on a cookie sheet you can
see<00:03:40.340> there's<00:03:40.520> still<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.730> little<00:03:40.820> bit<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.090> flour

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
see there's still a little bit of flour

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.449 
see there's still a little bit of flour
just<00:03:42.380> scoop<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:42.800> in<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.990> because<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.100> is<00:03:46.280> so

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
just scoop it in and because this is so

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.080 
just scoop it in and because this is so
soft<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.120> always<00:03:47.450> refrigerate<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.530> crust<00:03:49.090> for

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
soft I always refrigerate the crust for

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.420 
soft I always refrigerate the crust for
half<00:03:50.690> hour<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:51.110> could<00:03:51.230> do<00:03:51.320> it<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.620> day<00:03:51.860> just

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
half hour you could do it for a day just

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.280 
half hour you could do it for a day just
to<00:03:52.610> firm<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:52.880> up<00:03:53.090> because<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.720> can<00:03:53.900> see<00:03:54.080> that<00:03:54.260> a

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
to firm it up because you can see that a

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.410 
to firm it up because you can see that a
crust<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:55.160> soft<00:03:55.519> is<00:03:55.760> going<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:55.970> be<00:03:56.060> hard<00:03:56.330> to

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
crust this soft is going to be hard to

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.160 
crust this soft is going to be hard to
present<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.019> a<00:03:57.050> pan<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.600> can<00:03:59.780> see<00:03:59.989> that

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
present to a pan so you can see that

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.900 
present to a pan so you can see that
this<00:04:00.320> is<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.769> way<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:00.980> looks<00:04:01.190> after<00:04:01.700> it's<00:04:01.820> been

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
this is the way it looks after it's been

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.550 
this is the way it looks after it's been
sitting<00:04:02.120> at<00:04:02.269> room<00:04:02.390> temperature<00:04:02.900> or<00:04:03.140> when<00:04:03.410> it's

sitting at room temperature or when it's

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.340 
sitting at room temperature or when it's
chilled<00:04:03.910> we<00:04:04.910> wanted<00:04:05.209> to<00:04:05.330> prepare<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.870> pan<00:04:06.080> to

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
chilled we wanted to prepare the pan to

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.170 
chilled we wanted to prepare the pan to
make<00:04:06.470> sure<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.550> crust<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:07.940> going<00:04:08.120> to

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
make sure that the crust is going to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.150 
make sure that the crust is going to
come<00:04:08.360> out<00:04:08.390> beautifully<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.050> in<00:04:09.140> one<00:04:09.320> piece<00:04:09.620> so

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
come out beautifully and in one piece so

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.130 
come out beautifully and in one piece so
either<00:04:10.370> we<00:04:10.610> can<00:04:10.760> grease<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.269> flour<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:11.750> where

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
either we can grease and flour it where

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.780 
either we can grease and flour it where
we<00:04:12.290> can<00:04:12.470> spray<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:12.890> with<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.160> little<00:04:13.459> spray

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
we can spray it with a little spray

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.300 
we can spray it with a little spray
preferably<00:04:14.330> one<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:14.959> has<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.620> grease<00:04:16.070> and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
preferably one that has the grease and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.030 
preferably one that has the grease and
the<00:04:16.519> flour<00:04:16.790> already<00:04:17.390> in<00:04:17.480> it<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.919> if<00:04:18.919> this

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
the flour already in it and if this

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.099 
the flour already in it and if this
seems<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.459> be<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.580> little<00:04:19.760> bit<00:04:19.880> of<00:04:20.000> extra<00:04:20.239> just

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
seems to be a little bit of extra just

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.030 
seems to be a little bit of extra just
take<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.380> paper<00:04:21.680> towel<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.340> dab<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.390> out<00:04:24.040> it

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
take a paper towel and dab it out it

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.380 
take a paper towel and dab it out it
wouldn't<00:04:25.220> matter<00:04:25.400> if<00:04:25.520> you<00:04:25.669> left<00:04:25.910> it<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:26.270> it's

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
wouldn't matter if you left it but it's

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.030 
wouldn't matter if you left it but it's
easier<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.840> press<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.229> question<00:04:27.680> when<00:04:27.919> it's

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
easier to press the question when it's

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.600 
easier to press the question when it's
not<00:04:28.190> too<00:04:28.490> greasy<00:04:29.919> now<00:04:30.919> this<00:04:31.070> makes<00:04:31.280> quite<00:04:31.580> a

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
not too greasy now this makes quite a

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.180 
not too greasy now this makes quite a
bit<00:04:31.850> of<00:04:32.060> cookie<00:04:32.390> crust<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.770> could<00:04:33.950> be<00:04:34.100> even

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
bit of cookie crust and it could be even

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.400 
bit of cookie crust and it could be even
enough<00:04:34.520> for<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.729> 10<00:04:34.970> inch<00:04:35.150> pan<00:04:35.450> so<00:04:35.810> what<00:04:36.140> I<00:04:36.169> do<00:04:36.290> is

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
enough for a 10 inch pan so what I do is

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.550 
enough for a 10 inch pan so what I do is
I<00:04:36.620> press<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:37.100> in<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.180> nice<00:04:38.450> fine<00:04:38.930> even<00:04:39.229> layer

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
I press it in to a nice fine even layer

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.400 
I press it in to a nice fine even layer
and<00:04:39.830> then<00:04:40.729> whatever<00:04:41.330> is<00:04:41.540> left<00:04:41.930> over<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.290> just

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410
