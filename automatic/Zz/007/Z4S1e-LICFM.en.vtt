okay<00:00:03.060> in<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:03.570> I'm<00:00:03.929> going<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.259> show<00:00:04.529> you

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay in this video I'm going to show you

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.579 
okay in this video I'm going to show you
how<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.460> build<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.060> very<00:00:06.420> small<00:00:06.810> binary

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
how to build a very small binary

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.459 
how to build a very small binary
encounter<00:00:08.480> first<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.840> all<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.170> have<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.349> do

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
encounter first you all you have to do

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.650 
encounter first you all you have to do
is<00:00:10.590> start<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> sticky<00:00:11.820> piston<00:00:12.000> pointing

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
is start with a sticky piston pointing

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.750 
is start with a sticky piston pointing
up<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.559> repeater<00:00:14.330> pointing<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.420> towards<00:00:15.630> it

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
up and repeater pointing in towards it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.779 
up and repeater pointing in towards it
just<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:17.970> block<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.390> top<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.960> that's<00:00:19.230> your

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
just one block on top and that's your

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.810 
just one block on top and that's your
single<00:00:20.789> segment<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:22.460> other<00:00:23.460> binary

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
single segment of your other binary

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.000 
single segment of your other binary
counter<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.500> don't<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> pulse

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
counter but if you don't have a pulse

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.099 
counter but if you don't have a pulse
limiter<00:00:26.400> then<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.939> will<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.359> first<00:00:27.720> segment

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
limiter then it will the first segment

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.279 
limiter then it will the first segment
will<00:00:28.529> always<00:00:28.890> act<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> pulsar<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:31.260> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
will always act as a pulsar I like to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.470 
will always act as a pulsar I like to
put<00:00:31.560> sand<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:31.920> top<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.880> just<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.120> case<00:00:33.329> it

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
put sand on top you're just in case it

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.380 
put sand on top you're just in case it
gets<00:00:33.540> stuck<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:33.930> there<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> if<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> add<00:00:37.110> on

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
gets stuck up there so if you add on

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.590 
gets stuck up there so if you add on
more<00:00:39.860> segments<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.820> easily<00:00:42.120> extend

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
more segments that you can easily extend

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:55.270 
more segments that you can easily extend
up<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.660> very<00:00:48.989> modular

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.280 

so<00:00:55.850> when<00:00:56.000> top<00:00:56.300> 200<00:00:59.410> one

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
so when top 200 one

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.750 
so when top 200 one
two

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.180 

three

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.410 

for

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.020 

I've

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.640 

6

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
6

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.970 
6
7<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.750> loose<00:01:21.750> back<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> 0<00:01:23.630> but<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.620> if<00:01:25.800> you

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
7 and loose back to 0 but now see if you

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.240 
7 and loose back to 0 but now see if you
you<00:01:26.700> try<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.750> run<00:01:27.900> power<00:01:28.170> directly<00:01:28.710> through

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
you try to run power directly through

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
you try to run power directly through
with<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.820> blocks<00:01:30.770> like<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.510> so<00:01:33.510> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
with one of the blocks like so so that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.230 
with one of the blocks like so so that
you<00:01:33.690> can<00:01:33.870> detect<00:01:34.230> where<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.530> is

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.090 

then<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.420> will<00:01:41.110> will<00:01:42.110> run<00:01:42.320> fuel<00:01:42.560> run<00:01:42.800> through

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
then it will will run fuel run through

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.020 
then it will will run fuel run through
and<00:01:43.580> it's<00:01:43.729> up<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:45.650> won't<00:01:45.920> look<00:01:46.190> because<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:46.940> a

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
and it's up it won't look because of a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.980 
and it's up it won't look because of a
bug<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.570> piston<00:01:47.990> will<00:01:48.170> stay<00:01:48.440> up<00:01:49.570> so<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:50.630> can't

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
bug the piston will stay up so you can't

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.819 
bug the piston will stay up so you can't
do<00:01:51.170> that<00:01:52.060> break<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.180> counter

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.010 

but<00:02:00.829> what<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.009> can<00:02:01.310> do<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:02.929> put<00:02:03.679> some<00:02:03.829> sand<00:02:04.189> on

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
but what you can do is put some sand on

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.369 
but what you can do is put some sand on
the<00:02:06.020> top<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:07.420> run<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.450> current<00:02:08.840> through<00:02:09.019> with

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
the top and run a current through with

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:20.840 
the top and run a current through with
that<00:02:09.410> instead

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:35.110 

you

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.180 

make<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.409> is<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.720> very<00:02:38.720> very<00:02:39.170> small<00:02:39.349> compact

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
make it is a very very small compact

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:52.479 
make it is a very very small compact
very<00:02:41.090> counting<00:02:42.370> line

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.270 

in<00:02:53.489> total<00:02:53.700> each<00:02:53.940> segment<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.540> takes<00:02:55.280> two

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
in total each segment or takes two

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.420 
in total each segment or takes two
repeaters<00:02:56.640> one<00:02:57.390> torch<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.080> one<00:02:58.680> biston<00:02:59.069> with

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
repeaters one torch and one biston with

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.290 
repeaters one torch and one biston with
some<00:02:59.640> sand<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.150> blocks

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.750 

but<00:03:08.300> whenever<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:09.130> may<00:03:10.130> want<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.490> invert<00:03:10.700> your

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
but whenever the may want to invert your

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.320 
but whenever the may want to invert your
output<00:03:11.270> because<00:03:12.340> whenever<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:14.090> means

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
output because whenever it's on it means

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.900 
output because whenever it's on it means
zero<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.500> inverted<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.490> would<00:03:16.580> make<00:03:16.730> more

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
zero so this inverted it would make more

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.350 
zero so this inverted it would make more
sense

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.930 

two

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.570 

now<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.240> look<00:03:26.900> closer<00:03:27.200> at<00:03:27.470> how<00:03:30.520> how<00:03:31.520> the

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
now if you look closer at how how the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.110 
now if you look closer at how how the
system<00:03:32.000> works<00:03:33.550> then<00:03:34.550> you<00:03:34.670> can<00:03:34.850> start<00:03:35.030> to

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
system works then you can start to

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:51.300 
system works then you can start to
understand<00:03:35.630> why<00:03:36.260> orgs

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.890 

so<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:54.580> get<00:03:54.670> well<00:03:54.880> we<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.150> ignore<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.750> first

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
so you get well we can ignore the first

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.809 
so you get well we can ignore the first
block<00:03:56.170> because<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.830> what<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.280> acting<00:03:57.640> as<00:03:57.730> a

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
block because that what is acting as a

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.540 
block because that what is acting as a
pulse<00:03:58.030> imager<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.940> it's<00:04:01.060> sending<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.360> pulse<00:04:01.630> i

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
pulse imager so it's sending the pulse i

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.280 
pulse imager so it's sending the pulse i
think<00:04:03.550> i<00:04:03.580> will<00:04:03.640> explain<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.180> so<00:04:04.810> as<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.080> sends

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
think i will explain this so as it sends

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.710 
think i will explain this so as it sends
in<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.410> pulse<00:04:05.650> here<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.910> pushes<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.480> block

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
in the pulse here it pushes the block

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.900 
in the pulse here it pushes the block
the<00:04:07.900> piston<00:04:08.230> block<00:04:08.410> up<00:04:08.590> because<00:04:09.010> soon<00:04:09.519> as<00:04:09.730> it

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
the piston block up because soon as it

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.759 
the piston block up because soon as it
pushes<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.180> block<00:04:10.450> piston<00:04:10.870> this<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.620> push

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
pushes a block piston this is it push

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.640 
pushes a block piston this is it push
it's<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:11.980> block<00:04:12.220> up<00:04:12.630> then<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:13.810> stops<00:04:14.170> letting

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
it's a block up then it stops letting

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.800 
it's a block up then it stops letting
the<00:04:14.739> power<00:04:14.950> through<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.849> this<00:04:15.970> repeater<00:04:16.359> so<00:04:16.720> it

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
the power through to this repeater so it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.920 
the power through to this repeater so it
gives<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.109> only<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.560> very<00:04:17.799> small<00:04:17.980> tick<00:04:18.780> just<00:04:19.780> one

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
gives it only a very small tick just one

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.400 
gives it only a very small tick just one
tick<00:04:20.169> through<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.700> rescue<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:22.180> bits<00:04:25.410> and

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
tick through to the rescue of bits and

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.740 
tick through to the rescue of bits and
whenever<00:04:26.889> one<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.370> these<00:04:27.550> pulses<00:04:27.970> then<00:04:28.630> it

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
whenever one of these pulses then it

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.180 
whenever one of these pulses then it
will<00:04:28.930> trigger<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:29.260> pissed<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.770> front<00:04:30.010> of<00:04:30.070> it

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
will trigger the pissed in front of it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.100 
will trigger the pissed in front of it
but<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.700> power<00:04:30.940> will<00:04:31.210> only<00:04:31.419> go<00:04:31.690> through<00:04:31.960> if

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
but the power will only go through if

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.540 
but the power will only go through if
the<00:04:32.229> place<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.590> block<00:04:32.830> isn't<00:04:33.070> working

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
the place of the block isn't working

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.590 
the place of the block isn't working
down<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:35.080> right<00:04:35.320> now<00:04:35.850> it<00:04:36.850> will<00:04:37.000> toggle<00:04:37.210> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
down so right now it will toggle the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.930 
down so right now it will toggle the
first<00:04:37.840> one<00:04:38.430> here<00:04:39.990> at<00:04:40.990> end<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.710> though<00:04:42.610> the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
first one here at end it though the

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.580 
first one here at end it though the
power<00:04:43.450> will<00:04:43.720> be<00:04:43.750> let<00:04:44.020> through<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.290> block

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
power will be let through the block

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.469 
power will be let through the block
because<00:04:45.100> it's<00:04:45.280> down<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.760> it<00:04:46.210> will<00:04:46.300> toggle

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
because it's down and it will toggle

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.730 
because it's down and it will toggle
this<00:04:46.840> one<00:04:47.080> this<00:04:47.430> piston<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.580> as<00:04:48.790> well<00:04:49.740> leaving

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
this one this piston it as well leaving

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.890 
this one this piston it as well leaving
us<00:04:51.040> with<00:04:51.280> two<00:04:52.169> but<00:04:53.169> now<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:55.030> will<00:04:55.210> only<00:04:55.240> toggle

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
us with two but now it will only toggle

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.900 
us with two but now it will only toggle
the<00:04:55.960> first<00:04:56.200> one<00:04:56.410> because<00:04:57.039> it<00:04:57.340> can't<00:04:57.610> go

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
the first one because it can't go

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.810 
the first one because it can't go
through<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.450> block<00:04:58.660> since<00:04:59.169> it's<00:04:59.350> up

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
through the block since it's up

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.210 
through the block since it's up
so<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.450> toggle<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.960> head<00:05:02.110> now<00:05:02.980> you<00:05:03.040> have

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
so you toggle the head now you have

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.220 
so you toggle the head now you have
three<00:05:03.270> now<00:05:04.270> see<00:05:04.450> it<00:05:04.570> will<00:05:04.690> go<00:05:04.780> through<00:05:05.080> the

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
three now see it will go through the

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.780 
three now see it will go through the
first<00:05:05.380> one<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.830> toggle<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:06.550> we'll<00:05:06.670> go

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
first one and toggle it and we'll go

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.360 
first one and toggle it and we'll go
through<00:05:06.870> to<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.050> second<00:05:08.440> one<00:05:08.470> toggle<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.190> as

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
through to the second one toggle that as

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.700 
through to the second one toggle that as
well<00:05:09.660> automatically<00:05:10.660> are<00:05:10.870> you<00:05:10.930> setting<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.350> to

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
well automatically are you setting it to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:22.080 
well automatically are you setting it to
0<00:05:14.640> you<00:05:15.640> see<00:05:15.670> how<00:05:15.910> useful<00:05:16.120> this<00:05:16.390> could<00:05:16.660> be<00:05:21.090> i'll

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
0 you see how useful this could be i'll

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.920 
0 you see how useful this could be i'll
show<00:05:22.390> you<00:05:22.450> what<00:05:22.630> i<00:05:22.690> used<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.290> for<00:05:24.720> it's<00:05:25.720> going

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
show you what i used it for it's going

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.770 
show you what i used it for it's going
to<00:05:25.960> be<00:05:26.080> a<00:05:26.110> semi-automatic<00:05:27.390> snow<00:05:28.390> will<00:05:28.630> and

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
to be a semi-automatic snow will and

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.100 
to be a semi-automatic snow will and
producer<00:05:29.230> right<00:05:29.530> now<00:05:29.680> I'm<00:05:30.010> just<00:05:30.310> making<00:05:30.970> the

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
producer right now I'm just making the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.250 
producer right now I'm just making the
snow<00:05:32.110> tape<00:05:32.470> fine<00:05:32.980> i<00:05:34.470> use<00:05:35.470> my<00:05:35.650> counter<00:05:36.040> to<00:05:37.260> time

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
snow tape fine i use my counter to time

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.220 
snow tape fine i use my counter to time
when<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:39.460> secondary<00:05:40.710> sand<00:05:42.840> columns<00:05:43.840> or

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
when the secondary sand columns or

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.860 
when the secondary sand columns or
whatever<00:05:44.950> you<00:05:45.100> want<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.370> call<00:05:45.550> them<00:05:45.690> push<00:05:46.690> it

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
whatever you want to call them push it

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.320 
whatever you want to call them push it
down<00:05:47.050> into<00:05:47.620> the<00:05:48.600> primary<00:05:49.600> sign<00:05:49.900> sand<00:05:50.410> feed<00:05:51.330> to

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
down into the primary sign sand feed to

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.820 
down into the primary sign sand feed to
push<00:05:52.540> these<00:05:52.750> blocks<00:05:53.140> out<00:05:54.810> so<00:05:55.810> and<00:05:56.110> is<00:05:56.290> this<00:05:56.650> is

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
push these blocks out so and is this is

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.160 
push these blocks out so and is this is
each<00:05:57.460> piston<00:05:57.760> there<00:05:58.270> are<00:05:58.360> eight<00:05:58.510> their<00:05:59.020> eight

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
each piston there are eight their eight

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.120 
each piston there are eight their eight
columns<00:05:59.620> here<00:06:00.570> so<00:06:01.570> when<00:06:02.320> it's<00:06:02.470> counts<00:06:02.770> up<00:06:02.920> to

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
columns here so when it's counts up to

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.300 
columns here so when it's counts up to
eight<00:06:03.310> then<00:06:04.090> it<00:06:04.210> will<00:06:04.360> trigger<00:06:04.650> all<00:06:05.650> these

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
eight then it will trigger all these

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.140 
eight then it will trigger all these
vistas

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:18.659 

just<00:06:11.150> toggle<00:06:11.389> the<00:06:11.599> clock

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:25.430 

see<00:06:19.669> that<00:06:19.849> got<00:06:20.059> him<00:06:20.210> down

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.820 

automatically<00:06:26.340> puts<00:06:26.610> it<00:06:26.700> all<00:06:26.790> down<00:06:26.970> there<00:06:27.830> see

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
automatically puts it all down there see

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.890 
automatically puts it all down there see
if<00:06:28.860> you<00:06:29.100> look<00:06:29.670> here<00:06:29.850> then<00:06:30.060> I<00:06:30.120> just<00:06:30.360> I<00:06:30.540> just<00:06:30.570> took

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
if you look here then I just I just took

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.870 
if you look here then I just I just took
the<00:06:31.110> inputs<00:06:31.680> of<00:06:31.770> all<00:06:31.950> of<00:06:32.070> them<00:06:32.220> and<00:06:32.400> inverted

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
the inputs of all of them and inverted

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.680 
the inputs of all of them and inverted
it<00:06:33.530> so<00:06:34.530> whenever<00:06:34.680> that's<00:06:35.010> on<00:06:35.220> I<00:06:35.670> don't<00:06:36.030> trigger

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
it so whenever that's on I don't trigger

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.940 
it so whenever that's on I don't trigger
the<00:06:39.710> entire<00:06:40.710> columns<00:06:41.640> appear<00:06:42.710> all<00:06:43.710> right<00:06:43.830> now

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
the entire columns appear all right now

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.250 
the entire columns appear all right now
I<00:06:43.980> just<00:06:44.070> have<00:06:44.280> it<00:06:44.490> pushing<00:06:45.420> the<00:06:45.510> sand<00:06:45.750> out<00:06:45.960> on

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
I just have it pushing the sand out on

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.620 
I just have it pushing the sand out on
tues<00:06:46.500> and<00:06:46.650> signs<00:06:46.920> to<00:06:47.640> test<00:06:47.910> it<00:06:48.090> out<00:06:48.180> haven't

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
tues and signs to test it out haven't

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.280 
tues and signs to test it out haven't
got<00:06:48.720> the<00:06:48.840> distant<00:06:49.170> a<00:06:49.520> fully<00:06:50.520> working
