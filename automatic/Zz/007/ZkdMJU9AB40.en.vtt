looking<00:00:30.570> car<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.140> different<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
looking car that it's different from the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.500

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
previous model it's a little bit longer

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.020

about an inch longer wider by 3 inches

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.819

but<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> biggest<00:00:36.870> difference<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.350> they<00:00:37.530> drop

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
but the biggest difference is they drop

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.740 
but the biggest difference is they drop
the<00:00:38.040> roof<00:00:38.280> down<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> very<00:00:39.270> low

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the roof down so it's got a very low

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.959 
the roof down so it's got a very low
silhouette<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.920> makes<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> look<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
silhouette which makes it look like it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
silhouette which makes it look like it
means<00:00:42.149> business<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.930> kind<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.559> think<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.829> looks

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
means business I kind of think it looks

inline-6<00:04:17.850> but<00:04:18.330> what<00:04:18.450> this<00:04:18.600> car<00:04:18.870> has<00:04:19.080> is

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
inline-6 but what this car has is

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.340 
inline-6 but what this car has is
fantastic<00:04:20.580> linear<00:04:21.030> torque<00:04:21.420> and<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:22.110> great

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
fantastic linear torque and the great

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.050 
fantastic linear torque and the great
thing<00:04:22.560> about<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.920> manual<00:04:23.250> transmission<00:04:23.940> is

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
thing about the manual transmission is

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.540 
thing about the manual transmission is
it's<00:04:24.510> oh<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:24.720> smooth<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.380> shift<00:04:25.830> it's<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.340> lot<00:04:26.520> of

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
it's oh so smooth to shift it's a lot of

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.430 
it's oh so smooth to shift it's a lot of
fun<00:04:26.850> you<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:27.180> heal<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.630> toe<00:04:27.840> with<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.230> just

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
fun you can heal and toe with it just

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.230

perfectly<00:04:28.920> but<00:04:29.310> here's<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.670> other<00:04:29.820> thing<00:04:29.940> in

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
perfectly but here's the other thing in

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.150 
perfectly but here's the other thing in
city<00:04:30.450> traffic<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:31.350> can<00:04:31.500> put<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:31.770> in<00:04:31.890> third

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
city traffic you can put it in third

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.260 
city traffic you can put it in third
gear<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.790> you<00:04:33.390> can<00:04:33.600> drive<00:04:33.840> as<00:04:34.110> low<00:04:34.530> as<00:04:34.890> 25<00:04:35.820> 30

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.600 
definitely want to try it with it or
live<00:05:57.450> without<00:05:57.630> it<00:05:57.990> but<00:05:58.440> this<00:05:58.919> car<00:05:59.220> is<00:05:59.250> really

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610

quite soft and compliant it handles

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.430 
quite soft and compliant it handles
beautifully<00:06:02.310> but<00:06:03.180> there's<00:06:03.360> really<00:06:03.600> not<00:06:03.900> a<00:06:03.960> lot

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
beautifully but there's really not a lot

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.280 
beautifully but there's really not a lot
of<00:06:04.680> feedback<00:06:05.160> to<00:06:05.730> the<00:06:06.000> driver<00:06:06.300> compared<00:06:07.080> to

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
of feedback to the driver compared to

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.350 
of feedback to the driver compared to
