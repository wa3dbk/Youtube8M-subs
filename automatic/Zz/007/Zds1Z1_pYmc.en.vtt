be scattered about all in the canopy but

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.070 
be scattered about all in the canopy but
we<00:00:16.280> use<00:00:16.430> a<00:00:16.460> soap<00:00:16.970> flush<00:00:17.210> technique<00:00:17.660> using<00:00:18.020> a

as we use a one square foot template
will<00:01:12.109> try<00:01:12.259> to<00:01:12.289> count<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.709> number<00:01:12.920> of<00:01:12.979> adults
