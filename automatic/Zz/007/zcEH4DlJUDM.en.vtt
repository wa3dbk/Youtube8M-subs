you know we have a few things in

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.920 
you know we have a few things in
adventure<00:03:28.210> time<00:03:28.360> but<00:03:28.510> I'm<00:03:28.570> not<00:03:28.720> really<00:03:28.780> sure

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
adventure time but I'm not really sure

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.060 
adventure time but I'm not really sure
how<00:03:29.350> much<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.620> characters<00:03:29.920> actually

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
how much the characters actually

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.520 
how much the characters actually
progressed<00:03:30.700> we<00:03:30.880> have<00:03:31.030> thin<00:03:31.780> his<00:03:32.110> hair<00:03:32.320> gets

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
progressed we have thin his hair gets

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.700 
progressed we have thin his hair gets
cut<00:03:32.710> off<00:03:32.770> sometimes<00:03:33.690> yada<00:03:34.690> yada<00:03:34.990> it's<00:03:35.440> kind<00:03:35.590> of

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
cut off sometimes yada yada it's kind of

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.730 
cut off sometimes yada yada it's kind of
real<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.310> with<00:03:36.520> his<00:03:36.640> hair<00:03:37.230> sometimes<00:03:38.230> he<00:03:38.440> has

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
real like with his hair sometimes he has

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.630 
real like with his hair sometimes he has
a<00:03:38.770> different<00:03:39.160> sword<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.730> stuff<00:03:40.030> um<00:03:41.340> jake<00:03:42.340> has

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
a different sword and stuff um jake has

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.240 
a different sword and stuff um jake has
kids<00:03:43.000> now<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.750> few<00:03:44.380> things<00:03:44.590> affect<00:03:45.130> the

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
kids now a few things affect the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.990 
kids now a few things affect the
characters<00:03:45.700> but<00:03:46.080> that's<00:03:47.080> about<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:48.280> think

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
characters but that's about it I think

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.060 
characters but that's about it I think
there<00:03:49.150> should<00:03:49.330> be<00:03:49.360> more<00:03:49.750> maybe<00:03:50.530> affect<00:03:50.950> the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
there should be more maybe affect the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.160 
there should be more maybe affect the
world<00:03:51.220> around<00:03:51.459> them

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
world around them

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.360 
world around them
and<00:03:54.170> then<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.320> leave<00:03:54.440> subtle<00:03:54.950> hints<00:03:55.280> in

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
and then I leave subtle hints in

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.250 
and then I leave subtle hints in
adventure<00:03:55.760> time<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.570> there<00:03:56.750> might<00:03:56.900> be<00:03:56.960> this

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
adventure time that there might be this

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.680 
adventure time that there might be this
huge<00:03:57.560> world<00:03:58.040> or<00:03:58.550> something<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.150> there's<00:03:59.600> a

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
huge world or something and there's a

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.350 
huge world or something and there's a
big<00:03:59.960> fan<00:04:00.260> theory<00:04:00.740> about<00:04:00.830> a<00:04:00.980> war<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.910> all<00:04:02.120> that

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
big fan theory about a war and all that

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.800 
big fan theory about a war and all that
stuff<00:04:02.570> and<00:04:03.020> I<00:04:03.650> think<00:04:04.360> sometimes<00:04:05.360> I<00:04:05.600> feel<00:04:05.780> like

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
stuff and I think sometimes I feel like

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.720 
stuff and I think sometimes I feel like
that<00:04:06.050> stuff's<00:04:06.260> cannon<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.710> don't<00:04:07.070> know<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.400> just

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.730 
that stuff's cannon I don't know I just
want<00:04:08.300> them<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.420> go<00:04:08.600> into<00:04:08.720> more<00:04:08.930> detail<00:04:09.290> because

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
want them to go into more detail because

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.230 
want them to go into more detail because
the<00:04:09.830> venture<00:04:10.040> time<00:04:10.190> has<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.370> really<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.880> really

have good content and some vit might not

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.920 
have good content and some vit might not
be<00:04:42.680> able<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:42.920> be<00:04:43.070> shown<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.400> 15<00:04:44.000> minutes<00:04:44.360> like

be able to be shown in 15 minutes like
you<00:04:45.020> can<00:04:45.140> make<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.290> really<00:04:45.710> whore<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.400> make

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
you can make a really whore you can make

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.460 
you can make a really whore you can make
a<00:04:46.550> horrible<00:04:46.910> episode<00:04:47.330> in<00:04:47.450> 15<00:04:47.780> minutes<00:04:48.080> or<00:04:48.380> you

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
can make a great episode in 30 minutes

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.280 
can make a great episode in 30 minutes
kind<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.420> depends<00:04:50.690> on<00:04:50.810> what<00:04:50.930> you<00:04:50.990> want<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.170> do

kind of depends on what you want to do

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.390 
kind of depends on what you want to do
because<00:04:51.470> sometimes<00:04:51.830> these<00:04:51.950> episodes<00:04:52.190> are

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
because sometimes these episodes are

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.659 
because sometimes these episodes are
good<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:52.850> sometimes<00:04:53.030> it's<00:04:53.210> just<00:04:53.300> like

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669

episodes I brought this up earlier so I
just<00:05:08.699> kind<00:05:08.849> of<00:05:08.909> feel<00:05:08.999> like<00:05:09.089> they<00:05:09.270> did<00:05:09.569> but<00:05:09.900> I

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
just kind of feel like they did but I

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.679 
just kind of feel like they did but I
think<00:05:10.319> I'm<00:05:10.439> wrong<00:05:10.620> as<00:05:10.860> well<00:05:11.059> you<00:05:12.059> may<00:05:12.210> have<00:05:12.240> I

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:12.689 
think I'm wrong as well you may have I

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:14.179 
think I'm wrong as well you may have I
just<00:05:13.169> feel<00:05:13.289> like<00:05:13.349> they<00:05:13.469> have<00:05:13.499> more<00:05:13.800> room<00:05:14.009> to

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
just feel like they have more room to

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.100 
just feel like they have more room to
work<00:05:14.219> within<00:05:14.550> 30<00:05:14.879> minutes<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.419> perhaps<00:05:15.900> the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
work within 30 minutes and perhaps the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.390 
work within 30 minutes and perhaps the
episodes<00:05:16.469> will<00:05:16.589> feel<00:05:16.740> more<00:05:16.979> like<00:05:17.129> full

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
episodes will feel more like full

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.219 
episodes will feel more like full
episodes<00:05:17.879> because<00:05:18.360> you<00:05:18.539> can't<00:05:18.809> always<00:05:18.960> tell<00:05:19.199> a

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
episodes because you can't always tell a

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.989 
episodes because you can't always tell a
good<00:05:19.439> plot<00:05:19.710> in<00:05:19.889> 15<00:05:20.279> minutes<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:22.460> know<00:05:23.460> this<00:05:23.759> this
