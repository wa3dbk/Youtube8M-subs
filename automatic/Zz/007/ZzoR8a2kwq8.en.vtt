00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.439
 grace mate from the study of fer according to jose antonio noriega 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.939
 Fernando Suarez to analyze the situation of Hugo Sanchez who 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.179
 became the fourth coach to lose his place in the league 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.730
 from Spain that happened as there are many factors not to consider the first 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.820
 I would consider 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.480
 is that a year ago he did things right with almeria took him up to 12 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.179
 Aug instead of the table he got it out of recession problems 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.539
 but I think the undeniably serious problem that he had was that 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.519
 negredo sold it to the Real Madrid team and later to Neredo it will be 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.170
 zaragoza between that it disbands him of the equipment and can not adapt to the new 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.850
 plus the invoice of fabián vargas that came from reinforcement I think that there 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.950
 was left with a third model car for first division if I think that 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.610
 beyond the circumstances that you comment that are true for a hundred do not 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.889
 could find 

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:47.080
 percent 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.280
 the best game to the best style the most convenient to his team and he was trying 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.699
 is to jump the line to be very vertical 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.780
 in the beginning he put the Argentine forward piatti in front only i 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.030
 which was like a suicide because piatti is fast is skillful but does not know 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.869
 hold the ball and that style he said he needs someone after 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.220
 it detects it later the season and puts to uche 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.220
 but 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.560
 I never took second forward 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.600
 the fixed in front of the solar and that was in the campus never futile hoisted in order the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.990
 truth is that Almeria did not play well football of these to which they say no 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.299
 I walked in the way you told him to stay and if you're in shape I'll put you 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.630
 play that is also a factor but the fact is that hugo sanchez I think 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.380
 he was convinced of what was going to play this season key players who 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.170
 they left sooner or later I had the impression that this happened 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.940
 speaking of the almeria although names we hear as for 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.010
 replace a sanchez diego simeone is spoken that deals with contracts to lorenzo 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.390
 of almagro will have to be given to the one in zaragoza 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.560
 t at least start decks and many names that go to the cholo is 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.030
 ips would be good a little what hugo sanchez did not get to football 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.660
 Spain for a smaller team but as you say has a contract with him 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.220
 lorenzo constantin galca also go up to him is the coach of the quarries 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.550
 from almería the work of alfonso lópez sojo there a nice and nice trainer 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.300
 cheap in favor that right now the investigation of hugo sanchez exist 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.189
 those roots and cession of sergio Aegean his second 1 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.959
 is costing you some money now there is no secret that there was always 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.659
 He has said it is not his dream or being a Real Madrid coach 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.039
 that so much affects the image of hugo sanchez this decision 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.349
 it affects me I think it serves that affects affects because it was getting closer 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.370
 after local barcelona measurement and in the bernabéu 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.400
 and this affects just stop the time clock and we'll see how it goes 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.620
 in his next team to see if he can climb was what happened to aguirre you 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.180
 you agree aguirre with the osasuna pamplona had the season gave me bad another half 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.680
 good megalomaniac and that's why yesterday athletic madrid sealed with and been me 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.060
 it seems that distance to hugo sanchez from his goal that is undoubtedly reaching 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.079
 direct the madrid 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.219
 will have to go direct and be successful somewhere else hopefully find it 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.540
 porteña spain serious 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.839
 the best for this this search that he has but yes no doubt 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:20.650
 away that opportunity that the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.009
 the cameraman been even and always looking 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:28.290
 the almeria added four of the last 24 points disputed and already hugo sanchez 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.830
 is not the coach of the set of Andalusia 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.130
 name fernando suárez josé antonio noriega we will use hernandez now 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.840
 we pray 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.379
 with you
