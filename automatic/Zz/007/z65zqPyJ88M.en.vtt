trying this new thing where I'm gonna
pay<00:04:06.120> attention<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.660> how<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.049> part<00:04:07.349> so<00:04:07.560> I'm

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
pay attention to how I part so I'm

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.620 
pay attention to how I part so I'm
trying<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:07.920> do<00:04:08.069> diagonal<00:04:08.640> parts<00:04:08.970> throughout

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
trying to do diagonal parts throughout

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:25.840 
trying to do diagonal parts throughout
my<00:04:09.810> hair<00:04:10.110> for<00:04:10.950> these<00:04:11.069> twists

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.290 

and<00:04:27.140> I'm<00:04:28.140> going<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.560> braid<00:04:28.920> at<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.370> root<00:04:29.640> for

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
and I'm going to braid at the root for

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.820 
and I'm going to braid at the root for
about<00:04:30.510> an<00:04:30.660> inch<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.080> tend<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.350> do<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.530> with

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
about an inch I tend to do that with

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.170 
about an inch I tend to do that with
almost<00:04:32.190> who<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.460> whether<00:04:32.670> they<00:04:32.820> be<00:04:32.880> mini

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
almost who is whether they be mini

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.730 
almost who is whether they be mini
twists<00:04:33.630> or<00:04:33.720> large<00:04:34.080> twists

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
twists or large twists

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.400 
twists or large twists
just<00:04:35.340> because<00:04:35.640> my<00:04:35.970> hair<00:04:36.330> likes<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.810> slide<00:04:37.080> down

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
just because my hair likes to slide down

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.930 
just because my hair likes to slide down
from<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.800> root<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.280> braid<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:38.670> keeps

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
from the root and the braid just keeps

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:49.460 
from the root and the braid just keeps
it<00:04:39.090> nice<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.270> neat

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.590 

so<00:04:50.280> I'm<00:04:50.370> just<00:04:50.520> going<00:04:50.640> to<00:04:50.730> continue<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:51.180> part

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
so I'm just going to continue to part

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.900 
so I'm just going to continue to part
diagonally<00:04:52.320> throughout<00:04:52.740> my<00:04:52.920> hair<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.460> twist

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
diagonally throughout my hair and twist

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.960 
diagonally throughout my hair and twist
these<00:04:54.840> twists<00:04:55.350> probably<00:04:56.010> took<00:04:56.220> me<00:04:56.280> about<00:04:56.490> five

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
these twists probably took me about five

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.630 
these twists probably took me about five
or<00:04:57.150> six<00:04:57.360> hours<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.710> use<00:04:58.980> my<00:04:59.190> whip<00:04:59.430> shea

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
or six hours and I use my whip shea

00:04:59.640 --> 00:06:18.010 
or six hours and I use my whip shea
butter<00:04:59.880> on<00:05:00.120> each<00:05:00.390> twist

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.299 

so<00:06:19.020> yeah<00:06:19.169> it's<00:06:19.379> the<00:06:19.499> next<00:06:19.739> day<00:06:19.830> I<00:06:19.860> like<00:06:20.129> that

00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:20.309 
so yeah it's the next day I like that

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:22.339 
so yeah it's the next day I like that
stuff<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:20.789> I<00:06:21.149> was<00:06:21.449> finishing<00:06:21.719> up<00:06:22.110> my<00:06:22.289> Twitter

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
stuff and I was finishing up my Twitter

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.010 
stuff and I was finishing up my Twitter
actually<00:06:22.830> on<00:06:23.039> my<00:06:23.159> last<00:06:23.429> twist<00:06:24.029> and<00:06:24.270> I<00:06:24.689> just

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
actually on my last twist and I just

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.899 
actually on my last twist and I just
used<00:06:25.349> a<00:06:25.619> little<00:06:25.860> bit<00:06:25.949> of<00:06:26.069> shea<00:06:26.309> butter<00:06:26.550> to

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
used a little bit of shea butter to

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.149 
used a little bit of shea butter to
detangle<00:06:27.539> it<00:06:27.629> just<00:06:27.899> a<00:06:28.019> little<00:06:28.169> bit<00:06:28.319> and<00:06:28.679> then<00:06:28.919> I

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
detangle it just a little bit and then I

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.609 
detangle it just a little bit and then I
braid<00:06:29.550> up<00:06:29.699> the<00:06:29.819> roots<00:06:30.089> for<00:06:30.389> an<00:06:30.569> inch<00:06:31.019> and<00:06:31.319> then

00:06:31.609 --> 00:06:31.619 
braid up the roots for an inch and then

00:06:31.619 --> 00:07:11.010 
braid up the roots for an inch and then
I<00:06:31.649> twist

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.960 

all<00:07:12.020> right<00:07:12.170> so<00:07:12.320> I'm<00:07:12.380> all<00:07:12.650> done<00:07:13.010> I'm<00:07:13.760> just

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.990 
tried to keep them diagonal I also I
really<00:07:21.770> like<00:07:21.890> the<00:07:21.980> way<00:07:22.070> they<00:07:22.220> laid<00:07:22.550> I<00:07:22.850> don't

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.010 
know if there's a any difference maybe

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.940 
know if there's a any difference maybe
it's<00:07:25.220> just<00:07:25.310> in<00:07:25.490> my<00:07:25.610> mind<00:07:26.050> but<00:07:27.050> I<00:07:27.110> did<00:07:27.590> like<00:07:27.830> the
