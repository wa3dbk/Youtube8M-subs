00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.420 
yeah that is one bad boom he also
doesn't<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.230> best<00:03:13.350> passing<00:03:13.650> if<00:03:14.040> you

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
doesn't have the best passing if you

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.160 
doesn't have the best passing if you
play<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:15.030> strikers<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.019> would<00:03:16.140> be

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
play in a strikers and that would be

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.530 
play in a strikers and that would be
much<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.040> problem<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.580> centre-forward

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
much of the problem but I centre-forward

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.759 
much of the problem but I centre-forward
you<00:03:18.630> do<00:03:18.810> want<00:03:18.989> them<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.320> link<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:19.709> the

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
you do want them to link up with the

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.470 
you do want them to link up with the
strikers<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.250> sometimes<00:03:20.940> his<00:03:21.120> passing

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
strikers and sometimes his passing

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.780 
strikers and sometimes his passing
doesn't<00:03:21.720> always<00:03:21.900> reach<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.459> strikers<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.610> he

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
doesn't always reach the strikers and he

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.850 
doesn't always reach the strikers and he
really<00:03:24.030> has<00:03:24.150> preset<00:03:24.540> skills<00:03:24.810> no<00:03:25.320> big<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> worry

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
really has preset skills no big a worry
