00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
can select multiple applications so here

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.890 
can select multiple applications so here
I<00:03:16.950> can<00:03:17.130> select<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:17.970> group<00:03:18.299> here<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.660> move

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
them as a group you can see how the icon

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.340 
them as a group you can see how the icon
changes<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.790> stack<00:03:21.209> there<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.079> can<00:03:22.260> move

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
changes to a stack there and I can move

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.750 
changes to a stack there and I can move
it<00:03:22.500> around<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.010> screen<00:03:23.280> or<00:03:23.459> move<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.730> to

bunch of apps and you really want to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.380 
bunch of apps and you really want to
arrange<00:03:28.799> them<00:03:29.070> specifically<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.790> your<00:03:29.820> iPhone

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
it's much better than doing it on the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.280 
it's much better than doing it on the
phone<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.940> little<00:03:33.180> buggy<00:03:33.540> however<00:03:33.810> for

instance<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.769> can<00:03:34.890> drag<00:03:35.100> an<00:03:35.220> application<00:03:36.030> and

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
instance you can drag an application and

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.490 
instance you can drag an application and
just<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.480> right<00:03:36.630> way<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.840> create<00:03:37.049> an<00:03:37.230> entire

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
just the right way to create an entire

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.620 
just the right way to create an entire
blank<00:03:37.860> screen<00:03:38.310> between<00:03:38.970> two<00:03:39.150> screens<00:03:39.510> that
