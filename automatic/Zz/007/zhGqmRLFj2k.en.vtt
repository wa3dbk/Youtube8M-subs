00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello people I had announced yes 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 that in this series of experiments 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.919
 regarding hybrid dry cells only 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.920
 a 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.580
 will give a video clip and that 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.039
 Regarding actual gas measurement that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.869
 but in the meantime I have a lot 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.910
 bitch has done around this whole 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.070
 history and many people not the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 want to watch complete series or yourself 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 can not imagine how big the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.399
 specified dimensions in the part 1 of this 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 Video series is easy now 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.340
 I decided but briefly that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.110
 video and the little one 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.200
 generator it is now this 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 partly because in relation to known 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.680
 to compare objects 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.289
 so you can see it in about how big 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.360
 the part is actually as I said 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.129
 it is this little generator of the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.050
 is now against it connected 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.350
 have been watching for several hours 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.609
 down 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:07.580
 the temperature of the whole story 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.140
 is somewhere at 25 26 degrees 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.130
 I also have a pressure gauge 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.680
 affiliated 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 this is the pre-pressure in the generator Lich 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:24.750
 at 0 40 0 4 bar and the whole in the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.540
 city ​​with a fixed voltage 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.430
 of twelve volts and accordingly 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.009
 34 ampere pulled 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.049
 whether it is still moderately high 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.820
 I do not know for sure if 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.500
 the temperature will change 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 but in the reason quite stable show that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.479
 as well as the now there are 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.310
 also specialists based on the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.290
 Bubble formation and the size and so on 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.510
 on already 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.320
 How much liter of gas can you tell? 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.900
 Things produced for these people hold 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.760
 I now pretty much the sun 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.670
 maric estimate how much gas that is in 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.080
 can be about and now he 'll stop 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.810
 the whole 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.210
 that's the little cell and that is 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.310
 one of our test generators the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.940
 the dry cell with me actually 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.860
 always different measurements and 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.870
 different function test in 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.270
 take different applications out 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.330
 you can see exactly how 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.200
 small the part of this hybrid actually 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.410
 compared to the dry season 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.930
 I think for all who where 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.180
 details such as length / width / height do not matter 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.209
 can start esther 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.640
 make approximate picture how big the whole 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.160
 is i need to hold again yes 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.180
 many, I hold the once again 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.130
 cigarette box and you can see 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.380
 is about the size of one 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.489
 cigarette box and by the width 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.480
 it will be around 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.310
 well be 44 wide therefore can 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.950
 Now imagine how big that 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.510
 Whole is the actual grass you need 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.519
 which I had previously announced the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.530
 is still out I'm not yet 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.900
 come 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.670
 set up the device of therefore 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.370
 I thank you for this for now 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.549
 spectators of this video hope that all 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.290
 now also satisfied on this point 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.010
 are placed and the gas measurements like 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:26.650
 said it still stands until then 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.650
 Thank you and see you
