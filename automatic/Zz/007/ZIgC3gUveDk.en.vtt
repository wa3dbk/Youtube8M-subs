00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.650 
size would take no time in just
consuming<00:03:09.380> us<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.880> elsewhere<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.120> will<00:03:11.150> find

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
consuming us and elsewhere you will find

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.880 
consuming us and elsewhere you will find
a<00:03:11.870> host<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.410> gorgeous<00:03:13.100> gassy<00:03:13.580> nebulae<00:03:14.209> and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
a host of gorgeous gassy nebulae and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.560 
a host of gorgeous gassy nebulae and
also<00:03:15.890> all<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.280> stars<00:03:16.580> behind<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.390> the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
also all the stars behind it in the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:32.520 
also all the stars behind it in the
Milky<00:03:17.959> gallops

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.770 

so<00:03:33.530> there<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.250> are<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.459> Swan<00:03:34.939> the<00:03:35.180> Eagle<00:03:35.569> and

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
so there we are the Swan the Eagle and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.259 
so there we are the Swan the Eagle and
the<00:03:35.840> hub<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.469> magical<00:03:37.069> and<00:03:37.219> if<00:03:37.639> you<00:03:37.819> don't<00:03:38.060> look

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
the hub so magical and if you don't look

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.569 
the hub so magical and if you don't look
up<00:03:38.480> for<00:03:38.719> us<00:03:38.870> we'll<00:03:39.170> think<00:03:39.379> it<00:03:39.560> very<00:03:39.859> tragical

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
up for us we'll think it very tragical

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.849 
up for us we'll think it very tragical
but<00:03:41.060> if<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.359> do<00:03:41.540> look<00:03:41.750> overhead<00:03:42.200> you'll<00:03:42.590> see

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
but if you do look overhead you'll see

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.890 
but if you do look overhead you'll see
us<00:03:43.040> in<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.430> right<00:03:43.700> angle<00:03:44.180> we<00:03:44.599> are<00:03:44.629> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
us in that right angle we are the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.890 
us in that right angle we are the
constellations<00:03:45.739> of<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:45.980> so-called<00:03:46.579> summer

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.620 

triangles<00:03:53.900> I'm<00:03:54.139> trying
