00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.280
 guys what's going on here I was told to be 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.780
 one with another online dgt video this time 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.530
 I bring you a touch you can not miss in 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.390
 their garages 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.369
 the tornado is the act of the 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.560
 mariachis that is identified by having the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.910
 flag of mexico in the to begin what 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.770
 What we have to do is get a 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.930
 we can locate it in the helicopter 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.580
 airport want now because it is 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.290
 the closest place to the point that 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.930
 let's take that is the nature reserve 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.190
 from Mount Chilian, this is the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.800
 point where we will take our 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.420
 helicopter so when they give the 19 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.970
 hours that are seven o'clock in the afternoon or 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.250
 ten seconds that of the seven of the 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.260
 late they may be 30 or the time 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.720
 necessary before they give 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.850
 just at 7 o'clock we are going to call 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.100
 our good friend lester and we're going to 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.260
 ask him to the police ignore crimes for 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.970
 five thousand dollars once we have already 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.860
 done this we are going to take the helicopter 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.530
 to the location that I told them we're going 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.850
 to get off of it and let's identify this 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.640
 small event that is going to be happening 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.500
 here that is on the other side of the mountain in the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.200
 that we landed let's see that there is a 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.060
 auto and there's going to be another good person more 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.070
 well two people persecuted by the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.630
 police and we're going to shoot him with a 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.100
 sniper in the head 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.960
 make sure that you are in the head and 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.180
 because the police do not read crimes for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.070
 that you do not arrest them in this case 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.200
 I ran out of time when the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.570
 cop will not do crimes and justly 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.039
 When I stole the car, I was activated 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.079
 star and I will start shooting 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.079
 so what are we going to have to do 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.130
 is to go out in front and we will try 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.869
 to fall just like this standing up so that 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.030
 the car does not explode when we are 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.429
 stealing once we've already got 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.020
 get out with the car the police are going to 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.450
 continue to be perceiving and we are going to 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.970
 call again our friend lester 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.740
 so that we remove the cop from above 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.420
 It depends on how many stars you have 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.520
 is what it will cost them to be 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.979
 remove in this case to me it cost me 400 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.840
 dollars and as I tell you once I already 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.880
 we've got rid of all that we're going 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.640
 to carry the saints customs more 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.970
 close and we will be able to buy you a 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.289
 localizer and insurance 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.780
 besides that the only thing we can do 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.450
 is to sell it or put explosives like 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.160
 come, it's a pretty incredible car because 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.720
 has the things of the mariachis the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
 flag of mexico and it's something that a 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.910
 you can not miss them as you 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.490
 alive 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.930
 garages good guys I hope that you 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.469
 have liked how you see that was the tornado 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.469
 yes
