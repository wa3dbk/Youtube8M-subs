feature is the LED lights there are
three<00:02:10.599> modes<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.970> force<00:02:13.209> first<00:02:13.629> mode

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
three modes this is the force first mode

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.220 
three modes this is the force first mode
it<00:02:14.200> doesn't<00:02:14.500> blink<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:16.060> second<00:02:16.420> mode<00:02:16.660> blinks

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
it doesn't blink the second mode blinks

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.610 
it doesn't blink the second mode blinks
and<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.760> third<00:02:19.090> mode<00:02:19.420> blinks<00:02:19.959> at<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.170> faster

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
and the third mode blinks at a faster

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.150 
and the third mode blinks at a faster
pace<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.230> thing<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:23.620> feature<00:02:23.799> will<00:02:24.069> be

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
pace so this thing this feature will be

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
system but it's you will predict it for

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.370 
system but it's you will predict it for
a<00:02:44.980> for<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.489> normal<00:02:45.819> size<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:46.090> size<00:02:46.720> chart<00:02:47.169> is
