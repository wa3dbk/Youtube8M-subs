00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.399
 good to all to a good new video 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:07.830
 it seems that rocksteady eliminates good 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.860
 withdraws for the moment the purchase of 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.049
 game batman arkham night in extinguish 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.640
 basically I started it's giving enough 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.100
 problems and rocksteady then warner bros 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 rocksteady then they have decided this 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.340
 then eliminate the sale of the game on pc and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 so while solving the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.960
 problems that nobody else can 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 buy and so on, basically basically 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.739
 they ask the users who have bought 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.989
 that either they are in which to be 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.559
 only problems or if they want it is 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.679
 ask for the return of your money in the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.030
 store or estimated where I was 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.940
 bought not where you bought that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.379
 PC version seems to be good 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.620
 players are also affected by 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.210
 the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.720
 books and others basically to go from 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.809
 30 frames you have to retouch a file and 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.059
 also different things but have 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.800
 done something that the people then started 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.990
 I complained enough I have to say a 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.330
 thing the truth is that the game is 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.560
 impressive despite having these 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.259
 problems I started that I do not imagine that 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.759
 will be solved and others I think 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.479
 play a console as you have already seen and 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.180
 the rest 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.920
 hours and hours and hours I can tell you that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.360
 the game is impressive or is still 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.009
 I'm not going to do the analysis until I 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.580
 I have played a lot a lot a lot a lot 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.710
 more and have done many more secondary 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.070
 but very impressive games to me 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.570
 is really freaking out I think that I 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.990
 I think it is a serious candidate Karez 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.270
 something you this year will be of the five 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.310
 best games we certainly go but but 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.520
 certainly without doubt in the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.470
 top 5 in the top 3 is a great game that I 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.170
 I knew it was going to be good but this 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.820
 level I did not expect it sincerely be 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.920
 every time filippo more and especially 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.810
 as seen graphically 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.810
 in consoles and others I thought I was not going 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.729
 to get to that point neither of cunt and when 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.290
 see the videos I thought we arrived 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.270
 super cock 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.159
 when I saw it in fact in e3 that 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.890
 I ran in a movie 4 I did not believe it but 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.459
 if it looks the same as what was seen 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.250
 in e3 or flip and simply 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.970
 I really hope I know 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.280
 These failures recover the 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.140
 eggs and people can play without any 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.080
 kind of problems because the truth that 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.760
 they're missing out 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.290
 interesting so we will not see anything 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.709
 if the batteries are put 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.470
 the doctor rocks trading and they do well 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.420
 that the boys to try to enjoy 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.620
 try to wait and nothing we see in the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.620
 next video until next time
