00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
meadow below don't we you know we've

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.920 
meadow below don't we you know we've
usually<00:00:28.860> encountered<00:00:30.540> some<00:00:31.540> cold<00:00:31.780> weather

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
usually encountered some cold weather

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
we might miss the migration but it looks

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.020 
we might miss the migration but it looks
like<00:00:37.320> looks<00:00:38.320> like<00:00:38.410> Indian<00:00:39.309> summers<00:00:39.640> come<00:00:39.820> back

in and we might - the migration might

00:00:42.129 --> 00:01:17.459
