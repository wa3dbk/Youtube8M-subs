00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.390
 being a tremendously complex structure where there are millions of neurons 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.970
 are interconnected with each other 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.829
 and many times during development 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.660
 the connections are not all in some groups of neurons everything 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.179
 to solve a problem 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.960
 if that neuron 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.920
 who has a connection not quite ideal to solve a problem is going 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.519
 dying with aging it is possible that those that remain 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.759
 now form circuits that are capable of solving some questions 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.060
 any 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.370
 difficult that during the youth we were not able to solve 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.770
 but with the years 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.020
 Neurons are not only lost 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.900
 until recently it was thought that we did not do with a defined number of 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.990
 neurons that we were losing with age 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.249
 this pillar of neuroscience and has fallen 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.879
 we currently know that there are stem cells while the euro that are capable 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.100
 to proliferate and are able to give some types of neurons thought 

00:00:57.099 --> 00:01:00.540
 besides that in the brain there were two populations of cells 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.420
 the neurons and the cells of the glia 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
 specialized only in supporting neurons 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.470
 in the whole villa area 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.100
 there is a city that are called star-conserved astrocytes 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.280
 view ensures that the city was seen and they were able to transform and 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.660
 differentiate towards neurons say would be stem cells 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.250
 the team of doctor GarcÃ­a Executioner demonstrated for the first time 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.520
 existence of stem cells in the adult human brain 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 we currently know what 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420
 the stem cells are transformed 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.480
 new neurons that are single migrants that have to migrate to their destination 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.570
 final 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.770
 that final destination naturally so he did not doubt pozzato york and also a 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.930
 area that is called 'phase sale of the hippocampus these a very important area 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.530
 because it is where it is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080
 decentralized 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.630
 all memory and learning 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.560
 sometimes it is that these new neurons are important for 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.000
 he had them that we learn the day to day 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 this is 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.390
 where are we going to study the case 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.690
 barcelona the future 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.159
 is not easy 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.220
 and this is the united 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.220
 kelly 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.269
 many times this year 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.269
 it adds 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.069
 Didier Covered 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.579
 for the sector 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.739
 in fact this is an act of flagging 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.739
 also being replaced 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.429
 the discovery of stem cells in the brain 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.979
 open the possibility that one day we will learn to dialogue with this 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.199
 cedula and can recover 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.339
 the area will harm job losses in the brain either by aging or by 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:45.969
 traumatism 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.419
 we are currently in a moment that precedes the ear to say we are in a 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.239
 moment 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.239
 enke we already know which is the stem cell you know where is the headquarter 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:56.839
 this loan 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:00.149
 we only know some and wash some chemical factors 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.379
 we still lack a lot of power 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.059
 i several of those and lamas form words 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:09.519
 and reach a dialogue with the cell 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.280
 let's not forget that the city are able to dialogue with each other because they are 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:14.469
 able to form 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.549
 bush a structure as complex as our brain 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:18.789
 We do not know 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:22.889
 e the time that we will take to be able to dialogue with these stem cells and 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.559
 tell them they have to do where they have to go and what they have to do 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:28.129
 but it is the challenge of the scientists
