00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.470

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.390

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.330

 the manual is multi-lingual, including obviously Italian 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.460

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.400

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.360
 the socket for the TV connection cable 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.110
 in the lower part we have the weight for the headphones 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.009
 we ship it back on we remove it in this protection 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.900
 we turn on we act with the appropriate command 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.550
 sudo lights up in just a few seconds 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.550
 here is the menu with all the titles 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.920
 available internally divided into 4 pages in this first to the second 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.430
 it's the fourth 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.360

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.179
 nunzia competition 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.079
 so this button pauses the game 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.269
 tonight instead returned to the initial menu 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.219
 and here we come now another game among which available and I would say to go 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.029
 directly on 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.739

 gay 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.689
 in this case we go to fabric francers 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.430
 then 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.430
 blackberries 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.110

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.210
 hahaha 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.800
 Dear 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.930
 art 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.930
 Sara 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.539
 but 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.589
 ahhh 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.370
 antara 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.370
 but 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.330
 Now 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:37.330
 but 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.970
 at the wheel an evening seat 11 months messenger 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.879
 meetings 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:50.069
 well ultimately we can say that it is a good product 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.860
 light with good autonomy it can be used in full mobility 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.389
 or you want other measures so this thing will go to play 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.240
 on the largest screen 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.130
 leasing the weak points we say the things that I don't like are absolutely the 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.180
 controller 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.370
 of which there are 12 volts 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.860
 making the directions diagonally in general is not a problem a motto 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.189
 be annoying with some games it 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.479
 then he beats me when he sat down with a screwdriver 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.949
 the choice of games is obviously unlimited among those available but 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.439
 it will probably be made to keep the price down 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:34.569
 I remind everyone that on the yahoo site 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:39.259
 fuck. ainu.it available lite a complete review of the 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.229
 product goodbye to all
