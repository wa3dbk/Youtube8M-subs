anything like that is fun and I actually

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.620 
anything like that is fun and I actually
found<00:02:00.780> when<00:02:01.410> I<00:02:01.440> was<00:02:01.650> hammering<00:02:02.300> if<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:03.390> don't

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
found when I was hammering if you don't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.080 
found when I was hammering if you don't
have<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.900> reverse<00:02:04.290> steel<00:02:04.950> stamping<00:02:05.400> set<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:05.880> you

have a reverse steel stamping set if you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.089 
have a reverse steel stamping set if you
actually<00:02:06.840> choose<00:02:07.380> words<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:08.009> are

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
actually choose words that are

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.550 
actually choose words that are
symmetrical<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.660> turn<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.899> over<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
symmetrical you can turn it over this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.289 
symmetrical you can turn it over this
was<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> original<00:02:10.920> side<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> stamped<00:02:12.180> on

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
was the original side that I stamped on

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.140 
was the original side that I stamped on
and<00:02:12.599> then

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
and then

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.759 
and then
turn<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.569> over<00:02:13.659> and<00:02:13.870> realize<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.500> side

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
turn it over and realize that this side

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.429 
turn it over and realize that this side
looks<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.189> much<00:02:15.310> cooler<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.689> have<00:02:17.260> a

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
looks so much cooler so you can have a

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.600 
looks so much cooler so you can have a
lot<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.650> fun<00:02:17.890> playing<00:02:18.159> around<00:02:18.310> with

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
lot of fun playing around with

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.309 
lot of fun playing around with
techniques<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.239> that<00:02:19.450> okay<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:19.930> then<00:02:20.079> for

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
techniques like that okay and then for

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.530 
techniques like that okay and then for
this<00:02:20.470> technique<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.250> just<00:02:21.579> took<00:02:21.760> some<00:02:21.970> Ranger

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
this technique I just took some Ranger

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.199 
this technique I just took some Ranger
paints<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.680> ulta<00:02:23.920> blanks<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.549> these

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
paints and the ulta blanks and these

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.759 
paints and the ulta blanks and these
paints<00:02:25.540> will<00:02:25.659> stay<00:02:25.840> on<00:02:25.870> metal<00:02:26.230> which<00:02:26.349> is<00:02:26.500> great

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
paints will stay on metal which is great

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.190 
paints will stay on metal which is great
so<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.040> just<00:02:27.280> did<00:02:27.459> some<00:02:27.810> swirly<00:02:28.810> kind<00:02:29.079> of

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
so I just did some swirly kind of

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.380 
so I just did some swirly kind of
designs<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:30.069> one<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.700> then<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.819> star<00:02:31.209> in

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
designs on this one and then a star in

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.089 
designs on this one and then a star in
this<00:02:31.569> one<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.109> then<00:02:32.439> you're<00:02:32.620> going<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.769> allow

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
this one and then you're going to allow

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.520 
this one and then you're going to allow
the<00:02:33.129> paint<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.609> dry<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.260> can<00:02:35.409> just

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530

going to wire wrap it all together so

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.339 
going to wire wrap it all together so
the<00:03:37.989> first<00:03:38.290> step<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:38.799> we<00:03:39.669> need<00:03:39.879> to<00:03:40.060> have<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.349> take

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
the first step is we need to have a take

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.899 
the first step is we need to have a take
a<00:03:41.379> piece<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.650> wire<00:03:41.979> and<00:03:43.680> create<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:46.409> hook<00:03:47.409> in<00:03:47.560> it

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
a piece of wire and create a hook in it

00:03:47.909 --> 00:04:03.580 
a piece of wire and create a hook in it
for<00:03:48.909> a<00:03:48.940> pendant<00:03:49.389> to<00:03:49.449> hang<00:03:49.629> off<00:03:49.780> of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.229 

and<00:04:03.680> we're<00:04:04.310> going<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.459> make<00:04:04.610> a<00:04:04.670> bigger<00:04:04.940> loop

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
and we're going to make a bigger loop

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.559 
and we're going to make a bigger loop
this<00:04:05.480> time<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:08.239> accommodate<00:04:08.780> this<00:04:08.989> larger

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
this time to accommodate this larger

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.050 
this time to accommodate this larger
circular-shaped<00:04:11.569> vintage<00:04:12.560> finding<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.790> is

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
circular-shaped vintage finding that is

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.979 
circular-shaped vintage finding that is
really<00:04:14.450> beautiful<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:16.479> you<00:04:17.479> just<00:04:17.690> need<00:04:17.840> to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
really beautiful and you just need to

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:27.570 
really beautiful and you just need to
adjust<00:04:18.109> this<00:04:18.650> loop<00:04:19.389> so<00:04:20.389> that<00:04:20.419> it's<00:04:20.780> big<00:04:20.989> enough

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.840 

so<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.610> it's<00:04:28.880> big<00:04:29.030> enough<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.479> fit<00:04:30.040> on<00:04:31.040> the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
so that it's big enough to fit on the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.310 
so that it's big enough to fit on the
wire<00:04:32.060> our<00:04:32.630> next<00:04:32.930> step<00:04:33.229> is<00:04:33.850> to<00:04:34.850> end<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:35.810> over<00:04:36.200> the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
wire our next step is to end it over the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.020 
wire our next step is to end it over the
edges<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.710> our<00:04:37.180> handmade<00:04:38.180> pendant<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.729> do

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
edges of our handmade pendant so to do

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.210 
edges of our handmade pendant so to do
so<00:04:41.300> it's<00:04:41.660> very<00:04:41.900> simple<00:04:44.169> all<00:04:45.169> you<00:04:45.500> do<00:04:45.710> is<00:04:45.740> fold

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
so it's very simple all you do is fold

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.920 
so it's very simple all you do is fold
the<00:04:46.430> ends<00:04:46.750> in<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.669> center<00:04:50.000> we're<00:04:50.600> going<00:04:50.840> to

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
the ends in to the center we're going to

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.020 
the ends in to the center we're going to
connect<00:04:52.600> these<00:04:53.600> findings<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.950> our
