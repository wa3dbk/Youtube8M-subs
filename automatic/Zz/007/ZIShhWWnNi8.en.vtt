00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
can see they came out pretty sharp I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.560 
can see they came out pretty sharp I
went<00:00:22.289> back<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.619> touched<00:00:22.829> up<00:00:23.009> a<00:00:23.099> few<00:00:23.310> areas<00:00:23.730> but

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
went back and touched up a few areas but

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.999 
went back and touched up a few areas but
the<00:00:24.720> color<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:24.990> nice<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.499> not<00:00:25.589> too<00:00:25.800> dark

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
the color is nice it's not too dark

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.069 
the color is nice it's not too dark
that's<00:00:26.249> only<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.669> coat<00:00:26.909> of<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.390> pen<00:00:27.599> that's

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
that's only one coat of the pen that's

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.810 
that's only one coat of the pen that's
all<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> use<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.890> coat<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> pen<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
all I use with one coat of the pen I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.609 
all I use with one coat of the pen I
guess<00:00:30.539> there's<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.810> little<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.140> darker<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
guess there's a little bit darker of a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.240 
guess there's a little bit darker of a
pen<00:00:31.829> they<00:00:32.460> want<00:00:32.670> rescues<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:34.200> uh<00:00:34.260> pretty

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250

sharp really nice man I mean if you if
you<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.100> closely<00:00:38.400> certain<00:00:39.210> spots<00:00:39.740> see<00:00:40.740> if<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
you look closely certain spots see if I

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.950 
you look closely certain spots see if I
come<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.490> there<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.510> see<00:00:42.690> how<00:00:42.780> right

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
come like right there you see how right

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.940 
come like right there you see how right
there<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> bottom<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:43.710> little

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
there in the bottom it's a little

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
there in the bottom it's a little
lighter<00:00:44.130> I<00:00:44.400> guess<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.970> certain<00:00:45.210> parts<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
lighter I guess it certain parts of the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.950 
lighter I guess it certain parts of the
shoes<00:00:45.810> towards<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.830> hole<00:00:47.040> where<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> glue

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
shoes towards this hole where the glue

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.210 
shoes towards this hole where the glue
connects<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.470> bottom<00:00:52.710> part<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.070> sole

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
connects to the bottom part of the sole

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.850 
connects to the bottom part of the sole
the<00:00:53.550> glue<00:00:53.700> from<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.210> elephant<00:00:54.840> print<00:00:55.050> patch

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the glue from the elephant print patch

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.410 
the glue from the elephant print patch
or<00:00:56.160> whatever<00:00:56.400> you<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:56.580> to<00:00:56.640> call<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
or whatever you want to call that to the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.830 
or whatever you want to call that to the
bottom<00:00:57.810> of<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:57.960> sole<00:00:59.090> is<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.450> underneath

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
bottom of the sole is that underneath

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.740 
bottom of the sole is that underneath
and<00:01:01.350> because<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.650> that<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.190> weird<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:02.750> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and because of that it's weird but the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.569 
and because of that it's weird but the
marker<00:01:04.289> won't<00:01:04.469> take<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.890> certain<00:01:05.100> areas

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:05.579 
marker won't take in certain areas

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.569 
marker won't take in certain areas
because<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.969> it<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.799> even<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> consistent

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
because of it so even if you consistent

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.539 
because of it so even if you consistent
go<00:01:08.700> over<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.299> over<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.630> over<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.399> it<00:01:11.399> won't

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
go over and over and over it it won't

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.399 
go over and over and over it it won't
pick<00:01:11.789> up<00:01:11.909> any<00:01:12.060> color<00:01:12.270> which<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.990> kind<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.229> odd

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
pick up any color which is kind of odd

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.440 
pick up any color which is kind of odd
you're<00:01:14.340> gonna<00:01:14.429> have<00:01:14.609> a<00:01:14.640> few<00:01:14.939> parts<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you're gonna have a few parts of the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.789 
you're gonna have a few parts of the
shoes<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.109> like<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.649> if

kind<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.249> small<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:45.479> should<00:01:45.840> come<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.709> maybe

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
kind of small it should come up to maybe

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.959 
kind of small it should come up to maybe
here<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:48.869> start<00:01:49.259> dropping<00:01:49.709> down<00:01:49.889> so<00:01:50.880> on

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
here and then start dropping down so on

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:52.340

they'll probably be able to tell these

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.919 
they'll probably be able to tell these
replicas<00:01:53.969> just<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:54.359> the<00:01:54.539> back<00:01:54.719> the

and tumbled leather is nice I know this
part<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.749> not<00:02:06.929> that<00:02:07.109> humble<00:02:07.259> leather<00:02:07.529> it's

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
part is not that humble leather it's

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.219 
part is not that humble leather it's
regular<00:02:08.039> leather<00:02:08.189> so<00:02:08.489> that's<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.959> even

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
regular leather so that's right and even

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.530 
regular leather so that's right and even
back<00:02:10.379> here<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:11.549> have<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.819> little<00:02:12.060> indented

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
back here you have the little indented

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.250 
back here you have the little indented
leather<00:02:12.750> which

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
leather which

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.050 
leather which
I<00:02:13.290> believe<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.769> correct<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.489> regular<00:02:14.819> pair

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I believe is correct on the regular pair

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.229 
I believe is correct on the regular pair
so<00:02:15.629> that's<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.989> only<00:02:16.110> thing<00:02:16.500> that's<00:02:16.920> not
