00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 every time I get a hairstyle 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.970
 changuito here rebel many of you 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.290
 they ask me how do I do it and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.059
 although some of you have more or 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.730
 less the idea of how they are achieved 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.530
 this kind of hairstyles other and not good 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 the speciation I thought it would be a very 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
 good idea that we did it step by step 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.560
 and so at last clear all doubts 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.480
 Many of those who ask me really 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.609
 do not believe that this hairstyle I do 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.859
 when I really do not have any time 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.590
 to fix myself and then he opted for this 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.990
 combed so they tell me to and see what 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.990
 hairstyle so beautiful and rebellious 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.970
 The first thing you need is this guy 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.620
 of sponge donuts do not weigh the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.390
 can put the shelter and that kind of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.210
 things and public that you are going to drain 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 you're going to feel a lot or dripping 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.460
 your head but nothing really happens to you 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.230
 are these unlike diluted the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.480
 that many were made and that many of us 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.790
 we combed with that of the sock and I 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.910
 I also did this it does not weigh nadita and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.509
 then this area is very father 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.280
 I bought rehearsed at 25 pesos but when the 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.979
 development boom was everyone 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 I was getting out and out 95 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.610
 clear weights maybe that's why you're 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.050
 not knowing a little bit but go that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.240
 they do not know so I do not have any 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.070
 problem in using it as something too very 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.930
 important and this maybe for some 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.080
 optional you're going to use a brush 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.030
 I use some without bristles but in the end 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.470
 of the day is the one with which you feel most 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 comfortable 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.060
 and last but very important are 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.220
 hair lines and pins these 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.930
 I already bought them in gold because it was 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.580
 when he had totally decorated the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.410
 good hair with wicks and things like that 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.750
 and then he lost himself very well in my 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.700
 hair and now it's still working 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.770
 because the top part is brown my 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.780
 natural coffee so to speak and below is 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.000
 where I have the fantasy color so 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 I'm doing very well and well the lines of 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.510
 colors usually I buy them black 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.030
 but these are my favorites and the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.250
 I get in the market of my city this 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.360
 it does not have a beginning or end so they are 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.550
 very elastic 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.890
 they never burst in my hand so 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.360
 it did not hurt me anymore and things like that and can 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.980
 be the color that you want me so 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.780
 regular buy them black but in this 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.780
 occasion there was nothing else of colors 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.209
 we took inspiration into account and did not see 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.709
 the pompadour and your hairstyle, what I do is 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.709
 make it very important that forward so 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.049
 I'm going to let some of my hair free 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.840
 that I usually only do as 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.870
 a triangle is this and leave 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.829
 free while the rest I begin to 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.170
 assume 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.359
 do not worry much if you do not have 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.639
 totally smooth of the hair because 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:50.310
 remember that these hairstyles this one are 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.670
 hairstyles disheveled so that too 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.160
 will bring you say style to your 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.770
 hairstyle 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.290
 but also to buses that do not look like this 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.090
 like you had a tangle of hair and 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.210
 three you start like I'm halfway through 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.360
 hoisting these leagues I love them because they are 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:10.020
 really very elastic and do not hurt 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.810
 nothing hair 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.180
 then I still upload it a little bit 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.980
 plus 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.280
 once we have our changos 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.630
 and everything will take pretty 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.530
 and the only thing we are going to do is put it 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.180
 and this is supposed to be used like this then 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.410
 distribute your hair and put the side 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.750
 investment looks like that more 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.880
 perfect eye if you have blond hair 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.830
 I did not have to buy a black donut because 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.450
 is going to look horrible I preferred 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.319
 buy it coffee like that so I go 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.330
 with everything and the technique here is very easy 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.310
 and the only thing that works in this case is 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.140
 dona is to give volume to your hair 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.569
 and then once we wake 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.190
 it's like a banana you're going to give 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.819
 return 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.069
 but without it being perfect 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.079
 and then let's say you start to stop 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:14.670
 your hair and then you start adjusting 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:16.229
 with more people, it's better to put it on 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.060
 exercise that with many children who 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.090
 they like it so you can do it more 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.610
 short maybe I do not know but I do prefer 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.610
 do it as if it were to insist 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.260
 Y 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.030
 I'm going around 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.580
 until 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.580
 that finally remains as you want 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.969
 like visiting gold, I'm going to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.610
 put these golden brown 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.839
 this afternoon afternoon open pins 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.839
 buy existing 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.129
 and now if this little horse is left 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:06.059
 you will accommodate it around your 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:22.979
 hair that is already adjusted and now yes 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:24.959
 let the pin party begin and so on 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.999
 is how is the hairstyle really is 

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:28.979
 very simple very easy and very fast 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:31.619
 especially when we hurry and that 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.779
 kind of things many of you or many 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:35.399
 Sometimes they asked me do not believe me 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:38.490
 that really this hairstyle I use 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:40.949
 when I do not have time because it 's very, very 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.629
 simple and now I hope that you have 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.550
 liked and above all I hope that there 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:47.129
 aroused all your doubts serve you and 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.629
 above all, get rid of the heat in these 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.149
 days and in these sisters that we already 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.639
 there are a few for one and heat so 

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:56.260
 let's have fun going up the 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.330
 hair to everything that gives good 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.340
 to ask so I tell them of a 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.080
 time if they paint me again the 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.040
 hair and I did it with this manic 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.780
 panic called after midnight 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.800
 I would send this color is very blue but I 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.690
 dilute it with a little bit of 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.090
 conditioner why they remained toned 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.130
 between blue and water and I really am 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.900
 in love with my hair and so I go to 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.070
 comb everything that remains the week 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.120
 so that the color shows up and I hope 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.770
 I hope you have them 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.080
 liked and especially that has cleared 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.460
