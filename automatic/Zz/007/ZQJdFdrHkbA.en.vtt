00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
collaborates and there's such a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.740 
collaborates and there's such a
community<00:02:40.070> for<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.489> which<00:02:40.760> I<00:02:40.910> think<00:02:41.180> still

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
community for that which I think still

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.740 
community for that which I think still
today<00:02:42.140> but<00:02:42.380> especially<00:02:42.590> back<00:02:43.190> then<00:02:43.269> existed
