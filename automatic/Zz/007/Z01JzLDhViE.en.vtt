00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:02.650
 they lent to exist 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.040
 and I'm dedicated to 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.090
 I've always liked to do this here, the ones who are looking for more is 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.079
 aerial 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.339
 to all the people who are interested in this in this art 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.349
 what we are going to do on this occasion are three projects 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.380
 in chopped 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.349
 stop 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.039
 Mother's Day will arrive 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 3 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.890
 that project this time is a little box 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890
 that we are going to decorate with a special technique 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.909
 this technique 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.699
 no doubt as if it were 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.710
 we tend to Iquitos as if it were Hindu painting 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.030
 It is a technique that, but fed it a lot, caught my attention 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.870
 i 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.590
 the fabric iata swims 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.040
 but adopt it for my properties 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.730
 what we have to do is the following 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.410
 the box that we are going to lower the Quran 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.950
 Inca basketball 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.840
 d 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.650
 anything that is exposed in the bottom part and in the part the outline 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.290
 of tin art 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.830
 what is involved is that the lid 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.480
 we can paint it black 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.820
 because that is going to be 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.050
 the background of our 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.890
 you will not be brushstrokes that we are going to give 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.600
 quique what makes xx or colors stand out 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.810
 the palette said 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.100
 in which we carry 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.549
 irizar the one that is green the orange the yellow 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.030
 The Golden 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.650
 and the white 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.430
 what we have here 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.770
 basic to be able to do this technique is called by finished 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.720
 it's a barnier steele furniture 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.930
 glue to the water 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.680
 which has the peculiarity that it was very bright to our work once 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.400
 that is already finished 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.830
 and to be able to elaborate state the only thing that we need is a brush that they have 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.370
 in asia the india that have been preserved by certain short appetite 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.990
 I do not need to be 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 I do not say either because it will help us 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.210
 to do the quick paint droplet we're going to start working 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.959
 good is that we have our palette ready 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.649
 let's start mixing following the contour of the colors 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.889
 what we have here 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:22.359
 the first one we're going to achieve in the end so many times we take a drop of the sea 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.429
 we are not going to mix 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:28.619
 very good with our porcine 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.429
 at the beginning this is going to look a little clearer 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.949
 for the same porcelain look and Saturday but this one 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.099
 this material once it is k 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.099
 It gets completely transparent 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.119
 What it is about is that we are doing 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:45.879
 As if they were 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.149
 some 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.049
 with a rope areas 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.929
 they go niekerk delineating 1 behind the other 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:59.049
 It's a technique that is a little bit of a board but once you finish it relaxes a lot 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.589
 the attention to the people who are on the list 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.929
 because one afternoon that 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.990
 have nothing to do or what 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.529
 time is third to school 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.019
 sit down you can do this job 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.549
 and do not know how it helps them relax and in the end and the terminal 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.469
 Will 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.779
 they keep doing all this 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.989
 until the fifth inning in the contour 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.199
 in the plot relates 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.509
 I will continue with the other 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.939
 color range so we can 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.430
 finished of short time being able to explain why being repetitive one of these in 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.349
 the 1st 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.539
 it goes on to go on and on and on and on 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.599
 the basis for our skin is him 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.319
 We were going to be able to 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.930
 killed the second line of color that this time in white 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.389
 equal the most consulted destinations in the list to have the brightness 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.939
 plus 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.519
 that is as highlighted 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.439
 and the ridge where we put both the network 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.400
 on January 12 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.390
 with the orange color the two orange shirts 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.909
 there we are going to place 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.909
 the white color 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:13.959
 in this way 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.870
 it's a technique that's pretty simple but 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.419
 curiosity 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.319
 you can do all these years one hour more the contour of the cover 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.110
 but you can do 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.460
 they form the same as the group stated 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.949
 Hombre de Hierro 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.169
 to continue making toasting with this same technique and things were left 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.199
 pretty 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.150
 later on and the student there is a project that has something else 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.340
 finished 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.249
 but at the same time as the three 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.069
 Now we are going with another third color line than your favorite color 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.800
 the same fate leads us to twist 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.399
 There was never an instance of power because he was strong in what he had 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:57.370
 I was going to separate very well 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.759
 our 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.759
 color advisory committee that do most good 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.600
 this also for children is very very very nice 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.999
 10% 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.619
 apply this is more entertaining before lebanon naranjo 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.879
 so pretty title 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:19.179
 and once here we have here is repeats the range of colors 

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:21.039
 I am done 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.120
 to this color 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.290
 escom as we are closing the circle that's all there is no need to do 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.950
 cunnilingus the other thing 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.580
 once we had all the outline and the line determined 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.270
 the aforementioned 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.550
 two hands of that same material 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.150
 to the lid let it dry the minor theme so that we have a shine 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.830
 very nice in the end this one went well if they want 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.870
 Apply 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.150
 ugarte ubillÃºz 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.990
 fast dsk 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.990
 and they can also if they want to do a little more 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:58.750
 the course 'the box plus a striking 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.969
 apply pebbles interspersed between 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.169
 the news of colors that we have 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.590
 what is acrylic paint it is clear that everything I have done what I have worked 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.169
 It is with acrylic paints 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.509
 and that we are going to show them inhabitants so they can see 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.110
 I was going to report your color palette 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.949
 our last projected 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.569
 what can this box do that the network 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:21.680
 A technique 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.789
 so different and painting 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.210
 the curious 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.059
 p use the products also to take others 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:31.699
 acrylic paintings 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.229
 and this the 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.339
 the contributions are known that this process 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.430
 as far as the way before 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.779
 hillary there 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:43.319
 electricity 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.860
 all these products 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.979
 the truth I'm here 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.710
 in Latin America 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.639
 it was a determined force 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.289
 the three projects expected the week ceo 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:56.139
 what they make are quite simple 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.069
 and that they are not the last time
