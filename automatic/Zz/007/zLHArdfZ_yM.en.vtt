because<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.260> want<00:02:32.470> some<00:02:32.590> crappy<00:02:33.130> colors<00:02:33.460> the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
because I want some crappy colors the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.080 
because I want some crappy colors the
way<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.300> boom<00:02:34.690> works<00:02:34.960> is<00:02:35.230> any<00:02:35.680> region<00:02:36.310> closed

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
way to boom works is any region closed

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.650 
way to boom works is any region closed
region<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.260> fill<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.710> color<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.510> its

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
region you can fill the color so its

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.470 
region you can fill the color so its
face<00:02:40.900> here<00:02:41.200> they<00:02:41.530> can<00:02:41.680> just<00:02:41.710> go<00:02:42.010> blam<00:02:42.520> nass

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
face here they can just go blam nass

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.530 
face here they can just go blam nass
whole<00:02:43.750> face<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.110> pink<00:02:44.320> but<00:02:45.040> uh<00:02:45.190> oh<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:46.360> might

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
whole face is pink but uh oh we might

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.080 
whole face is pink but uh oh we might
have<00:02:46.570> actually<00:02:46.810> wanted<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.830> ear<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.910> inner

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
have actually wanted the ear the inner

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.190 
have actually wanted the ear the inner
ear<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.510> different<00:02:49.720> color<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.840> let's<00:02:52.840> undo

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
ear to be different color so let's undo

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.400 
ear to be different color so let's undo
that<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:54.820> move<00:02:54.970> has<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> feature<00:02:55.480> under<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
that and to move has a feature under the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.600 
that and to move has a feature under the
pink<00:02:56.740> bucket<00:02:58.200> for<00:02:59.580> creating<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.670> stroke<00:03:02.610> this

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
pink bucket for creating a stroke this

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.150 
pink bucket for creating a stroke this
is<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.910> be<00:03:04.030> an<00:03:04.120> invisible<00:03:04.660> line<00:03:05.160> so

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
is going to be an invisible line so

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.610 
is going to be an invisible line so
let's<00:03:06.430> get<00:03:07.120> ourselves<00:03:07.300> ready<00:03:07.630> in<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.989> good<00:03:08.140> spot

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.800 

and<00:03:11.620> we<00:03:11.890> just<00:03:12.070> simply<00:03:12.430> draw<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> line<00:03:13.630> that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
and we just simply draw a line that

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.280 
and we just simply draw a line that
crosses<00:03:15.180> or<00:03:16.180> we<00:03:16.600> want<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.870> be<00:03:18.720> yes<00:03:19.720> yes<00:03:20.110> don't

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
crosses or we want to be yes yes don't

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.940 
crosses or we want to be yes yes don't
show<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:22.020> just<00:03:23.020> reminding<00:03:23.410> us<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.560> we<00:03:23.800> need

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
show this just reminding us that we need

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.949 
show this just reminding us that we need
to<00:03:23.980> turn<00:03:24.190> on<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> stroke<00:03:25.300> view<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:25.750> we<00:03:25.780> can

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
to turn on a stroke view so we can

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.199 
to turn on a stroke view so we can
actually<00:03:26.050> see<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.470> lines<00:03:26.680> we<00:03:26.890> drew<00:03:27.209> okay

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
actually see the lines we drew okay

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.479 
actually see the lines we drew okay
that's<00:03:28.780> maybe<00:03:29.050> not<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.230> very<00:03:29.470> good<00:03:29.500> line<00:03:29.830> so

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
that's maybe not a very good line so

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.120 
that's maybe not a very good line so
we'll<00:03:30.670> give<00:03:30.790> another<00:03:30.970> shot<00:03:31.890> verb<00:03:34.980> I'm<00:03:35.980> going

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
we'll give another shot verb I'm going

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
we'll give another shot verb I'm going
to<00:03:36.280> let's<00:03:36.489> do<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.670> again<00:03:37.019> verb<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.880> there<00:03:40.060> we

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
to let's do it again verb and there we

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.259 
to let's do it again verb and there we
are<00:03:41.130> so<00:03:42.130> once<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:42.430> have<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:42.610> little<00:03:42.970> region

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
are so once we have that little region

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.110 
are so once we have that little region
there<00:03:43.980> we<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.130> turn<00:03:45.400> off<00:03:45.610> our<00:03:46.650> stroke<00:03:47.650> view

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
there we can turn off our stroke view

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.190 
there we can turn off our stroke view
get<00:03:49.120> ourselves<00:03:49.180> back<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.750> where<00:03:49.900> we<00:03:49.959> want<00:03:50.140> to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
get ourselves back to where we want to

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.259 
get ourselves back to where we want to
be<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.730> let's<00:03:51.730> try<00:03:51.940> that<00:03:52.120> paint<00:03:52.420> bucket<00:03:52.720> again

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
be and let's try that paint bucket again

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.120 
be and let's try that paint bucket again
so<00:03:55.269> take<00:03:55.510> our<00:03:55.600> crappy<00:03:55.959> color<00:03:56.170> well<00:03:56.920> it<00:03:57.040> will

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
so take our crappy color well it will

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.490 
so take our crappy color well it will
put<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.400> in<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.549> ear<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:57.940> time<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:59.350> will

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
put it in the ear this time and I will

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.620 
put it in the ear this time and I will
make<00:03:59.560> us<00:03:59.709> face<00:03:59.950> green<00:04:00.340> because<00:04:00.760> does<00:04:01.510> that

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
make us face green because does that

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.130 
make us face green because does that
make<00:04:01.810> sense<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:03.250> there<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.549> go<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.900> click
