00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 catastrophic climate predictions 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.410
 of land have not been confirmed so far 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.690
 contrary to global warming, which 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.110
 is an increase in the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.789
 ice in the Arctic Ocean, which grew 50% 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.710
 the reduction of the layer of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.270
 ice that covers the article has always been 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.830
 presented by advocating 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.560
 hypothesis of global warming provoked by 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.750
 by man as a symptom that something does not 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.630
 well in the terrestrial atmosphere that it 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.600
 has been going on since the 80's 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.579
 in 2007 the sales that emerged the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.020
 glacial melting were 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.210
 interpreted by scientists 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.040
 as evidence that the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.469
 carbon released into the air by 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.879
 human beings was one step closer to 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.680
 climate or collapse 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.050
 researchers such as the British james 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.030
 lovelock came to anticipate the death of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.489
 millions of people by the end of the century 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.460
 caused by the increase in temperature and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.149
 also of sea level 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.520
 in 2006 the bbc that there are more respectable 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.860
 communication chain of the united 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.960
 echo to a scary television 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.110
 the ice on the north pole would 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.600
 fatally disappear in the summer of 2013 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.060
 which is closing now james love 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.770
 love threw the towel two years ago made a 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.899
 Self-criticism apologized for 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.700
 alarmism and came to be stigmatized 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.530
 by the old comrades 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.149
 warmer is now the nature that 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.190
 fear to authorize this line of 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.229
 summer search in the Arctic is 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.890
 finished with an area covered by ice 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.539
 which is 50% more extensive than it existed in 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.700
 same date last year 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.929
 data collected by the satellite and 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.300
 tabulated by government agencies 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.960
 show that the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.780
 Arctic ice had on the last day 15 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.740
 5.1 million square kilometers 49% 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.000
 more than the US 3.42 million 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.280
 accumulated on the same date last year 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.860
 when historical record was recorded 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.960
 negative since the measurements by 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.390
 and started the teacher Ricardo 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.399
 University of SÃ£o Paulo is 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.439
 one of the most critical voices of the 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.820
 scientists who challenge the hypothesis of 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.770
 heating in exchange 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.750
 according to him what happened at the pole 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.759
 is an important proof that it does not 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.440
 is the carbon dioxide that controls the climate 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.829
 on the planet because it finds itself in the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.269
 earth is the sun the oceans volcanoes and everything 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.070
 is to show that they are entering 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.200
 in a new cooling cycle 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.299
 exactly as it happened in the 1920s 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.299
 920 in the 70s
