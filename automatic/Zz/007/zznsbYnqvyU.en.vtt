00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.240
 hi to all to the room i hope that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.550
 you are fine 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.539
 we find ourselves here on the map 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.000
 I will show you a hysteric 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.619
 rather intriguing which refers to the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.599
 lost series the missing 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.969
 so if you do not know I do you 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.170
 invite to go look on google so 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.200
 in the series there is one thing that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.690
 call the mirror it's kind of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.899
 bunker that serves the inhabitants of the island to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.329
 communicate with the outside world 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.039
 so in this series a character who 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.300
 is called michael by the way this is the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.879
 first to have escaped from the island while 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.250
 like ours michael in gta 5 1 who 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.890
 is alive and well so we could believe 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.059
 that they escape and Lille also 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 so I show you what it looks like 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.830
 in the series so it's not a simple 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.979
 element of decor to it's a real danger 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.780
 for the survivors 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.909
 so here too in gta 5 it's a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.470
 danger because they put it in the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.280
 depths of the ocean so at the limit 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.840
 even bearable for our player 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.860
 in the series it's dangerous for 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.920
 survivors because there are others 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.689
 people who covet the bunkers and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.570
 we if we approach it too low the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.350
 water pressure is killing us so we see 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.060
 although this thing represents a danger 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.789
 for everyone so there is a rumor 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.759
 who runs like what 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.530
 the mirror would contain the jetpack and that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.000
 it's here that we 'll get it back when 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.429
 update that counts that it contains 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.810
 low will make its appearance in gta so 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.670
 I personally think it a little 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.079
 weird 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.229
 after all it's just an easter egg 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.789
 so 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.020
 so that's after we're sure we see 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.579
 sees light inside so 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.659
 so this bunker necessarily contains 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.850
 something in the series the survivors 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.209
 they found inside the bunker 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.060
 two guys we will find there maybe 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.709
 nothing at all but we can say that it 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.720
 still remains unsettling it's this 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.829
 light 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.019
 so that's this story is that touches 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:23.239
 at its end I hope you have enjoyed 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.239
 and I tell you at the next ciao
