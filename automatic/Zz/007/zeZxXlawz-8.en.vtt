00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello people i am such braeburn 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.099
 I warmly welcome to his new 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 video the topic of this video is like 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.740
 you already recognize cologne here 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.590
 the us 6.1 yes after recently the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 last beta the beta 5 436 point 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.019
 different has apple now yesterday 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.090
 evening the os 6.1 for all users 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.219
 provided you can do that 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.660
 update in the here in the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.000
 attitudes to generally each 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.469
 Software updates and then finds 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.040
 it could be the same here about him 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.680
 invite as always jailbreaker allowed the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.899
 but in no case do but 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.460
 that be or at least if they have it 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.320
 you have to do some things there 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.430
 note that this is an end of the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.199
 videos more 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.219
 we look only times the innovations 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.370
 there we count on more 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.559
 information 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.300
 first of all, the ltg support is included 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.550
 several network operators possible 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.320
 for example in Switzerland 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.320
 I have here some viewers in 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.119
 switzerland for that should be so 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.280
 be useful with us in Germany 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.500
 but it does not matter anyway 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 another network operator came to it 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.920
 further to itunes match 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.930
 subscribers now single titles about the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.540
 iCloud and there is a new one 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.040
 path to reset the ed hardy 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.900
 But that's not all news 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.930
 the update there are a few more 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.970
 There are minor innovations, for example 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.369
 Improvements in the maps and in the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.430
 facebook app but also minimal 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.610
 changes of the other is so still 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.479
 the lockscreen changed slightly to 1 601 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.950
 namely the music player and though 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.810
 but we can press on it now 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.799
 we are always a music player 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.909
 Now something even pushed back 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.689
 pushed in and the clock is showing 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.560
 he now gone that is still new and 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.450
 otherwise there is still 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.180
 improvements with siri and indeed can 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.460
 you can buy now over series movie tickets 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 this feature is only for 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.629
 that means supporting customers from the usa 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.110
 if for us it is anyway 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.780
 irrelevant so big euro 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.330
 there is now on the ios 6.1 rather than 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.400
 not a must have tor to update but now 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.220
 In any case, it is not very happy 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.890
 the 16.1 is out there for now 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.350
 we do what for all the jailbreak fans 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.610
 which of course also means me and that 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.160
 is the eos six jailbreak now with 16.1 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.410
 as good as to grab it so close 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.230
 only is a few days on 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.340
 sunday this week so would have to 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.480
 the third will be the jailbreak 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.490
 it appears the jailbreak 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.780
 Developer planet being via twitter 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.520
 so it should not be communicated 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.700
 not something else in the short term 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.310
 What will happen to us? 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.040
 on sunday then the application for the os 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.709
 6.1 have man has just again on the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.940
 update from ios 6.1 waited there if he 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.830
 was there if you want this now 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.900
 has brought out the jailbreak 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.180
 Apple's security gap is one 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.800
 exploit that made the jailbreak possible 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.410
 fixed with 6.1 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.610
 madworld not only for 1 601 anyway 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:22.989
 but also for ios 6.0 point one and 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.630
 16.02 and os 6.0 will be available 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.160
 and if there is a jailbreak then 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.049
 Of course, I'll give it to you too 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.150
 jailbreak tutorial and of course again 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.519
 regular tips and tricks for 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.440
 jailbreak reviews of tweaks so who 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.060
 not to be missed to jailbreak it 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.400
 would definitely be off or off 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.860
 I would definitely be happy 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.019
 Now what's more important is all traders 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.540
 should avoid loading it over and 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.160
 but install it to load 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.049
 but you have to update ios 6.1 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.030
 load over itunes if your dragonball 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.709
 that means either you are looking for something 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.540
 after updates or if you are already on the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.390
 six points that now but he 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.010
 you have to have your iphone still loaded 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.720
 make again 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.400
 because otherwise it could cause problems 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.860
 jailbreak many is definitely 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.900
 very important that means I must not 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.690
 Just load and install here and 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.130
 then think now I can easily 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.050
 jailbreak 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.290
 as I said so you have to each 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.100
 case note so it was that of 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.690
 this video 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.500
 I am happy and I wish you 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:31.310
 now have fun downloading from the 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.310
 eu 6.1 and until then your dre profi
