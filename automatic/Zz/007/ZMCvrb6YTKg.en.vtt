00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
Braman Supermarine in blue and you can

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.870 
Braman Supermarine in blue and you can
as<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.110> can<00:00:13.259> probably<00:00:13.440> tell<00:00:13.650> sorry<00:00:14.639> about<00:00:14.790> the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
as you can probably tell sorry about the

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.240 
as you can probably tell sorry about the
quality<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.080> video<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.560> not<00:00:16.619> very<00:00:16.980> good

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
quality of the video it's not very good

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.279 
quality of the video it's not very good
but<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.150> best<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> light

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
but it's the best I can do in the light

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.450 
but it's the best I can do in the light
and<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.800> them<00:00:19.920> afraid

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.910 

yep<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.750> print<00:00:25.019> pretty<00:00:25.320> much<00:00:25.439> if<00:00:25.680> you're

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
yep so you print pretty much if you're

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
yep so you print pretty much if you're
looking<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.789> video<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.150> obviously<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
looking at this video you obviously I

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.009 
looking at this video you obviously I
got<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> youtube<00:00:28.859> search<00:00:29.820> Braman<00:00:30.330> Supermarine

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
got a youtube search Braman Supermarine

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.520 
got a youtube search Braman Supermarine
so<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.160> super<00:00:32.489> bring<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:33.450> blue<00:00:33.840> 43

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
so here is the super bring in blue 43

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.630 
so here is the super bring in blue 43
millimeters<00:00:34.829> by<00:00:35.280> 60<00:00:35.730> mil<00:00:35.969> deep<00:00:36.380> it's<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.640> fifty

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
millimeters by 60 mil deep it's a fifty

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.930 
millimeters by 60 mil deep it's a fifty
point<00:00:39.120> five<00:00:39.510> millimeters<00:00:40.200> love<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.559> hug<00:00:40.940> it's

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
point five millimeters love to hug it's

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450 
point five millimeters love to hug it's
a<00:00:42.230> sapphire<00:00:43.230> crystal<00:00:43.290> obviously<00:00:44.250> with<00:00:44.370> an

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a sapphire crystal obviously with an

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.660 
a sapphire crystal obviously with an
antique<00:00:44.760> reflective<00:00:45.420> glass<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.430> believe

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
antique reflective glass and I believe

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.500 
antique reflective glass and I believe
the<00:00:48.260> bezel<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.610> sapphire<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the bezel is sapphire as well or is this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.700 
the bezel is sapphire as well or is this
toughest<00:00:51.960> sapphire<00:00:52.469> um<00:00:53.239> it's<00:00:54.239> got<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> nice

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
toughest sapphire um it's got a nice

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.540 
toughest sapphire um it's got a nice
quality<00:00:55.710> feel<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:57.420> movement<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
quality feel to it that movement is a

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.950 
quality feel to it that movement is a
Braman<00:00:59.809> b-36

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
Braman b-36

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
Braman b-36
AE<00:01:01.850> which<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:03.300> allowed<00:01:03.989> led<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.890> believe<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.519> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
AE which I'm allowed led to believe is a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.590 
AE which I'm allowed led to believe is a
um<00:01:06.500> it's<00:01:07.500> based<00:01:07.740> off<00:01:07.920> an<00:01:08.100> ETA<00:01:09.530> 2836<00:01:10.530> movement

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
um it's based off an ETA 2836 movement

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.530 
um it's based off an ETA 2836 movement
the<00:01:12.600> movements<00:01:12.990> hosted<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> Faraday<00:01:13.920> cage

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
the movements hosted a Faraday cage

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
the movements hosted a Faraday cage
which<00:01:15.540> suspends<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:18.740> movement<00:01:19.740> inside<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
which suspends the movement inside the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.910 
which suspends the movement inside the
watch<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> three<00:01:21.810> part<00:01:22.020> case<00:01:22.439> where<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> think

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
watch is a three part case where I think

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.320 
watch is a three part case where I think
they<00:01:23.189> call<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.580> tip<00:01:24.180> trick<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.770> triptych

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
they call that a tip trick or triptych

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.370 
they call that a tip trick or triptych
technology<00:01:27.330> or<00:01:27.420> something<00:01:27.750> they<00:01:27.840> used<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
technology or something they used the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.300 
technology or something they used the
steel<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:30.890> hardened<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:33.229> 2000<00:01:34.229> Vickers<00:01:34.740> which

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
steel is hardened to 2000 Vickers which

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.410 
steel is hardened to 2000 Vickers which
i<00:01:35.430> think<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:37.520> pretty<00:01:38.520> hard<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.270> regular

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
i think is pretty hard I think regular

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.090 
i think is pretty hard I think regular
three<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:39.960> six<00:01:40.920> L<00:01:41.189> steel<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:43.100> four

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
three one six L steel is about four

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.499 
three one six L steel is about four
hundred<00:01:44.220> Vickers<00:01:44.820> um<00:01:46.729> it's<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> same<00:01:48.090> still

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
hundred Vickers um it's the same still

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.870 
hundred Vickers um it's the same still
they<00:01:48.689> used<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.259> make<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.070> turbine<00:01:50.880> blades<00:01:51.270> in

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
they used to make the turbine blades in
