00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
early 70s specific to the tone was aces

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.950 
early 70s specific to the tone was aces
use<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> slap<00:00:19.859> back<00:00:20.160> delay<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:21.449> slap<00:00:21.720> back

use of a slap back delay the slap back

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.109 
use of a slap back delay the slap back
was<00:00:22.230> there<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> studio<00:00:23.160> records<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.939> well

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
was there on the studio records as well

as the live records and really added an

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.599 
as the live records and really added an
element<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.420> texture<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.320> depth<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.010> Asus

element of texture and depth to Asus

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.060 
element of texture and depth to Asus
claim<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.599> also<00:00:30.750> gave<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> bit<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> separation

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
claim it also gave a bit of separation

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.100 
claim it also gave a bit of separation
so<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.610> his<00:00:32.790> guitar<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.390> pulled<00:00:33.630> out<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
so that his guitar was pulled out of the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.340 
so that his guitar was pulled out of the
mix<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.559> bit<00:00:34.860> more<00:00:35.160> than<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> other<00:00:35.880> guitars

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
mix a bit more than the other guitars

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.410 
mix a bit more than the other guitars
here's<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.500> example<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.850> slap<00:00:39.120> back

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
here's an example of what the slap back

00:00:39.420 --> 00:01:00.119 
here's an example of what the slap back
delay<00:00:39.450> would<00:00:40.170> sound<00:00:40.440> like

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.439 

playing<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.280> introduction<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:02.000> Strutter

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
playing the introduction to Strutter

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.210 
playing the introduction to Strutter
also<00:01:03.050> highlights<00:01:03.590> one<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.040> most

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
also highlights one of the most

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.490 
also highlights one of the most
important<00:01:04.850> elements<00:01:05.059> of<00:01:05.600> aces<00:01:06.050> rhythm

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
important elements of aces rhythm

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.640 
important elements of aces rhythm
playing<00:01:06.860> technique<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.790> that<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.380> ace

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
playing technique and that is that ace

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.450 
playing technique and that is that ace
typically<00:01:10.430> played<00:01:10.729> all<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.090> his<00:01:11.540> chords<00:01:12.110> an

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
typically played all of his chords an

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.570 
typically played all of his chords an
octave<00:01:13.460> above<00:01:13.759> where<00:01:14.720> Paul<00:01:15.020> played<00:01:15.380> them<00:01:15.650> the

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
octave above where Paul played them the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.880 
octave above where Paul played them the
way<00:01:16.729> that<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:17.090> achieve<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.960> by<00:01:18.200> routing

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
way that you achieve this is by routing

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.310 
way that you achieve this is by routing
your<00:01:19.040> chords<00:01:19.520> either<00:01:19.790> off<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.479> D<00:01:20.690> string<00:01:20.960> or

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
your chords either off the D string or

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.010 
your chords either off the D string or
the<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.770> string<00:01:22.369> like<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.060> just<00:01:23.119> did<00:01:23.539> in<00:01:23.750> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
the a string like I just did in the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:36.999 
the a string like I just did in the
Strutter<00:01:24.350> example<00:01:35.200> last<00:01:36.200> week<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:36.619> talked<00:01:36.890> a

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
Strutter example last week I talked a

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.340 
Strutter example last week I talked a
little<00:01:37.130> bit<00:01:37.340> as<00:01:37.520> well<00:01:37.700> about<00:01:38.000> aces<00:01:38.600> use<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
little bit as well about aces use of the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.950 
little bit as well about aces use of the
pentatonic<00:01:40.039> scale<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:40.610> we<00:01:41.450> went<00:01:41.660> over<00:01:41.929> a

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
pentatonic scale and we went over a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:54.190 
pentatonic scale and we went over a
pentatonic<00:01:42.350> scale<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:52.570> specifically<00:01:53.570> first

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
pentatonic scale in a specifically first

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.560 
pentatonic scale in a specifically first
position<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.759> element<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.180> I'm<00:01:56.360> going<00:01:56.540> to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
position the element that I'm going to

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.410 
position the element that I'm going to
go<00:01:56.689> over<00:01:56.990> today<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.979> addition<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.579> fifth

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
go over today is the addition of fifth

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.100 
go over today is the addition of fifth
position<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.229> second<00:02:01.130> position<00:02:01.630> which<00:02:02.630> again

very important elements of aces playing
I'm<00:02:07.189> going<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.520> blend<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.939> two<00:02:07.970> together<00:02:08.390> but

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
I'm going to blend the two together but

I<00:02:09.170> want<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.619> to<00:02:09.649> work<00:02:09.920> on<00:02:10.220> all<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.549> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
I want you to work on all of the

I want you to work on all of the
positions<00:02:11.299> of<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.840> pentatonic<00:02:12.320> scale

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.990 

learning<00:02:33.260> how<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.410> blend<00:02:33.740> those<00:02:33.920> two<00:02:34.280> or<00:02:34.550> three

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
learning how to blend those two or three

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.690 
learning how to blend those two or three
scales<00:02:35.360> together<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:36.560> even<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.280> fourth

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
scales together and then even a fourth

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.720 
scales together and then even a fourth
scale<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.420> really<00:02:39.110> important<00:02:39.710> but<00:02:40.250> once<00:02:40.580> you

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
scale is really important but once you

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.120 
scale is really important but once you
learn<00:02:40.880> how<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.180> do<00:02:41.420> all<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.750> those<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.530> can

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
learn how to do all of those I can

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.490 
learn how to do all of those I can
almost<00:02:43.310> guarantee<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:44.240> there's<00:02:44.750> not<00:02:45.110> too
