than nine for a battery problem it's not

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.830 
than nine for a battery problem it's not
there<00:02:30.070> you<00:02:30.430> can't<00:02:30.670> really<00:02:30.700> see<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:33.840> just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
there you can't really see it but just

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.510 
there you can't really see it but just
know<00:02:35.020> it's<00:02:35.170> not<00:02:35.260> there<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.650> um

I<00:02:36.550> put<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.390> inside<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.810> shoes<00:02:38.020> now<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:38.710> a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
I put it inside the shoes now so it's a

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.010 
I put it inside the shoes now so it's a
lot<00:02:38.890> easier<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.490> can<00:02:40.270> easily<00:02:40.540> change<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.900> out

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
lot easier you can easily change it out

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.320 
lot easier you can easily change it out
but<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> new<00:02:42.100> battery<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.460> once<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.760> dies<00:02:42.880> out

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330
