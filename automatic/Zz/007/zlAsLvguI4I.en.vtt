 Well, in general, now we already see how 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:36.110
 The first notes of this cilek return are 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.390

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.150
 well, how are the obstacles like 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.720
 through did not begin to play more interesting 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.430
 play before new modifications appeared 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.350
 weapons are cool in general i feel 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.390
 Sergey just after the interview he was like 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.369

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.930
 I never interview again anyway 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.520
 just not in any way yes you have a new 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.200
 Serious image in general so what? 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.280

 sleep early and just did not get enough sleep 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.909

 training we try to minimize 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.120
 all yes all your story tell but with 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.800
