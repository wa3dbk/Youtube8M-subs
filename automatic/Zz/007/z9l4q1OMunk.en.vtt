I<00:01:16.789> think<00:01:17.450> I<00:01:18.140> mean<00:01:18.880> if<00:01:19.880> Macy's<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.719> market<00:01:21.200> I

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
I think I mean if Macy's on the market I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.639 
I think I mean if Macy's on the market I
think<00:01:22.360> there's<00:01:23.360> not<00:01:23.570> only<00:01:23.780> one<00:01:23.960> club<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:24.619> is

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
think there's not only one club that is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.690 
think there's not only one club that is
there<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:26.240> whole<00:01:26.390> world<00:01:26.659> is<00:01:26.869> there<00:01:27.079> I<00:01:27.110> think

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
there the whole world is there I think

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.130 
there the whole world is there I think
because<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.850> get<00:01:29.000> opportunity<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.929> get<00:01:30.079> a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
because to get opportunity to get a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.889 
because to get opportunity to get a
player<00:01:30.439> like<00:01:30.679> Messi<00:01:31.159> I<00:01:31.570> don't<00:01:32.570> know<00:01:32.630> if<00:01:32.780> you

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
player like Messi I don't know if you

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.109 
player like Messi I don't know if you
get<00:01:33.140> that<00:01:33.590> kind<00:01:33.649> of<00:01:33.920> opportunity<00:01:34.039> and<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:35.060> don't

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
get that kind of opportunity and I don't

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.109

know<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.569> situation<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.319> and<00:01:36.850> for<00:01:37.850> me<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.000> think

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
know the situation is and for me I think

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.809

he's<00:01:38.390> very<00:01:38.450> happy<00:01:38.899> at<00:01:38.960> Barcelona<00:01:39.469> and<00:01:40.429> then<00:01:40.700> of

he's very happy at Barcelona and then of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.120 
he's very happy at Barcelona and then of
course<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.210> media<00:01:41.420> is<00:01:41.719> creating<00:01:42.319> this<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:42.950> know

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
course the media is creating this I know

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.700 
course the media is creating this I know
myself<00:01:43.429> when<00:01:43.909> I<00:01:44.030> when<00:01:44.750> I'm<00:01:44.899> changing<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.439> club

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
myself when I when I'm changing the club

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.499 
myself when I when I'm changing the club
like<00:01:46.009> all<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.520> media<00:01:46.819> is<00:01:46.880> creating<00:01:47.390> this

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
like all the media is creating this

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.190 
like all the media is creating this
atmosphere<00:01:48.289> life<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:49.610> out<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.209> going<00:01:50.539> away<00:01:50.659> and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
atmosphere life is out is going away and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.760 
atmosphere life is out is going away and
but<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.459> real<00:01:52.640> story<00:01:52.939> we<00:01:53.569> don't<00:01:53.720> know<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.170> I

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
but the real story we don't know and I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.419 
but the real story we don't know and I
think<00:01:55.069> only<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.759> lie<00:01:56.240> on<00:01:56.479> Messi<00:01:56.990> is<00:01:57.259> as<00:01:58.130> the

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
think only the lie on Messi is as the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.029 
think only the lie on Messi is as the
answers<00:01:58.759> for<00:01:59.000> that<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.479> probably<00:02:00.380> after<00:02:00.829> a

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
answers for that so probably after a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.059 
answers for that so probably after a
scheme<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:02.049> if<00:02:03.049> he<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.259> on<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.530> market<00:02:03.890> of

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
scheme but if he is on the market of

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.160 
scheme but if he is on the market of
