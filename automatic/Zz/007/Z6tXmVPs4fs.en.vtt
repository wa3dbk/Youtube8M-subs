not<00:00:10.769> cool<00:00:10.980> weather<00:00:11.130> plants<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.059> you're<00:00:12.240> not

not cool weather plants so you're not

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
these are the straight cucumbers and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.850

they get to be about eight inches which
are<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> standard<00:00:42.450> cucumbers<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.079> see

in<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.440> grocery<00:00:43.920> store<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.430> couple<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> tips

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
in your grocery store a couple of tips

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
in your grocery store a couple of tips
I<00:00:45.899> always<00:00:46.440> start<00:00:46.800> cucumbers<00:00:48.890> in<00:00:49.890> larger

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
I always start cucumbers in larger

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.130 
I always start cucumbers in larger
containers<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.210> don't<00:00:51.449> want<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> start<00:00:51.960> them

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
containers you don't want to start them

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.470 
containers you don't want to start them
in<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.320> smaller<00:00:52.680> cells<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.340> roots<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:54.149> over

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
in the smaller cells the roots will over

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
in the smaller cells the roots will over
grow<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.809> cell<00:00:55.050> quickly<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> you're<00:00:55.800> just

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
grow that cell quickly and you're just

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
grow that cell quickly and you're just
going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.190> damage<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.850> plant<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.449> shock<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
going to damage the plant and shock the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.420 
going to damage the plant and shock the
plant<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.199> always<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> start<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
plant so you always want to start in a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.400 
plant so you always want to start in a
container<00:00:59.820> at<00:01:00.000> least<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.420> size<00:01:00.690> for

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
container at least this size for

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.070 
container at least this size for
cucumbers<00:01:01.879> I<00:01:02.879> recommend<00:01:03.570> putting<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.899> two

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
cucumbers I recommend putting in two

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.719 
cucumbers I recommend putting in two
seeds<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> plant<00:01:05.129> these<00:01:05.250> outside

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
seeds and when I plant these outside

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.210 
seeds and when I plant these outside
into<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.030> earth<00:01:06.720> planting<00:01:07.200> hole<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:08.040> two

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
into the earth planting hole I want two

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.160 
into the earth planting hole I want two
plants<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.760> there<00:01:08.909> either<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.390> containers<00:01:09.960> or

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
plants in there either in containers or

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.590 
plants in there either in containers or
on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> ground<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.549> plants<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.330> space

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
on the ground but two plants in a space

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.859 
on the ground but two plants in a space
like<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.869> work<00:01:13.229> perfectly<00:01:13.680> fine<00:01:13.920> outdoors

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
like this work perfectly fine outdoors

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.249 
like this work perfectly fine outdoors
so<00:01:16.790> two<00:01:17.790> seeds<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.509> could<00:01:18.659> put<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> third

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so two seeds you could put in the third

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.690 
so two seeds you could put in the third
seed<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:19.979> three<00:01:20.250> come<00:01:20.400> up<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.670> going

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
seed if all three come up you're going

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.160 
seed if all three come up you're going
to<00:01:20.850> remove<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:21.840> want<00:01:22.049> more

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to remove one but you don't want more

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.440 
to remove one but you don't want more
than<00:01:22.229> two<00:01:22.560> plants<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.700> containers<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
than two plants in these containers and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
than two plants in these containers and
the<00:01:24.509> reason<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> do<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.250> least

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the reason that I like to do at least

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.490 
the reason that I like to do at least
two<00:01:26.520> seeds<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.750> only<00:01:27.960> one

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
two seeds you can see over here only one

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.130 
two seeds you can see over here only one
cucumber<00:01:28.770> came<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> straight-8<00:01:30.479> only

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
cucumber came up for the straight-8 only

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.510 
cucumber came up for the straight-8 only
one<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> doesn't<00:01:31.979> mean<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
one over here that doesn't mean the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
one over here that doesn't mean the
other<00:01:32.549> seeds<00:01:32.939> won't<00:01:33.470> nothing<00:01:34.470> came<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.829> over

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
other seeds won't nothing came up over

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.270 
other seeds won't nothing came up over
here<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.820> six<00:01:36.180> seeds<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.799> only<00:01:38.130> two

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
here so this was six seeds and only two

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
here so this was six seeds and only two
plants<00:01:38.579> come<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.240> came<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.380> with

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
plants come up so came up so with

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
plants come up so came up so with
cucumbers<00:01:41.520> definitely<00:01:42.030> put<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.329> two<00:01:42.509> seeds

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
cucumbers definitely put in two seeds

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
cucumbers definitely put in two seeds
maybe<00:01:43.110> three<00:01:43.500> seeds<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.399> thin<00:01:44.640> them

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
maybe three seeds and then thin them

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.889 
maybe three seeds and then thin them
down<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.360> two<00:01:45.540> plants<00:01:46.610> now<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.000> start

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
down to two plants now when you start

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.359 
down to two plants now when you start
them<00:01:49.049> indoors<00:01:49.229> you're<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> time<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.159> so

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
them indoors you're going to time it so

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.310 
them indoors you're going to time it so
that<00:01:50.700> well<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:51.780> were

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that well first of all these are were

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.130 
that well first of all these are were
planted<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.920> January<00:01:53.579> 22nd<00:01:54.360> today's<00:01:54.600> February

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
planted on January 22nd today's February

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.590 
planted on January 22nd today's February
12<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.399> three<00:01:56.729> weeks<00:01:56.969> worth<00:01:57.390> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
12 so this is about three weeks worth of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.590 
12 so this is about three weeks worth of
growth<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.530> four<00:01:58.950> or<00:01:59.070> five<00:01:59.250> weeks<00:01:59.549> before<00:02:00.119> your

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
growth so four or five weeks before your
