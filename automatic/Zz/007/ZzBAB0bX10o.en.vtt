00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
so when I screwed it around I wouldn't

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.670 
so when I screwed it around I wouldn't
have<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> worry<00:02:14.490> about<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.940> yep<00:02:15.900> that's<00:02:16.470> pretty

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
