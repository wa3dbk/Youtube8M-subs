00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
note the key that this song is in is

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.839 
note the key that this song is in is
really<00:00:07.230> funky<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.919> had<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.220> try<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.490> out<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.760> my

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
really funky I had to try it out of my

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.370 
really funky I had to try it out of my
keyboard<00:00:09.300> which<00:00:09.450> has<00:00:09.599> perfect<00:00:10.050> pitch<00:00:10.080> to

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
keyboard which has perfect pitch to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.140 
keyboard which has perfect pitch to
figure<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:10.769> out<00:00:10.950> but<00:00:11.490> it's<00:00:11.639> actually

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
figure this out but it's actually

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.820 
figure this out but it's actually
exactly<00:00:12.719> halfway<00:00:13.559> between<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.990> flat<00:00:15.990> minor<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
exactly halfway between a flat minor and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.890 
exactly halfway between a flat minor and
G<00:00:17.180> flat<00:00:18.180> or<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> G<00:00:19.170> minor<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:21.359> kind<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.779> hard

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
G flat or a G minor so it's kind of hard

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.720 
G flat or a G minor so it's kind of hard
for<00:00:22.020> me<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.100> keyboard<00:00:23.640> without

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
for me to do it on this keyboard without

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.700 
for me to do it on this keyboard without
it<00:00:24.029> sounding<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.390> little<00:00:24.570> funky<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> decided<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it sounding a little funky I decided it

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
it sounding a little funky I decided it
sounds<00:00:26.010> better<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.460> a-flat<00:00:27.180> minor<00:00:27.510> when

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
sounds better in a-flat minor when

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410 
sounds better in a-flat minor when
choosing<00:00:28.439> between<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> two<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.210> this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
choosing between the two so you got this

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
choosing between the two so you got this
lessons<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.960> a-flat<00:00:31.410> minor<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.890> will<00:00:32.070> sound<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
lessons in a-flat minor it will sound a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
lessons in a-flat minor it will sound a
little<00:00:32.520> weird<00:00:32.850> if<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> keyboard<00:00:34.230> tune

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
little weird if you have a keyboard tune

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.490 
little weird if you have a keyboard tune
it<00:00:35.190> down<00:00:35.370> 50%<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.630> you're<00:00:36.750> exactly<00:00:37.230> halfway

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
it down 50% so you're exactly halfway

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.690 
it down 50% so you're exactly halfway
between<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.570> flat<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.170> G<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.430> hand

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
between a flat and G so your right hand

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.160 
between a flat and G so your right hand
from<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> instrumental<00:00:45.420> backing<00:00:45.660> track<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
from the instrumental backing track to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:01:20.290 
from the instrumental backing track to
your<00:00:46.260> chorus<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.280> follows

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.910 

so<00:01:21.300> on<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.510> so<00:01:21.570> forth<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> right<00:01:22.650> hand

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so on and so forth that's the right hand

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.550 
so on and so forth that's the right hand
to<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> backing<00:01:23.610> track<00:01:23.760> for<00:01:23.910> your<00:01:24.030> course

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.969 

so<00:02:01.630> on<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:01.960> forth<00:02:02.350> that's<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.619> backing
