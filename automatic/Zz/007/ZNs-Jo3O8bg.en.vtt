was just a few hands really so there

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.780

wasn't that much time to check for not

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.030 
wasn't that much time to check for not
having<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.180> many<00:01:06.659> BB<00:01:07.050> into<00:01:07.260> play<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.740> seemed

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
having that many BB into play it seemed

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.530 
having that many BB into play it seemed
that<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.550> tournament<00:01:08.940> was<00:01:09.000> dragged<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.480> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that the tournament was dragged out a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.470 
that the tournament was dragged out a
lot<00:01:09.870> longer<00:01:10.080> than<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> typical<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.880> 1k

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
lot longer than a typical you know 1k

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.080 
lot longer than a typical you know 1k
event<00:01:12.720> obviously<00:01:12.870> I<00:01:13.350> think<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
event obviously I think because of the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.850 
event obviously I think because of the
level<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.510> play<00:01:15.690> was<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.080> high<00:01:16.290> young<00:01:16.710> people

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
level of play was so high young people

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.550
