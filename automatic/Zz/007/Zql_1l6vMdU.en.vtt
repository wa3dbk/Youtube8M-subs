I mean a lot of people don't realize or

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.710 
I mean a lot of people don't realize or
recognize<00:01:26.380> why<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.400> this<00:01:27.730> so<00:01:27.970> intense<00:01:28.420> you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
recognize why is this so intense you

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.050 
recognize why is this so intense you
know<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.620> lot<00:01:29.650> of<00:01:29.800> times<00:01:30.100> it's<00:01:30.520> because<00:01:30.820> of

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
know and a lot of times it's because of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.110 
know and a lot of times it's because of
the<00:01:31.240> music<00:01:31.390> so<00:01:32.350> when<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.460> apply<00:01:33.730> that<00:01:33.760> to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
the music so when you apply that to

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.110 
the music so when you apply that to
games<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.990> think<00:01:35.650> that<00:01:35.800> music<00:01:36.220> plays<00:01:36.610> at<00:01:36.820> least

that<00:01:37.510> important<00:01:37.930> of<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.080> role<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:39.220> can<00:01:39.370> play<00:01:39.640> a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.170 
experience so I think really when they
use<00:02:11.260> music<00:02:11.530> correctly<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.880> video<00:02:13.120> game

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
use music correctly in a video game

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.020 
use music correctly in a video game
