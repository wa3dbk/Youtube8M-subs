00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.249

 We were hired in the preparatory stage. 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.970
 occurred the program 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.430
 It was there that I met who had gotten a job so he continued 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.830
 working in cassock 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.070
 after he left the box cipolini byu pubis 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.969
 also there 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.969
 It's bad to have it when you left the box. 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.639
 after an epic month Claudio eta was there in the newsroom 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.400
 in the studio doing nothing 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 one of my external reports and the oil well 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.290
 there I made a scene with him one of the goals 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.540
 I went to the mato grosso bar of the herons a former senator of the republic who created a 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.870
 discomfort 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.169
 the official site by the city hall with the project 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.110
 where could land 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.639
 the billions 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.039
 and was a former senator of the republic no less appropriate to attack 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:26.310
 When I got there, there was that space. 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.460
 where do they land on the document 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.830
 saying that it really is a discomfort 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.400
 but a cenographic ship there as I took the plavix treat the few with the 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.870
 I cut and I took milk 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.280
 at the end of my story because he in the little window of the round the disk 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.030
 that was there that is scenographic 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.960
 in these three phases of farewell at the helm 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.270
 it was a success 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.939
 I leave from there where I went with him on the record record himself 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.959
 - years passed through the head to lose this too because it had robinho jose 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:02.110
 august founders of the city at the time less 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.939
 are the poor founders inclusive of the daily use of only the region 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:07.369
 it's a food 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:12.139
 he's super excited I saw that he was a person who would really give a double 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.309
 is very intelligent 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:17.119
 even because he had a capable intelligence 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:22.589
 is their attention is the cane he had friends here in the city always 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:24.930
 developing them by helping them engage 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.860
 he showed it on a television show 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.860
 it was a game l you see in the time of spectator 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.069
 the 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.999
 your goal by match 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:37.070
 He worked at the city hall. 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.960
 our nation 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.169
 lll chancelado protocols resulted in blue color 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.069

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.669
 n gal we want to hit the edge of disease 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.210
 I think it is possible for the user to get 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.309
 we do not have only negative things new plans 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:54.930
 I did not think so 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.789
 hardware 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:56.790
 the examples 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.300
 positive today 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.279
 oo rhodolfo a personality 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:05.839
 which, like others, is mainly 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:09.989
 to know that a person so simple at the time thank you very much without being 

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:13.360
 here I thank you for having representatives from the press 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.250
 communication as you who 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.490
 still rescues us 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.280
 Why do we stay in the big broadcasts around SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil? 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.220
 but people using sculfor dwarfism here it seems that yes I do not know and I have 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.319
 fear 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:32.310
 - driving with the lives of people shared that so the invitation was made I'm here 

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:35.699
 in Brazil a perfect week I'm here is the best invitation 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.810
 the press that seems to abandon us instead of us on the day of the year 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.509
 they abandon us because 

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:44.539
 if I'm a journalist for the last few years 

00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:48.129
 I want to get my brothers, I'll go after the interview, I hope. 

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:52.289
 that he calls me the support of the newspaper does not know what to look for then 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:55.499
 is happening because this interest with you is clear that I am 

00:07:55.499 --> 00:07:58.330
 here I never refused to give an interview was made with Belgian chocolate 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.309
 fortis with a pt so I think it's clear in the note that if it had not 

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:05.339
 found sbt will already be debuting here in brazil 

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:09.239
 grow up woke up with the red card for those who are coming back and I hope 

00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.409
 stay connected here in the house
