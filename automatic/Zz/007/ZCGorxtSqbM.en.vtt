adapter<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.879> tap<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.629> seamlessly

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
adapter we can tap into that seamlessly

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.639 
adapter we can tap into that seamlessly
by<00:00:56.190> plugging<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.879> into<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.930> Xbox<00:00:58.289> no

gaming access point to your Xbox 360 but

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
gaming access point to your Xbox 360 but
two<00:01:23.159> things<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.790> need<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.240> little<00:01:24.600> bit

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
two things you need to know a little bit

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.859 
two things you need to know a little bit
of<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> technical<00:01:25.290> know-how<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.820> also<00:01:27.540> it's

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
of a technical know-how and also it's

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.140 
of a technical know-how and also it's
not<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.170> elegant

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
not as elegant

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.990 
not as elegant
having<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.770> access<00:01:31.770> point<00:01:32.009> next<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.579> Xbox

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.810 
having a access point next to your Xbox
360<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.650> device<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.579> actually

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
360 as this little device that actually

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.929 
360 as this little device that actually
is<00:01:36.270> built<00:01:36.810> into<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.500> security<00:01:37.979> feature<00:01:38.189> block

is built into the security feature block

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.670 
is built into the security feature block
I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.509> actually<00:01:39.840> an<00:01:39.900> extra<00:01:40.259> security

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
I think it's actually an extra security

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.010 
I think it's actually an extra security
feature<00:01:40.950> hole<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> back<00:01:41.790> where<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
basically locks in clamps and connects

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.289 
basically locks in clamps and connects
