with an on/off switch which is labeled

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.280 
with an on/off switch which is labeled
overkill<00:00:48.550> which<00:00:49.510> gives<00:00:49.810> you<00:00:49.930> quite<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.110> good

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
overkill which gives you quite a good

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.870 
overkill which gives you quite a good
idea<00:00:50.470> what<00:00:50.590> you<00:00:50.680> can<00:00:50.920> do<00:00:51.100> with<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:51.400> module<00:00:51.700> if

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
idea what you can do with this module if

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.790 
idea what you can do with this module if
you<00:00:52.090> want<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.420> then<00:00:52.870> we<00:00:53.020> have<00:00:53.110> three<00:00:53.440> quarter

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
you want to then we have three quarter

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.460 
you want to then we have three quarter
inch<00:00:53.950> drag<00:00:54.310> trigger<00:00:54.820> inputs<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:56.020> right<00:00:56.260> one

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
inch drag trigger inputs the right one

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.530 
inch drag trigger inputs the right one
is<00:00:56.680> a<00:00:56.890> gate<00:00:57.130> input<00:00:57.520> which<00:00:57.970> either<00:00:58.180> just

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
is a gate input which either just

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.660 
is a gate input which either just
triggers<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.380> bar<00:00:59.530> Mona<00:00:59.710> at<00:01:00.220> a<00:01:00.280> certain

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
triggers the bar Mona at a certain

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.910 
triggers the bar Mona at a certain
volume<00:01:00.790> or<00:01:01.240> it<00:01:01.600> can<00:01:01.750> also<00:01:01.840> track<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.590> volume

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
volume or it can also track the volume

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.280 
volume or it can also track the volume
to<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.310> gate<00:01:03.490> signals<00:01:03.940> voltage<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:04.989> can

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
to the gate signals voltage so you can

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.840 
to the gate signals voltage so you can
play<00:01:05.560> more<00:01:05.710> expressively<00:01:06.250> by<00:01:06.520> sending

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
play more expressively by sending

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.050 
play more expressively by sending
different<00:01:07.000> voltages<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.229> gate<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.909> in

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
different voltages to the gate then in

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.700 
different voltages to the gate then in
the<00:01:10.150> middle<00:01:10.360> we<00:01:10.509> have<00:01:10.540> foot<00:01:10.899> pedal<00:01:11.170> input<00:01:11.319> and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
the middle we have foot pedal input and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.709 
the middle we have foot pedal input and
on<00:01:12.249> the<00:01:12.340> left<00:01:12.549> there<00:01:12.850> is<00:01:12.880> an<00:01:13.030> audio<00:01:13.359> trigger

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
on the left there is an audio trigger

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.380

input<00:01:14.229> which<00:01:14.859> triggers<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.340> Ramona<00:01:15.789> at<00:01:16.030> a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
input which triggers the Ramona at a

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.819 
input which triggers the Ramona at a
certain<00:01:16.810> audio<00:01:17.140> level<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.590> could

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
certain audio level so you could

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.559 
certain audio level so you could
basically<00:01:18.009> clap<00:01:18.609> into<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> microphone<00:01:19.329> and

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
basically clap into a microphone and

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.069 
basically clap into a microphone and
have<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.079> Ramona<00:01:20.409> trigger<00:01:21.219> to<00:01:21.549> that<00:01:21.810> next<00:01:22.810> we

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
have the Ramona trigger to that next we

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.989 
have the Ramona trigger to that next we
have<00:01:23.200> two<00:01:23.439> MIDI<00:01:23.649> sockets<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.639> through

it's<00:02:03.459> not<00:02:03.639> that<00:02:03.819> spectacular<00:02:04.090> yet<00:02:04.869> with

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
it's not that spectacular yet with

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.430 
it's not that spectacular yet with
everything<00:02:06.009> dialed<00:02:06.249> down<00:02:06.549> pretty<00:02:07.060> much<00:02:07.440> so

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
everything dialed down pretty much so

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.990 
everything dialed down pretty much so
let's<00:02:08.679> try<00:02:08.920> fiddling<00:02:09.340> with<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.550> knobs<00:02:09.759> little

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
let's try fiddling with the knobs little

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.199 
let's try fiddling with the knobs little
the<00:02:13.000> first<00:02:13.209> knob<00:02:13.480> here<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.170> decay<00:02:14.740> knob

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.600 

which<00:02:22.209> obviously<00:02:22.510> adjusts<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.590> decay<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.190> the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
which obviously adjusts the decay of the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:40.350 
which obviously adjusts the decay of the
sound<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.819> second<00:02:28.120> knob<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.540> pitch<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:40.180> next

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
sound the second knob is pitch the next

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.199 
sound the second knob is pitch the next
two<00:02:40.720> knobs<00:02:40.930> are<00:02:41.260> Bend<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.920> time<00:02:42.220> which<00:02:42.700> adjust

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
two knobs are Bend and time which adjust

00:02:43.209 --> 00:03:00.390 
two knobs are Bend and time which adjust
the<00:02:43.360> pitch<00:02:43.569> modulation<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.920> can<00:03:00.160> give<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.370> a

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
the pitch modulation this can give you a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.780 
the pitch modulation this can give you a
kick<00:03:00.609> even<00:03:01.329> more<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.629> a<00:03:01.720> punch<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:03.400> we<00:03:03.579> have

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
kick even more of a punch then we have

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.990 
kick even more of a punch then we have
FM<00:03:04.480> frequency<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.290> FM<00:03:05.709> intensity<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.819> it's

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
FM frequency and FM intensity so it's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.119 
FM frequency and FM intensity so it's
basically<00:03:07.299> frequency<00:03:07.930> modulation<00:03:08.319> which<00:03:08.920> can

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
basically frequency modulation which can

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:21.020 
basically frequency modulation which can
give<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> sound<00:03:09.459> little<00:03:09.790> more<00:03:09.940> texture

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.400 

then<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.299> bottom<00:03:22.540> row<00:03:22.690> we<00:03:22.840> have<00:03:22.989> an<00:03:23.079> attack

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
then in the bottom row we have an attack

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.250 
then in the bottom row we have an attack
knob<00:03:23.650> which<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.430> not<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.879> attack<00:03:25.180> time<00:03:25.480> but<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
knob which is not the attack time but it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.979 
knob which is not the attack time but it
dials<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.980> pulled<00:03:27.250> sound<00:03:27.700> giving<00:03:28.419> your<00:03:28.630> kick

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
dials in a pulled sound giving your kick

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:41.520 
dials in a pulled sound giving your kick
drum<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.230> little<00:03:29.470> more<00:03:29.620> of<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.769> click<00:03:40.380> then<00:03:41.380> we

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
drum a little more of a click then we

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.849 
drum a little more of a click then we
have<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.680> noise<00:03:41.950> knob<00:03:45.959> which<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:47.380> mix<00:03:47.590> us<00:03:47.709> in

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
have a noise knob which just mix us in

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:54.149 
have a noise knob which just mix us in
some<00:03:48.099> noise

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.229 

here<00:03:55.159> I<00:03:55.219> wish<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.760> they<00:03:55.939> would<00:03:56.060> have

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
here I wish that they would have

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.740 
here I wish that they would have
included<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:57.140> noise<00:03:57.650> time<00:03:58.099> knob<00:03:58.640> as<00:03:58.879> well<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.719> I

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
included a noise time knob as well so I

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.610 
included a noise time knob as well so I
could<00:04:00.170> adjust<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.680> length<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.819> noise

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
could adjust the length of the noise

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.009 
could adjust the length of the noise
because<00:04:03.620> right<00:04:03.829> now<00:04:07.090> it's<00:04:08.090> just<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.599> short<00:04:08.780> hit

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
because right now it's just a short hit

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.720 
because right now it's just a short hit
at<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.319> beginning<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.829> sound<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:13.549> next

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
at the beginning of the sound the next

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.330 
at the beginning of the sound the next
mode<00:04:13.969> is<00:04:14.000> wave<00:04:14.450> which<00:04:14.870> controls<00:04:15.349> the<00:04:15.889> shape<00:04:16.130> of

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
mode is wave which controls the shape of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.189 
mode is wave which controls the shape of
our<00:04:16.789> wave<00:04:17.000> goes<00:04:17.570> from<00:04:17.840> sine<00:04:18.199> wave<00:04:23.199> seamlessly

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
our wave goes from sine wave seamlessly

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.640 
our wave goes from sine wave seamlessly
into<00:04:24.680> pulse<00:04:25.160> wave

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.280

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
and next to that we have the infamous

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.070 
and next to that we have the infamous
balls<00:04:33.800> knob<00:04:34.280> which<00:04:34.970> just<00:04:35.330> fattens<00:04:35.780> up<00:04:35.900> the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
balls knob which just fattens up the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:54.730 
balls knob which just fattens up the

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
sound even warm and to the right there

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.920

is<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.220> big<00:04:55.400> knob<00:04:55.580> labeled<00:04:55.880> volume<00:04:56.479> which

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
is the big knob labeled volume which

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.810 
is the big knob labeled volume which

250 euros the vimana kick Lancer is

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.240 
250 euros the vimana kick Lancer is
definitely<00:05:05.270> on<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.570> expensive<00:05:06.080> side<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:07.100> do

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
definitely on the expensive side you do

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.159 
definitely on the expensive side you do
however<00:05:07.430> get<00:05:07.910> really<00:05:08.389> expressive<00:05:08.840> kick<00:05:08.990> drum

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
however get really expressive kick drum

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.770 
however get really expressive kick drum
sounds<00:05:09.530> out<00:05:09.710> of<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:09.889> and<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:11.090> interfaces<00:05:11.630> with

sounds out of it and it interfaces with
pretty<00:05:12.080> much<00:05:12.229> everything<00:05:12.560> so<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:13.220> can

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
pretty much everything so you can

pretty much everything so you can
incorporate<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:14.180> in<00:05:14.360> pretty<00:05:14.570> much<00:05:14.660> any<00:05:15.020> music
