00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the third pilot is not yet 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 whichever qualifying it 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.429
 it was just a matter of the track because 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 along the heating the carpet came out 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.410
 popular for having stapled and sewage 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.089
 I was trying to feel this way, I 'm 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.650
 wanting to get hurt and abandon the 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.869
 old road facilities but 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 recovered from the problem of infection 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.449
 fall he suffered and even one side 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.099
 very strong fall in correction 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.869
 here that ended up falling was not jonilson 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.710
 The crazy kiko whistles 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.689
 falling down 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.160
 Henri Balestrin for the third 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.780
 last year, one of the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 motocross promises 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.370
 in this mode in the full stadium book 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 really can have but stop here 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.180
 security is already being 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
 made of the medical team that the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.239
 door and quickly entered the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.930
 he is receiving the first 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.760
 calls it a pity what the henrique 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 balestrin and was third in the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.340
 Last year I'm only 20 years old. 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.109
 In clear evolution is making a clip and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.239
 is a pilot who has great maneuvers of 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.010
 base are the regular maneuvers with it 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.260
 with the bike upside- down is very 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.830
 good in this type of maneuver and how 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.570
 could add to that the flip 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 added betclic his repertoire is 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
 one of the pilots that really could 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 to positively surprise this first 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.210
 The pilots normally measure the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.549
 distances neodi is to see how I 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.020
 I fit the perfect place in daycare for 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.880
 then in qualifying try 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.619
 maneuvers was to make this maneuver 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.600
 that gives a nervous people was watching 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.770
 here really quite nervous 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.409
 especially you had an accident 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.350
 grave for themselves 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.969
 The young man is actually I just was not just me 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:41.149
 that I think I play the joy fell ee up 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.250
 a maneuver that he has as not 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.560
 talking is not having now started to 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.179
 make this year's end to be able to do 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.819
 Here in poverty presented the cup 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.740
 Brazil that you can see in the image that he 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:54.380
 is a bit off -axis 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.479
 already in the takeoff januario already with the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.670
 very steep motorcycle and could not 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.380
 make the landing they are practically 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.270
 to make a felipe that is a 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.140
 back flip out only used in 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.140
 technician evaluation
