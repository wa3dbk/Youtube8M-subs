00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.799
 it took us 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.590
 smeared the inside of the solution is difficult to mix 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.160
 difficult it is clay sandy mix a little 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.380
 cement-sand mixture 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.279
 a little ash and a little salt what is it 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.689
 gives it gives a dense sintering 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.070
 you can work directly on the stove and warm 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.879

 music and stroked with wet mitts 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.440
 Here's the delay decided not to spend too much 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.960
 money when riveting stainless steel here 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 maybe even two sides will be super 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.320
 economical option 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:04.159
 super perpetual latches. 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:07.590
 more economic than the bath here 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.729
 added sand from kunal and more to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.799
 not cracked their proportions increased 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 proportions such about 1 part 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.690
 sand one part beat written 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.940
 mortar and part of the cement-sand 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.190
 solution 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.950
 all this got stuck gathered everything in place 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.610
 below the style or stainless sheet there 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 inside 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.649
 so that the moisture is sleeping here forgot to put 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.440
 waterproofing benefits slept not 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.070
 dragged into the brownies channel therefore 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.090
 it was they who were constantly being killed 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:49.259
 accordingly here the opportunity 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:53.929
 shut down you can safely stove 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.720
 here you can not see how to do 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.039
 can't do something here 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.979
 categorically can not spread firewood 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:11.899
