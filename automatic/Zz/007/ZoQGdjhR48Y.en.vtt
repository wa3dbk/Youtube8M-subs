have the MRAP rate and the friends it's
either<00:01:36.600> gonna<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> forward<00:01:37.500> side<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
either gonna be on the forward side you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.319 
either gonna be on the forward side you
kind<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.490> want<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> beginning<00:01:39.119> but

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
kind of want it in the beginning but

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.480 
kind of want it in the beginning but
here<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:39.990> saw<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> target

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
here but we saw actually that the target

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.550 
here but we saw actually that the target
was<00:01:41.670> close<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> didn't<00:01:42.840> stop<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
was close there so I didn't stop this is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
was close there so I didn't stop this is
exactly<00:01:43.979> why<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.189> want<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.610> MRAP<00:01:44.759> there<00:01:45.329> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
exactly why you want the MRAP there to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
exactly why you want the MRAP there to
get<00:01:45.869> away<00:01:45.990> from<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.350> tank<00:01:46.590> fast<00:01:46.939> going<00:01:47.939> near

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
get away from that tank fast going near

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.630 
get away from that tank fast going near
the<00:01:48.329> front<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.200> let<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.829> point<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the front here just let it go point the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
the front here just let it go point the
bomb<00:01:50.790> no<00:01:51.060> after<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> plant<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> bomb<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.500> this

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
bomb no after you plant the bomb on this

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.620 
bomb no after you plant the bomb on this
side<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.340> important<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.060> they're<00:01:54.479> not

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
side here it's important if they're not

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.109 
side here it's important if they're not
shut<00:01:54.960> already<00:01:55.380> closed<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.549> blinds<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
shut already closed the blinds the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.090 
shut already closed the blinds the
armored<00:01:57.509> blinds<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> don't<00:01:58.710> want<00:01:58.950> them

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
armored blinds are you don't want them

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.649 
armored blinds are you don't want them
coming<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> enemy<00:01:59.969> coming<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.329> from<00:02:00.509> all

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
coming in the enemy coming in from all

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.569 
coming in the enemy coming in from all
sides<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.469> want<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.710> contain<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.340> want<00:02:02.520> to

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
sides you want to contain it you want to

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.560 
sides you want to contain it you want to
know<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.969> they're<00:02:03.119> only<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> be

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
know that they're only going to be

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.899 
know that they're only going to be
coming<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:03.990> from<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.259> front<00:02:04.500> side<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.219> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
coming in from that front side and you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.130 
coming in from that front side and you
can<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.390> they'll<00:02:06.570> be<00:02:06.659> coming<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:06.990> from

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
can see that they'll be coming in from

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.440 
can see that they'll be coming in from
this<00:02:07.259> side<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.890> keep<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.610> mind<00:02:08.879> when

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
this side here just keep in mind when

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.750 
this side here just keep in mind when
you<00:02:09.539> plant<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> bomb<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> goes<00:02:10.950> off<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.580> has

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you plant the bomb if it goes off it has

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.120 
you plant the bomb if it goes off it has
quite<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.150> explosion

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
quite the explosion

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.160 
quite the explosion
so<00:02:13.520> if<00:02:13.670> you're<00:02:13.820> close<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.270> there<00:02:14.450> you're<00:02:15.080> gonna

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
so if you're close in there you're gonna

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.830 
so if you're close in there you're gonna
end<00:02:15.440> up<00:02:15.530> getting<00:02:15.620> killed<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.160> like<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.840> in

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
end up getting killed just like that in

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.840 
end up getting killed just like that in
the<00:02:18.080> event<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.560> bomb<00:02:18.800> target<00:02:19.250> spawns<00:02:19.610> on

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
the event that a bomb target spawns on

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.060 
the event that a bomb target spawns on

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.650 
tower what you're gonna want to do is
grab<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.740> bomb<00:02:27.950> head<00:02:28.490> in<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.790> tower<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.510> make

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
grab that bomb head in the tower to make

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.750 
grab that bomb head in the tower to make

first target at the top there there are

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.150 
first target at the top there there are
two<00:02:46.400> optimal<00:02:47.090> pathways<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.380> first<00:02:48.680> being<00:02:48.920> in

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
two optimal pathways the first being in

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.100 
two optimal pathways the first being in
front<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> target<00:02:50.090> closest<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.020> the

front of the target closest to the
bridge<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.950> other<00:02:52.070> one<00:02:52.280> actually<00:02:52.700> in

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
between the top and the middle target as

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.860 
between the top and the middle target as
previously<00:02:55.940> mentioned<00:02:56.240> you<00:02:56.480> want<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.750> make

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
previously mentioned you want to make

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.060 
previously mentioned you want to make
sure<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.230> when<00:02:57.380> you're<00:02:57.500> deploying<00:02:57.860> you

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
sure that when you're deploying you

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.220 
sure that when you're deploying you
freefall<00:02:58.640> as<00:02:58.820> much<00:02:59.150> as<00:02:59.330> possible<00:02:59.570> as<00:03:00.020> it's

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
freefall as much as possible as it's

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.960 
freefall as much as possible as it's
harder<00:03:00.500> for<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.770> enemy<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.310> target<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.850> and

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
harder for the enemy to target you and

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.340 
harder for the enemy to target you and

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.430 
strategy as you can see it's more to do
with<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:17.790> helicopters<00:06:18.479> and<00:06:18.630> I<00:06:19.050> wanted<00:06:19.350> to

with the helicopters and I wanted to

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.360 
with the helicopters and I wanted to
throw<00:06:19.650> this<00:06:19.800> in<00:06:19.950> there<00:06:20.070> because<00:06:20.160> it's

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
throw this in there because it's

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.190 
throw this in there because it's
