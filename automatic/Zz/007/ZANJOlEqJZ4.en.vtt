00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that you take out the actual mirror

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.450 
that you take out the actual mirror
itself<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:52.289> mir<00:00:52.559> itself<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.280> actually

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
itself and the mir itself is actually

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.060 
itself and the mir itself is actually
connected<00:00:54.180> they're<00:00:54.539> actually<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:55.110> pieces<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
connected they're actually two pieces of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.860 
connected they're actually two pieces of
glass<00:00:56.420> basically<00:00:57.420> there<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:59.239> glass<00:01:00.239> over

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
glass basically there is a glass over

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.170 
glass basically there is a glass over
the<00:01:00.989> actual<00:01:01.350> mirror<00:01:01.620> itself<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.910> break

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the actual mirror itself and to break

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.000 
the actual mirror itself and to break
the<00:01:03.510> adhesive<00:01:04.049> scene<00:01:04.320> between<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> two

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the adhesive scene between the two

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.250 
the adhesive scene between the two
glasses<00:01:05.250> you're<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> need<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.299> exacto

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
glasses you're going to need an exacto

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740 
glasses you're going to need an exacto
knife<00:01:07.610> similar<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> be

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
knife similar to this and it has to be

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.660 
knife similar to this and it has to be
really<00:01:10.260> thin<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.860> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> then

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
really thin like kind of like that then

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.480 
really thin like kind of like that then
so<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.860> careful<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.340> try

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
so you got to be really careful but try

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.120 
so you got to be really careful but try
not<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.670> break<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> glass<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
not to break the glass it's you you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.160 
not to break the glass it's you you
should<00:01:17.280> take<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.460> time<00:01:17.759> doing<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.210> once<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
should take your time doing it once you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.770 
should take your time doing it once you
break<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.619> seam<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:23.009> liquid<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.570> mean

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
break that seam the liquid you want mean

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
break that seam the liquid you want mean
you're<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> liquid<00:01:25.830> make<00:01:26.220> sure

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you're going to see the liquid make sure

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.109 
you're going to see the liquid make sure
you<00:01:26.430> keep<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.729> level

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
you keep it level

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.030 
you keep it level
so<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> doesn't<00:01:27.570> spill<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:29.030> once<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.299> that

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
so it doesn't spill and once you do that

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.859 
so it doesn't spill and once you do that
you<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.250> clean<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.909> used<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.329> magic<00:01:33.509> rub

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you can clean it up I used a magic rub

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
you can clean it up I used a magic rub
eraser<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:36.090> works<00:01:36.329> nicely<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
eraser which I think works nicely and it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.760 
eraser which I think works nicely and it
really<00:01:38.759> wasn't<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.869> hard<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.380> thought<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.680> was

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
really wasn't that hard I thought it was

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.590 
really wasn't that hard I thought it was
going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> need<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.790> severe<00:01:42.119> scrubbing

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
going to need a like severe scrubbing

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.100 
going to need a like severe scrubbing
but<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.140> came<00:01:43.259> off<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:44.659> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.930> have

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
but it just came off the if you have

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.410 
but it just came off the if you have
haze<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> yellow<00:01:47.970> haze<00:01:48.149> that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
haze kind of like the yellow haze that

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.889 
haze kind of like the yellow haze that
comes<00:01:48.659> off<00:01:48.869> easily<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> black

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
comes off easily if you have the black

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.630 
comes off easily if you have the black
mercury<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.100> mercury<00:01:53.280> something

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
mercury I think it's mercury something

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.490 
mercury I think it's mercury something
like<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.020> you're<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.229> need<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
like that you're going to need to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
like that you're going to need to
carefully<00:01:56.100> dispose<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:59.270> it<00:02:00.270> really

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
carefully dispose of that and it really

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.929 
carefully dispose of that and it really
don't<00:02:00.719> taught<00:02:00.930> me<00:02:01.079> thirty<00:02:01.320> minutes<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.860> do<00:02:02.399> if

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
don't taught me thirty minutes to do if

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.230 
don't taught me thirty minutes to do if
you're<00:02:03.090> once<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.710> reassemble<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.210> what<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you're once you reassemble it what I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.359 
you're once you reassemble it what I
used<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.869> tape<00:02:07.259> which<00:02:07.680> doesn't<00:02:08.099> sound<00:02:08.220> good

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
used is tape which doesn't sound good

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.249

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
cuz you don't have to worry about the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.440 
cuz you don't have to worry about the
BMW<00:02:49.080> Assist<00:02:49.319> cables<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.120> good<00:02:51.269> thing

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
BMW Assist cables so that's a good thing

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.750 
BMW Assist cables so that's a good thing
and<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.720> will<00:02:52.530> lose<00:02:52.799> your<00:02:53.010> auto<00:02:53.220> dim<00:02:53.519> feature

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
and you will lose your auto dim feature

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.430 
and you will lose your auto dim feature
even<00:02:54.120> though<00:02:54.330> it's<00:02:54.450> already<00:02:54.569> broken<00:02:55.049> since<00:02:55.290> it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
even though it's already broken since it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.820 
even though it's already broken since it
leaked<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:56.280> if<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.610> real<00:02:56.819> tint<00:02:57.060> like<00:02:57.239> me

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
leaked but if you have real tint like me

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.520 
leaked but if you have real tint like me
you<00:02:58.830> should<00:02:59.069> be<00:02:59.099> fine<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.200> that's<00:03:01.200> it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
you should be fine so that's it

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.350 
you should be fine so that's it
hopefully<00:03:02.310> you'll<00:03:02.610> be<00:03:02.670> able<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:03.180> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
hopefully you'll be able to do this and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.950 
hopefully you'll be able to do this and
save<00:03:03.540> 600<00:03:04.049> bucks<00:03:04.170> thanks
