00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.950
 start watching this video I wanted to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.020
 tell them a little something this gameplay 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.580

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.710
 talk a little while I'll let you see it 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.719

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.089
 completely got out of hand I have 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 to say that lasts longer than is that they are 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.770
 it lasts longer I'm not going to say the hard 17 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.390
 minutes with 30 seconds the game 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.220
 complete and me personally 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.320
 like to watch a game of 17 minutes 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.849
 because I seem boring for that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.529
 I'm only going to go up the first round if 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.750
 you want to see maybe not the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.090
 first round or two rounds or three rounds 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.579
 or they want to see the 15 minutes of departure 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.930
 at 17 in this case of twin 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.329

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.530
 I would like to know taking off the medium 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.969

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.110

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.080
 live comment let's try 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.760
 kill enemies is not what 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.320
 it is about 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.700
 I'm going to finally catch the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.470
 incendiary we see that a bot the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.780
 acting on another team here there's a lot 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.420
 people do have a site site 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.250
 shit I'm pretty bad with the desire 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.580
 that because if both in 3 and in the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.580
 chat med 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.400
 the enemy fire in the fucking boxing 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 until I could not kill that so 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.030
 least I already have two in the bag 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.790

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.300

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.270
 seeing was following 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.540
 no one can shoot you regretting 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.440
 I was killed in the column and I 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.730
 it was not there is a little bit more 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.730
 forward of the column but I kill myself 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.840
 I also find something very good that 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.840
 is that he kills me from that distance 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.510
 to see here there is a bag 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.980
 yes no it was not seen by the reflection I have 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.710
 a lot of light in my room 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.710
 one end bow comes 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.270
 I'm watching dixie 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.420
 the 17 comes to sack by my side 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.980
 if he died thanks for your support locust 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.260
 friend we will thank in the region of 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.330
 queen locus my raid 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.159
 until then with protection with 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.280
 urban protection and well he says another 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.130
 head first 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.300
 to see if he can help in the exam he 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.330
 He says 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 and you can and 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.099
 ah 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.870
 and if the 17 is very crazy 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.120
 and this down also that I think that 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.560
 He gave me a little bit the other one, not if he helped me 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.500
 a little bit because I appreciate it I'm not going to 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.530
 say we're not going cantus let's sing 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.610
 let's go songs we're going to look for home and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.470
 friend what does not fall does not fall well the disc 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.400
 bring fat 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.400
 here is one 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.430
 here arrived almost without indicated this is 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.550
 Awesome 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.270
 the other day we killed cantus ananÃ¡ and the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.270
 fire the fire is 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.569
 is undervalued he was the fire s 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.340
 This is not mine, you can kill it from above 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.760
 friend if I can not kill him I do not have 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.760
 problem 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.900
 let's see that the arch also key is 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.210
 the bow I will go for this one the design 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.010
 I'm also going to that combination 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.570
 It's already given enough, I have no mission 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.130
 I'm sorry you do not like the cachazos 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.130
 but good if I do not have ammunition 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.410
 let's see there are two nothing more so 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.569
 the first round happened pretty fast 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.310
 I have to serve 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.390
 let's see if I can give a little bit of 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:59.870
 support with the bolton and print pam pam 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.290
 and that friend has the bow so now 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.569
 then for support I support you what we 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.060
 I could have laid down with that I did not 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.190
 do not knock it down I stay here 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.159
 the doubt that a non-clutch is made is worth the 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.680
 first round we won it was pretty 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:19.060
 ok let's see how this continues 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.060
 let's hope it continues equally
