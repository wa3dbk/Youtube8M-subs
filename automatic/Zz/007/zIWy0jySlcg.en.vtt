economy I think that a key trend that is
now<00:01:05.129> clear<00:01:05.930> but<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> 20<00:01:07.530> years<00:01:07.560> ago<00:01:08.240> was<00:01:09.240> not

matter<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.860> here<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> second<00:02:13.390> trend<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:14.349> has

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
matter and here a second trend that has

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.449 
matter and here a second trend that has
become<00:02:15.190> very<00:02:15.459> clear<00:02:16.030> over<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> last<00:02:16.720> 20<00:02:17.140> years

that as the global economy has expanded

that as the global economy has expanded
you<00:07:19.430> have<00:07:19.550> seen<00:07:19.820> an<00:07:19.970> expansion<00:07:20.870> of<00:07:20.990> global

is to deconstruct the global economy
