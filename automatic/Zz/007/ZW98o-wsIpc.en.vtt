00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
last year they've got some room to grow

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.420 
last year they've got some room to grow
and<00:02:10.410> then<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.740> freshmen<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.340> are

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and then you have freshmen that are

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.670 
and then you have freshmen that are
coming<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.820> so<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.210> isn't<00:02:12.540> about<00:02:12.630> setting<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
coming in so this isn't about setting a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
coming in so this isn't about setting a
depth<00:02:13.920> chart<00:02:14.220> as<00:02:14.400> much<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.000> where

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
depth chart as much as it is where

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.270 
depth chart as much as it is where
we<00:02:15.760> are<00:02:15.940> with<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.660> new<00:02:17.200> influx<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.830> players<00:02:18.129> and

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
going to change the way we practice much

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.809 
going to change the way we practice much
it'll<00:02:56.560> be<00:02:56.799> times<00:02:57.010> where<00:02:57.190> we<00:02:57.280> take<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.579> ball

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
it'll be times where we take the ball

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.509 
it'll be times where we take the ball
carrier<00:02:58.269> down<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.799> about<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.099> really

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
carrier down but that's about it really

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.920 
carrier down but that's about it really
other<00:03:01.239> than<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.450> it's<00:03:01.660> going<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.870> be

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
other than that it's going to be

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.479 
other than that it's going to be
business<00:03:02.260> as<00:03:02.410> usual<00:03:02.470> we<00:03:02.890> won't<00:03:03.069> change<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
business as usual we won't change the

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.640 
business as usual we won't change the
practice<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.150> much<00:03:04.390> other<00:03:05.079> than<00:03:05.200> they'll<00:03:05.530> be

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
practice that much other than they'll be

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.740 
practice that much other than they'll be
occasionally<00:03:06.190> they<00:03:06.670> will<00:03:07.269> bring<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.569> ball

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
occasionally they will bring the ball

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.660 
occasionally they will bring the ball
carrier<00:03:08.140> down<00:03:08.290> but<00:03:08.560> our<00:03:08.650> practices<00:03:09.190> will<00:03:09.430> look

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
carrier down but our practices will look

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.110 
carrier down but our practices will look
very<00:03:09.910> similar<00:03:10.860> because<00:03:11.860> we're<00:03:12.190> really<00:03:12.400> pretty

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
very similar because we're really pretty

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.759 
very similar because we're really pretty
much<00:03:13.329> wearing<00:03:13.630> all<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.780> our<00:03:13.989> pads<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.680> know

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
much wearing all of our pads you know
