00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.370
 we all talk about the heart we say that 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.040
 we feel with the heart we relate the 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.530
 love with the heart we give away hearts 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.370
 and we even heard songs that speak of 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.560
 heart 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.900
 there are even those who still firmly believe 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.780
 that emotions come from the heart 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.289
 the reason is simple and that is that 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:30.699
 emotions change the rhythm of the heart 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.699
 although they do not come from 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.079
 the heart is a great world that opens 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.840
 behind the traditional image that 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.120
 we know 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.790
 is a muscular organ located between 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.530
 the lungs in the center of the chest whose 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.360
 Size is approximately for each 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.000
 person the size of his two fists 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.230
 united is responsible for pumping the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.540
 blood to the whole body 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 providing oxygen and nutrients to the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.100
 cells and tissues during the cycle 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.460
 cardiac repeat a series of passes 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.059
 called systole or contraction and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.160
 diastole or relaxation to answer 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.380
 to the energetic demands of the body the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.280
 heart should beat more than 100 thousand times 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.130
 a day inside the heart there are four 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.009
 The upper cavities are called 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.960
 atria are very small with a 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.899
 capacity of approximately 50 milliliters 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.090
 of blood the lower ones are called 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.550
 ventricles somewhat larger than 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.280
 atria have a capacity of about 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.220
 60 milliliters this extraordinary 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.890
 set of small cavities is capable 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.190
 of pumping about 7000 liters of blood to 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.470
 day 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.810
 the atria and ventricles work 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.940
 as a team, the atria fill up 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.950
 blood that they then expel to the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.120
 ventricles 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.580
 while the ventricles pump the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.990
 blood ejecting the heart's 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.220
 atria fill up again 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.710
 preparing for the next 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.810
 contraction 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.720
 the left side of the heart sends 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.210
 fresh and clean blood to the body is 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.010
 blood contains a lot of oxygen and 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.070
 this oxygen is what keeps the 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.649
 cells the cells use oxygen 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.690
 making carbon dioxide and other 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.280
 things you need to give back to the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.280
 blood to take them 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.280
 the right side of the heart takes now 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.020
 the relay carries the blood without oxygen and 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.110
 used up to the lungs to 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.820
 cool it during breathing on 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.310
 carbon dioxide is separated from the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.740
 blood when exhaling and new oxygen 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.990
 enter by inhaling now this new 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.400
 blood has the oxygen it needs 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.670
 to go back to the left side of 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.770
 heart and start everything all over again 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.410
 It happens in less than a minute 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.170
 before each heartbeat the heart fills 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.020
 of blood and then it contracts for 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.650
 expel her that she does all day and 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.400
 all night all the time the heart 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.400
 not for 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.400
 but the pumped blood is not going to 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.010
 any place four valves are the 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.650
 for defining where the blood goes 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.980
 task is to open or close in a 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:18.230
 automatic mitral valve and the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.310
 tricuspid valve work between 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.310
 atria and ventricles 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.220
 the other two are called aortic valve 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.410
 and pulmonary valve and they take care of 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.740
 control the flow as the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.080
 blood comes from the heart 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.580
 all these valves work to make 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.130
 that the blood keeps flowing 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.770
 opens to let the blood advance 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.480
 and then they close quickly for 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.480
 prevent blood from flowing back 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.750
 to the movement of blood through 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.480
 heart and by the organism it is called 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.990
 circulation and the heart does it too 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.640
 it only takes 60 seconds to pump 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.640
 blood to every cell of the body 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.200
 the assistants who assure that the blood 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.049
 move everywhere are the glasses 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.150
 blood the heart is attached to them 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.150
 and they are the conductors of the blood 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.350
 and the blood vessels that carry 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.420
 the blood out of the heart the blood 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.859
 fresh full of oxygen are called 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.569
 arteries 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.939
 and those who carry the blood to the 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:28.939
 heart blood without oxygen and with 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:31.400
 waste is called veins there are many 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:33.500
 veins and arteries all over the body if 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.930
 we put all the blood vessels in 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.379
 row could wrap the earth two 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.379
 times 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.180
 although the heart is inside the body 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.110
 there's a great way to watch him work 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.580
 from outside feeling the pulse can 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.260
 find the pulse when pressing 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.650
 slightly at the bottom of the 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.300
 wrist just below the thumb you will know that 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.300
 has found the pulse when you feel a 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.580
 small heartbeat under the skin every beat 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.920
 is caused by the contraction of 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.900
 heart 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.290
 if you want to know what is its frequency 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.150
 cardiac use a watch with a second hand and 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.690
 Count how many beats you feel in a 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.030
 minute when at rest 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.430
 you will probably notice about 70 to 80 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.740
 beats per minute when we do 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.060
 physical activity the body needs more 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.040
 fresh blood 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.110
 that's why the heart pumps faster 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.260
 to supply fresh blood that the 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.450
 body needs the heart is a great 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.180
 worker who needs to take care always 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.270
 and keep it happy most of the 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.310
 children are born with a healthy heart and is 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.310
 important to keep it in good shape 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.790
 first the heart is a muscle and there 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.460
 than to exercise it to make it strong in 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:56.700
 the child needs at least 60 minutes of 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:58.050
 daily physical activity second the 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.550
 Consumption of a variety of foods 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.740
 Healthy is excellent for the heart 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.590
 avoid fatty foods lower the 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.000
 sugar and limit the salt will keep 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.000
 also happy to his heart 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.210
 third, cigarette smoke is deadly 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.850
 for the life of the heart the heart and 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.550
 the blood vessels abhor the smoke 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:28.640
 because it makes it harder for them to perform 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.500
 your tasks the heart is amazing and 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.620
 manages to let blood flow through the body 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.260
 already existed before birth and 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.680
 pump blood all your life if the 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.100
 heart beats, life, let's give life to 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.100
 heart 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.870
 prevent keeps the pace 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:53.170
 or be a responsible heart 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:58.570
 heart melon melon melon 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:07:04.140
