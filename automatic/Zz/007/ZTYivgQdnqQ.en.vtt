00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 Y 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.730
 ah 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.320
 what fart people how is in my name 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.270
 health ebooks and then today 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.330
 I want to bring a little guide for how 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.490
 build the trampoline that becomes 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.710
 too useful for interest or for 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.480
 kill those dwarfs or to jump from 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.340
 building in building I would like to start 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.340
 showing them the first locations 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.140
 inside the lobby to find them 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.379
 as you can see here on my right it 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.449
 find the first location the first 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.580
 item that is the flag here next to 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.530
 Lions will not be another item osa 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.300
 there are loses you already know that each game is 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.850
 random here at the reception desk 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.110
 you also find another and especially 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.670
 up here on the stairs that in a 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.829
 moment are not going to teach people 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.460
 nothing else we clean this area a little 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.230
 and we do a little bit of points for 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.550
 open some doors or good is what 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.020
 I did a moment ago since it's not in 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.089
 I do not know why he seems to have commented 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.580
 as if it were live but in short people 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.050
 here in this corner is another 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.050
 item for the trampoline goes 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.360
 very good now what we can do is 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.790
 from round 1 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.440
 build from here to my right side 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.900
 you also find the item that is another 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.240
 of the occasions my left also 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.550
 here in the background is also found 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 one in the corner 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.510
 and especially in this space with the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.100
 staircases there's no loses then 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.020
 those occasions are a force must of 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 appear as is the item below 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.620
 now what I wanted to say 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.720
 we could start doing it from the 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.320
 round 1 but it's kind of a bit tedious not 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.550
 difficult but yes tedious since good I 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.500
 I say it like that if you do not have the 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.320
 Same patience than me if you despair 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.030
 of flown that in my case it was like that but 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.909
 well we are going people there are many ways to 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.299
 do what 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.149
 we could start using the elevator 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.590
 the truth very carefully clear because 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.219
 some of the times as it usually 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.110
 crush us trolling not if what is like that 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.729
 that from the summit in your account or 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.900
 we could do this this part that 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.030
 It's also simple, though a little 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.549
 tedious too and very foolish to me 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.349
 since always meter law always die and 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.140
 in this case it was black and I did not 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.120
 nothing happened but ok people ok here is 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.160
 where is the table not now 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.830
 we could use the elevators for 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.049
 faster but I repeat again from 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.910
 base is too tedious is not here and 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.250
 there of each one if he wants to have that 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.599
 patience or not is not something to entertain 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.140
 zombie and ready more than anything and as 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.090
 you can see 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.830
 I was waiting and I'm trying to do 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.240
 also a guide of interest that fits 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.510
 mention that there is a lot 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.530
 thanks for arriving gÃ¼icho 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.750
 Roberto and other people who 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.470
 they were participating the truth people 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.290
 in my case I think that if there was not 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.370
 been for them I would never have done it 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.900
 or maybe I would have done it but 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.000
 much very much later on in 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.880
 playstation should not be noted that they are 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.050
 Thank you very much and then that no longer 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.459
 you enjoy the time and the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.959
 togetherness that we had together in 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.330
 those parts of those attempts 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.040
 something very screwed something very funny but 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.410
 quite nice very good people 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.300

 that they enjoy it that it serves them of something 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.560
