00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.299
 in 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.249
 cabía is the name of the theater laboratory formed from the veteran 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.669
 company of the independent chelsea of ​​its mother company and specialized in 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.570
 interior jobs this young group will present 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.680
 cecilia kikillo epa and this action of cadillac theatrical experimentation with 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.079
 writer's texts they are based on the day 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.480
 do not 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.090
 the tie 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.330
 a goal that he understood with a double face 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.400
 On the one hand, we came to the idea of ​​the patio as a transit space 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.070
 trivial space where 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.710
 Well, people walk 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.890
 without giving much importance to the party where he talked about trivial things 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.310
 about the fmi 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.850
 lines of work 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 in short, a pyrise space 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.830
 I chose this day of the patio we tried to mix states looks no 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.800
 perona ways we posed good and if to these everyday characters that 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.120
 transit 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.240
 without grief or glory for this game we say a child's eyes 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 like mining in the yard 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.539
 this case we put together a team that in 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.659
 they investigate in the theatrical processes in what is the theatrical fact exciting 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.520
 theoretical aspects as practical 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.360
 and I was left with space and time for that cast to be able to 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 develops its own image shows 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.130
 but the loaf of bread 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.930
 Starts 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.930
 the trader the marker 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.670
 pacquiao 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.490
 n 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.590
 this 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.590
 l 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 the truth is that there is no day 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.000
 In short, it is like this and the aesthetics that have why it has 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.049
 been d 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.450
 among the actors that there are on this day the actresses that on stage 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.359
 the piece that is now presented in Spanish will be released in the fall 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:27.330
 industry 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.859
 for in the words of its director 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.859
 recover the music and the selection of texts 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.709
 we are assisted by ourselves 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.789
 because it's our samuel beckett 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.339
 because escapades through their texts c 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:49.819
 capture one surrealistic city awaits us 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.639
 for me it's essentially theatrical is the worst recession of its human endurance 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.639
 but also with a point of humor 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.959
 g 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.729
 the scorer 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:08.769
 the 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.769
 during the meeting 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.689
 everyone 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.579
 at that time and even then it was decided and that they take part 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.299
 of what is a laboratory research work that had 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.599
 but that later for its final rise organicity 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.599
 because thanks to the imaginary the texts of its essence 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.499
 do not 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.009
