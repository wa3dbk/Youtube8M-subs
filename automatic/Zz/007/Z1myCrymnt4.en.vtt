opinion with regard to the penalty and

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.420 
opinion with regard to the penalty and
clearly<00:00:42.719> you're<00:00:43.350> given<00:00:43.590> yourself<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.980> mountain

clearly you're given yourself a mountain
to<00:00:44.579> climb<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.530> attacked<00:00:47.030> well<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
to climb but we we attacked well on a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.720 
to climb but we we attacked well on a
number<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.530> occasions<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.340> had<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.550> lot<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
number of occasions we had a lot of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720 
number of occasions we had a lot of
attempts<00:00:51.210> ago<00:00:51.590> we<00:00:52.590> were<00:00:52.949> forced<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.460> heart

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
attempts ago we were forced your heart

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.310 
attempts ago we were forced your heart
to<00:00:53.969> make<00:00:54.180> some<00:00:54.989> good<00:00:55.170> saves<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.820> and

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
to make some good saves and and

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.750 
to make some good saves and and
eventually<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.350> got<00:00:58.620> probably<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
eventually we got probably the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.479 
eventually we got probably the
scrappiest<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.890> goal<00:01:01.890> from<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> scrap

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
scrappiest of the goal from the scrap

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.469 
scrappiest of the goal from the scrap
piece<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> moves<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.420> giant<00:01:04.080> seesaw

piece of the moves of giant seesaw

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.440 
piece of the moves of giant seesaw
bitterly<00:01:06.479> disappointed<00:01:07.140> obviously<00:01:07.490> but<00:01:08.490> we

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
bitterly disappointed obviously but we

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
bitterly disappointed obviously but we
have<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.840> look<00:01:10.409> at<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.760> positives<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
have to look at the positives and that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.450 
have to look at the positives and that
was<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.290> fact<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.740> did<00:01:13.890> create<00:01:14.189> chances

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
was the fact that we did create chances

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.990 
was the fact that we did create chances
against<00:01:15.030> Manchester<00:01:15.540> City<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:17.130> also<00:01:17.700> the

against Manchester City and and also the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
against Manchester City and and also the
fact<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> players<00:01:18.750> showed<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.290> mental

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
fact that the players showed the mental

with the important openings again would

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.819 
with the important openings again would
have<00:01:27.630> been<00:01:27.720> easy<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> fold<00:01:28.200> against<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> team

have crumbled at that point and and I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.990 
have crumbled at that point and and I
challenged<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> place<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.290> strong
