00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.750
 Good folks I bring another video 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.089
 interesting for you here that 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.390
 really caught the eye of a lot of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.650
 people and also my right 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.529
 a ball of fire in the sky of california 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.619
 unleashes a strange UFO flying in the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.779
 contrary to what would be the first 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 Let's say what would be a fireball 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.640
 according to the scientists a ball of 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 fire is a term used to describe the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 very bright meteor 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.719
 generally of magnitude 4, which is almost 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.170
 the same magnitude as the Venus planet 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.570
 seen from our skies morning or night 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.719
 such meteors cross our skies in high 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.760
 speed leaving behind a trail 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.070
 bright and sometimes just listen if a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.649
 noise and we see thousands of 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.140
 pieces but since that ball of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.260
 fire that exploded over chile abes kim 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.450
 on February 15, 2013 the land 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.900
 seems to have become a target of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.330
 meteors and remains of ball asteroids 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 fire in the sky has become a common phenomenon 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.840
 worldwide but few realized 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.080
 which was once an unusual event and is 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.570
 happening now almost every day 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.729
 for some experts the increase 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.280
 of these fireballs in the heavens is a 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.159
 prelude that the earth is about to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.890
 facing the impact of a large object 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.840
 space while for all others 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 these sightings are of origin 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.899
 extraterrestrial and now with this video 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.930
 that has become viral is really for 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.390
 think this video that was posted on 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.000
 youtube on January 5, 2015 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.549
 shows a ball of fire burning and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 falling on california but after 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.500
 a few seconds something very strange 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.409
 a bright ball is thrown in the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.149
 opposite direction some experts 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.060
 believe that the flying object does not 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.960
 identified can not be just another 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.800
 meteor burning in the atmosphere 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.780
 what would be after this strange object 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.120
 that was ejected would be an UFO expelling 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.790
 an escape pod 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.020
 the guy who recorded nabileque roberts it 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.550
 was driving to the south of 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.950
 California when he saw a large 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.200
 ball of fire in the sky toward the earth 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.360
 without thinking twice who decided 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.850
 record the surprising phenomenon that 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.070
 was witnessing when some 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.320
 seconds later the ball of fire seems 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.990
 strangely expel a white sphere 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.890
 that goes in the opposite direction and 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.080
 fades away 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.210
 this strange behavior of the second 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.910
 object that led to all kinds of 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.520
 theories such as that the big ball of 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.310
 fire would actually be a falling UFO 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.270
 expelling an exhaust cap 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.970
 possibly with the members of the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.340
 crew inside he posted the video and 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.040
 said the following I was driving 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.560
 coming home from work when the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.660
 city of caught my attention i stopped at 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.220
 in front of someone's house to record it in 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.170
 video I do not think it was an airplane 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.540
 because I was not making noise 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.500
 the orb flew straight into the sky and 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.420
 disappeared 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.220
 Sorry I did not record until the end because I 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.790
 was paying attention only to the ball 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.250
 of fire 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.470
 it is not clear that the logical explanation for 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.590
 the mysterious fireball would indeed be 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.910
 an airplane landing an emergency landing 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.640
 but so far there has not been any 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.260
 official statement of an accident is 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.020
 military or civilian 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.350
 but what would that be after agreement 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.780
 with dailymail online bix the publisher 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.910
 of a magazine on the subject discarded 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.700
 completely the theory that it would be the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.060
 meteorite and suggested that it might 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.280
 secret military project is something that 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.330
 entered the atmosphere and exploded in 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.760
 fragments 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.370
 however if it were a spaceship 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.620
 we would know soon after 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.290
 being the meteorite is too slow to be 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.020
 meteorites that usually travel much more 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.630
 fast through the atmosphere although it is 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.510
 We are in the peak of the rain of 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.090
 meteors of the quadrants could also 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.650
 photoshop possibly be clear 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.870
 person for a video on youtube can 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.270
 make no one a joke 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.310
 especially considering that it seems 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.440
 no other videos 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.330
 of the same phenomenon that was certainly 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.080
 seen by more people 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.900
 It's but there it is that my friend does not exist 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.950
 other videos but there are other people 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.660
 who claim to have seen and also we do not 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.790
 we can also rule out that 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.580
 California is very close to Nevada where 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.560
 area 51 is not I always the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.500
 possibility that it is any 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.290
 military project that went wrong but looks 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.639
 just what happened after the 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.300
 possibility that it would be a video 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.000
 edited with photoshop was discarded 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.190
 due to the large number of 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.860
 witnesses who reported having seen 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.200
 also the incident in the skies of 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.389
 to hear a witness who 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.740
 said he had seen a fireball with 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.479
 a bright green color 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.639
 others reported having seen a small 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.360
 flash just before the 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:20.960
 disappearance of the orb newark sound 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.720
 one of the most respected ufologists said 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.510
 who really got very excited about 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.880
 this video and this can be a meteorite 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.370
 space junk falling on the ground but the 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.220
 What caught my attention the most is the object 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.400
 that has been ejected there is really no 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.440
 explanation for this said watson 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.720
 at first it just looks like something that 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.750
 detached from the object but then 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.000
 seems to have its own flying power and 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.400
 untruthful and together as 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.810
 go the other direction this is an event 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.190
 rare even if it's not a flying saucer 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.590
 occupied by aliens 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:03.350
 we must recognize that it is spectacular and 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:07.190
 inexplicable and you, what do you think? 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:12.500
 will be just another meteor of 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:14.570
 nikki gepol the alien crew 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.930
 Give your opinion there, thank you so much. 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.930
 next
