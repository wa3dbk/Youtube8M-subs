00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.169
 lack in berlin was for me 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 actually more or less by not 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:29.230
 by chance but by opportunity going on 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.119
 I live just here and the next 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.989
 able waters flowering brandenburg 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.760
 and it's just for me 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.909
 friedrichshainer but quite a bit 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.559
 outside and that's natural 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:41.260
 for alternatives in your own 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.690
 environment and for me, the city has 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.180
 spree especially here where we are right now 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.030
 are at the tree bridge and the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.620
 Copper ditch as not necessarily very 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.289
 But fishy is very fishy 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.059
 that is worth the waters exposed 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.850
 a very different act than somehow 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.679
 in the open countryside in brandenburg or 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.789
 Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania surrounded by one 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:05.229
 Forest right on the coast 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.970
 here is the complete opposite I am 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.640
 surrounded by reinforced concrete and tourists 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.869
 all ask what I angle and whether 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.479
 she gives fish at all and if you have the 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.850
 can eat and that is a great deal 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.250
 more social fishing than I ever operated 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.730
 have and it is, above all, in 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.280
 fish in one whole 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.690
 for this process untypical environment 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.240
 and that makes the thing for me very much 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.710
 appealing 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.600
 Apart from that you can be nice 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.020
 make acquaintances one comes out 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.490
 and then learn a little bit about something 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.640
 his city because one or the other 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.320
 others simply stretch from my foot running 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.010
 you might otherwise be on the train 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.080
 would have driven and berlin is one 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.760
 wonderful city cheeks that is fishing 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.670
 a hobby with many stick matra too 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.510
 has to fight between animal cruelty and 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.250
 There is a lot of that pollution 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.140
 the fishing population said 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.790
 will prove like so many cases 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.390
 These prejudices are wrong if 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.390
 you look closely 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.970
 on the one hand you need to spree 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.990
 Of course you can use another card 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.600
 if you get a valid one 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.430
 Fishing license is important too 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.140
 Note that one for each 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.600
 spree section also the right card 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.560
 has info for it can be found on the 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.330
 Website of the berlin association 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.030
 Of course there is something like that for the second 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.860
 the pike and zander peas are in 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.690
 Berlin from the first to the first 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.360
 pushed and allowed five of the year 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.770
 therefore not be actively treated 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.270
 I'll tell you my method later 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.970
 Imagine that with me this time 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.989
 virtually bypass and targeted smaller fish 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.640
 such as the bass pangl 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.400
 Overall, but I can say yes 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.170
 may that be in a city like Berlin 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.810
 of course, the ranks offer one 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.670
 special appeal of the try fish 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.320
 surrounded by centuries - old buildings 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.150
 to move up to offers a modern 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.290
 alternative and diversion of 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.290
 classic fishing in the wild 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.180
 now 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.060
 ruler unfortunately just in school 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.260
 berlin and until two years ago 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.720
 one does not participate at all in this time 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.590
 us to naturalise 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.209
 meanwhile it is possible so-called 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.909
 micro or bait of two 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.409
 centimeter or smaller to use without 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.879
 with the set difficulties 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.260
 to come 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.650
 Personally, I like to bait 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.579
 tempt with flavors just in winter 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.489
 just one or the other knows 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.400
 faulenbach or fish then again 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.440
 to ask 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.049
 I use this for the presentation of this 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.730
 bait a so-called texas rick man 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.120
 It can also be very good on the carolina way 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.819
 do 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.099
 the most important effect is this free 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.140
 running on the cord remains flat 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.569
 still very much at this season 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.250
 shy fish that suck in for 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.290
 To facilitate that one looks very good 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.939
 that accompanies wonderfully on the track 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.049
 resistance and that 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.640
 works completely under water 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.530
 that's exactly what this section is 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.730
 I'll have a look and hope that I will 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.730
 also catch what 's up
