00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
also looking for craftsmanship a unique

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.420 
also looking for craftsmanship a unique
design<00:03:23.050> that's<00:03:23.320> poorly<00:03:23.650> crafted<00:03:23.860> will<00:03:24.280> not

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
design that's poorly crafted will not

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.150 
design that's poorly crafted will not
win<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:25.080> an<00:03:26.080> excellently<00:03:26.560> crafted<00:03:26.770> piece

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160

that's<00:03:27.610> poorly<00:03:28.270> designed<00:03:29.070> certainly<00:03:30.070> won't

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
that's poorly designed certainly won't

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.740 
that's poorly designed certainly won't
win<00:03:30.340> either<00:03:30.550> okay<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.209> it's<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.540> combination

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
win either okay so it's a combination

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.040 
win either okay so it's a combination

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.540 
and so they look for those things first
okay<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.890> then<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.130> just<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.310> matter<00:03:36.340> of

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
okay and then it's just a matter of

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.790 
okay and then it's just a matter of
preference<00:03:36.790> really<00:03:37.630> exactly<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.590> also

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
preference really exactly and and also
