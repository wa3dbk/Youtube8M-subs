hi once again this is Robert with clean

hi once again this is Robert with clean
pool<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.060> spa<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.659> in<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.770> want<00:00:05.250> to

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
pool and spa and in this video I want to

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.210 
pool and spa and in this video I want to
talk<00:00:05.549> about<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.879> situation<00:00:06.440> that<00:00:07.440> happens<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.189> a

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
talk about a situation that happens to a

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.370 
talk about a situation that happens to a
lot<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.639> pool<00:00:08.880> owners<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> problem

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
lot of pool owners and that is a problem

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.640 
lot of pool owners and that is a problem
with<00:00:10.980> their<00:00:11.340> side<00:00:12.240> arc<00:00:12.480> acid<00:00:12.960> or<00:00:13.139> their<00:00:13.320> pool

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
with their side arc acid or their pool

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.210 
with their side arc acid or their pool
stabilizer<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.900> sign<00:00:16.470> aren't<00:00:16.710> acid<00:00:17.130> or

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
stabilizer now the sign aren't acid or

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.859 
stabilizer now the sign aren't acid or
stabilizer<00:00:17.820> they're<00:00:18.180> all<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> same<00:00:18.600> thing

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
stabilizer they're all the same thing

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.890 
stabilizer they're all the same thing
should<00:00:19.470> be<00:00:19.590> between<00:00:19.770> thirty<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> fifty

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
should be between thirty to fifty

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.070 
should be between thirty to fifty
parts-per-million

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
parts-per-million

anything<00:00:22.800> lower<00:00:23.160> or<00:00:23.550> higher<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:24.269> render<00:00:24.660> your

anything lower or higher can render your

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.759 
anything lower or higher can render your
chlorine<00:00:25.140> less<00:00:25.680> or<00:00:26.449> ineffective<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:28.260> let's

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
chlorine less or ineffective now let's

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.640 
chlorine less or ineffective now let's
go<00:00:28.949> ahead<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.550> define<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:30.269> low<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.230> high<00:00:31.439> as

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
go ahead and define what low and high as

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.760 
go ahead and define what low and high as
low<00:00:31.969> would<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.120> twenty<00:00:33.780> ten<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.290> obviously

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
low would be twenty ten or obviously

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.819 
low would be twenty ten or obviously
zero<00:00:35.280> high<00:00:36.000> would<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.200> opinion<00:00:37.230> once

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
zero high would be in my opinion once

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.619 
zero high would be in my opinion once
you<00:00:37.950> start<00:00:38.219> getting<00:00:38.340> into<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.850> 70<00:00:39.300> 80<00:00:39.510> 90

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you start getting into this 70 80 90

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.770 
you start getting into this 70 80 90
especially<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.040> 90<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.640> 100<00:00:42.149> mark<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
especially the 90 and 100 mark and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.080 
especially the 90 and 100 mark and
anything<00:00:43.379> above<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.579> render<00:00:44.850> your

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
anything above that can render your

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.650 
anything above that can render your
chlorine<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.260> ineffective<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:48.420> want

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
chlorine very very ineffective you want

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.049 
chlorine very very ineffective you want
to<00:00:48.780> run<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.110> chlorine<00:00:49.410> between<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
to run your chlorine between one and a

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.180 
to run your chlorine between one and a
half<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.570> three<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> half<00:00:52.170> parts<00:00:52.920> per

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
half to three and a half parts per

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.000 
half to three and a half parts per
million<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:54.210> why<00:00:54.989> does<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.590> pool

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
million now why does your pool

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.670 
million now why does your pool
stabilizer<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.270> out<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.719> whack<00:00:57.930> well

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
stabilizer kind of get out of whack well

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.299 
stabilizer kind of get out of whack well
probably<00:00:59.489> uh<00:01:00.410> one<00:01:01.410> reason<00:01:01.770> would<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> use

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
probably uh one reason would be the use

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.140 
probably uh one reason would be the use
of<00:01:02.550> tricor<00:01:03.239> tabs<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> tabs<00:01:05.489> both<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
of tricor tabs the tabs both have the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.750 
of tricor tabs the tabs both have the
chlorine<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> stabilizer<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:08.100> them<00:01:08.490> so

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
chlorine and stabilizer in them so

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
chlorine and stabilizer in them so
through<00:01:09.510> continuous<00:01:10.170> user<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.650> overuse<00:01:11.280> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
through continuous user of overuse of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.700 
through continuous user of overuse of
triport<00:01:12.090> tabs<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.049> cause<00:01:13.290> your

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
triport tabs it can cause your

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.950 
triport tabs it can cause your
stabilizer<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.880> go<00:01:15.030> through<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.299> roof<00:01:15.540> very

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
stabilizer to go through the roof very

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200 
stabilizer to go through the roof very
quickly<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.890> every<00:01:17.100> ten<00:01:17.340> parts<00:01:17.670> per<00:01:17.909> million

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
quickly for every ten parts per million

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.410 
quickly for every ten parts per million
of<00:01:18.479> chlorine<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.350> add<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.890> tricor<00:01:20.369> tabs<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
of chlorine you add with tricor tabs you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.710 
of chlorine you add with tricor tabs you
increase<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.409> sign<00:01:22.619> arc<00:01:22.799> acid<00:01:23.250> by<00:01:23.790> six<00:01:24.360> parts

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
increase your sign arc acid by six parts

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.170 
increase your sign arc acid by six parts
per<00:01:24.900> million<00:01:25.189> so<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.400> something<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.970> keep

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
per million so that's something to keep

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
per million so that's something to keep
in<00:01:27.360> mind<00:01:27.390> also<00:01:27.869> never<00:01:28.080> put<00:01:28.380> tabs<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
in mind also never put tabs in the
