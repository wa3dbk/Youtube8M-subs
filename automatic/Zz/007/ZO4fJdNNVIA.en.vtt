we<00:02:31.830> developed<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.460> portable<00:02:32.820> bicycle<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:34.320> Hank

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
we developed a portable bicycle the Hank

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.160 
we developed a portable bicycle the Hank
handline<00:02:35.310> as<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:36.270> first<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.630> our<00:02:36.720> series<00:02:37.140> of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
handline as the first of our series of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.440 
handline as the first of our series of
direct<00:02:37.680> fights<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.580> resolved<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.180> issues

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
direct fights that resolved the issues

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.540 
direct fights that resolved the issues
of<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.750> wait<00:02:39.960> speed<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.770> size<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
of the wait speed and size of the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.850 
of the wait speed and size of the
existing<00:02:41.640> folding<00:02:42.480> bicycles<00:02:42.990> under<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
existing folding bicycles under the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.620 
existing folding bicycles under the
premise<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.220> bicycles<00:02:45.090> are<00:02:45.210> not<00:02:45.420> only

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
premise that bicycles are not only

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.830 
premise that bicycles are not only
written<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.590> also<00:02:46.860> carried<00:02:47.360> our<00:02:48.360> unique

written but also carried our unique

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.750 
written but also carried our unique
sliding<00:02:49.050> technique<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:50.010> folding<00:02:50.460> handle

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
sliding technique and folding handle

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
sliding technique and folding handle
that<00:02:50.970> we<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.240> developed<00:02:51.480> had<00:02:52.140> been<00:02:52.380> applied

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
that we have developed had been applied

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.100 
that we have developed had been applied
to<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.100> direct<00:02:53.490> bike<00:02:53.730> Hank<00:02:54.420> to

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
to this direct bike Hank to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.410 
to this direct bike Hank to
substantially<00:02:55.710> reduce<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.070> weight<00:02:56.400> size<00:02:57.060> and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
substantially reduce the weight size and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.160 
substantially reduce the weight size and
volume<00:02:57.630> by<00:02:58.350> eliminating<00:02:58.770> bebe<00:02:59.310> as<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.840> result

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
volume by eliminating bebe as the result

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.590 
volume by eliminating bebe as the result
we<00:03:01.410> produced<00:03:02.280> an<00:03:02.459> ultra<00:03:03.000> light<00:03:03.209> portable

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
we produced an ultra light portable

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.840 
we produced an ultra light portable
bicycle<00:03:04.260> with<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:04.860> total<00:03:05.190> weight<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.400> seven

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
bicycle with the total weight of seven

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.830 
bicycle with the total weight of seven
kilograms<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.720> can<00:03:07.170> be<00:03:07.260> easily<00:03:07.620> transported

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
kilograms that can be easily transported

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.449 
kilograms that can be easily transported
therefore<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.140> can<00:03:10.440> easily<00:03:10.680> be<00:03:11.010> carried<00:03:11.340> into

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
therefore it can easily be carried into
