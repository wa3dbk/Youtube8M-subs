00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello to all meet for a 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.700
 new video so this video that 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.710
 bring it on so it's my new 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.530
 project so after the scooter 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.700
 thermal down my mini thermal bike 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.789
 so with pocket bike waters here 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.699
 disc brakes that's with the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.130
 three bhl so here is the painting is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.140
 not finished here it's not over there is a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.849
 second layer to do on the rest and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.590
 on the structure so the structure for 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.560
 our engine is a structure in 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.160
 triangle so we can see it here as 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.270
 so with ramparts here for no to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.550
 see with the structures but for the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.719
 weight to prevent it from bending see there 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.030
 a 50 cubic centimeter engine like this 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.390
 here pocket bike cup we can see the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.610
 chain here is the reservoir that is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.719
 hung above because there is no 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.960
 proof to take 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.940
 this is how it is and so here is a good 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 little beast I already did a trick 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.379
 on time two minutes ago but I 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.850
 you offered a movie is for you a 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.920
 little idea huh it's going well when 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.680
 even a standard in top speed of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.610
 55 km so on a bike we will say that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.610
 it's already reasonable 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.320
 so here you are showing just about all 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.439
 the gas handle parts that hovered 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.340
 to that I took off just now 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.500
 start stop to turn off the engine the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.310
 front brake 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.770
 we can see to operate the foot wedge 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.299
 the betty who is hidden behind when you 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.750
 see here and there is the road to 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.850
