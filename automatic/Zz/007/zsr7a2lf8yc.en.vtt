how to do the hand that you are
predominant<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.130> when<00:00:20.670> you're<00:00:20.850> filing<00:00:21.150> with

the opposite hand that you're not very
good<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.609> use<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.600> hand<00:00:24.990> mostly<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.070> the

good at use this hand mostly to do the
motion<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.510> rather<00:00:28.439> than<00:00:28.680> using<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.070> drill

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
motion so rather than using your drill

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.609

which we're not as so good at try to use

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.270 
which we're not as so good at try to use
the<00:00:32.219> opposite<00:00:32.790> hand<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> bracing<00:00:35.040> by

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the opposite hand and this is bracing by

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.720 
the opposite hand and this is bracing by
holding<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.969> part<00:00:36.620> we<00:00:37.620> literally<00:00:38.129> move<00:00:38.430> the

carbide<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.670> don't<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> cut

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
carbide bit you don't want to cut

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.530 
carbide bit you don't want to cut
yourself

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:19.950 

you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.570 

mixing<00:01:20.960> acrylic<00:01:21.560> your<00:01:21.800> liquid<00:01:22.100> monitor<00:01:22.400> with

mixing acrylic your liquid monitor with

mixing acrylic your liquid monitor with
your<00:01:22.760> with<00:01:23.210> your<00:01:23.240> ball<00:01:23.510> get<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.140> smaller<00:01:24.500> ball

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
your with your ball get a smaller ball

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.990 
your with your ball get a smaller ball
you<00:01:24.860> don't<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.130> get<00:01:25.250> too<00:01:25.400> big<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.820> bowl

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
you don't to get too big of a bowl

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.100 
you don't to get too big of a bowl
because<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.390> might<00:01:26.510> be<00:01:26.600> just<00:01:26.780> too<00:01:26.870> much<00:01:26.960> to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
because it might be just too much to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.150 
because it might be just too much to
handle<00:01:27.140> switch<00:01:27.620> when<00:01:27.770> you're<00:01:27.890> doing<00:01:28.070> your

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
handle switch when you're doing your

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.070 
handle switch when you're doing your
opposite<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.580> clean<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.510> off<00:01:29.630> right<00:01:29.900> away

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
opposite and clean it off right away

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.780 
opposite and clean it off right away
that's<00:01:30.229> part<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.590> your<00:01:30.710> learning<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.190> then

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
that's part of your learning and then

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.700 
that's part of your learning and then
start<00:01:32.270> molding<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:32.869> right<00:01:33.080> away<00:01:33.320> as<00:01:33.470> soon<00:01:33.500> as

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
start molding it right away as soon as

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.140 
start molding it right away as soon as
you<00:01:33.800> can't<00:01:33.979> flatten<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.460> as<00:01:34.580> soon<00:01:34.790> as<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.030> can

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
you can't flatten it as soon as you can

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.850 
you can't flatten it as soon as you can
to<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.360> cuticle<00:01:35.660> but<00:01:36.200> when<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.410> flatten<00:01:36.680> it

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
to the cuticle but when you flatten it

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.770 
to the cuticle but when you flatten it
in<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.010> cuticle<00:01:37.310> make<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:37.970> as<00:01:38.090> thin<00:01:38.450> as<00:01:38.750> you

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
in the cuticle make it as thin as you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.499 
in the cuticle make it as thin as you
possibly<00:01:39.470> can<00:01:39.830> that's<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.880> trick<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.300> good

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
possibly can that's the trick of a good

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:41.950 
possibly can that's the trick of a good
film

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
film

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.530 
film
right<00:01:42.380> nice<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:43.190> thin<00:01:43.400> near<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.820> cuticle<00:01:43.940> and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
right nice and thin near the cuticle and

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.890 
right nice and thin near the cuticle and
I<00:01:45.290> find<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.710> flattening<00:01:46.220> motion<00:01:46.880> as<00:01:47.450> much<00:01:47.750> as

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
I find the flattening motion as much as

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.480 
I find the flattening motion as much as
you<00:01:47.990> can<00:01:48.170> over<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.680> over<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.040> over<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.340> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
you can over and over and over is the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.980 
you can over and over and over is the
best<00:01:49.670> sometimes<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.509> can<00:01:50.630> get<00:01:50.690> your<00:01:50.869> brush

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
best sometimes you can get your brush

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.779 
best sometimes you can get your brush
wet<00:01:51.200> get<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.590> little<00:01:51.920> bit<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.130> liquid<00:01:52.310> between

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
wet get a little bit of liquid between

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.859 
wet get a little bit of liquid between
the<00:01:52.940> cuticle<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.710> your<00:01:54.820> acrylic<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.060> see<00:01:56.810> if

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
the cuticle and your acrylic and see if

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.480 
the cuticle and your acrylic and see if
you<00:01:56.960> can<00:01:57.080> fly<00:01:57.200> get<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.680> body<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.280> brush

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
you can fly get the body of the brush

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.830 
you can fly get the body of the brush
barrel<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.509> brush

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
barrel of the brush

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.330 
barrel of the brush
some<00:01:59.990> say<00:02:00.200> belly<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.860> brush<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.280> just

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
some say belly of the brush and just

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.550 
some say belly of the brush and just
kind<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:02.300> push<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.630> over<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:02.960> flatten<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.530> I

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
kind of push it over and flatten it so I

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.140 
kind of push it over and flatten it so I
can<00:02:09.709> do<00:02:09.800> this<00:02:09.979> beat<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> little<00:02:10.729> bit<00:02:10.850> drier

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
can do this beat a little bit drier

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.759 
can do this beat a little bit drier
because<00:02:11.540> I'm<00:02:11.660> molding<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.350> I'm<00:02:12.470> trying<00:02:12.739> to

and<00:04:19.410> again<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:20.190> can<00:04:20.459> use<00:04:20.850> more<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.359> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
and again you can use more of the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.800 
and again you can use more of the
momentum<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.440> your<00:04:22.800> hand<00:04:23.730> as<00:04:24.060> opposed<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
momentum of your hand as opposed to the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.120 
momentum of your hand as opposed to the
drill<00:04:25.020> sometimes<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.410> just<00:04:25.470> set<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.919> hand

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
drill sometimes I just set the hand

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.550 
drill sometimes I just set the hand
drill<00:04:26.340> into<00:04:26.610> one<00:04:27.210> position<00:04:27.570> it<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:28.080> moves<00:04:28.380> my

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
drill into one position it just moves my

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.740 
drill into one position it just moves my
finger<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.520> then<00:04:29.639> as<00:04:29.760> time<00:04:30.000> goes<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.360> will

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
finger and then as time goes on you will

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.680 
finger and then as time goes on you will
get<00:04:30.960> better<00:04:31.139> at<00:04:31.800> moving<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.639> drill<00:04:33.060> as<00:04:33.300> well

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
get better at moving the drill as well

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.100 
get better at moving the drill as well
especially<00:04:34.440> around<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.710> cuticles<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.370> stuff

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
especially around the cuticles and stuff

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.230 
especially around the cuticles and stuff
you<00:04:37.110> just<00:04:37.169> keep<00:04:37.500> doing<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.979> until<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.940> get<00:04:39.120> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
you just keep doing it until you get the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.150 
you just keep doing it until you get the
look<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.450> you're<00:04:39.750> looking<00:04:40.050> for<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.830> when

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
look that you're looking for and when

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.860 
look that you're looking for and when
you're<00:04:41.280> shortening<00:04:41.610> again<00:04:41.940> it's<00:04:42.660> kind<00:04:42.840> of

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
you're shortening again it's kind of

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.719 
you're shortening again it's kind of
hard<00:04:43.050> sometimes<00:04:43.200> if<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.800> shut<00:04:44.040> off<00:04:44.070> this<00:04:44.460> way

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
hard sometimes if you shut off this way

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.010 
hard sometimes if you shut off this way
and<00:04:44.760> then<00:04:45.060> always<00:04:45.300> keep<00:04:45.450> checking<00:04:45.690> cuz<00:04:45.900> it's

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
and then always keep checking cuz it's

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.340 
and then always keep checking cuz it's
really<00:04:46.050> easy<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.590> go<00:04:46.740> crooked<00:04:51.080> ok<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.139> just

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
really easy to go crooked ok so just

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.290 
really easy to go crooked ok so just
keep<00:04:52.650> fine<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.130> may<00:04:53.250> take<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.669> half<00:04:54.030> an<00:04:54.150> hour

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
keep fine it may take you half an hour

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.690 
keep fine it may take you half an hour
maybe<00:04:54.510> for<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.930> TV<00:04:55.380> show<00:04:55.560> on<00:04:55.800> and

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
maybe for the TV show on and

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:10.830 
maybe for the TV show on and
just<00:04:57.420> go<00:04:57.630> for<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.140> just<00:04:58.350> keep<00:04:58.530> filing

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.689 

it's<00:05:11.840> hard<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.169> find<00:05:12.319> an<00:05:12.469> angle<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:13.400> make<00:05:13.430> it

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
it's hard to find an angle to make it

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.420 
it's hard to find an angle to make it
work<00:05:13.849> sometimes<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.749> will<00:05:15.379> even<00:05:15.530> put<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:16.069> bottle

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
work sometimes I will even put a bottle

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.730 
work sometimes I will even put a bottle
of<00:05:16.610> polish<00:05:17.180> on<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:18.080> I<00:05:18.139> can<00:05:18.319> brace<00:05:18.529> myself

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
of polish on so I can brace myself

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.769 
of polish on so I can brace myself
rather<00:05:19.099> than<00:05:19.189> holding<00:05:19.610> in<00:05:19.699> there<00:05:20.029> that<00:05:20.419> helps

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:20.779 
rather than holding in there that helps

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:25.629 
rather than holding in there that helps
too<00:05:21.969> and<00:05:22.969> we<00:05:23.060> don't<00:05:23.210> have<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:23.960> get<00:05:24.110> better<00:05:24.639> that

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
too and we don't have to get better that

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.519 
too and we don't have to get better that
really<00:05:26.150> helps<00:05:26.419> with<00:05:26.479> the<00:05:26.569> pinkie<00:05:26.930> pinkie<00:05:27.199> just

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:27.529 
really helps with the pinkie pinkie just

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.679 
really helps with the pinkie pinkie just
does<00:05:27.650> not<00:05:27.800> have<00:05:27.979> enough<00:05:28.189> strength<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.759> get

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:29.689 
does not have enough strength to get

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:40.950 
does not have enough strength to get
hold<00:05:29.990> itself<00:05:30.349> up<00:05:30.680> for<00:05:31.310> you

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.390 

okay<00:05:41.960> so<00:05:42.020> I've<00:05:42.350> done<00:05:42.500> all<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.710> major<00:05:42.890> filing

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
okay so I've done all the major filing

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.950 
okay so I've done all the major filing
they're<00:05:43.580> all<00:05:43.730> shaped<00:05:44.180> and<00:05:44.450> thin<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.840> way<00:05:44.930> I

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
they're all shaped and thin the way I

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.230 
they're all shaped and thin the way I
want<00:05:45.260> them<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.440> be<00:05:45.620> and<00:05:45.860> they<00:05:46.610> match<00:05:46.790> this<00:05:47.030> hand

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
want them to be and they match this hand

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
nice and smooth I'm not going to gel

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.470 
nice and smooth I'm not going to gel

coat them I'm just going to polish them

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.050 
coat them I'm just going to polish them
so<00:05:53.810> I<00:05:53.840> just<00:05:54.350> nail<00:05:54.710> polish<00:05:55.010> that<00:05:55.190> is<00:05:55.310> so<00:05:55.850> I<00:05:55.910> just

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
so I just nail polish that is so I just

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.880 
so I just nail polish that is so I just
want<00:05:56.180> to<00:05:56.270> go<00:05:56.390> and<00:05:56.720> smooth<00:05:57.110> them<00:05:57.260> off<00:05:57.380> so<00:05:57.620> I'm

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
want to go and smooth them off so I'm

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.240 
want to go and smooth them off so I'm
just<00:05:58.040> finishing<00:05:58.190> nail<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:59.920> then<00:06:00.920> I'll<00:06:01.040> put

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
just finishing nail and then I'll put

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.980 
just finishing nail and then I'll put
some<00:06:01.370> oil<00:06:01.520> on<00:06:01.760> them<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.180> again<00:06:02.690> when<00:06:02.900> you're

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
some oil on them and again when you're

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.960 
some oil on them and again when you're
filing<00:06:03.260> it's<00:06:03.680> easier<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.460> move<00:06:04.610> your

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
filing it's easier to move your

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.870 
filing it's easier to move your
prominent<00:06:05.870> hand<00:06:06.230> than<00:06:06.770> it<00:06:06.890> is<00:06:07.040> the<00:06:07.280> file<00:06:07.580> this

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
prominent hand than it is the file this

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.060 
prominent hand than it is the file this
I<00:06:08.120> find<00:06:08.510> this<00:06:08.630> really<00:06:08.810> awkward<00:06:09.050> trying<00:06:09.350> to<00:06:09.470> but

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
I find this really awkward trying to but

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.860 
I find this really awkward trying to but
you<00:06:10.250> can<00:06:10.400> do<00:06:10.580> it<00:06:10.790> but<00:06:11.090> we're<00:06:11.300> just<00:06:11.330> not<00:06:11.600> as<00:06:11.720> good

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
you can do it but we're just not as good

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.510 
you can do it but we're just not as good
at<00:06:11.990> it<00:06:12.140> this<00:06:12.530> arm<00:06:12.770> has<00:06:12.950> all<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.250> strength

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
at it this arm has all the strength

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.580 
at it this arm has all the strength
right<00:06:14.000> this<00:06:14.240> is<00:06:14.360> what<00:06:14.480> you're<00:06:14.630> used<00:06:14.810> to<00:06:14.900> so

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
right this is what you're used to so

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.340 
right this is what you're used to so
just<00:06:15.620> to<00:06:16.130> move<00:06:16.790> this<00:06:17.180> hand<00:06:17.450> I<00:06:17.840> find<00:06:18.080> is<00:06:18.230> the

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
just to move this hand I find is the

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:35.709 
just to move this hand I find is the
easiest<00:06:18.710> way<00:06:18.920> to<00:06:18.950> do<00:06:19.190> it

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:35.719 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:38.570 

so<00:06:36.719> now<00:06:36.990> we're<00:06:37.169> going<00:06:37.259> to<00:06:37.319> polish<00:06:37.619> a<00:06:37.649> totally

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
so now we're going to polish a totally

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.070 
so now we're going to polish a totally
dried<00:06:38.849> make<00:06:39.149> sure<00:06:39.270> that<00:06:39.389> it's<00:06:39.659> really<00:06:39.869> super
