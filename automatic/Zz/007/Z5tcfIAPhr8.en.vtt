00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.110
 Hello everyone in this video I will show you 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.929
 how do i need to close me back 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.940
 do i mean things close up in 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.020
 various wood 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.619
 In this case, this chipboard by the way I want 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 say that this is a blank for the future 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.490
 stools that will follow 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.490
 The video posted there is not just decided 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.030
 bite carry 1 video how many 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:45.170
 principle independent topic so for 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:49.940
 we need it like this 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.940
 wood dust from the grinder 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.270
 and my pva glue is written on 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.070
 your can be written 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:10.440
 someone else is desirable to hum 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.420
 so what we do in principle can 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.650
 buy wood shops in Moscow 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:22.390
 now sold by different manufacturers 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.290
 even under different types of wood I tell you 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.630
 I will show how this putty can be done in 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:34.690
 home conditions 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:37.320
 there were no further shops 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.600
 had to resort to this way 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.950
 we sprinkle a lot of dust 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:51.240
 was there a little bit reduced so we them 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:59.190
 Mark with a spatula and all carefully 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:03.190
 mix try not too much 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.220
 wood dust since too thick 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.550
 putty 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.800
 pulled by a spatula that is when 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:19.630
 will rub over cracks 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:24.100
 pits should just be for 20 minutes 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.510
 spatula and will not evenly close 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.510
 and flexible 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:40.050
 Here is about such a desirable homogeneous 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.440
 mass should turn out principle 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.410
 due to the fact that it is made of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.920
 wood dust and tone is obtained 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:56.970
 woody all of course desirable this 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.020
 the option to continue to use simply 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.750
 or else somehow close instead 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.900
 such will be visible 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:11.570
 I in this case, your future stools 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.570
 I will cover self-adhesive film 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.980
 all say what's pre 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.080
 this is the place I was covered Grind 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.790
 to make it all stronger better kept 2 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.790
 now we begin to putty 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.239
 without 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:46.200
 just make in this case even 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:48.180
 did a watery putty but if u have 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.940
 much putty because later 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.790
 do the process 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.790
 putty and where will flow 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.700
 peeling cherries 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.260
 that's how it will look when its on 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.240
 shpaklyuyu all unnecessary, and so that you can either 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.850
 wipe once 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:24.290
 either in that grind and so here we are 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.850
 It turns out I previously putty 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.330
 dried to show here is the problem in 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.050
 the fact that after drying it is putty 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.560
 diminishes that is but you form a fossa 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.540
 not as deep as it was but it is still 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.380
 have it need to close up 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:49.400
 so klikayte putty twice 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.400
 and fell asleep putty 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.840
 and leave to dry further when 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.320
 further processing is first necessary 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.750
 eat 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.770
 grind and do something to me 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.770
 sorry to do it
