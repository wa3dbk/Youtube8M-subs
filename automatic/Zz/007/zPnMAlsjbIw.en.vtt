00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.929 

all<00:00:28.039> right<00:00:28.929> basically<00:00:30.310> this<00:00:31.310> is<00:00:31.369> as<00:00:31.609> far<00:00:31.789> as

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
all right basically this is as far as

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.180 
all right basically this is as far as
I've<00:00:32.059> gotten<00:00:33.010> now<00:00:34.010> it's<00:00:34.280> not<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.670> best<00:00:35.000> light

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
I've gotten now it's not the best light

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.430 
I've gotten now it's not the best light
to<00:00:37.190> see<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.460> little<00:00:37.700> bit<00:00:37.850> better<00:00:38.149> there<00:00:39.430> um<00:00:41.440> I'm

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
to see a little bit better there um I'm

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.010 
to see a little bit better there um I'm
doing<00:00:42.950> retro<00:00:43.820> bright<00:00:44.059> like<00:00:44.450> kind<00:00:44.719> of<00:00:44.780> my<00:00:44.960> own

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
doing retro bright like kind of my own

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.760 
doing retro bright like kind of my own
formula<00:00:46.030> but<00:00:47.030> uh<00:00:47.090> pretty<00:00:47.960> much<00:00:48.020> you<00:00:48.260> can<00:00:48.410> see

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
formula but uh pretty much you can see

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.410 
formula but uh pretty much you can see
the<00:00:49.100> difference<00:00:49.520> between<00:00:49.700> these<00:00:49.969> two<00:00:50.030> shoes

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
the difference between these two shoes

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.920 
the difference between these two shoes
um<00:00:51.230> if<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.430> can't<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:53.000> left<00:00:53.239> one<00:00:53.360> is<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.660> one

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
um if you can't the left one is the one

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.520 
um if you can't the left one is the one
that<00:00:54.050> I've<00:00:54.430> worked<00:00:55.430> on<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:55.940> far<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:57.199> right

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
that I've worked on so far and the right

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.289 
that I've worked on so far and the right
one<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:57.800> untouched<00:00:58.280> so<00:01:00.430> pretty<00:01:01.430> much<00:01:01.640> it's

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.230 

it's<00:01:05.299> a<00:01:05.540> big<00:01:05.780> difference<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.380> person<00:01:07.000> but<00:01:08.000> on

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
it's a big difference in person but on

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.080 
it's a big difference in person but on
this<00:01:08.360> video<00:01:08.659> looks<00:01:08.930> more<00:01:09.170> subtle<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:10.490> addition

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
this video looks more subtle in addition

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.590 
this video looks more subtle in addition
to<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.860> results<00:01:13.430> are<00:01:13.520> kind<00:01:13.820> of<00:01:13.970> Milky

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
to that the results are kind of Milky

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.760 
to that the results are kind of Milky
like<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:14.990> milky<00:01:15.610> clear<00:01:16.960> like<00:01:17.960> slightly<00:01:18.320> still

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
like a milky clear like slightly still

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.020 
like a milky clear like slightly still
yellow<00:01:19.159> but<00:01:21.009> they're<00:01:22.009> not<00:01:22.159> completely<00:01:22.670> clear

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
yellow but they're not completely clear

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.390 
yellow but they're not completely clear
that's<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.390> little<00:01:23.689> bit<00:01:23.810> better<00:01:24.560> be<00:01:25.189> right

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
that's a little bit better be right

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.850 
that's a little bit better be right
there<00:01:25.640> you<00:01:25.759> can<00:01:25.909> see<00:01:25.939> at<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.110> bottom<00:01:27.439> ones

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
there you can see at the bottom ones

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.350 
there you can see at the bottom ones
yellow<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.790> top<00:01:29.030> ones<00:01:29.270> clear<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:31.060> i've<00:01:32.060> put
