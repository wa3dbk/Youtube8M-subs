00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:16.860
 Cells that form the body of an organism 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.860
 The number In the case of human beings applies even to 60 trillion 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:25.470
 Dna with Disclose the genetic information of the chromosome that is in the nucleus of the cell will appear 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:39.820
 DeNA over the cell division cycle once unwinds the double helix 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.820
 Each is used as a template to replicate genetic information and form a double helix in Japan 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 Hmm 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:51.090
 Dena that has been doubled by fortune is condensed 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.360
 It will be in the form of chromosomes, such as after 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.950
 The chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.950
 Split to split longitudinally 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.350
 I will divide with the cytoplasm 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:16.220
 In the presence of this mechanism while accurately replicating dna's genetic information 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.920
 I will repeat the division 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:25.390
 Hmm 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:29.130
 In the chromosome dynamics laboratory of RIKEN, dna condenses and becomes a chromosome 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:36.450
 I am working on the clarification of the mechanism 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:40.350
 The mechanism by which the length of DNA is condensed to about 1 / 10,000 and becomes a chromosome is a mystery part 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.770
 Many exact mechanisms are not known 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:50.179
 It's any of the Tokyo Sky Tree and 600m 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:56.890
 Imagine 600 meters of shipping yarn rather than thin hair 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:02:04.009
 It is this 600m that this condenses 10,000 times among the cells that condense 10,000 times 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:10.479
 I think that it is 10,000 times condensed that it becomes only 6,000 almost related sub-directors 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.479
 Well, in fact in the cell it will be easy to do it 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:24.110
 The research group uses Xenopus eggs to produce chromosomes in test tubes 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:28.220
 As a result of analysis, we found a key protein for chromosome condensation 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.270
 A protein that looks like a clip 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.270
 I am a telegrapher now 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:45.530
 It is a protein platform in the form of a very unusual person in a word 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:52.100
 It's not like I'm thinking now , hold this dna in this huge arm 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.490
 Maa position is a form like a so-called dna clip d 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.330
 Tell a chromosome 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:04.750
 Though it is the current expectation that it is not Tei-kun 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:10.090
 So-called proteins that make up so-called chromosomes , regardless of condensation 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:16.540
 Well, that You have that gene expression rather than pregnant women in such form 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:19.930
 Because it is also related to the stability of that chromosome, it is said that the connection to such diseases 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.090
 Still more and more in the beginning 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:28.790
 I think it will be clear 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:33.319
 Well, but when you say it because it's true 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:39.019
 Well, that will be in the distant future, but if it's like treating it 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:43.110
 After all very basic knowledge is needed at the molecular level too 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:48.060
 Well kind of even such modest personality analysis 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:51.320
 It is a mistake that it is useful for the true essential understanding of such words when the time comes 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.320
 I think not
