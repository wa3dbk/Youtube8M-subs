00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.930
 and I wanted to associate my skills 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.610
 experiences of these last twenty 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.910
 years and as a therapist and in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.070
 as a coach to ride a for 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.050
 create a method that can combine 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.279
 all the skills of terra boots 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.170
 on the development of the child 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.660
 and then workshops of awakening and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.840
 motor skills for 6-month-olds 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
 at 36 months knowing that on this 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 period there is going to be three groups 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.780
 of age and different level where we go 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.670
 tackle a lot of things by these 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.350
 awakening and motor skills workshops and 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.030
 you can also talk to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.219
 parents can answer a whole bunch 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
 questions and concerns especially 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.300
 thought from the first child we are 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.950
 a little bit lost to the lack of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.210
 benchmarks so it's also workshops 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 for parents they can come 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.140
 find some quick answers 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.570
 to their questions or anxieties 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.160
 and then it's also to strengthen the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.840
 link and the parent relationship child 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.850
 initially they listened to small 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.680
 songs for the greatest they could 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.300
 start moving on for the most 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.279
 little ones can bang careless hands 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.259
 after they discovered a whole bunch 

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:09.659
 certain objects that made noise 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.279
 small maracas and then objects 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.409
 who were all of us and then objects 

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:15.420
 which were a little spicy or a little 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.279
 raspy with fabrics and materials 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.380
 different different colors 

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:20.909
 they discovered bullets 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.219
 we start to roll them or go 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.469
 start greenhouses are the little ribbons 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.659
 for the older ones they started to 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.890
 manipulate them 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.399
 other times we will also do things 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.780
 a little bit more physical for the more 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.770
 big there was not very very 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.439
 great wines there was only one 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.079
 today but we're doing a little bit of 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.899
 of horse on dad and mom did 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.399
 the plane by wearing him on the feet and 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.049
 then we make them hop for the most 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.119
 big little ones we start to 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.340
 help to learn to sit up a 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.780
 tried in their hands and the end of the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.759
 sitting is something that is more 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.679
 sweet and a moment when we put music a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.740
 a little softer where we can start 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:01.439
 do a little hug with her child or 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.789
 rock gently on the music 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.039
 and then make small massages 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.659
 feet the mas massage her back with 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.819
 a little foam ball or things 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.709

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.510

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.459

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.680
