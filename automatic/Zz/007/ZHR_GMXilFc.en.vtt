 Hey everyone, how are you? 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.520
 my name is Marcos Espindola I am 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.980
 mrc owning plastic artist 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.950
 leads here in curitiba and today I came 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.950
 here to give some nice tips from 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.200
 how to leave more beautiful and professional 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.410
 these coloring booklets that are 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.210
 super trendy there and go there and for a good 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.560
 work it is necessary that a good 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.050
 right stuff 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.090
 today I chose three different products 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.210
 for our painting 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.270
 I'll use puji colored pencils. 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.180
 retractable and the fine tip pen that the 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.760
 show all these materials are brand 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.960
 Esteller and you can buy them by 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.140
 internet on the site of wb paktika that is 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.100
 the esteller web store I chose 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.239
 This Mandala here, I'm going to give a tip. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.829
 especially what is it for pencils? 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.030
 I do not think anyone knows what 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.780
 huh 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.939
 We can always start at the center. 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.549
 because you will not push what you 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.670
 're painting then I'll do okay 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.060
 some lines are just lines 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.819
 simple with white 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.779
 I'll get a darker red 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:24.819
 to get here O cine olympia 

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:27.009
 very important always to use 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:29.889
 the whole family of colors are red 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.899
 it starts there in the dark red there he 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:35.319
 goes to red lighter for the 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.749
 orange light orange dark yellow 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.149
 and light yellow with that we 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:41.560
 get the gradient and in effect well 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.090
 too cool 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.369
 and it does not get so popular every person does 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.219
 I have done it here, now I'm going to use it. 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.150
 yellow on the edges and I'm going 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:58.560
 mix 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:03.510
 He already said look he's already well, bacaninha. 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.360
 and focus now I go 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.200
 the petals here where I passed the white 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.450
 remember 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.300
 I spent the white underneath I'll choose 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.920
 here a rosy tone I like you can 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.330
 make agreements and 15 when we use the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.340
 White 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.740
 you get such an effect of not 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.980
 color fill 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.630
 We think it's bullshit, not everything. 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.710
 world asks what a pencil is for 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.690
 White 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.400
 It has its function if done. Let's go. 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.160
 continue our mandate with the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.440
 colors that you have chosen the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.800
 I can now 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.610
 give prominence to some 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:49.800
 details so small to perform 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.800
 I'll get a piece of cotton shape 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.220
 of polka dots to standardize this 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.220
 painting 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.710
 this is it for uncle 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.860
 now it's your turn, we'll see you next time. 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.860
