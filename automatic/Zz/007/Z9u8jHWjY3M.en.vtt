days ago and these are the things that

days ago and these are the things that
have<00:02:28.110> been<00:02:28.140> pointed<00:02:28.710> out<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:30.030> already

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
have been pointed out so as we already

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
which was in the theory before is that

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.910 
which was in the theory before is that
he's<00:03:14.040> only<00:03:14.400> ever<00:03:14.970> played<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.810> single<00:03:16.500> match<00:03:16.709> of

he's only ever played a single match of

operation Locker and finally that on the

operation Locker and finally that on the
wall<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:22.160> operation<00:03:23.160> Locker<00:03:23.400> there<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.820> a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
wall of operation Locker there is a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.030 
wall of operation Locker there is a
skull<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.269> crossbones<00:03:25.019> which<00:03:25.709> some<00:03:25.920> people

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
skull and crossbones which some people

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.650 
skull and crossbones which some people
originally<00:03:26.700> didn't<00:03:26.940> notice<00:03:27.150> has<00:03:27.269> been<00:03:27.300> there

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
originally didn't notice has been there

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.960 
originally didn't notice has been there
for<00:03:27.840> ages<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.370> would<00:03:29.610> be<00:03:29.730> quite

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
for ages so it would be quite

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.910 
for ages so it would be quite
interesting<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.660> see<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:30.900> dice<00:03:31.110> had<00:03:31.410> tied<00:03:31.650> this

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
interesting to see if dice had tied this

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.220 
interesting to see if dice had tied this
in<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:33.000> Davy<00:03:33.269> Jones's<00:03:33.600> Locker<00:03:33.660> kind<00:03:34.110> of

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
in so the Davy Jones's Locker kind of

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.780 
in so the Davy Jones's Locker kind of
symbol<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.620> things<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.040> actually<00:03:35.640> on

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
symbol of things is actually on

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.850 
symbol of things is actually on
operation<00:03:36.600> Locker<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.170> seems<00:03:37.650> pretty

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
operation Locker and seems pretty

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.000 
operation Locker and seems pretty
familiar<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.269> last<00:03:39.480> lasting<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.650> that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
familiar and the last lasting is that

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.289 
familiar and the last lasting is that
the<00:03:41.160> bottom<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.700> riddle<00:03:41.970> where<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.150> says

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
the bottom of the riddle where it says

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.900 
the bottom of the riddle where it says
exit<00:03:42.840> is<00:03:42.989> better<00:03:43.260> with<00:03:43.470> friends<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:43.980> possibly

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
exit is better with friends is possibly

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.330 
exit is better with friends is possibly
a<00:03:45.060> requirement<00:03:46.019> towards<00:03:46.500> how<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.920> easter

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
a requirement towards how this easter

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.160 
a requirement towards how this easter
egg<00:03:47.459> or<00:03:47.580> part<00:03:47.820> what<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.090> found<00:03:48.390> in<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.959> sense

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
egg or part what is found in a sense

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.840 
egg or part what is found in a sense
that<00:03:49.260> more<00:03:49.650> people<00:03:49.920> are<00:03:50.220> required<00:03:50.549> to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
that more people are required to

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.090 
that more people are required to
actually<00:03:51.239> get<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:51.989> necessary<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:52.860> have<00:03:53.040> a

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
actually get is necessary to have a

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.970 
actually get is necessary to have a
certain<00:03:53.370> number<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.880> people<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.540> which<00:03:55.320> we<00:03:55.739> do

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
certain number of people of which we do

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.340 
certain number of people of which we do
not<00:03:56.160> know<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:56.640> this<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.880> great<00:03:57.150> update<00:03:57.540> it

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
not know but this is a great update it

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.190 
not know but this is a great update it
did<00:03:59.040> usher<00:03:59.640> in<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.940> pc<00:04:00.480> version<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.930> naval

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
did usher in the pc version of naval

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.780 
did usher in the pc version of naval
strike<00:04:01.410> which<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.769> now<00:04:02.010> launched<00:04:02.610> and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
strike which is now launched and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.850 
strike which is now launched and
hopefully<00:04:03.780> we<00:04:03.900> could<00:04:04.049> see<00:04:04.260> some<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.620> files

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
hopefully we could see some of the files

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.740 
hopefully we could see some of the files
being<00:04:05.250> ripped<00:04:05.580> from<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.970> inner<00:04:06.299> core<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.570> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
game to work out exactly what we're

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.940 
game to work out exactly what we're
looking<00:04:09.600> for<00:04:09.630> because<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.470> said<00:04:10.530> we've<00:04:10.920> been

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
looking for because as I said we've been

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.830 
looking for because as I said we've been
streaming<00:04:11.489> for<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.790> last<00:04:11.970> four<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.360> five<00:04:12.570> days

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.770 
streaming for the last four to five days
and<00:04:13.590> we've<00:04:13.830> literally<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.880> accept<00:04:15.360> every

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
and we've literally have to accept every

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.420 
and we've literally have to accept every

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
single theory because practically

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.460 
single theory because practically
everything<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.239> possible<00:04:18.479> we've<00:04:19.200> had<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.440> go

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
everything is possible we've had to go

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.490 
everything is possible we've had to go

is<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.750> confirm<00:04:28.169> that<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:29.730> wasn't

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
is just to confirm that it it wasn't

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.610 
is just to confirm that it it wasn't
there<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:30.930> know<00:04:31.050> it's<00:04:31.260> been<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.410> really

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
there and you know it's been a really

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.460 
there and you know it's been a really
tough<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.220> long<00:04:32.430> process<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.330> we've<00:04:34.320> also

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
tough and long process and we've also

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.770 
tough and long process and we've also
had<00:04:34.770> quite<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.130> few<00:04:35.310> hints<00:04:35.610> from<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.210> EA<00:04:36.419> dice

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
had quite a few hints from the EA dice

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.390 
had quite a few hints from the EA dice
or<00:04:37.080> sector<00:04:37.500> they've<00:04:37.620> been<00:04:37.800> dropping<00:04:38.250> into

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
or sector they've been dropping into

or sector they've been dropping into
streams<00:04:38.930> watching<00:04:39.930> us<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.229> we've<00:04:40.380> quite

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
streams watching us and we've quite

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.930 
streams watching us and we've quite
often<00:04:40.800> think<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.220> they're<00:04:41.400> laughing<00:04:41.790> ass

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
often think that they're laughing ass

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.240 
often think that they're laughing ass
but<00:04:42.690> we<00:04:42.960> feel<00:04:43.229> as<00:04:43.380> though<00:04:43.560> we're<00:04:43.770> finally

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
but we feel as though we're finally

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.070 
but we feel as though we're finally
heading<00:04:44.639> somewhere<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.360> we<00:04:45.810> finally

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
heading somewhere and we finally

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.600 
heading somewhere and we finally
pinpointing<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.919> there<00:04:47.100> have<00:04:47.190> been<00:04:47.280> lots<00:04:47.400> of

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
pinpointing it there have been lots of

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.939 
pinpointing it there have been lots of
strong<00:04:47.940> leads<00:04:48.270> now<00:04:48.600> because<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:49.680> new

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
strong leads now because of this new

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.550 
strong leads now because of this new
update<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.639> is<00:04:50.760> battlelog<00:04:51.419> and<00:04:51.630> hopefully

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
update to is battlelog and hopefully

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.129 
update to is battlelog and hopefully
just<00:04:53.310> hopefully<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.180> can<00:04:54.360> find<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.780> easter

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
just hopefully we can find the easter

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.010 
just hopefully we can find the easter
egg<00:04:55.260> within<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.070> next<00:04:56.100> few<00:04:56.669> days<00:04:57.000> if<00:04:57.389> we're

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
egg within the next few days if we're

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.350 
egg within the next few days if we're
lucky<00:04:58.160> hopefully<00:04:59.160> not<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.639> long<00:04:59.880> maybe<00:04:59.940> a

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
lucky hopefully not that long maybe a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.020 
lucky hopefully not that long maybe a
day<00:05:00.660> or<00:05:00.690> two<00:05:01.020> because<00:05:01.320> ideally<00:05:01.979> we've<00:05:02.820> been

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
day or two because ideally we've been

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.670 
day or two because ideally we've been
streaming<00:05:03.330> for<00:05:03.450> so<00:05:03.810> long<00:05:04.020> now<00:05:04.080> it's<00:05:04.440> actually

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
streaming for so long now it's actually

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.080 
streaming for so long now it's actually
getting<00:05:04.889> pretty<00:05:05.130> frustrating<00:05:05.700> we<00:05:05.790> know<00:05:05.940> the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
getting pretty frustrating we know the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.570 
getting pretty frustrating we know the
