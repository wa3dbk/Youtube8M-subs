00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.240
 The CBR evaluates in a practical exam 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.660
 whether you are driving. 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.559
 The fitness to drive is assessed on the basis of a personal statement 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.559
 and driving license test. 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.189
 Welcome to the CBR. 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.419
 Today you will take your truck practice exam for a professional driver. 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.029
 That's right. 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.880
 You have brought a valid B driving license. - Yes. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.589
 Can I see it? 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.259
 I see that you have already passed all three theory courses. 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.930
 And the test closed terrain. - Yes correct. 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.330
 And you also brought an invitation from us. Can you come here? 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.630
 put a date and signature. 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.370
 So Sander, brought a nice truck. - Yes, a new Euro 6. - Can you tell me 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.200
 what is the side partition used for? 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.310
 It serves so that no cyclists and pedestrians can end up under it. 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.620
 Very well, thank you. What do you check in the morning? 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.430
 Then I first check the wiper fluid, if there is still enough in it. 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.330
 The oil. 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.240
 And finally the coolant. 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.640
 The examiner will pay particular attention to the control of the vehicle, 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.960
 environmentally conscious driving behavior, insightful driving and safe and professional 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.850
 traffic participation. 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.150
 Can you now insert the driver card. 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.440
 Are we going for a nice ride. 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.880
 During the practice, the examiner gives directions 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.260
 driven inside and outside built-up areas. 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.660
 The next exit we turn right, Sander. 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.120
 Ok there is driven independently on navigation, 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 where you must be able to multitask, such as monitoring traffic and 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.390
 At the same time, consider height restrictions that are not on it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.430
 navigation system. 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.420
 We go left here to a loading door: 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.630
 I want you to do it safely and smoothly; you decide how you do it. 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.140
 You will be given three special assignments during the exam. 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.560
 You thereby show that you control the vehicle, that you are aware 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.360
 are familiar with the environment and take road safety into account. 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.890
 As a final assignment, Sander can drive back to the CBR independently. 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.930
 So we are back again. Do you want to make another print? 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.780
 Sincerely boy. - Thank you. - You passed. It went fine. The result is taken directly by the examiner 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.389
 processed. 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.749
 If Sander has also done practical test C then he can go to it 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:19.279
 town hall to apply for his C driving license with code 95. 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:23.129
 Success and many safe kilometers. - Thank you. 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.239
 Good driver, he will come. 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.510
 It went well. Now I can get started! - Good!
