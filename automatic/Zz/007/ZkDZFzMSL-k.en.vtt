00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
book adapter is pretty big so look there

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.940 
book adapter is pretty big so look there
you<00:02:02.539> go<00:02:02.720> low<00:02:03.049> battery<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.530> can<00:02:03.649> we<00:02:03.830> can

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
you go low battery you can we can

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.450 
you go low battery you can we can
actually<00:02:04.100> see<00:02:04.490> no<00:02:04.820> battery<00:02:05.210> nests<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.560> non

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
actually see no battery nests on the non

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.699 
actually see no battery nests on the non
book<00:02:07.670> side<00:02:07.880> but<00:02:08.630> there<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:08.959> an<00:02:09.170> upper<00:02:09.470> boot

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
book side but there is an upper boot

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.009 
book side but there is an upper boot
screen<00:02:10.039> on<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.700> upper<00:02:11.269> side<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.840> it's

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
screen on the upper side and it's

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.530 
screen on the upper side and it's
actually<00:02:12.440> charging<00:02:12.769> this<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.180> battery<00:02:14.480> is

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
actually charging this is the battery is

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.660 
actually charging this is the battery is
too<00:02:14.720> low<00:02:14.930> charges<00:02:15.470> for<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.680> while<00:02:15.890> charge<00:02:16.430> for<00:02:16.640> a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
too low charges for a while charge for a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.570 
too low charges for a while charge for a
while<00:02:16.850> before<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.239> hours<00:02:17.569> on<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.959> that's<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.650> 29

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
while before it hours on and that's a 29

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.449 
while before it hours on and that's a 29
seconds<00:02:19.970> in<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:21.319> when<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.709> goes<00:02:21.920> off<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:22.430> are

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
seconds in so when this goes off we are

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.650 
seconds in so when this goes off we are
actually<00:02:23.030> going<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.450> switch<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:26.209> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
actually going to switch it on to and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.020 
actually going to switch it on to and
open<00:02:27.319> up<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.530> battery<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:28.580> she<00:02:28.730> was<00:02:28.910> the

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
open up the battery that she was the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.270 
open up the battery that she was the
cognitive<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.660> energy<00:02:30.230> say<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.130> power

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
cognitive and energy say the power

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.920 
cognitive and energy say the power
management<00:02:31.700> thing<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.209> we<00:02:32.299> can<00:02:32.420> know<00:02:32.720> exactly

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
management thing so we can know exactly

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.970 
management thing so we can know exactly
how<00:02:33.410> much<00:02:33.590> battery<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:35.180> has<00:02:35.239> as<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.650> goes<00:02:36.769> so

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
how much battery it has as it goes so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:49.510 
how much battery it has as it goes so
you<00:02:37.069> can<00:02:37.220> see<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.640> in<00:02:38.360> real<00:02:38.660> time

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.890 

always<00:02:50.520> reach<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.180> station<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.720> has

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
always reach that station this has

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.570 
always reach that station this has
already<00:02:52.050> started<00:02:52.380> up<00:02:52.640> there

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.360 

okay<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:59.260> so<00:03:00.260> as<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.590> see<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:01.190> has

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
okay so that so as you can see that has

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:26.890 
okay so that so as you can see that has
started<00:03:01.580> up<00:03:01.790> already<00:03:06.130> but<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.400> hasn't<00:03:25.900> mr.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
minutes anyway about 35 minutes later

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.730 
minutes anyway about 35 minutes later
you<00:06:09.369> get<00:06:09.520> some<00:06:09.959> 574<00:06:10.959> each<00:06:11.139> percent<00:06:11.469> and<00:06:11.680> even

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:31.959 
concept in detail to look at this guy

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:35.339 
concept in detail to look at this guy
this<00:06:32.199> graph<00:06:32.589> versus<00:06:33.189> this<00:06:33.370> guy<00:06:33.550> so<00:06:34.080> it's<00:06:35.080> no

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:35.349 
this graph versus this guy so it's no

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.589 
this graph versus this guy so it's no
like<00:06:35.589> no<00:06:35.889> contest<00:06:36.069> no<00:06:36.370> contest<00:06:36.729> unfortunately

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
like no contest no contest unfortunately

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.309 
like no contest no contest unfortunately
you<00:06:37.749> can't<00:06:38.080> um<00:06:38.469> you<00:06:39.069> can't<00:06:39.399> get<00:06:40.300> this<00:06:40.719> in<00:06:41.110> a

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
you can't um you can't get this in a

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.439 
you can't um you can't get this in a
power<00:06:41.649> bank<00:06:41.889> cause<00:06:42.639> the<00:06:42.849> output<00:06:43.149> I<00:06:43.180> guess

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
power bank cause the output I guess

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.269 
power bank cause the output I guess
output<00:06:43.839> in<00:06:44.019> the<00:06:44.110> cable<00:06:44.469> so<00:06:44.620> therefore<00:06:45.159> that's

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279 
output in the cable so therefore that's

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.309 
output in the cable so therefore that's
the<00:06:45.399> hope<00:06:45.580> you<00:06:45.610> feel<00:06:45.909> folk<00:06:46.629> charging<00:06:47.019> anyway

the hope you feel folk charging anyway

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.230 
the hope you feel folk charging anyway
is<00:06:47.680> anything<00:06:48.039> new<00:06:48.249> well<00:06:48.909> if<00:06:49.029> you<00:06:49.120> consider

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
is anything new well if you consider

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.170 
is anything new well if you consider
this<00:06:49.629> it's<00:06:50.019> not<00:06:50.439> really<00:06:50.709> that<00:06:50.740> hot<00:06:51.180> it's

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
this it's not really that hot it's

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.259 
this it's not really that hot it's
really<00:06:53.019> much<00:06:53.169> actually<00:06:53.469> about<00:06:53.709> the<00:06:54.069> same<00:06:54.269> the

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:55.269 
really much actually about the same the

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:56.549 
really much actually about the same the
difference<00:06:55.360> is<00:06:55.659> of<00:06:55.809> course<00:06:55.990> the<00:06:56.080> charger<00:06:56.409> is<00:06:56.529> a

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:56.559 
difference is of course the charger is a

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:58.320 
difference is of course the charger is a
little<00:06:56.800> bit<00:06:56.889> longer<00:06:57.069> than<00:06:57.339> the<00:06:57.399> normal<00:06:58.149> one

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330
