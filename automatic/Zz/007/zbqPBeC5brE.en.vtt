00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 a side is okay 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.700
 She does not turn the other way , I see 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.799
 turn and pull a watch is one of the most 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.960

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.009
 heavy I step on 181 grams size 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.469
 it's 46mm I'll put it 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.990
 in the course for you to see and then I 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.789
 I'm going to end up with the information 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.109

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.600
 mm is 50mm measuring the 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.170
 crown 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.080
 It's good to know that his bracelet is also 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.930
 great that makes a good one is 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.700
 good fit then for those who have the arm 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.870
 big will have problems with this 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.190
 The clock is there and his dial has 34 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.530
 so he has a good 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.750
 view also something else 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.880
 interesting is that I forgot to 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.410
 to point out is that the watch had 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.290
 night lighting 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.690
 so you have the possibility to 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.850
 view better in the evening nÃ© 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.280
 and the thickness of it that was missing 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.140
 outside 15 millimeters 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.840
 the watch has a good thick look 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.180
