00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
I'm looking forward to exploring

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.400

directing<00:01:09.250> because<00:01:09.520> we've<00:01:10.390> seen<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.020> far<00:01:11.050> the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
directing because we've seen so far the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.100 
directing because we've seen so far the
costumes<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.370> setting<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.390> lighting<00:01:13.870> and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
costumes the setting the lighting and

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.900 
costumes the setting the lighting and
it's<00:01:14.260> interesting<00:01:14.620> to<00:01:14.950> see<00:01:15.130> how<00:01:15.160> all<00:01:15.640> those

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
it's interesting to see how all those

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.790 
it's interesting to see how all those
aspects<00:01:16.420> come<00:01:16.690> together<00:01:16.930> under<00:01:17.290> one

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
aspects come together under one

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.680 
aspects come together under one
direction<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.650> our<00:01:20.950> new<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.970> improved<00:01:22.090> work

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690

experience<00:01:23.410> program<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.640> really<00:01:25.270> grounded<00:01:25.690> in

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
experience program is really grounded in

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.840 
experience program is really grounded in
the<00:01:25.990> curriculum<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.770> has<00:01:27.010> strong<00:01:27.340> learning

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.510 

I<00:01:36.530> really<00:01:37.530> say<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> learning<00:01:38.190> about<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
I really say that learning about the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.310 
I really say that learning about the
production<00:01:38.970> side<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.270> theater<00:01:39.870> like<00:01:40.050> I've

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
kind of you know make connections

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.310 
kind of you know make connections
talking<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.300> people<00:01:45.420> who<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> been<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.260> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
industry for a really long time

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.260 
industry for a really long time
and<00:01:48.260> kind<00:01:49.260> of<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.950> mix<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.460> art<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> science

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
and kind of that mix of art and science

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.600 
and kind of that mix of art and science
is<00:01:51.780> really<00:01:51.990> interesting<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.620> me<00:01:52.650> so<00:01:53.010> yeah

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
is really interesting to me so yeah

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.800 
is really interesting to me so yeah
that's<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.090> probably<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.510> most<00:01:54.690> excited

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that's that's probably I'm most excited
