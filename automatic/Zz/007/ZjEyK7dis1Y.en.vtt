00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.010
 smoothie that really is delicious and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.750
 Apart from that it is delicious it gives you a lot 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.390
 energy this is a life a little 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.119
 energetics and to survive you know 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.189
 when we are in final exams I do not know 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.980
 maybe this is like studying for your 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.079
 admission test for I do not know any 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.140
 Secondary College prepares what 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.059
 be and if you need a little encouragement to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.160
 do it a little bit, you feel that you are missing a 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.820
 little energy what you can do is

 wake up I hope you like it 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.640
 very much the ingredients are super 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.640
 easy to get 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.040
 for this recipe the ideal is to take out the 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.910
 refrigerator ice cream one half hour 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.430
 before so that it is like more liquid the 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.060
 I really did pass myself 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.460
 because what's out of the fridge and what 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.120
 I left completely forgotten I forgot 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.610
 completely and mine and it appeared 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.030
 malted later we're going to add 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.550
 our 4 mania cookies add 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.580
 the banana, we add our 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.580
 glass of milk we will beat it like a 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.550
 minute or more until everything is 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.950
 mixed super super well mixed and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.850
 ready since we have it so we pass it to 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.850
 our glass 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.970
 we decorate it with our chantilly cream 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.650
 obviously they do not have both the glass for 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.840
 that we can decorate with our 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.209
 mazzanti and then we add taste 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.470
 granillo your brincos or whatever you want 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.470
 as you want to say 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.050
 and that's it, that's all, today you have your smoothie 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.510
 energetic which is a liquefied rather 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.970
 energetic I recommend that you put it a 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.069
 a little while at the fridge because it's cold 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.110
 obviously you know a lot better I hope 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.720
 that you really liked this video 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.880

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.340

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.280
 ride something like this very very slowly by 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.510

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.360
 sea illuminator and I just put it on 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.630
 my cheeks and I applied it also a 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.630
 bit
