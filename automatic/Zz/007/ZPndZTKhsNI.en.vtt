00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.469
 worried about the occlusion or the lousy 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.900
 chewing we have come to the clinic 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 of doctor manuel inns that is not going to 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.640
 apply what are the difficulties that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.520
 can cause chewing badly or have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.949
 a bad occlusion also explains also 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.640
 that other diseases could generate 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640
 root of this problem 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.579
 although they are from the bite 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.130
 and to make it much simpler and that 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.020
 understand it as something 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.240
 functional within us something that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.580
 we have to somehow try 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:51.500
 our patients is that the bite 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.740
 It must be a couple when I bite 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.630
 ideally they should bite each one 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.080
 of the pieces that I have as superior 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.140
 or lower does not that bite a part and 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.699
 another no or a part first and another 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.619
 after 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.110
 because that's what he's going to do to create 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.240
 a dysfunction of the bite is going to be 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.380
 that bite earth stability and with 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.340
 it starts a series of problems 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:23.479
 unimaginable that we are now going to give 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:26.090
 let's detail some when we 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.250
 we have a bite where we have 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.069
 all our upper teeth and 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.740
 all lower teeth mostly 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:38.060
 there should not be any problem except 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.680
 that in some cases when we bite 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.079
 one of the teeth hits first but that 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.939
 it does not mean that others do not touch 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.579
 because remember that teeth have 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.979
 a damping system that is the 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.320
 periodontal ligament teeth not 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.080
 They are welded to the bone to the maxilla 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.159
 the jaw has a ligament but such 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.950
 which acts as a buffer 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.200
 then if I have a piece 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.140
 what collides first what is going to happen 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.260
 with that piece so that it collides later 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.460
 others include then the others is that 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.650
 will sink a little 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.040
 when they sink a little they enter 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:24.219
 contact to the other pieces 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:28.240
 that extra job that hit that trauma 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:30.430
 in that piece creates a first problem 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.010
 first swelling of the pulp because 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.890
 It is a tooth that every day is 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.850
 receiving an overcharge an extra blow 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.610
 of others 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.800
 is directly receiving all the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.580
 chewing force in a in a close-up 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.160
 moment he takes it then what is going to 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.190
 happen the pulp becomes inflamed in some 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.790
 cases and the most moderate we have 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.580
 some sensitivity a little bit of 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.720
 annoyance with cold water with the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.290
 air when I eat something cold because 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.250
 because the pulp is inflamed and it 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.650
 becomes hypersensitive to changes in 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.930
 temperature then creates a first 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.939
 problem 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.180
 in a second problem like to 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:21.969
 deepen or if the problem continues 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.689
 is that the bone says here there is a 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:27.640
 problem and when perceiving the bone or the 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:32.500
 periodontal ligament that there is a 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.079
 problem the bone retracts shrinks and 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.290
 is when we start to see some small 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.780
 exposures of the tooth root that 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.790
 it should not be given and with it they start 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.790
 another endless series of problems 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.640
 if we do not put a stop a high 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.920
 to the wing to the cause of the problem the 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.650
 problem will continue is logical 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.320
 so if I keep crashing, follow 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.420
 crashing keeps going down the root follows 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.360
 going down the root and start they start to 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.080
 move the teeth and then 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.080
 close 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.000
 the car today is prepared 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.680
 to solve these and all cases 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.330
 and all the worthies and all the 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.850
 problems all the discomforts of 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.890
 our patients first and foremost 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.120
 healthy what is always pensioned and what have 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.470
 heard everyone is that you have to 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.070
 visit the list once every six months 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.650
 at least once a year because everything 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.800
 problem diagnosed in time is going to 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.540
 have a happy ending the worst enemy of 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.030
 the customers in our oversight the 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.760
 neglects our carelessness when we 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.980
 we do not neglect all the little ones 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.510
 problems from a little face that 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.180
 see you the ten minutes to cure it 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.890
 may end up in an ad may 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.370
 end up losing the tooth with 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.370
 a great infection
