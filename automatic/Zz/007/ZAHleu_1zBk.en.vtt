00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
tried to recreate here and then you can

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.150 
tried to recreate here and then you can
see<00:00:29.310> all<00:00:29.670> turn<00:00:30.090> around<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.859> wall<00:00:32.009> gets

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
see all turn around and the wall gets

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.010 
see all turn around and the wall gets
placed<00:00:32.369> back<00:00:32.550> down<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.360> saw<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> kind<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> used

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
placed back down you saw I kind of used

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.590 
placed back down you saw I kind of used
some<00:00:34.260> mechanics<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.160> he<00:00:35.550> died<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.000> then<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
some mechanics here he died and then the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.100 
some mechanics here he died and then the
wall<00:00:36.750> got<00:00:36.899> spawned<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:38.420> yeah<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.660> that's

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
wall got spawned in yeah so that's

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
wall got spawned in yeah so that's
that's<00:00:40.410> pretty<00:00:40.590> much<00:00:40.770> how<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.070> works<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.550> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
that's pretty much how it works so you

thing's working so I have two sets of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.880 
thing's working so I have two sets of
command<00:01:22.560> blocks<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:25.590> that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
command blocks here this one that that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
command blocks here this one that that
there<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.420> turns<00:01:27.630> him<00:01:27.750> into<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
there we go this one turns him into the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.100 
there we go this one turns him into the
ghost<00:01:28.200> oh<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:29.180> can't<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.750> he's<00:01:30.869> near

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
there and basically what this set of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.139 
there and basically what this set of
command<00:01:41.490> blocks<00:01:41.700> does<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:44.520> deletes<00:01:44.880> all

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
command blocks does is it deletes all

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.340 
command blocks does is it deletes all
the<00:01:45.450> blocks<00:01:45.659> around<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.229> wither<00:01:46.409> skull

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
the blocks around the wither skull

summons aghast at the wither skull and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.300 
summons aghast at the wither skull and
then<00:01:50.640> kills<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> wither<00:01:51.240> skull<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.130> boom<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
then kills the wither skull so boom and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.020 
then kills the wither skull so boom and
then<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.850> one<00:01:54.060> does<00:01:54.270> kind<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> opposite

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
then this one does kind of the opposite

guest is kills the guest and then

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.510 
guest is kills the guest and then
it<00:02:01.810> will<00:02:02.049> summon<00:02:02.350> wool<00:02:02.619> around<00:02:03.100> whether<00:02:03.280> with

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
it will summon wool around whether with

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.730 
it will summon wool around whether with
their<00:02:03.670> skull<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:04.960> can<00:02:05.110> see<00:02:05.290> I<00:02:05.320> hit<00:02:05.590> this

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
their skull is so you can see I hit this

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.400 
their skull is so you can see I hit this
and<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:07.060> design<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:07.600> then<00:02:07.689> it<00:02:07.780> also<00:02:07.900> kills

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
and the design and then it also kills

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.109 
and the design and then it also kills
any<00:02:08.619> items<00:02:08.979> for<00:02:09.160> any<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.610> take<00:02:09.759> care<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:09.970> any

any items for any to take care of any
gas<00:02:10.330> drops<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:12.819> lastly<00:02:13.150> over<00:02:13.450> here

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
gas drops and then lastly over here

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.330 
gas drops and then lastly over here
there's<00:02:16.200> four<00:02:17.200> eight<00:02:17.500> eight<00:02:17.709> command<00:02:18.160> blocks

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
there's four eight eight command blocks

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.590 
there's four eight eight command blocks

detects when I'm faced when I'm facing

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.740 
detects when I'm faced when I'm facing
the<00:02:26.200> gas<00:02:26.680> no<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.190> one<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:28.090> text<00:02:28.360> one<00:02:28.510> on

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
the gas no this one the text one on

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.110 
the gas no this one the text one on
there<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> gas<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:29.950> turn<00:02:30.160> around<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.910> I'm

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
there is a gas and I turn around and I'm

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.630 
there is a gas and I turn around and I'm
looking<00:02:31.540> at<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.920> then<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.280> will<00:02:33.400> place<00:02:33.610> a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
looking at it and then it will place a

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.880 
looking at it and then it will place a
redstone<00:02:33.880> block<00:02:34.090> over<00:02:34.750> here<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.200> turn<00:02:35.800> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
redstone block over here and turn the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.710 
redstone block over here and turn the
gas<00:02:36.069> into<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.430> wool<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.819> then<00:02:36.940> vice<00:02:37.600> versa

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
gas into the wool and then vice versa

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.840 
gas into the wool and then vice versa
v's<00:02:38.140> detect<00:02:38.560> when<00:02:38.800> I'm<00:02:38.980> looking<00:02:39.489> away<00:02:39.670> from

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
v's detect when I'm looking away from

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.680 
v's detect when I'm looking away from
the<00:02:40.569> wither<00:02:40.780> skull<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.640> then<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.180> will<00:02:43.300> summon

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
the wither skull and then it will summon

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.110 
the wither skull and then it will summon
the<00:02:43.810> gas<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:45.400> way<00:02:45.519> how<00:02:45.610> do<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.090> a

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
the gas so the way how do this is a

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.650 
the gas so the way how do this is a
nested<00:02:46.720> execute<00:02:47.290> command<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.940> we<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:49.180> first

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
nested execute command so we have first

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.259 
nested execute command so we have first
of<00:02:49.810> all<00:02:49.930> execute<00:02:50.580> at<00:02:51.580> player<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.150> then

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
of all execute at player and then

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.280 
of all execute at player and then
between<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.560> specific<00:02:54.100> rotation<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.900> then

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
between a specific rotation and then

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.979 
between a specific rotation and then
fifty<00:02:56.680> blocks<00:02:56.860> away

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
fifty blocks away

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.960 
fifty blocks away
these<00:02:58.989> fifties<00:02:59.590> change<00:02:59.950> depending<00:03:00.519> on<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
these fifties change depending on the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.259 
these fifties change depending on the
rotation<00:03:01.450> I'm<00:03:01.569> specifying<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.319> that's<00:03:02.470> how<00:03:02.620> I

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
rotation I'm specifying and that's how I

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.940 
rotation I'm specifying and that's how I
achieve<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:04.959> specific<00:03:05.440> directions

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
achieve the like specific directions

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.150 
achieve the like specific directions
that<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.220> player<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.489> facing<00:03:07.860> but<00:03:08.860> then<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
that the player is facing but then the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.000 
that the player is facing but then the
next<00:03:09.400> execute<00:03:09.820> command<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.390> at<00:03:11.320> any<00:03:11.769> gas

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
next execute command is at any gas

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.300 
next execute command is at any gas
within<00:03:12.519> 50<00:03:13.209> blocks<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.870> direction<00:03:14.410> and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
within 50 blocks of that direction and

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.280 
within 50 blocks of that direction and
this<00:03:15.459> is<00:03:15.579> limited<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.090> 50<00:03:16.420> blocks<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:17.019> as<00:03:17.260> a

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
this is limited to 50 blocks so as a

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.960 
this is limited to 50 blocks so as a
result<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.739> doesn't<00:03:18.070> work<00:03:18.160> from<00:03:18.340> far<00:03:18.760> away

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
result this doesn't work from far away

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.810 
result this doesn't work from far away
or<00:03:19.120> very<00:03:19.329> close<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.140> kind<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.130> imprecise<00:03:21.579> but

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
or very close so kind of imprecise but

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.930 
or very close so kind of imprecise but
it<00:03:22.420> gets<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.750> job<00:03:22.900> done<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.320> then<00:03:23.859> if<00:03:24.609> it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
it gets the job done and then if it

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.150 
it gets the job done and then if it
basically<00:03:25.780> if<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:25.959> managed<00:03:26.320> if<00:03:26.440> if<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.980> manages

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
basically if it managed if if it manages

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.449 
basically if it managed if if it manages
to<00:03:27.519> find<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.940> gas<00:03:28.350> within<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.620> 50<00:03:29.920> blocks<00:03:30.220> away

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
to find a gas within the 50 blocks away

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.430 
to find a gas within the 50 blocks away
from<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.910> player<00:03:31.120> facing<00:03:31.780> in<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.170> specific

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
from the player facing in that specific

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.160 
from the player facing in that specific
rotation<00:03:33.340> then<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.329> will<00:03:34.480> place<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.930> redstone

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
rotation then it will place a redstone

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.470 
rotation then it will place a redstone
block<00:03:35.440> over<00:03:36.340> here

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
block over here

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.030 
block over here
and<00:03:37.840> then<00:03:38.320> these<00:03:38.440> pretty<00:03:38.620> much<00:03:38.709> do<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.010> same

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
and then these pretty much do the same

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.009 
and then these pretty much do the same
thing<00:03:39.459> but<00:03:39.730> place<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.329> red<00:03:40.450> sun<00:03:40.660> block<00:03:40.750> in<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
thing but place the red sun block in the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.250 
thing but place the red sun block in the
other<00:03:41.140> spot<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.650> yeah<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:43.480> start<00:03:43.900> this<00:03:44.019> clock

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
other spot and yeah so start this clock

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.539 
other spot and yeah so start this clock
up<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:45.690> see<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.840> stays<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.200> same<00:03:47.400> going<00:03:48.400> to

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
up and see that stays the same going to

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.750 
up and see that stays the same going to
f5<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.329> see<00:03:49.480> behind<00:03:49.630> me<00:03:49.859> Oh<00:03:50.859> actually

yeah there you go you see them too close

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.410 
yeah there you go you see them too close
to<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.160> yeah<00:03:54.700> once<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:55.030> get<00:03:55.150> far<00:03:55.329> enough

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
to it and yeah once I get far enough

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.199 
to it and yeah once I get far enough
away<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.810> will<00:03:55.900> work<00:03:56.079> so<00:03:56.700> yeah<00:03:57.700> there<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.150> go
