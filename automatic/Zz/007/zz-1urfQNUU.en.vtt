it's<00:00:09.599> fairly<00:00:09.840> simple<00:00:10.200> but<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.469> know<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.650> was

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
it's fairly simple but I know I was

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.100 
it's fairly simple but I know I was
having<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.370> few<00:00:11.580> issues<00:00:11.730> with<00:00:12.599> getting<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.990> to

then you should see GTA 5 simply click
on<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
on that and right here you have the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.799 
on that and right here you have the
folder<00:00:47.190> called<00:00:47.460> user<00:00:47.820> traffic<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.629> these

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
folder called user traffic I know these

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.029 
folder called user traffic I know these
for<00:00:48.960> me<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.289> looking<00:00:49.530> into<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> steam

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
for me I was looking into the steam

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.740 
for me I was looking into the steam
folder<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:50.940> not<00:00:51.180> where<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
folder and that's not where this is that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.540 
folder and that's not where this is that
so<00:00:52.020> hope<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.350> makes<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.860> easier<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> find<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so hope this makes it easier to find it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.580 
so hope this makes it easier to find it
now<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.030> basically<00:00:54.120> once<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> here

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
now but basically once you have it here

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.279 
now but basically once you have it here
simply<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.430> copy<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.879> music<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:58.020> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
simply just copy your music that you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.680 
simply just copy your music that you
want<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:58.920> suggest<00:00:59.190> use<00:00:59.640> mp3<00:01:00.030> formats

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
want and I would suggest use mp3 formats

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510 
want and I would suggest use mp3 formats
I<00:01:00.870> know<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.500> heard<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.890> other<00:01:02.100> formats

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
I know I have heard that other formats

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.009 
I know I have heard that other formats
do<00:01:02.760> work<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> think<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.719> people<00:01:03.809> were

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
do work but I think some people were

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.660 
do work but I think some people were
having<00:01:04.260> issues<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> would<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
having issues so I would just go the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.789 
having issues so I would just go the
safe<00:01:05.850> route<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.270> mp3<00:01:06.810> formats<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> like

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
safe route and use mp3 formats and like

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.469 
safe route and use mp3 formats and like
I<00:01:07.860> said<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.040> literally<00:01:08.460> copy<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.270> there

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
I said just literally copy them in there

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
I said just literally copy them in there
once<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.470> them<00:01:10.619> copied<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.369> all

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850 
once you have them copied in there all

you're<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.810> obviously

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you're gonna want to do is obviously

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.109 
you're gonna want to do is obviously
have<00:01:37.470> Auto<00:01:37.680> scan<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.189> music<00:01:38.430> turned<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.850> and

have Auto scan for music turned on and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.700 
have Auto scan for music turned on and
then<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> perform<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.930> quick<00:01:40.200> scan<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
then you can perform a quick scan or a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.679 
then you can perform a quick scan or a
full<00:01:40.979> scan<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.280> mean<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.270> same<00:01:42.420> thing

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
full scan I mean they do the same thing

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.899 
full scan I mean they do the same thing
pretty<00:01:42.930> much<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.409> once<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.610> set

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
pretty much and once you have that set

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
pretty much and once you have that set
up<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.450> basically<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.439> them<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> your

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
up then basically just get them to your

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.639 
up then basically just get them to your
car<00:01:47.009> then<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.640> hit<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> self<00:01:48.210> radio<00:01:48.649> option

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
car then you hit the self radio option

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.899 
car then you hit the self radio option
and<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.009> should<00:01:50.220> start<00:01:50.399> playing<00:01:50.610> your<00:01:50.790> music

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and it should start playing your music

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.490 
and it should start playing your music
now<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.810> was<00:01:51.930> saying<00:01:52.079> there's<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> three

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
now like I was saying there's the three

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
now like I was saying there's the three
different<00:01:52.619> modes<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.250> radio<00:01:53.790> mode<00:01:54.119> will

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
different modes the radio mode will

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.149 
different modes the radio mode will
actually<00:01:54.810> play<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> sort<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.829> radio
