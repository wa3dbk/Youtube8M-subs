every<00:00:40.710> game<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:42.000> took<00:00:42.180> some<00:00:42.329> steps

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
every game so they took some steps

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
really dominated an offense and taking
shots<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.920> last<00:00:50.309> 20<00:00:50.760> minutes<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
shots in that last 20 minutes of the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.520 
shots in that last 20 minutes of the
game<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> say<00:00:51.899> anything<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
difference from the first half to that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.720 
difference from the first half to that
last<00:00:54.570> 90<00:00:54.840> minutes<00:00:54.960> yeah<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.280> created

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
last 90 minutes yeah i think we created

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.099 
last 90 minutes yeah i think we created
in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> first<00:00:57.059> half<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.809> did<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
in the first half as we did in the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.720 
in the first half as we did in the
second<00:00:58.469> half<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.859> i<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
second half but i think there was just a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.400 
second half but i think there was just a
bit<00:00:59.940> more<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.149> awareness<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> second<00:01:01.230> half

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
bit more of awareness in the second half

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.250 
bit more of awareness in the second half
um<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.570> need<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> bit<00:01:04.140> more

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
um but now we just need to be a bit more

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.140 
um but now we just need to be a bit more
