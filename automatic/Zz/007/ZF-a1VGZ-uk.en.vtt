this<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.350> actually<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> pre-production<00:00:08.130> sample

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
this is actually a pre-production sample

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.089 
this is actually a pre-production sample
of<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> final<00:00:09.480> product<00:00:09.690> peel<00:00:10.410> from<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.860> sent

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
this out to me to test for them so that

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.629 
this out to me to test for them so that
I<00:00:13.230> can<00:00:13.349> feed<00:00:13.740> back<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.099> them<00:00:14.250> all<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.580> the

I can feed back to them all of the
positives<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.299> negatives<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.500> case<00:00:16.710> so

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
positives and negatives of the case so

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.460 
positives and negatives of the case so
hopefully<00:00:18.090> everything<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.779> point<00:00:19.020> out<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.350> this

of clothing that you wish case is closed
with<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> magnet<00:01:19.159> although<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.430> worth

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
with a magnet although it's also worth

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.310 
with a magnet although it's also worth
noting<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.420> doesn't<00:01:21.630> activate<00:01:22.170> the

sleep function on the device which isn't

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.880 
sleep function on the device which isn't
too<00:01:24.659> much<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> problem<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.710> lot

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
too much of a problem but I know a lot

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
too much of a problem but I know a lot
of<00:01:25.950> people<00:01:26.040> wish<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.930> case<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
of people wish to see that on a case the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.210 
of people wish to see that on a case the
inside<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.049> lined<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> peel<00:01:31.860> frommer

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
inside is lined with the peel frommer

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
inside is lined with the peel frommer
logo<00:01:33.090> which<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.360> think<00:01:33.540> looks<00:01:33.570> really

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
logo which I think looks really

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
logo which I think looks really
sophisticated<00:01:34.460> but<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.970> case<00:01:36.210> definitely

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
sophisticated but this case definitely

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
sophisticated but this case definitely
isn't<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.140> for<00:01:37.170> those<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
isn't one for those that just like to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100
