student's college career is essential
for<00:00:59.190> success<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.059> we've<00:01:00.690> increased<00:01:01.199> our

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
for success and we've increased our

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.990 
for success and we've increased our

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
all those credits every semester means

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.399 
all those credits every semester means
we<00:01:08.820> need<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.180> make<00:01:09.390> sure<00:01:09.420> they're<00:01:10.049> available

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
we need to make sure they're available

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.460 
we need to make sure they're available
and<00:01:10.799> we've<00:01:11.250> done<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.659> we<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.780> added<00:01:13.020> over

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and we've done that we have added over

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.760 
and we've done that we have added over
700<00:01:14.400> classes<00:01:14.990> dramatically<00:01:15.990> reducing<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
700 classes dramatically reducing the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.550 
700 classes dramatically reducing the
bottlenecks<00:01:17.310> students<00:01:17.850> faced<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:19.350> make

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
bottlenecks students faced and to make

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
bottlenecks students faced and to make
getting<00:01:19.860> into<00:01:20.369> those<00:01:20.490> classes<00:01:20.700> even<00:01:21.210> easier

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
getting into those classes even easier

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.609 
getting into those classes even easier
we<00:01:22.470> had<00:01:22.680> another<00:01:23.070> big<00:01:23.310> idea<00:01:23.930> one-stop<00:01:24.930> Express

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
we had another big idea one-stop Express

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.850 
we had another big idea one-stop Express
student<00:01:26.130> services<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> usually<00:01:28.590> you'd<00:01:28.740> have

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
student services so usually you'd have

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.289 
student services so usually you'd have
to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.040> running<00:01:29.159> around<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.150> these

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to be running around it's all these

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
to be running around it's all these
different<00:01:30.420> offices<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.930> campus<00:01:31.340> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> had

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
different offices on campus if you had

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.240 
different offices on campus if you had
anything<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.090> financial<00:01:33.450> aid<00:01:33.659> registration
