00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.840
 the 160th Turin derby has begun 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.269
 in joy with the old gianduia 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.709
 turin mask in the field to greet i 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.400
 players and the public 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.740
 then the battle with blows began 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.689
 hard to repeat on both sides and 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.150
 the toselli referee who intervened 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.099
 whistling and admonishing continued like this 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.900
 for a long time but in this first 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.029
 tender reminder was clearly the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.980
 torino to maneuver while juve goes by 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.740
 goes to contain very little risk in 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.990
 attack on the first tenth blaze 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.970
 punishment of agroppi head of shot buy 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.770
 strong of pulici that suffers pushes 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.850
 retorting immediately afterwards also 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.530
 close conclusion of rampant la 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.940
 juventus tries to replicate with exchanges 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.920
 maneuvered but it is still the turin 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.140
 relax the midfield well 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.600
 juventino which also supports bettega 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.850
 and anastasis seems to hold up with difficulty and 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.680
 the episodes of the agroppi dark room create 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.680
 concern for Juventus defenders 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.110
 at the twentieth, however, it is the juve that touches 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.009
 the cross goal of causio with altafini that 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.009
 missing the easy target 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.380
 shortly after this time on the center of 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.090
 marchetti still altafini puts to the side 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.369
 of head 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.869
 to the 42nd anastasis is made alive and with a 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.909
 precise ground level commits to castellino 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.979
 in the second half despite the accusations 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.810
 a serious illness in the left foot but 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.340
 the year for which perhaps the stopper does not 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.170
 can play Wednesday against the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.030
 Hungarians of the Juventus Juventus 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.680
 attacks in a tone more convinced than it is 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.680
 did not do in the first half 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.180
 and on the sixth it touches the goal with this shot 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.890
 of marchetti that escapes to castellini al 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.900
 thirteenth pulici goes off guard 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.420
 exceeds morini but in the next 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.190
 contrast clashes with salvador and for 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.190
 the referee toselli and penalty kick 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.490
 which pulici transforms by placing the ball 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.650
 in the left corner and sending zoff 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.360
 on the other side to the seventeenth for 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.010
 having protested with the referee on the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.630
 irregular position of the opponents 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.120
 during the corner kicks beaten by 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.780
 juve causio is ejected is played now 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.780
 ten against eleven 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.740
 the bianconeri attempt the offensive 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.270
 cuccureddu's angry punishment 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.180
 replaced by Altafini 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:35.430
 then a tight scrum that does not get 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.350
 result some twenty-seventh punishment 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.540
 for the torino hall rampanti that touches 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.280
 for agroppi right shot and ball in the net 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.280
 torino 2 juventus 0 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.110
 last burst of live game is all about 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.800
 dribbling blinds gets rid of 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.550
 Opponents and then roll zoff placed deviates 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.110
 in a corner with two hands but I think mazzini 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.350
 and I turn to the youngest in Turin 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.390
 the derby is above all a man game 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.500
 against man 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.090
 practically takes place there are the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.980
 match man against man 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.900
 she had one going today 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.600
 well he had scored twice recently 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.580
 called roberto bettega as I saw it 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.760
 well i have seen say the best of the 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.820
 other times it moves more and more 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.320
 in short, more time 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.220
 today, however, in the first half I think it is fir 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.900
 that he played a little 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.000
 strange a little back prepare some 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.320
 in fact, I was surprised because 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.090
 he never played back like that 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.350
 mattered a little outside the area 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.520
 however, I didn't even serve pop then 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.990
 this one has played well 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.570
 add to the honor of the true montini 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.280
 he played a wonderful game 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.930
 the decisive moment of course that 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.270
 of rigor 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.590
 I think so if it hadn't been there 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.510
 penalty kick as it would be over 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.190
 according to you the game but I think it is 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.620
 once we would have dreamed the same yes 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.620
 you would have won anyway i think
