00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
they're pulling on us they said me but

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:38.170 
they're pulling on us they said me but
they're<00:00:31.730> not<00:00:35.769> so<00:00:36.769> today<00:00:37.100> we're<00:00:37.370> racing<00:00:38.030> down<00:00:38.150> a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
they're not so today we're racing down a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.270 
they're not so today we're racing down a
marina<00:00:38.540> del<00:00:38.780> rey<00:00:39.019> and<00:00:39.260> headed<00:00:39.530> towards<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.860> el

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
marina del rey and headed towards the el

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.540 
marina del rey and headed towards the el
segundo<00:00:40.670> buoy<00:00:41.199> it's<00:00:42.199> pretty<00:00:42.920> straight<00:00:43.250> shot

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
segundo buoy it's pretty straight shot

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.610 
segundo buoy it's pretty straight shot
so<00:00:43.790> it's<00:00:43.909> more<00:00:44.089> like<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.330> parade<00:00:44.780> bit<00:00:45.470> of<00:00:45.559> a

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
so it's more like a parade bit of a

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.439 
so it's more like a parade bit of a
disadvantage<00:00:45.979> in<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.549> boat<00:00:46.729> like<00:00:46.909> ours<00:00:47.210> we're

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
disadvantage in a boat like ours we're

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.549 
disadvantage in a boat like ours we're
much<00:00:47.629> better<00:00:47.659> in<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.110> corners<00:00:49.210> we<00:00:50.210> also<00:00:51.199> not

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
much better in the corners we also not

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.110 
much better in the corners we also not
particularly<00:00:52.100> crazy<00:00:52.370> about<00:00:52.549> this<00:00:52.850> route

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
particularly crazy about this route

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.210 
particularly crazy about this route
because<00:00:53.330> we're<00:00:53.659> right<00:00:53.839> under<00:00:54.229> LAX<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.070> all

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
because we're right under LAX and all

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.539 
because we're right under LAX and all
the<00:00:55.400> planes<00:00:56.150> take<00:00:56.479> off<00:00:56.629> over<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.140> ocean<00:00:57.549> we

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
the planes take off over the ocean we

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.090 
the planes take off over the ocean we
did<00:00:58.760> get<00:00:58.909> an<00:00:59.059> excellent<00:00:59.629> start<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.229> none<00:01:01.070> of

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
the other boat seemed to be able to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.149 
the other boat seemed to be able to
catch<00:01:02.479> up<00:01:02.690> with<00:01:02.720> this<00:01:02.900> point<00:01:03.199> yet<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:03.920> take<00:01:04.129> a

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
which may give us a advantage we'll just

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.819
