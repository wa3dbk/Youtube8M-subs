00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
now using a filter sock my return pump

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.199 
now using a filter sock my return pump
is<00:03:37.830> on<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.070> Union<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.640> then<00:03:38.790> there's<00:03:39.120> a

is on the Union and then there's a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.199 
is on the Union and then there's a
little<00:03:39.860> filter<00:03:40.860> internal<00:03:41.640> filter<00:03:41.970> so

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
little filter internal filter so

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.570 
little filter internal filter so
hopefully<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.019> does<00:03:43.170> well<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:44.130> clears<00:03:44.459> up

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580
