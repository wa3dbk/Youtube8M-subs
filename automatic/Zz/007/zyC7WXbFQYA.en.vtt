conservation<00:00:58.799> obviously<00:00:59.799> if<00:01:00.040> you<00:01:00.220> have<00:01:00.400> a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
conservation obviously if you have a

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.280 
conservation obviously if you have a
loud<00:01:00.670> stage<00:01:01.059> being<00:01:01.690> able<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:01.930> reduce<00:01:02.229> that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
loud stage being able to reduce that

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.320 
loud stage being able to reduce that
stage<00:01:02.739> volume<00:01:03.220> is<00:01:03.339> important<00:01:03.879> for<00:01:04.180> the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
stage volume is important for the

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.240 
stage volume is important for the
individual<00:01:04.869> musician<00:01:05.350> as<00:01:05.770> well<00:01:05.920> as<00:01:06.190> a

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
individual musician as well as a

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.370 
individual musician as well as a
congregation<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:07.390> by<00:01:07.720> reducing<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.350> volume

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
congregation so by reducing the volume

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.200 
congregation so by reducing the volume
by<00:01:08.740> twenty<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.190> twenty<00:01:09.430> five<00:01:09.460> decibels<00:01:09.970> and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
by twenty to twenty five decibels and

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.120 
by twenty to twenty five decibels and
having<00:01:10.450> that<00:01:10.570> consistent<00:01:11.140> fit<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.409> seal<00:01:11.590> it

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
having that consistent fit and seal it

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.649 
having that consistent fit and seal it
allows<00:01:12.369> you<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.640> really<00:01:12.790> maintain<00:01:13.479> the

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
allows you to really maintain the

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.450 
allows you to really maintain the
quality<00:01:14.049> of<00:01:14.140> sound<00:01:14.409> had<00:01:14.710> a<00:01:14.740> reduced<00:01:15.130> volume

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
quality of sound had a reduced volume

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.760 
quality of sound had a reduced volume
okay<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:16.240> how<00:01:16.420> do<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.600> get<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.810> custom<00:01:17.320> fit<00:01:17.590> that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
okay so how do you get a custom fit that

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.740 
okay so how do you get a custom fit that
means<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.460> order<00:01:18.850> of<00:01:19.000> custom<00:01:19.479> or<00:01:19.600> what

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
means you the order of custom or what

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.750 
means you the order of custom or what
happens<00:01:20.110> well<00:01:20.620> it<00:01:21.010> has<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.340> happen<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.730> you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
happens well it has to happen is you

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.190 
happens well it has to happen is you
have<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.060> have<00:01:22.180> an<00:01:22.240> impression<00:01:22.540> taken<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.110> your

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
have to have an impression taken of your

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.590 
have to have an impression taken of your
ear<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:23.950> an<00:01:24.130> audiologist<00:01:24.730> is<00:01:24.970> recommended

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
ear and so an audiologist is recommended

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.750 
ear and so an audiologist is recommended
because<00:01:25.690> they're<00:01:26.050> trained<00:01:26.440> in<00:01:26.770> understanding

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
because they're trained in understanding

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.520 
because they're trained in understanding
all<00:01:27.910> things<00:01:28.150> ears<00:01:28.540> from<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.290> hearing

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
all things ears from the hearing

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.410 
all things ears from the hearing
conservation<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:30.370> also<00:01:30.820> taking<00:01:31.210> impressions

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
conservation to also taking impressions

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.140 
conservation to also taking impressions
an<00:01:32.200> impression<00:01:32.650> is<00:01:32.770> basically<00:01:33.310> what<00:01:34.030> it's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
an impression is basically what it's

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.640 
an impression is basically what it's
happen<00:01:34.510> is<00:01:34.630> they<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:35.200> go<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.410> the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
happen is they you go to the

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.190 
happen is they you go to the
audiologists<00:01:36.220> office<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.820> they<00:01:37.480> will<00:01:37.660> insert

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
audiologists office and they will insert

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.080 
audiologists office and they will insert
what's<00:01:38.470> called<00:01:38.650> an<00:01:38.770> auto<00:01:38.980> dam<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.970> will

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
what's called an auto dam and it will

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.360 
what's called an auto dam and it will
block<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.600> ear<00:01:40.840> canal<00:01:41.230> and<00:01:41.500> they<00:01:42.040> so<00:01:42.250> that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
block the ear canal and they so that

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.310 
block the ear canal and they so that
they<00:01:42.520> can<00:01:42.700> then<00:01:42.850> inject<00:01:43.210> material<00:01:43.810> into<00:01:44.140> your

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
they can then inject material into your

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.220 
they can then inject material into your
ear<00:01:44.500> to<00:01:45.010> make<00:01:45.159> an<00:01:45.310> impression<00:01:45.670> so<00:01:46.450> then<00:01:46.600> they

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
ear to make an impression so then they

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.780 
ear to make an impression so then they
go<00:01:47.350> ahead<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.710> take<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:47.920> send<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.670> you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
go ahead and take that send it to you

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.460 
go ahead and take that send it to you
you<00:01:49.030> make<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.270> mold<00:01:49.600> out<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.110> then<00:01:50.290> what

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
you make a mold out of that then what

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.030 
you make a mold out of that then what
happens

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
happens

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.130 
happens
well<00:01:51.220> once<00:01:51.550> we<00:01:51.760> manufacture<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.600> custom<00:01:52.990> fit

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
well once we manufacture the custom fit

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.720 
well once we manufacture the custom fit
product<00:01:53.320> depending<00:01:53.680> on<00:01:53.770> what<00:01:53.980> that<00:01:54.010> is<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.610> we

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
product depending on what that is and we

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.610 
product depending on what that is and we
have<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:55.210> new<00:01:55.570> product<00:01:55.900> called<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.140> AC<00:01:56.290> to

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
okay so that's all molded in then it's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.870 
okay so that's all molded in then it's
not<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.720> separate<00:02:40.080> thing<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.440> plugs<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.980> fully

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
not a separate thing that plugs in fully

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
okay so what kind of isolation can I get

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.830 
okay so what kind of isolation can I get
from<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:50.040> versus<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.490> standard<00:02:50.820> foam<00:02:51.450> type
