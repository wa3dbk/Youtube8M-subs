weren't<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:51.270> keyed<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.020> one<00:00:52.320> specific

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
weren't really keyed in on one specific

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
weren't really keyed in on one specific
deal<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.670> could<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.449> bait

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
deal but what I could do with this bait

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.099 
deal but what I could do with this bait
is<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.860> could<00:00:56.039> cover<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.370> lot<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.850> water<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
is I could cover a lot of water and I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.290 
is I could cover a lot of water and I
could<00:00:58.289> keep<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> bait<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> strike<00:00:59.219> zone

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
could keep the bait in the strike zone

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.930 
could keep the bait in the strike zone
tracks<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.340> basically<00:01:02.670> making

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
tracks on and I was basically making

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
tracks on and I was basically making
long<00:01:03.270> cast<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.500> just

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
long cast with it and I was just

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.730 
long cast with it and I was just
crawling<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.250> bait<00:01:05.460> through<00:01:06.740> potential

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
crawling the bait through potential

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
crawling the bait through potential
areas<00:01:08.070> where<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.280> thought<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.760> fish<00:01:08.970> might<00:01:09.240> be

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
areas where I thought the fish might be

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.200 
areas where I thought the fish might be
and<00:01:09.840> sometimes<00:01:10.710> they<00:01:10.920> were<00:01:10.979> random<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and sometimes they were random but I

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.969 
and sometimes they were random but I
tried<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> fish<00:01:12.840> something<00:01:13.170> different<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
tried to fish something different you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
it just gives the fish a little bit

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.570 
it just gives the fish a little bit
different<00:03:45.519> look<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:47.040> lot<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.070> times<00:03:48.370> that's

different look and a lot of times that's

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.890 
different look and a lot of times that's
what<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.630> takes

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:04:01.360 

got<00:03:52.900> one<00:03:53.140> foot<00:03:53.470> not<00:03:53.950> very<00:03:54.190> big

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:17.240
