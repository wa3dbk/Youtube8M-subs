that one so then we're gonna just keep
repeating<00:03:59.810> this<00:04:00.079> pattern<00:04:00.230> until<00:04:00.560> we<00:04:00.680> get<00:04:00.769> to

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
repeating this pattern until we get to

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.819 
repeating this pattern until we get to
the<00:04:01.010> beginning<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:02.780> we're<00:04:02.959> gonna<00:04:03.049> do<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.590> two

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
the beginning and we're gonna do the two

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.809 
the beginning and we're gonna do the two
in<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.069> next<00:04:04.250> one<00:04:04.579> and<00:04:04.819> one<00:04:04.940> in<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.180> next<00:04:05.389> one

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
in the next one and one in the next one

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.659 
in the next one and one in the next one
so<00:04:07.819> just<00:04:08.120> think<00:04:08.359> -<00:04:08.660> one<00:04:08.989> two<00:04:09.590> one<00:04:09.620> okay<00:04:10.459> and
