00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 we are talking about soccer and uruguay 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.330
 looking for a place in the world cup this is 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.210
 maximum with the maxi as this is a place 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.969
 but it seems to me that I take out a passage and 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.070
 something quite more than the 23 players 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.789
 what can you get now I think that you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.430
 they took the passage to 1819 because in the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.320
 first leg match against jordan is 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.439
 disputing right now is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.599
 winning 2 to 0 and as we know great is 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.580
 the Uruguayan community that lives in 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.810
 our country and they will come together for the center 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.940
 to see the match where our 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.950
 compañero juan carlos fernández when 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.410
 I imagine that it is absolute happiness for 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.570
 now 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.130
 absolute happiness because Uruguay is 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.230
 is classifying for what is the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.989
 World Cup in Brazil has it so close 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.879
 geographically and it looked like a lie before 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.980
 of the match that Uruguay did not have 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.590
 sealed its classification but well 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.720
 you said celestial corner here in good 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.670
 ordinary airs and quiet without going more 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.860
 look at the number of Uruguayans who 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.840
 are following there are actually many 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.510
 look I'm going to approach one of them to 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.820
 a table are all paying homage to 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.080
 Uruguay with blue shirt in this case 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.880
 tell me how the story was for 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.710
 get together with the friend and he came he does the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.810
 endure to our Uruguayan friend we are 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.119
 Argentineans and we are for Uruguay although not 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.430
 be a corresponded love we 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.840
 we believe in Latin American brotherhood 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.100
 when they are all Argentines the only 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.520
 Uruguayan gentleman 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.520
 the Knight 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:33.500
 argentinian argentinian by chance 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.030
 I imagine he is very happy but 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.619
 also the support of the Argentines who 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.810
 have you had because there is actually a 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.030
 sense of belonging because he has won 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.140
 in Uruguay this not so close in a motel 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.300
 that will be so familiar 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.400
 We were in Uruguay, we are in the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.470
 global distrust 2 to 0 is already 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.060
 finished we can not be calm and 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.350
 after the rematch in montevideo not 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.000
 I have the boys entrance 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.759
 they are in the preview of what is the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.470
 Brazil's World Cup All Argentines 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.970
 accompanying a Uruguayan who is 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.040
 suffering but the reality that the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.410
 party did not represent much many 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.870
 complications 2 to 0 only in the first 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.000
 time like this with goals from maxi pereira 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.310
 textual and for what classification is 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.380
 already from uruguay with this result although 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.640
 Of course, it's within a week 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.440
 nine at night in the stadium 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.930
 centenary will be defining the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.390
 history to have Uruguay neither more nor 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.610
 less than in the World Cup in Brazil in 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.040
 thank you, Juan, take the opportunity to eat something 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.040
 rich or you can come back right away
