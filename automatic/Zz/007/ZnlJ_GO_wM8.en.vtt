00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
the Red Queen the face cards nice

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.130 
the Red Queen the face cards nice
contrast<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.240> course<00:02:14.420> from<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.660> spot<00:02:14.900> cards

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
contrast of course from the spot cards

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.960 
contrast of course from the spot cards
and<00:02:15.440> these<00:02:15.620> are<00:02:15.770> black<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.220> red<00:02:16.460> so<00:02:16.700> I

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
and these are black and it's red so I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.400 
and these are black and it's red so I
think<00:02:17.180> it's<00:02:17.270> all<00:02:17.390> working<00:02:17.780> well<00:02:17.960> really<00:02:18.260> nice

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
think it's all working well really nice

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.100 
think it's all working well really nice
contrasting<00:02:19.100> that's<00:02:19.730> your<00:02:19.910> setup<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:20.300> top<00:02:20.540> so

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
contrasting that's your setup on top so

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.650 
contrasting that's your setup on top so
it's<00:02:21.320> three<00:02:21.650> three<00:02:22.310> Queen<00:02:22.910> then<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.540> other

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
it's three three Queen then the other

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.900 
it's three three Queen then the other
three<00:02:23.930> Queens<00:02:24.200> now<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.950> technique<00:02:25.490> on<00:02:25.730> this

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
three Queens now the technique on this

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.430 
three Queens now the technique on this
apart<00:02:26.240> from<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.420> little<00:02:26.600> gentle<00:02:26.930> handling<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.380> a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
apart from a little gentle handling of a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.180 
apart from a little gentle handling of a
double<00:02:27.710> on<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.550> table<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:30.440> office<00:02:30.980> force

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
double on the table is the office force

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.860 
double on the table is the office force
the<00:02:31.370> ante<00:02:31.550> or<00:02:31.580> not<00:02:31.880> force<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.360> switch<00:02:32.450> any

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
the ante or not force the switch any

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.260 
the ante or not force the switch any
time<00:02:33.140> face<00:02:33.380> up<00:02:33.560> switch<00:02:33.770> really<00:02:34.370> simple<00:02:34.730> works

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
time face up switch really simple works

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.570 
time face up switch really simple works
really<00:02:35.510> cleanly<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.280> talk<00:02:37.550> about

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
really cleanly so you talk about

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.890 
really cleanly so you talk about
three-card<00:02:38.060> Monte<00:02:38.390> maybe<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.690> want<00:02:38.840> to

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
three-card Monte maybe you want to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.750 
three-card Monte maybe you want to
flourish<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.650> bring<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.010> cards<00:02:40.460> or<00:02:40.610> any

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
flourish just bring the cards or any

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.040 
flourish just bring the cards or any
other<00:02:40.910> flourish<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.330> remains<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> top

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
other flourish that remains the top

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.280 
other flourish that remains the top
stock<00:02:42.320> okay<00:02:42.950> now<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:44.180> turn<00:02:44.660> over<00:02:44.690> three<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.110> I'm

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
stock okay now I turn over three and I'm

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.590 
stock okay now I turn over three and I'm
very<00:02:45.530> casual<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.250> don't<00:02:46.910> want<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.180> turn<00:02:47.360> them

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
very casual I don't want to turn them

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.900 
very casual I don't want to turn them
over<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.960> spread<00:02:48.830> them<00:02:49.010> out<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.160> cleanly<00:02:49.820> and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
over and spread them out to cleanly and

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.340 
over and spread them out to cleanly and
give<00:02:50.060> them<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.270> real<00:02:50.450> chance<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.840> take<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.230> in

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
give them a real chance to take it in

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.770 
give them a real chance to take it in
because<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:52.160> longer<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.120> clearer<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.390> show

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
because the longer and clearer I show

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.650 
because the longer and clearer I show
this<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.740> less<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.310> justifies<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.210> up<00:02:56.450> and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
this the less it justifies this up and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.510 
this the less it justifies this up and
down<00:02:56.840> one<00:02:57.110> by<00:02:57.260> one<00:02:57.290> display<00:02:57.890> I'm<00:02:57.980> about<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.370> do

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
down one by one display I'm about to do

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.490 
down one by one display I'm about to do
so<00:02:59.180> I<00:02:59.210> wanted<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.690> first<00:02:59.900> part<00:03:00.140> really

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
so I wanted to this first part really

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.410 
so I wanted to this first part really
casually<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.220> spread<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.730> up<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.210> you<00:03:02.300> don't

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
casually I spread it up and you don't

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.760 
casually I spread it up and you don't
just<00:03:02.630> route<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> top<00:03:03.110> three<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.470> actually

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
an eye on it's really emphasizing three

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.060 
an eye on it's really emphasizing three
three<00:06:03.479> then<00:06:03.870> you<00:06:03.960> get<00:06:04.110> this<00:06:04.199> nice<00:06:04.380> ending<00:06:04.740> now

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
three then you get this nice ending now

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.469 
three then you get this nice ending now
you<00:06:05.400> can<00:06:05.550> do<00:06:05.639> this<00:06:05.760> with<00:06:05.849> one<00:06:06.060> hand<00:06:06.330> but

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
you can do this with one hand but

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:07.909 
you can do this with one hand but
sometimes<00:06:06.900> the<00:06:07.050> one<00:06:07.199> card<00:06:07.470> will<00:06:07.560> fly<00:06:07.770> a<00:06:07.800> little

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
sometimes the one card will fly a little

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.529 
sometimes the one card will fly a little
further<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.460> claw<00:06:08.880> off<00:06:08.940> camera<00:06:09.330> here<00:06:09.510> so

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
further and a claw off camera here so

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.750 
further and a claw off camera here so
that's<00:06:10.020> why<00:06:10.199> I<00:06:10.229> sort<00:06:10.710> of<00:06:10.770> baby<00:06:11.340> that<00:06:11.550> have<00:06:11.639> been

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.370 
that's why I sort of baby that have been
I<00:06:11.789> put<00:06:12.090> my<00:06:12.240> finger<00:06:12.599> down<00:06:12.780> in<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:12.990> corner<00:06:13.320> of

I put my finger down in the corner of

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.659 
I put my finger down in the corner of
this<00:06:13.560> card<00:06:13.800> so<00:06:13.949> they<00:06:14.039> wouldn't<00:06:14.190> fly<00:06:14.430> too<00:06:14.490> far

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669
