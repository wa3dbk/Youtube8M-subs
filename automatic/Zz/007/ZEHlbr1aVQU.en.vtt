it's<00:00:27.510> got<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.869> stir<00:00:28.169> bars<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.490> when

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
it's got to stir bars in in that when

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
it's got to stir bars in in that when
added<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> drill<00:00:31.230> will<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:31.919> actually

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
added to the drill will they actually

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130 
added to the drill will they actually
spin<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.850> fast<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.540> actually<00:00:33.870> create<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
your your fermentation process started a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
your your fermentation process started a
lot<00:00:49.920> faster<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.660> device<00:00:52.050> it's

I'm<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.539> using<00:00:54.929> a<00:00:55.170> 3/8<00:00:55.620> inch<00:00:55.800> drill<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
I'm going to be using a 3/8 inch drill a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.389 
I'm going to be using a 3/8 inch drill a
couple<00:00:56.940> along<00:00:57.359> with<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.379> stir<00:00:58.769> bar<00:00:58.800> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
couple along with this the stir bar and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.119 
couple along with this the stir bar and
an<00:00:59.910> aerator<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.530> we've<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
an aerator and then we've got a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.549 
an aerator and then we've got a
sanitation<00:01:02.910> solution<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.929> we've<00:01:04.350> actually

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
sanitation solution that we've actually

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.880 
sanitation solution that we've actually
will<00:01:05.370> actually<00:01:05.640> put<00:01:05.880> our<00:01:06.150> aerator<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.680> 10

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
will actually put our aerator in for 10

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.520 
will actually put our aerator in for 10
minutes<00:01:08.220> prior<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> putting<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.690> into<00:01:09.990> our

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
minutes prior to putting it into our

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.960 
minutes prior to putting it into our
ward<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.340> want<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> make<00:01:11.670> sure<00:01:11.700> it's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
ward so we want to make sure it's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
ward so we want to make sure it's
sanitized<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.930> we've<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:13.560> wort

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
sanitized and we've got our wort

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.440 
sanitized and we've got our wort
transfer<00:01:14.010> ring<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:14.550> down<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> 6<00:01:15.300> gallon
