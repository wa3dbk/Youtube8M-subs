on<00:02:53.500> my<00:02:53.590> ankle<00:02:53.890> bone<00:02:54.040> can<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.790> two<00:02:54.970> actually

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
on my ankle bone can you two actually

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.480 
on my ankle bone can you two actually
built<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.900> particular<00:02:56.590> bump<00:02:56.920> into<00:02:57.370> the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
built the particular bump into the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:05.330 
built the particular bump into the
Steven<00:02:57.910> meaning<00:02:58.780> that

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.309 

this<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:07.030> already<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.480> little<00:03:07.720> bit<00:03:07.840> more

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
this is already a little bit more

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.350 
this is already a little bit more
generous<00:03:08.800> in<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.100> spot<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:09.940> you're<00:03:10.060> not<00:03:10.150> going

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
generous in a spot so you're not going

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.940 
generous in a spot so you're not going
to<00:03:10.420> have<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.569> issue<00:03:10.870> if<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.530> have<00:03:11.830> that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
to have that issue if you have that

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.740 
to have that issue if you have that
issue<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.790> great<00:03:13.000> thing<00:03:13.209> is<00:03:13.240> when<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.630> go

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
issue the great thing is when you go

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.390 
issue the great thing is when you go
back<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.050> your<00:03:14.170> shop<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.650> say<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:15.280> know

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
back to your shop and you say you know

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
back to your shop and you say you know
I've<00:03:15.550> got<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.730> little<00:03:15.970> bit<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.180> pressure

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
I've got a little bit of a pressure

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.330 
I've got a little bit of a pressure
point<00:03:16.660> here<00:03:16.959> what<00:03:17.290> can<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.560> do<00:03:17.740> well<00:03:18.130> guess

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
point here what can you do well guess

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.130 
point here what can you do well guess
what<00:03:18.580> they<00:03:18.790> don't<00:03:18.970> have<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.209> push<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.569> fast<00:03:19.870> I

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
what they don't have to push that fast I

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.490 
what they don't have to push that fast I
can<00:03:20.290> eat<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.590> fine<00:03:20.890> you<00:03:21.790> push<00:03:22.060> then<00:03:22.270> we<00:03:22.500> grind

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
can eat that fine you push then we grind

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.650 
can eat that fine you push then we grind
them<00:03:23.770> we<00:03:24.250> lose<00:03:24.550> performance<00:03:25.270> so<00:03:25.420> if<00:03:25.510> you're

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
them we lose performance so if you're

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.059 
them we lose performance so if you're
out<00:03:25.750> on<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> hill<00:03:26.140> and<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.380> see<00:03:26.590> someone<00:03:26.950> and

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
they've got their boot wound down across

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.930 
they've got their boot wound down across
three<00:03:29.470> or<00:03:29.620> four<00:03:29.860> watches<00:03:30.130> on<00:03:30.459> their<00:03:30.550> buckle

first notch on every single bottle and

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.050 
first notch on every single bottle and
it<00:03:39.790> should<00:03:39.970> literally<00:03:40.239> zero<00:03:41.700> buckle<00:03:42.700> tension

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
it should literally zero buckle tension

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.350 
it should literally zero buckle tension
all<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.239> buckles<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:43.989> want<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.200> ski<00:03:44.470> boot<00:03:44.650> is

all the buckles you want a ski boot is

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.460 
all the buckles you want a ski boot is
essentially<00:03:46.360> seal<00:03:46.600> off<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.989> shelf<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.440> that

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
essentially seal off the shelf so that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.590 
essentially seal off the shelf so that
no<00:03:47.739> moisture<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.519> smell<00:03:48.730> can<00:03:48.910> come<00:03:49.060> into<00:03:49.209> it

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
no moisture and smell can come into it

no moisture and smell can come into it
another<00:03:50.080> great<00:03:50.290> feature<00:03:50.350> about<00:03:50.739> this<00:03:51.040> liner

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
another great feature about this liner

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.059 
another great feature about this liner
is<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.790> you've<00:03:52.150> got<00:03:52.390> an<00:03:52.769> asymmetrical<00:03:53.769> heat

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
is that you've got an asymmetrical heat

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.220 
is that you've got an asymmetrical heat
mold<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.519> time<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.940> lot<00:03:55.360> of<00:03:55.480> companies<00:03:55.900> aren't

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
mold of time a lot of companies aren't

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.050 
mold of time a lot of companies aren't
making<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.680> heat<00:03:56.860> moldable<00:03:57.190> tongue<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.910> I

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
making a heat moldable tongue and I

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.970 
making a heat moldable tongue and I
think<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.660> really<00:03:59.170> key<00:03:59.380> feature<00:03:59.620> to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
think this is a really key feature to

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.340 
think this is a really key feature to
the<00:04:00.100> ski<00:04:00.310> boot<00:04:00.489> I'll<00:04:00.790> tell<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.090> why<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:02.290> is

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
the ski boot I'll tell you why this is

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.949 
the ski boot I'll tell you why this is
even<00:04:02.890> when<00:04:03.130> you're<00:04:03.280> skiing<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:04.209> transmission

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
even when you're skiing the transmission

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.840 
even when you're skiing the transmission
point<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.380> all<00:04:05.530> skiing<00:04:05.860> today<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.430> happens

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
point of all skiing today it happens

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.100 
point of all skiing today it happens
right<00:04:07.030> there<00:04:07.330> you're<00:04:07.720> pushing<00:04:08.079> on<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.380> time

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
right there you're pushing on that time

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.930 
right there you're pushing on that time
and<00:04:09.260> it's<00:04:09.410> creating<00:04:09.830> transmission<00:04:10.460> for<00:04:10.910> the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
and it's creating transmission for the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.030 
and it's creating transmission for the
group<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.330> bend<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.990> move<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.290> ski<00:04:12.530> laterally

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
group to bend and move the ski laterally

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.590 
group to bend and move the ski laterally
immediately<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:13.880> also<00:04:14.270> give<00:04:14.480> you

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
immediately and also give you

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.930 
immediately and also give you
biofeedback<00:04:15.230> by<00:04:16.010> having<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.430> thin<00:04:16.640> tongue

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
biofeedback by having a thin tongue

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.210 
biofeedback by having a thin tongue
you're<00:04:17.510> gonna<00:04:17.630> be<00:04:17.810> loved<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.200> feel<00:04:18.620> what's

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
you're gonna be loved to feel what's

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.800 
you're gonna be loved to feel what's
happening<00:04:19.280> off<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:19.910> front<00:04:20.180> of<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:20.330> ski<00:04:20.570> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
happening off the front of the ski and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.960 
happening off the front of the ski and
throughout<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.500> full<00:04:21.709> range<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.280> for<00:04:22.610> bodies

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
throughout the full range and for bodies

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.390 
throughout the full range and for bodies
so<00:04:23.840> there's<00:04:24.020> a<00:04:24.080> lot<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.290> performance<00:04:24.860> both

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
so there's a lot of performance both

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.250 
so there's a lot of performance both
into<00:04:25.670> this<00:04:25.820> even<00:04:26.270> for<00:04:26.510> the<00:04:26.600> average<00:04:26.780> skier

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
into this even for the average skier

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.440 
into this even for the average skier
actually<00:04:28.070> increase<00:04:28.550> their<00:04:28.700> ski<00:04:28.910> performance

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
actually increase their ski performance

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.110 
actually increase their ski performance
and<00:04:29.810> actually<00:04:30.170> ski<00:04:30.380> better<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.950> found<00:04:31.550> over<00:04:32.030> the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
and actually ski better I found over the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.610 
and actually ski better I found over the
years<00:04:32.330> I've<00:04:32.510> Steven<00:04:32.840> a<00:04:32.930> lot<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:33.230> great<00:04:33.380> boots

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
years I've Steven a lot of great boots

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.350 
years I've Steven a lot of great boots
