the player itself the controls are very
unique<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.540> player<00:00:48.900> that<00:00:49.199> has<00:00:49.680> these<00:00:49.860> two

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
unique on this player that has these two

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.490 
unique on this player that has these two
wheels<00:00:50.430> built<00:00:50.790> around<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.210> sides<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.750> which

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
wheels built around the sides here which

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.140 
wheels built around the sides here which
allows<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:52.979> roll<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> dance<00:00:53.699> around<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
allows it to roll and dance around it

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.210

also<00:00:54.300> lets<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:54.989> control<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.530> device<00:00:55.650> so<00:00:56.100> if

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
also lets you control the device so if

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.560 
also lets you control the device so if
you<00:00:56.309> push<00:00:56.519> it<00:00:56.640> forward<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.089> little<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.300> it'll

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you push it forward a little bit it'll

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.969 
you push it forward a little bit it'll
go<00:00:57.750> forward<00:00:58.080> through<00:00:58.260> tracks<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.769> push<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
go forward through tracks we push it

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.250 
go forward through tracks we push it
back<00:00:59.070> it'll<00:00:59.430> go<00:00:59.549> back<00:00:59.850> through<00:01:00.120> tracks<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:01.110> if

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
back it'll go back through tracks now if

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.200 
back it'll go back through tracks now if
you<00:01:01.350> tilt<00:01:01.650> it<00:01:01.830> one<00:01:02.430> way<00:01:02.580> or<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.729> other<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
you tilt it one way or the other it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
you tilt it one way or the other it
actually<00:01:03.510> has<00:01:03.659> g<00:01:04.049> sensor<00:01:04.320> technology<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.220> here

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
actually has g sensor technology in here

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.670 
actually has g sensor technology in here
so<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.850> sense<00:01:06.170> which<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.380> you're<00:01:07.530> holding

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
so it can sense which way you're holding

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.070 
so it can sense which way you're holding
it<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.729> changes<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.299> controls<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
it and this changes the controls on the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.660 
it and this changes the controls on the
device<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.320> also<00:01:10.770> causes<00:01:11.159> sound<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
device and also causes sound just to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.920 
device and also causes sound just to
come<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.150> speaker<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.690> when<00:01:12.810> you're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
come out of one speaker now when you're

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840 
come out of one speaker now when you're
holding<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.040> bottom<00:01:14.369> controls

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
holding it like this the bottom controls

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.820 
holding it like this the bottom controls
volume<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.510> then<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> top<00:01:16.260> skips<00:01:16.740> through

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
volume and then the top skips through

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
volume and then the top skips through
tracks<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.460> couple<00:01:18.150> other<00:01:18.330> controls<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
tracks a couple other controls that you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.270
