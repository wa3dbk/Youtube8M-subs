 most of the kids are my age 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.620
 not sure what 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.959
 They want to do it 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.610
 but I know that I am for the rest 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.610
 wants to make my life allet 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.920
 People say that I have no childhood 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.169
 would have 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.999
 but I think that's exactly what I am 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:23.220
 proper measure of childhood and ballet 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.220

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.220
 I would say that is articulate 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.690
 nice disgusting 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.980
 many people tell me i am abnormal 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.110
 because I am doing such strange things 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:51.900
 can make

 A nickname in school is Barbie 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.300
 probably because I am in all 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:03.850
 possible directions can bend 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.140
 pink standing and blond hair I have 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.210
 I'm just having fun with dancing 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.760
 but now it is so much 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.110
 more than that, I'm working on that 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.360
 to do a job once 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.860
 it's kind of me to me 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.180
 to express without talking 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.260
 my friends say why can you 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.520
 not for a day of dance lessons 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.410
 fail 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.630
 they understand me as disciplined 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.430
 older they do not see it as yours 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.110
 career or that we are so hard at it 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.560
 work because it is his goal in the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.560
 is life 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.199
 [Music] 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.030
 if she dances so well she is mine 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.420
 According to rebecca 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.760
 win whole 84 rebecca hausknecht 17 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:03:14.720

00:02:47.760 --> 00:03:29.710
 [Music] 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:29.710
 [Applause] 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.010
 how did it go, it really was 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.620
 bad 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.970
 well done you did not see it 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.500
 lacie saw it was awful 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.910
 if so hard now and then you are 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.020
 make a minute on the wave 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.790
 that's it 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.020
 where you are all the hard work however 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.670
 a've put either they have 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.500
 a ligament tear or a stress fracture 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.209
 and then they will be out for a year 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.430
 that can be crucial for one 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.019
 career therefore some dance too 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.120
 continue with injury what you do not do 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.060
 should 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.650
 [Music] 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.630
 So your body forces things to be done for 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.280
 which he did not do is really not 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.050
 everything is satisfaction is not healthy 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.989
 Certainly not if it's just up there 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.390
 would stay 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.589

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.589
 [Music] 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.600
 [Music] 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.900
 when you start dancing again 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.900
 you have the feeling it never happened 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.680
 [Music] 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.840
 that's an air gun that should be me 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:50.599
 I would rather not stop it and that is 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.740
 a beautiful foot hurts a lot and that he does 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.980
 when turning 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.510
 [Music] 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.250
 I have fun with the dancing loose 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.250
 but now it is so much 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.900
 more than that the people are not clear 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.460
 how difficult is it to be a dancer 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.800
 create 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.170
 children over the latter give their 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.580
 childhood 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.290
 it never has to press on lake 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.840
 you find your body to the last 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.640
 page 5 are had is the christian 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.960
 most important if you have to go on it 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.290
 Many men are connected to your dream 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.730
 think about not building what I would 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.110
 never thought that my son would become a dancer 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.390
 but I could not be more proud 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.540
 I was in Sierra Leon in West Africa 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.340
 become 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.470
 my parents were from the rebels 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.600
 It's a miracle that I shot 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.860
 I'm here at all, I believe 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.320
 a fairly normal life one 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.370
 nickname in school is gabi because 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.980
 I am in all possible directions 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.360
 can connect 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.840
 when people say that i have no childhood 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.520
 would have 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.050
 but I think that's exactly what I am 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.540
 proper measure of childhood and ballet 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.030
 how high they were up to high 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.520
 i am from colombia i work for 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.680
 my family my dream is it 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.680
 to become a professional ballet dancer 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.159
 so many dancers would like to be a career 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:14.360
 but very few make it 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.069
 at least 5,000 take part in the competition 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.379
 and then only a few 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.379
 a hundred to new york it was awful 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.770
 you get five minutes on stage 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.280
 and to prove why you have this chance 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.710
 would have 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.100
