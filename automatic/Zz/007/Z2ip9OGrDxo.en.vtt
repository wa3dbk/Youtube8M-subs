blades some of the helicopter going so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.610 
blades some of the helicopter going so
you<00:00:52.410> adjust<00:00:52.950> that<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.310> a<00:00:54.060> level<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.380> want

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
you adjust that to a level that you want

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.440 
you adjust that to a level that you want
to<00:00:55.800> start<00:00:56.160> with<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.890> then<00:00:59.270> inside<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
to start with and then inside the

to start with and then inside the
control<00:01:00.900> panel<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.010> two

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
control panel there are two

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.859 
control panel there are two
potentiometers<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.589> your<00:01:04.949> throttle<00:01:05.869> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
potentiometers here on your throttle and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.609 
potentiometers here on your throttle and
this<00:01:07.020> bottom<00:01:07.439> potentiometer<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:09.109> the<00:01:10.109> second

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this bottom potentiometer is the second

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.819 
this bottom potentiometer is the second
volume<00:01:10.829> control<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:12.149> helicopter<00:01:12.960> rotor

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
volume control for the helicopter rotor

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.669 
volume control for the helicopter rotor
blades<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.359> increase<00:01:15.570> give<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.499> more

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
blades so as you increase give it more

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.859 
blades so as you increase give it more
throttle<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.729> rotate<00:01:18.149> this<00:01:18.329> and<00:01:18.539> actually

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
throttle you rotate this and actually

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.469 
throttle you rotate this and actually
make<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> helicopter<00:01:19.740> blades<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:21.149> volume

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
make the helicopter blades the volume

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.160 
make the helicopter blades the volume
get<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:22.020> louder<00:01:22.549> then<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.899> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
get get louder then up here this is the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.639 
get get louder then up here this is the
speed<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.219> helicopter<00:01:26.880> blades<00:01:27.649> that

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
speed for your helicopter blades that

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.819 
speed for your helicopter blades that
potentiometer<00:01:29.549> goes<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:31.380> copter

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
potentiometer goes to the the copter

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.550 
potentiometer goes to the the copter
motor<00:01:32.100> board<00:01:32.729> over<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.289> have<00:01:34.530> your

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
motor board over here you have your
