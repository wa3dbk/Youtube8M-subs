00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello from paul milanesi in this small 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:13.969
 video sheet does an exercise concerning 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:19.140
 the money that takes inspiration from 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:23.519
 command technique 1 and the technique of 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.840
 access therefore are two philosophies that me 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.630
 they gave this much inspiration 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.670
 simple sometimes you go looking for things 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.539
 complex when it is necessary to do 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.440
 simple things 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.930
 a small exercise consisting of two 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.620
 points then the first is to imagine that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.780
 money arrives to welcome him money 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.000
 arrives and that you also help with 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.039
 hands let this money revi 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.770
 money you need 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.809
 you can also ask has one in mind 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.110
 very specific figure but simply 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.940
 open up so you can imagine a figure 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.710
 of de nava a quantity of money one 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.260
 form of energy something I have 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.409
 anyway something that money can 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.610
 bring you me like to think they come in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.780
 my life all the money I have 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.540
 need to meet my needs 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.549
 to settle the accounts for holidays 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.790
 but right now maybe I need 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.820
 of a specific amount so I guess 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.580
 that this you do that this energy of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 I can get money and arrivals 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.180
 help you see with a movement of the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 very simple hands there is to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.659
 complicate nothing to warn the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.140
 feeling that this money is already here 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.780
 another thing 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.009
 this is a technique that suggests the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.829
 one that is a command of a methodology 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.049
 personal development 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.720
 another very important thing is from the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.200
 Access technique is another methodology 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.759
 always of personal development is the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.100
 command one who knows if he is up 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.000
 internet are two beautiful 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.799
 and there are two books the first is I do you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.320
 to see that it is hidden under one's hand 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.940
 the universe of your love asaro orders 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.369
 and joy from which I did this 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.730
 very simple technique of athletes the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.220
 money in this movement that of 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.250
 instead of access it is taken from the book i 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.260
 money is not happiness now 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.600
 I don't remember the title but it is anyway 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.819
 a beautiful book that I look at you at 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.290
 fishing I 'm going to fish you are a 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.840
 moment of time I let you see it is 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.170
 this money is not a problem 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.880
 it's you 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.950
 also a beautiful book that talks about 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.269
 abundance of prosperity 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.720
 in this book healthy technique is a lot 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.900
 simple and the technique of imagining 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.380
 that the money comes from all the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.470
 directions based on how you imagine yourself 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.850
 that the money arrives for example on all 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.340
 imagine that the money only comes 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.459
 in front only from left to right is a 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.480
 specific message that the barrels explains 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.250
 but at the end of the year it is useful to 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.720
 imagine that they usually come from all 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.940
 the size and therefore the money that 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.700
 they come from the front from above from the left 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.670
 right behind from the bottom ie six 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.890
 surrounded by energy of prosperity ai 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.030
 all the money that so you will 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.260
 I'm behind 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.650
 logically I like to think that money 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.569
 my son also comes in honestly 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.659
 he entered honestly not now 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.890
 out in an honest and see that I have 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.920
 asked for some money, I use both 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.480
 it's a scandalous stuff anyway 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.159
 let's return to an exercise let's imagine that 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.810
 money comes from all directions 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:48.280
 then from front to left to right 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.760
 from above it is very simple 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.599
 then two small but simple exercises 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.079
 fantastic 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.090
 we can imagine the money that you 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.629
 you are open abundance and therefore quater 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.189
 in installments the money he needs 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:11.919
 let us remember that there are several points 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:15.479
 of view for example yogananda rather 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:20.259
 that other traditions recommend not 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:22.240
 do not place emphasis on luxury then 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.530
 have the luxury to me personally the 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.690
 luxury I'm not crazy I'm not 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.979
 fanatic of the use of the course but the thing 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.780
 what interests me is that there is 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.229
 the abundance of everything he has 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.909
 need 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.010
 if I want to afford a trip, I'll do it 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:40.449
 I can allow if there are any 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.770
 bills to pay but eliminates self 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.800
 lends is a condition of need 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.020
 create via what access to 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.889
 prosperity then first money exercise 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.570
 that prosperity comes in abundance to me 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.060
 I open I feel really open towards 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.550
 this condition 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.810
 second exercise between aces che 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.400
 is to imagine that money 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.289
 they come from all directions 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.289
 front from above from left to right 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.020
 behind and feeling like you're surrounded by 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.789
 abundance prosperity energy of 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.289
 wealth 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.360
 let us also remember another concept 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:20.889
 important to get rich you need 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:24.340
 feel rich and know that too 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:28.320
 being rich is not necessarily the case 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.240
 something your soul 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:34.630
 wants at all costs 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.680
 however a requirement is important 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.050
 essential to feel erratic teeth because 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.660
 it will be this inner richness that there is 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.700
 will lead to the manifestation of things 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.470
 positive in life so I recommend it 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.450
 enjoy these practice hips 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.490
 daily when you want me 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.490
 know what you think hello
