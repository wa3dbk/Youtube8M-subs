day approach is very different from what
I<00:03:11.739> hear<00:03:11.920> from<00:03:12.010> my<00:03:12.099> friends<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:13.269> what<00:03:13.659> they<00:03:13.750> do

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
I hear from my friends so what they do

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.300 
I hear from my friends so what they do
is<00:03:13.930> they<00:03:14.170> let<00:03:14.319> you<00:03:14.440> choose<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.799> photos<00:03:15.099> and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
after that they give you the honest

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.160 
after that they give you the honest
opinion<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.859> which<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:19.000> think<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.810> should<00:03:20.140> be

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
opinion so which I think it should be

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.899 
opinion so which I think it should be
the<00:03:20.319> right<00:03:20.590> way<00:03:20.709> because<00:03:20.859> once<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.670> start

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
the right way because once you start

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.369 
the right way because once you start
pushing<00:03:22.239> everybody<00:03:22.540> will<00:03:22.900> get<00:03:23.019> turned<00:03:23.290> off
