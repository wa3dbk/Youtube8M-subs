00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.010
 I'd tell them 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.010
 they had to do with the rest 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.329
 they were disturbed guests or suffered psychotic episode 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.059

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.059

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.880
 and this to the men of laja 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.949
 factors exploring those minds torture 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 while they were talking the cartoonist 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.109
 most of the characters in the book 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.139
 is based on data from mental patients that nobody knows 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.830
 could do 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.270

 laopinión com co mexico is not for less not 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.710
 live and that the guys who were crazy knew something that doctors and 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.180
 nurses ignored 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.520
 because they had activated their consciousness of the world 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
 the patients were left without any type 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.229
 the hospital treatments described by kiss and as group therapies 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.620
 they scandalized elector 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.700
 once again regular 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.930
 it would inconvenience and erase it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.860
 nurse race therapy 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.860
 I wanted to control dt instead of soothing bed 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.830
 I do not believe that a toy store of the eternal 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.920
 I do not think it's back to normal 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.460
 but better than her 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.330
 4 percent men 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.960
 although the gallants farther according to had reported that things should 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.280
 take my younger sister to the Argentine a pointer after 2012 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.650
 according to the plan and 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.650
 is not the same 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.530
 the ankle to work 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.880
 strong impact never before had fled 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.020
 all of spain 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.210
 they felt somewhat embarrassed 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.270
 it was as if he had suddenly said something that was real important triumph 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.799
 and how well formed by what criteria very childish shame 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.239
 she had forgotten that young black people do not have any commitment 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.869
 for the moment the same end 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.869
 I did not know if they meet with nico all 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.009
 he said 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.009

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.699
 there was puel party 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.069
 continuation in total 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:41.949
 it was time 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.889
 but he will not notice either 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.980
 with the handles folded for lack of use 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.899
 a facade of numerous states and the rusty bell in silence 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.420
 an old and useless model 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.420
 with a click here a little women 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.109
 the cuckoo's nest had a huge influence 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.819
 because god you 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.159
 uncle life 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.739
 amum basic distrust in the way that psychiatry has been doing 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.099
 used for the purposes of society 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.280
 more than for people 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.099
 as patients with mental illness 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.569
 47 wrote other treatments in the cuckoo's nest 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.569
 treatments that terrified to be pronounced 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.719
 electroshock therapy was widely introduced the 40s 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.719
 voltage applied directly through the brain 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.909
 Perez and effective for certain diseases such as depression 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.129
 acute 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.540
 the ratched nurse had its use as a control tool 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.540
 and discipline 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.259
 you have not had the pleasure 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.629
 the supply 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.760
 it's an experience that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.760
 a human being 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.180
 one night that here is told that he asked a friend to apply the 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.809
 room 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.809
 I wanted to directly experience what I would try to describe 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:24.689
 you pay for the service with brain cells instead of money 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240
 we all have millions of brain cells 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.830
 that area more 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.830
 the highest 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.659
 as if the shake set in motion a good week and a half 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:45.599
 of taking images emotions and memories to turn the man around 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.569
 said marin 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.069
 palm 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.240
 scratching at the feet of a hospitalization early sixties and we explain 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.039
 why it impressed me not so much 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.150
 because that a few times 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.999
 they were employed especially at that time 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.999
 as a treatment for agitated depressions 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.340
 acted more quickly than drugs then acted more quickly than 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.469
 dv drugs 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.599
 I was apprehensive 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.460
 the brain is too delicate 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.479
 there is too much mystery to be messing with him 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.440
 in the '60s someone flew over the cuckoo's nest 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.430
 contributed a 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.430
 national action against the system of large public hospitals 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.860
 From morning to night 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.440
 to the mentally ill 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.249
 they were recognized more rights 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:38.249
 and the hospital population and began to sharply decline 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.219
 the book goes on sale in 1962 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.249
 in 64 'I was in denver 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.709
 trying to reduce the number of patients in hospitals 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:51.089
 psychiatric 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.089
 firmly convinced with kiss and 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.210
 that if we managed to close the hospitals if we kept out the 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:59.629
 sick 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.439
 it would be achieved will be sanity 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:05.439
 many of us believed in that 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.479
 books such as the cuckoo's nest and the public furor they aroused contributed to 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.580
 depopulate state hospitals 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.469
 and if you see something more important yet 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.639
 a development that caused the direct impact on treatment of 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.129
 mental diseases 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.710
 roasted what is how they are like this 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.759
 steel azín 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.800
 they had side effects but it turned out 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.490
 so that patients could be treated outside the hospital asylum 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.490
 hospitalization would stop being for life 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.150
 they could go home 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.719
 psychiatric hospitals are relatively new institutions because 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:50.119
 they were first created at the end of the 18th century 

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:53.300
 - some of the most effective treatments to take care of certain 

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:54.809
 mental diseases 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.809
 more details on our return 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:01.659
 a child now 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:04.689
 the 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:07.149
 swim 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:11.020
 as an art space 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.069
 we are presenting a new episode of the great books series 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:18.380
 today with someone flew over the American cuckoo's nest next to it 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:22.580
 this work that takes place in a psychiatric institution at the beginning 

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:25.599
 of the 70s served to draw attention to the form and 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:29.930
 also unleashed a great controversy 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.669
 around the audience 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:34.759
 cool votes new projects 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.219
 meanwhile font min 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:40.219
 it's worth saying for a long time back 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.270
 people sometimes as a fugitive 

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.119
 were included from 

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:50.789
 the document leaves the voice for 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:51.569
 for being suspended
