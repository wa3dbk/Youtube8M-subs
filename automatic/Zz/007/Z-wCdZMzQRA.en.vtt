exploit<00:00:28.109> from<00:00:28.410> mill<00:00:28.740> warm<00:00:29.660> now<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.170> all

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
exploit from mill warm now as we all

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.170 
exploit from mill warm now as we all
know<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.710> middle<00:00:32.009> mill<00:00:32.430> foam<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.759> nothing

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
know that middle mill foam is nothing

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.440 
know that middle mill foam is nothing
but<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.390> big<00:00:33.630> bank<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.200> exploit<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:36.149> just

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
but a big bank of exploit so I'm just

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.900 
but a big bank of exploit so I'm just
going<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.960> random<00:00:37.380> exploit<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.100> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
going for a random exploit and this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.619 
going for a random exploit and this
exploit<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.750> copper<00:00:40.050> mine<00:00:40.320> photo<00:00:40.620> gallery

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
exploit is of copper mine photo gallery

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.200 
exploit is of copper mine photo gallery
it<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> remote<00:00:43.230> exploit<00:00:43.710> which<00:00:44.219> exploits

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it is a remote exploit which exploits

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.420 
it is a remote exploit which exploits
Coppermine<00:00:45.989> photo<00:00:46.260> gallery<00:00:46.710> slower<00:00:47.129> than

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
Coppermine photo gallery slower than

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
Coppermine photo gallery slower than
version<00:00:48.410> 1.4<00:00:49.410> point<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:51.600> let's<00:00:51.989> just

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
version 1.4 point to two so let's just

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
version 1.4 point to two so let's just
copy<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:55.399> paste<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.640> somewhere<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
copy this and paste it somewhere on a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.270 
copy this and paste it somewhere on a
desktop<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.440> some<00:00:59.100> file<00:00:59.399> call<00:00:59.850> let<00:01:00.719> us<00:01:00.870> say

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
desktop in some file call let us say

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
desktop in some file call let us say
exploit<00:01:04.250> dot<00:01:05.479> txt<00:01:08.090> we<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.420> naming<00:01:10.080> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
exploit dot txt we are just naming it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.280 
exploit dot txt we are just naming it
exploit<00:01:10.650> dot<00:01:10.920> txt<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.640> time<00:01:11.850> being<00:01:12.140> after<00:01:13.140> we

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
exploit dot txt for time being after we

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
exploit dot txt for time being after we
have<00:01:13.380> copied<00:01:13.830> our<00:01:13.950> content<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.939> file

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
have copied our content into this file

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.890 
have copied our content into this file
we<00:01:15.810> will<00:01:15.869> rename<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.560> exploit<00:01:17.100> dot<00:01:17.460> PL<00:01:17.900> so

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
we will rename it to exploit dot PL so

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.070 
we will rename it to exploit dot PL so
let's<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.650> wait<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.280> notepad<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> open

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
let's just wait for this notepad to open

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.450 
let's just wait for this notepad to open
I'm<00:01:22.080> sorry<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.650> windows<00:01:23.040> box<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.549> kind<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.880> slow

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.700 

all<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.060> done<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.530> we

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
all right we are done and now all we

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.620 
all right we are done and now all we
need<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.280> rename<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.000> file<00:01:33.270> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
need to do is rename this file to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.630 
need to do is rename this file to
exploit<00:01:34.229> dot<00:01:34.560> PL

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.090 

now<00:01:40.640> let's<00:01:41.060> just<00:01:41.330> copy<00:01:41.630> this<00:01:41.930> file<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.590> paste

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
now let's just copy this file and paste

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.789 
now let's just copy this file and paste
it<00:01:43.369> where<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:43.939> have<00:01:43.970> installer<00:01:44.720> active<00:01:45.530> Perl

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
it where we have installer active Perl

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:58.450 
it where we have installer active Perl
interpreter<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:54.380> D<00:01:55.420> semicolon<00:01:56.420> /<00:01:56.720> po<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:58.310> I'll

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
interpreter in D semicolon / po so I'll

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.969 
interpreter in D semicolon / po so I'll
just<00:01:58.700> open<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:59.119> location<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:02.740> paste<00:02:03.740> my

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
just open this location and paste my

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:12.340 
just open this location and paste my

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
exploit script into this folder all

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:21.640 
exploit script into this folder all
right<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:13.069> done

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.530 

now<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.849> run<00:02:23.060> expel<00:02:23.750> exploit<00:02:25.180> first<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.360> need

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
now to run expel exploit first you need

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.059 
now to run expel exploit first you need
to<00:02:26.659> fire<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.170> your<00:02:27.200> command<00:02:28.099> prompt

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.039 

now<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.700> need<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.090> over<00:02:35.629> onto<00:02:36.079> your<00:02:38.049> location

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
now you need to over onto your location

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.890 
now you need to over onto your location
where<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.560> have<00:02:39.590> installed<00:02:40.040> active<00:02:40.879> ball<00:02:41.150> for

the pad or file name to your perl script
since<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.560> my<00:02:54.829> case<00:02:55.099> this<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.400> exploit<00:02:55.939> PL<00:02:56.540> so

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
since in my case this is exploit PL so

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.830 
since in my case this is exploit PL so
I'll<00:02:57.230> just<00:02:57.620> give<00:02:57.859> it<00:02:57.980> its<00:02:58.099> name<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.549> hit<00:02:59.299> enter

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
I'll just give it its name and hit enter

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.660 
I'll just give it its name and hit enter
