00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.420
 good hello to all dear friends e 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.630
 friends of those who call dot it 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 today we are in the company of iphone 5s 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.050
 32gb unlocked with Syria on board because 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.650
 because I want to show you the five 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.610
 best tweak for the jailbreak of 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.100
 this iphone 5s the why has me 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.560
 really convinced to go and unlock 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.570
 my device to go to insert 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.540
 of implementations that really are 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.120
 really very very beautiful we go to 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.830
 unlock our device immediately 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.740
 let's go into the settings to go to 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.810
 see the best tweak then the first one 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.080
 best tweak surely what 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.330
 the more it made me want to go to 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.040
 jailbreak is virtual home 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.110
 through the forums 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.920
 we will have a home button as it says 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.229
 exactly the virtual 9 or ci 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.990
 will be those implementations that mine 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.510
 notice apple had to insert especially 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 a fundamental one when we have the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.450
 phone locked to unlock it a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640
 iphone 5 s not jab rich we have to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.140
 press the home button and go to put 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 our touch 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.659
 heidi through the pronoun i don't try 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 no special key and device is 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.159
 unlocked or I don't have to do two stages 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.640
 to go and unlock my device 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.479
 this is one of the wonderful features 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.370
 as for virtue or if I make a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.510
 double tap 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.299
 as you can see I have not seen 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.890
 crushed in a physical way so not 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.890
 I made a double tap in a physical way 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.799
 but only pressed twice by touching the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.799
 touch and my device has crashed 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.780
 the double tap must be very fast 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.599
 then support them 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.340
 as you can see look also at that 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.420
 multitasking treat 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.549
 just hold my thumb 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.520
 how can we see all this comes 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:23.950
 done without any hardware intervention 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.130
 of my thumb so I will never go 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.500
 more press twice to press one 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.630
 time to go to unlock the device 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.410
 but it will be enough to support my imprint 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.760
 digital to restart everything 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.980
 then virtual on 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.730
 definitely one of those tweaks that su 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.560
 iphone 5 s can't miss it in a fashion 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.470
 therefore we are the first versions 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.660
 imagine what this birtolo deserves 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.540
 between air in a future within the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.630
 your iphone 5s 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.970
 flip control center is another tweak that 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.130
 it must not be missing inside yours 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.250
 iphone 55 s4 in short, what was missing at 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.760
 our iphone a notification center e 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.440
 with toggles enlarged through flick 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.010
 control center we could easily 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.720
 going to expand all the toggles to 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.000
 various default settings and we have 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.760
 two fi we have bluetooth and but not 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.350
 we have for example the quarrels and or the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.240
 spot is going to make a respring 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.209
 within your of our device 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.540
 then years through flip control 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.030
 center surely we will find gods 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.940
 benefits for these 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.670
 quick toggles a bit like they used to 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.180
 it happened with 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.810
 his famous tweak ios 6 and yes of 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:54.160
 settings through sprin handbags 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.280
 novero idem setting 7 we have others 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.260
 very very important functions 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.060
 we could go to settle it wasn't done 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.530
 parallax or for example as I have 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.770
 let me go to animate the animation 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.840
 as for the folders then the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.569
 the various folders as you can see me 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.819
 I raised that background that I didn't 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.560
 it didn't excite me very much and I didn't 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.540
 put any kind of background so as to 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.720
 going to stand out even more 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:25.270
 the basic background so very much 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:29.680
 useful and convenient spingo settings others 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.240
 really lots of features 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.240
 example we could go to change a 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.590
 text regarding the lockscreen 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.150
 go to set the notification center 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.280
 change wallpaper just go to 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.440
 set all the control center with 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.930
 all the effects the transparencies e 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.410
 so through this tweak you can 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.250
 really make really beautiful beautiful things 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:58.030
 graphically seeing another tweak 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.820
 very very important is no shadow of 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.190
 doubt killer one of the best tweaks 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.160
 products regarding this ajo 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.650
 s7 what is done through hit man 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.690
 meanwhile multitasking opens up and then 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.630
 as you can see we can go to 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.720
 close an application window 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:21.070
 open through a very animation 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.530
 very pretty if not we go to press 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.800
 on the home screen as you can see here 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.490
 on the left I will go to close all the 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.950
 app except because this is something that 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.560
 I noticed it does not close at 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.060
 example cydia and music but it must be closed 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.190
 manually 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.979
 nothing I saw that sometimes there 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.990
 we are dealing with even 100 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.669
 open applications so this is 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.310
 very very comfortable 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.690
 the last tweet 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.660
 this is really essential 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.930
 graphically and not because it has functions 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.520
 spectacular and zeppelins through wedges 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.490
 we will be able to go to select the logo 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.860
 operators as you can see here or the 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:06.470
 apple logo and then also wanting a text 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:10.740
 when we go to open for example one 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:12.840
 an app that allows the use of the 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.240
 text change now in this case 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.450
 it seems to me that the only change of the 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.610
 third, wait until I show you 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.440
 was written on whatsapp ok now not 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.910
 the name changes to me, perhaps because it is not 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.530
 I set it more 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.840
 however if we go to zeppelin 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.400
 we have all the various logos we can 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.000
 also don't put anything as you can 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.610
 the symbol of the apple has disappeared 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.750
 and we can go and put a carrier 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.690
 text 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.220
 I save now let's see if 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.610
 reopening an application 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.230
 ok i don't get written because before 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.230
 It worked now no longer functions 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.970
 however definitely try it too 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.660
 because it works I tried it before 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.600
 so there are no problems whatsoever 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.350
 in going to show okay now not 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.540
 it opens patience anyway if we go in 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.790
 jazz ing we put the logo of the apple 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.550
 here it is that appears quietly 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.320
 Perhaps it had to be done respring 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.060
 clearly in this video I did not put 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.750
 the various tweaks, for example to files 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.300
 activator that I installed 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.370
 however I think that by default I don't have 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.070
 put the tweak regarding 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:26.460
 burrell in short to the files all those tweaks 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:29.010
 who normally the breaker e 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.680
 he knows very well what we're talking about 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.080
 because I chose five tweaks and targeted e 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.650
 absolutely well made for yours 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:40.850
 iphone 5 if in this case well loved 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.510
 friends I remember to follow us on the site 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.820

 the twitter account to which they call us 15 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.500
 you can clearly find everywhere not 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:55.410
 I 'm not even my links because now 

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:58.230
 I think that after over 10 thousand subscribers e 

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.080
 thank you so much you really will be 

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:02.810
 already used to looking 

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:07.599
 on the various social media I still remember those 

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.599
 who call a greeting from wells 86
