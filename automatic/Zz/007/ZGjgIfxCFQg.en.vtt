00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.150
 0 Miss Grisel project implies that they have 10 and a little peace and 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.049
 tranquility 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.159
 buzzi 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:18.079
 they say that I must confess and that they were putting the wick on me and I have heard 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.439
 that it is possible that you leave us tomorrow 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.380
 yes 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.069
 there is even the possibility let me founder not priority issues 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:27.619
 and only one point 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.989
 obviously not 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.519
 all said he becomes something not 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.939
 the only thing that scares me is to forget all lived here 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.560
 all the elephants carriages and walkers to those who lit up 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.560
 and the kind brain and his wife 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.460
 many people a farewell gift 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.820
 concluding you will forget nbc what makes you from what before independently 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.240
 the way you take without the title 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.370
 thank you, prison lady 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.530
 now I am not afraid of what the future holds 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.080
 today my hair 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.170
 min 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.460
 It has never happened again I went back to raise the pipes better 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.020
 the happened 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.960
 then he was on court 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.840
 the accidents 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 it's not you 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.870
 Following this action 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.130
 the shooting star there is no doubt crowley 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.840
 if this is this 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.490
 that are falling from the sky to apply for the job of the lighthouse 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.490
 possibilities we have the eaves 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 a knife away 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.530
 camps has explained what I had forgotten I am a head of herring 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.120
 anyway 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.570
 the medicine in a place a little more interesting 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.400
 it's happening 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 I can not understand it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.120
 and without time 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.310
 the more fortunate than with 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.139
 silence 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.029
 and the very same stupidity on earth 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.689
 and who competed 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:14.919
 many more gifts 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.419
 are you serious 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.419
 the children one does not forget is what should attend 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.359
 but tucumÃ¡n 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.359
 come to all your thoughts and ideas 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.249
 where they possess that way 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.479
 that's a wonderful thing 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:34.069
 because to live 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.209
 the only joys that are worthwhile are those that can be shared 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.069
 just one thing 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.829
 and is that in Quito of the year Kelly 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.090
 the agreement is produced 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.630
 they have somewhat outdated ideas so it makes me have to wait until 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.790
 someone has some candles inside you 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 and is that magic 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.769
 I hope that does not mean I wait too long 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.709
 good luck old lighthouse 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.299
 In Venezuela 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.839
 No doubt 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:10.089
 This has been the weirdest night of my life but at least I am not afraid of 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.089
 what the future holds 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.779
 added that the next morning 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.219
 the cid and took us to the old lantern a year 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.429
 to know 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.699
 jaua 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:56.269
 now spouses child how wonderful it would be to see a real elephant 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.379
 the old room was sad for the Chilean and his wife 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.369
 because the magic gift of the shooting star 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:07.679
 it meant who could imagine the elephants as if I were in front 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.169
 we are very old we could not take such a long trip 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.470
 but without candles lit inside 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.099
 they thought he could not teach his friends what he could do 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:28.050
 no matter what they put at least we have each other 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.999
 and our dear old lantern 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.789
 the old series was not right 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.879
 he and his wife never traveled to africa 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.930
 this junk jaume is here good 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.930
 maybe the metal is worth something 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.199
 a dnu 2010 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.199
 with the purpose of doing with him 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.509
 just like Miss Grisel I promised 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.509
 never forgot who you are 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.350
 maybe this inspires me to write new problems 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.229
 Christ 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:21.800
 nor did he forget the old man came and his wife 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:25.499
 who gave him so much 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.029
 in the cities and as I now had one of her decide inside 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.770
 the gift of the shooting star rose 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.520
 both be carried out 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.860
 all your thoughts ideas and memories 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.460
 they passed the heart beat the young poets 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.029
 Who was going to say it 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.990
 the best exponential increase the ong 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.310
 a decades-old bluff occupies the place where the old man was 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.210
 But he does not care 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.430
 because you are happy helping people like me 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.020
 to tell full stories 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.259
 and colorin colorado this young 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:07.610
