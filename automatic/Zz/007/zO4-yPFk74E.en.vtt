we go to the other end of the spectrum
which<00:00:40.520> is<00:00:40.550> cabinetry<00:00:41.149> which<00:00:41.329> is<00:00:41.420> much<00:00:41.570> more

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
which is cabinetry which is much more

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.810 
which is cabinetry which is much more
about<00:00:41.960> machines<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.530> production<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.190> kind

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
about machines and production and kind

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.970 
about machines and production and kind
of<00:00:43.910> everything<00:00:44.269> in<00:00:44.390> between<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:45.109> what<00:00:45.949> I

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
of everything in between so the what I

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.410 
of everything in between so the what I
hope<00:00:46.280> that<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.550> students<00:00:46.910> come<00:00:47.030> away<00:00:47.210> from

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
hope that the students come away from

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.790 
hope that the students come away from
the<00:00:47.510> class<00:00:47.719> with<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.289> think<00:00:48.469> that<00:00:48.620> they<00:00:48.739> do

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
the class with and I think that they do

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.709 
the class with and I think that they do
is<00:00:49.219> their<00:00:49.609> hand<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:50.059> kind<00:00:50.269> of<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.390> lot<00:00:50.600> of

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
is their hand in kind of a lot of

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.509 
is their hand in kind of a lot of
different<00:00:51.019> parts<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:52.129> world<00:00:52.309> of

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
different parts of the world of

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.549 
different parts of the world of
woodworking<00:00:52.850> which<00:00:53.090> is<00:00:53.210> huge<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:54.440> they

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
woodworking which is huge and that they

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.079 
woodworking which is huge and that they
can<00:00:54.739> pick<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.039> choose<00:00:55.339> from<00:00:55.399> where<00:00:55.760> they<00:00:55.879> go

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
can pick and choose from where they go
