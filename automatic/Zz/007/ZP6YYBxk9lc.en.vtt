00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
in full color but I don't think they're

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.580 
in full color but I don't think they're
ever<00:05:40.330> gonna<00:05:40.570> release<00:05:40.870> it<00:05:40.900> in<00:05:41.110> full<00:05:41.260> color<00:05:41.500> I

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
ever gonna release it in full color I

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.100 
ever gonna release it in full color I
could<00:05:41.710> be<00:05:41.980> wrong<00:05:42.160> but<00:05:42.460> I<00:05:43.330> doubt<00:05:43.480> though<00:05:43.840> I've

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
could be wrong but I doubt though I've

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.100 
could be wrong but I doubt though I've
got<00:05:44.290> at<00:05:44.440> least<00:05:44.470> in<00:05:44.740> full<00:05:44.980> color<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:46.150> correct<00:05:46.900> me

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
got at least in full color I correct me

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.630 
got at least in full color I correct me
if<00:05:47.200> I'm<00:05:47.350> wrong<00:05:47.380> on<00:05:47.770> this<00:05:47.950> but<00:05:48.010> I<00:05:48.160> believe<00:05:48.490> the

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
if I'm wrong on this but I believe the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.300 
if I'm wrong on this but I believe the
only<00:05:49.150> show<00:05:49.870> they've<00:05:50.110> ever<00:05:50.380> released<00:05:50.920> in<00:05:51.130> full

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
only show they've ever released in full

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.690 
only show they've ever released in full
color

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
color

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.160 
color
as<00:05:52.150> far<00:05:52.450> as<00:05:52.480> anime<00:05:52.930> goes<00:05:53.110> is<00:05:53.440> Dragonball<00:05:54.750> Z<00:05:55.750> the

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
as far as anime goes is Dragonball Z the

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.810 
as far as anime goes is Dragonball Z the
full<00:05:56.530> color<00:05:58.620> comics<00:05:59.620> I'm<00:05:59.950> not<00:06:00.220> sure<00:06:00.490> if<00:06:00.670> I'm

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
full color comics I'm not sure if I'm

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.910 
full color comics I'm not sure if I'm
right<00:06:01.000> on<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.330> or<00:06:01.480> not<00:06:01.630> I<00:06:01.900> would<00:06:02.650> love<00:06:02.800> to

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:02.920 
right on that or not I would love to

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.130 
right on that or not I would love to
find<00:06:03.070> out<00:06:03.250> that<00:06:03.490> bleach<00:06:03.940> or<00:06:04.330> one<00:06:04.870> of<00:06:04.990> my<00:06:05.080> other

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
find out that bleach or one of my other

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.130 
find out that bleach or one of my other
top<00:06:06.010> animes<00:06:06.580> was<00:06:07.240> released<00:06:07.600> in<00:06:07.780> full<00:06:07.930> color

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
top animes was released in full color

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.710 
top animes was released in full color
but<00:06:08.410> I<00:06:08.530> believe<00:06:08.860> Dragonball<00:06:09.310> Z<00:06:10.090> is<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.510> only

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
but I believe Dragonball Z is the only

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.570 
but I believe Dragonball Z is the only
one<00:06:11.020> right<00:06:11.230> now<00:06:11.380> and<00:06:11.590> they're<00:06:12.070> only<00:06:12.190> on<00:06:12.340> the

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
one right now and they're only on the

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.330 
one right now and they're only on the
second<00:06:12.940> volume<00:06:13.180> so<00:06:16.110> this<00:06:17.110> will<00:06:17.350> go<00:06:17.500> with<00:06:18.100> my

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
second volume so this will go with my

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.790 
second volume so this will go with my
other<00:06:18.460> sword<00:06:18.790> art<00:06:18.940> online<00:06:19.060> stuff<00:06:19.570> and<00:06:20.200> then
