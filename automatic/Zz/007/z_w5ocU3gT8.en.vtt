00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.810
 hi to all and welcome to this 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.610
 first number of the biggest bides of the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.500
 video game you know very 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.210
 certainly some consoles that did 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.750
 a failure like for example the jaguar 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.980
 atari 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.470
 but today we are going 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.090
 look at nintendo and yes because the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.440
 sad life has experienced two failures and 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.510
 especially the virtual boyle but 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.280
 today we are going to talk about the family 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.800
 disk system 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.239
 it's a failure we're going to say surrender 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.040
 matter of asserting you're going to see 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.620
 why in the report but before 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.480
 so let 's rediscover 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.650
 a little family coop family 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.180
 as of nintendo is the culmination 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.470
 strokes of genius of the firm well 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.400
 that she was initially a simple society 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.649
 playing cards 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.180
 she became in the space of 20 years 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.920
 a real war machine 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.239
 after sweeping the bet on the sector 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.010
 portable with the game and watch 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.479
 nintendo has put everything in competition with 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.640
 a powerful console and the most 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.740
 powerful at its revolutionary release 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.340
 emane game design is accessible in 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.740
 terms of price 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.270
 its success is exported worldwide except 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.310
 in europe where a company has followed a 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.350
 delay in distribution which will benefit 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.180
 the master system 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.009
 despite the neck and neck in Europe with 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.289
 these guys there family dominance 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.709
 as in the usa and japan is almost 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:29.590
 total you will see how nintendo 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:33.069
 had a real failure through 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.319
 figures and explanations report 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.060
 nintendo it's the firm that all the 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.850
 world knows with its consoles like the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.350
 nes nintendo 64 the wii brief to each 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.910
 time is the solid cardboard even if he 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.860
 asserts are not necessarily sales 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.259
 exceptional a little long with the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.270
 Nintendo 64 or Nintendo Gamecube 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.459
 has always known how to make a profit but 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 the time with the nes mainly who 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.640
 meets an extraordinary success 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.380
 maintains a commercial policy 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.979
 with its partners equivalent to a 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.810
 dictatorship 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.270
 they are surrounded by all the editors 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.360
 third parties bound by a contract however very 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.210
 binding and very expensive 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.960
 Intel has saved intelligence games 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.640
 videos with rob the euro words especially the 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.640
 strollers the master of your adventures 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.630
 adventures of which you are the hero 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.780
 which exciting and full scenario 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.460
 of humor it would be time of play and 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.140
 for the first time in the world of cases 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.140
 this black year that records your 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.640
 results 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.470
 nintendo more of the more diligent man 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.030
 and fun not a step in the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.610
 manufacturing of young people escape the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.070
 nintendo firm could decide everything 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.900
 the content of the programming the design 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.880
 of the box the price of the game the number of 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.310
 produced cartridges set a limit 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.320
 maximum number of parent licenses were 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.000
 rats short the control was total 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.470
 moreover the builder was the only one 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.300
 able to produce 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.460
 cartridges is therefore obliged milkman to 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.850
 resort to the exorbitant services of 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.220
 big n 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.170
 for the creation of said cartridges of 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.910
 his box and the development team of 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.040
 the nes in addition to paying royalties 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.440
 in order to obtain the famous seal of quality 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.540
 a jump that ultimately guaranteed is that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.280
 third-party publishers was fine to move on to 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.960
 the box 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.790
 this tyrannical policy was 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.350
 challenged that much later with 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.020
 the arrival of the megadrive and 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.570
 definitely with the playstation of 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.250
 sony at 8-bit time no console 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.320
 could not compete with the success of 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.700
 famicom and for a third party publisher 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.010
 produce games on the fabulous 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.180
 nintendo console is the insurance of 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.240
 make important profits 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.920
 and it is only in 1985 that the master 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.459
 system will appear in the countries 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.740
 Japanese 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.170
 but at that moment it was too late 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.209
 Nintendo has won the prize 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.190
 and although the success was encountered in 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.959
 Europe and Brazil are far from 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.370
 strategic continents as well 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.420
 for the manufacturers than for the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.459
 publishers 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.020
 but nintendo is far from satisfied 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.850
 of his monopoly plumber's firm 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.650
 think to have found a way to sink 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.450
 a little more the nail with a support 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.320
 that she thinks revolutionary gives her 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.940
 family disk system launched in 1986 in 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.830
 collaboration with sharp this is a 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.780
 floppy drive that we can 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.900
 place under the family as there is a 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.940
 cartridge called adapter rab the 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.739
 family disk system will be sold 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.350
 for 15000 yen and at the same time a 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.489
 console integrating everything is sold 32 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.319
 thousandths the twin women 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.940
 as at that time the floppy disk 

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:21.380
 has a big advantage over the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.940
 cheaper cartridge to produce 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.400
 having a backup system 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.410
 more efficient in terms of memory but 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.229
 especially the price of games very attractive 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.599
 barely 1600 yen for a floppy disk 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.130
 against 2000 for a floppy yard 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.960
 when the price of a cartridge and the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.000
 double or quadruple for some 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.520
 and especially the possibility to re - register 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.199
 at will with a game terminal disc 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.870
 freighter for a small fee of 5 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.970
 without being an innovative concept for big 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.680
 who does not hesitate to hammer 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.960
 Japanese televisions campaign 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.699
 advertising promising that this new 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.610
 support will allow the creation of 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:02.770
 new visual sound games and more 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:09.139
 content thanks to memory that hardly 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:13.400
 more because it could well there is we there 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:17.270
 waiting with my bike or a product like 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.000
 an enemy so does our work by 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.169
 loÃ¯c g camilla worse and yannick 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 boli is not bad but a problem is 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.710
 poses to Nintendo only to produce a game to 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.050
 both cartridge and diskette 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.909
 significantly increases the costs of 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.919
 development because it is not necessary 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.659
 penalize the players and so nintendo has 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.740
 planned to develop most of these 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.680
 games on both supports 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.539
 to overcome the constructor will tighten 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.610
 a little more the screw for the support 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.530
 disc is in securing half of 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.060
 copyright and charging more 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.130
 royalties to third-party publishers 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.500
 in addition to being English his supporters 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.330
 nintendo goes through contracts 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.500
 obliged developers to work on 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.719
 the support of your choice 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.780
 sometimes both to get the most 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:01.159
 of benefit a policy that is going 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.810
 cause a lot of anger among the 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.419
 third of which some fins their 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.130
 contract with bienne a present grumbling 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.530
 also in the stalls of the shops that 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.330
 complain about the place that ten9 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.580
 writer because he can only welcome a 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.110
 maximum of nine games and therefore 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.819
 it is necessary to have 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.469
 several terminals to offer all 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.230
 the games available to consumers 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:23.000
 moreover being able to reuse 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.130
 floppy will decrease the sale of 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.750
 cartridge games and thus impact on the 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.280
 turnover of resellers who do not 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.100
 earns almost nothing on games 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.230
 dematerialized and finally the time of 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.630
 loading was more or less long 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:39.050
 while they were almost nonexistent 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.670
 on the cartridge it's finally the 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.710
 cartridge that will get the better of his rival 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.510
 indeed the cartridge continues to evolve 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.520
 guys to electronic components of 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.590
 more and more performant and less and 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.690
 cheaper even to the floppy disk and a 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.220
 victim of hacking as well as 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.410
 many pirate copies circulate at 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.020
 Japan because of a very easy protection 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.460
 to finally bypass the arrival of zelda va 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.750
 amputate the diskette of his last 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.850
 asset thanks to the integration of a chip 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.830
 backup before using words 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.630
 pass this umpteenth feat is so 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.060
 awesome for nintendo who decides 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.040
 to market it globally and its 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.020
 new cartridge will end up 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.240
 gradually move away from the floppy disk 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.240
 but the latter will still be 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.810
 supported until 2003 the last fds 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.360
 will be puyo puyo volume 5 releases in 91 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.880
 in all it will have sold anyway 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.250
 4.4 million system families 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.440
 disc a semi failure for nintendo car 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.750
 laden was very popular with the Japanese and 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.880
 helped to strengthen the influenced of the 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.880
 builder in the land of the rising sun 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:57.790
 family like nintendo 

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.840
 the culmination of the genius blows of the 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:03.640
 firm although she was a departure her
