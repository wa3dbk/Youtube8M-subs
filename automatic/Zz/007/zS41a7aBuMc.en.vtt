actually only never had more than one
party<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.520> we've<00:01:44.640> only<00:01:44.790> had<00:01:45.090> six<00:01:45.329> people

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
on at a time and it's actually really

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.620 
on at a time and it's actually really
sad<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.930> um<00:01:49.430> we're<00:01:50.430> gonna<00:01:50.490> obviously<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.450> stuff

sad so um we're gonna obviously do stuff
about<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.200> basically<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.590> reason<00:01:53.189> we're

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
about that but basically we reason we're

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.620 
about that but basically we reason we're
winning<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.060> because<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.540> are

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
winning right now is because we are

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.139 
winning right now is because we are
getting<00:01:54.780> extremely<00:01:55.250> lucky<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.939> clans

that we were going up against are not
playing<00:01:58.979> now<00:01:59.610> sometimes<00:02:00.060> these<00:02:00.329> clans<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.719> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
playing now sometimes these clans have a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.209 
playing now sometimes these clans have a
party<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.110> five<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.469> Piper<00:02:01.740> later<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:02.040> night

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and ones couple things really fast but

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.270 
and ones couple things really fast but
yeah<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.020> we've<00:02:10.500> been<00:02:10.770> able<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.069> get<00:02:11.160> our

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
yeah so we've been able to get our

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.770 
yeah so we've been able to get our
swords<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.700> but<00:02:11.879> one<00:02:12.120> reason<00:02:12.390> we're<00:02:12.510> winning

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
swords up but one reason we're winning

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.290 
swords up but one reason we're winning
is<00:02:12.870> because

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
is because

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.810 
is because
we<00:02:13.450> have<00:02:13.990> been<00:02:14.140> honestly<00:02:14.560> really<00:02:15.220> really

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
we have been honestly really really

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.060 
we have been honestly really really
lucky<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.990> is<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.320> main<00:02:17.590> part<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:17.950> need

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
lucky so that is the main part you need

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.120 
lucky so that is the main part you need
to<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.550> really<00:02:19.030> good<00:02:19.150> participation

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
to have a really good participation

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.200 
to have a really good participation
otherwise<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.550> need<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.880> really<00:02:22.120> good

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
otherwise you need to have really good

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.080 
otherwise you need to have really good
luck<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:24.370> along<00:02:24.550> with<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:24.970> basically

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
luck but along with that so basically

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.150 
luck but along with that so basically
how<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.450> kind<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.750> works<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.170> what<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.040> usually

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
how it kind of works is what we usually

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.790 
how it kind of works is what we usually
do<00:02:27.370> from<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.610> start<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.210> we<00:02:28.660> go<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.470> guess

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
do from the start is we go for I guess

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.880 
do from the start is we go for I guess
the<00:02:30.520> smaller<00:02:31.060> seat<00:02:31.570> not<00:02:31.990> look<00:02:32.320> not<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.500> I

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the smaller seat not look not just I

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.980 
the smaller seat not look not just I
guess<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.190> smaller<00:02:33.460> CP<00:02:33.790> values<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.360> because

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
guess the smaller CP values but because

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.470 
guess the smaller CP values but because
they're<00:02:35.470> less<00:02:35.860> wins<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.400> cap<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.850> mean<00:02:37.330> like

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
they're less wins the cap I mean like

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.360 
they're less wins the cap I mean like
some<00:02:37.990> of<00:02:38.110> them<00:02:38.200> only<00:02:38.350> worth<00:02:38.560> 12<00:02:38.950> minutes<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.310> if

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
some of them only worth 12 minutes so if

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.610 
some of them only worth 12 minutes so if
you<00:02:39.460> have<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> full<00:02:39.760> party<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.060> 60<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.470> have

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
you have a full party of 60 if you have

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.350 
you have a full party of 60 if you have
you<00:02:41.950> have<00:02:42.040> all<00:02:42.220> 12<00:02:42.400> people<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:42.760> basic<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:43.180> one

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you have all 12 people on basic it's one

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.940 
you have all 12 people on basic it's one
win<00:02:43.720> for<00:02:43.870> each<00:02:43.930> party<00:02:44.350> you're<00:02:44.530> already<00:02:44.650> done

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
win for each party you're already done

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.980 
win for each party you're already done
but<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:46.030> usually<00:02:46.150> go<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.570> smaller<00:02:46.810> ones

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
but we usually go for the smaller ones

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.940 
but we usually go for the smaller ones
first<00:02:47.170> because<00:02:47.470> they're<00:02:47.590> usually<00:02:47.710> worth

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
first because they're usually worth

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.940 
first because they're usually worth
around<00:02:48.130> like<00:02:48.340> 12<00:02:48.940> 13<00:02:49.180> CP<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.530> bigger<00:02:50.770> one

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
around like 12 13 CP and the bigger one

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.070 
around like 12 13 CP and the bigger one
like<00:02:51.100> TDM<00:02:51.520> for<00:02:51.820> us<00:02:51.880> was<00:02:52.090> worth<00:02:52.240> 29<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:52.870> just

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
like TDM for us was worth 29 but just

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.510 
like TDM for us was worth 29 but just
because<00:02:53.170> haces<00:02:53.650> do<00:02:53.770> is<00:02:53.890> with<00:02:54.100> 12<00:02:54.340> members

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
because haces do is with 12 members

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.190 
because haces do is with 12 members
other<00:02:55.060> comes<00:02:55.390> with<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> lot<00:02:55.630> more<00:02:55.780> members<00:02:56.080> will

a<00:03:11.800> smaller<00:03:12.670> ones<00:03:12.970> first<00:03:13.240> and<00:03:13.510> got<00:03:14.050> those<00:03:14.290> and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
a smaller ones first and got those and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.720 
a smaller ones first and got those and
gonna<00:03:14.920> get<00:03:15.010> more<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.310> those<00:03:15.430> while<00:03:15.610> other

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
gonna get more of those while other

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.750 
gonna get more of those while other
clans<00:03:15.940> wasted<00:03:16.240> time<00:03:16.360> getting<00:03:16.600> a<00:03:16.630> 29<00:03:16.960> 1<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:18.310> uh

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
clans wasted time getting a 29 1 but uh

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.699 
clans wasted time getting a 29 1 but uh
I<00:03:19.239> mean<00:03:19.630> also<00:03:20.020> you<00:03:20.080> want<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.380> try<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.530> get<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
I mean also you want to try to get the

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.229 
I mean also you want to try to get the
bigger<00:03:20.890> want<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.160> because<00:03:21.430> how<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.760> does<00:03:21.940> work

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
bigger want to because how it does work

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.250 
bigger want to because how it does work
is<00:03:22.600> basically<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:24.580> longer<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.090> hold<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.720> got

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
is basically the longer you hold I got

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.229 
is basically the longer you hold I got
node<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:26.709> like<00:03:26.860> let's<00:03:27.040> say<00:03:27.130> we<00:03:27.280> hold<00:03:27.459> team

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
node so like let's say we hold team

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.270 
node so like let's say we hold team
deathmatch<00:03:28.720> for<00:03:29.350> like<00:03:29.440> three<00:03:29.770> days<00:03:29.800> the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
deathmatch for like three days the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.670 
deathmatch for like three days the
longer<00:03:30.580> you<00:03:30.610> hold<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.270> CP<00:03:31.690> value<00:03:32.050> rises<00:03:32.560> up

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
longer you hold it the CP value rises up

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.190 
longer you hold it the CP value rises up
and<00:03:32.980> up<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.280> up<00:03:33.400> too<00:03:33.580> long<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.940> hold<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.300> so<00:03:34.840> if

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
and up and up too long you hold it so if

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.199 
and up and up too long you hold it so if
you<00:03:35.470> hold<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.800> for<00:03:35.980> three<00:03:36.190> days<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.580> CP<00:03:36.910> value

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
you hold it for three days the CP value

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.790 
you hold it for three days the CP value
pibe<00:03:37.420> it's<00:03:37.630> like<00:03:37.810> 30<00:03:38.170> or<00:03:38.290> something<00:03:38.680> like<00:03:38.739> that

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
pibe it's like 30 or something like that

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.130 
pibe it's like 30 or something like that
and<00:03:38.950> be<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.160> massive<00:03:39.610> amount<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.750> mean<00:03:40.989> like

and be a massive amount and I mean like

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.260 
and be a massive amount and I mean like
select<00:03:41.650> from<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.860> very<00:03:42.010> start<00:03:42.070> all<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.910> CP

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
select from the very start all the CP

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.240 
select from the very start all the CP
values<00:03:43.660> for<00:03:43.870> all<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.050> ours<00:03:44.230> are<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:44.560> round<00:03:44.770> 13

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
values for all of ours are like round 13

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.640 
values for all of ours are like round 13
14<00:03:45.700> 15<00:03:45.820> 16<00:03:46.120> now<00:03:47.020> they're<00:03:47.200> all<00:03:47.290> worth<00:03:47.470> around

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
14 15 16 now they're all worth around

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.490 
14 15 16 now they're all worth around
20s<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.430> 30s<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:49.330> I<00:03:49.360> mean<00:03:49.660> really<00:03:49.989> any<00:03:50.230> clinic

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
and make a comeback on the last day if

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.460 
and make a comeback on the last day if
they<00:03:51.820> capture<00:03:52.000> every<00:03:52.420> single<00:03:52.480> thing<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:53.290> I

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
they capture every single thing and I

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.199 
they capture every single thing and I
want<00:03:53.739> also<00:03:54.340> with<00:03:54.489> that<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.820> longer<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.180> hold

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
want also with that the longer you hold

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.750 
want also with that the longer you hold
it<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.630> also<00:03:55.810> do<00:03:56.080> get<00:03:56.290> points<00:03:56.650> for<00:03:56.680> holding<00:03:57.100> so

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
it you also do get points for holding so

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.670 
it you also do get points for holding so
holding<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.360> for<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:58.780> certain<00:03:59.080> amount<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.290> what

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
holding it for a certain amount of what

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.900 
holding it for a certain amount of what
the<00:03:59.800> exact<00:04:00.070> time<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.370> still<00:04:00.520> holding<00:04:00.730> a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
the exact time is still holding a

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.940 
the exact time is still holding a
territory<00:04:01.840> network<00:04:02.230> whatever<00:04:02.709> you<00:04:02.800> want<00:04:02.830> to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
territory network whatever you want to

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.979 
territory network whatever you want to
call<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.390> longer<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:04.480> hold<00:04:04.660> it<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:04.870> actually

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
call it longer you hold it you actually

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.900 
call it longer you hold it you actually
get<00:04:05.320> additional<00:04:05.709> points<00:04:06.220> for<00:04:06.400> holding<00:04:06.760> that

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
get additional points for holding that

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.520 
get additional points for holding that
now<00:04:07.420> it's<00:04:07.600> not<00:04:07.720> like<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.870> bunch<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.200> points<00:04:08.320> it's

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
now it's not like a bunch of points it's

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.900 
now it's not like a bunch of points it's
just<00:04:08.680> like<00:04:08.770> 12<00:04:09.190> like<00:04:09.340> overnight<00:04:09.610> you'll<00:04:09.790> get

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
just like 12 like overnight you'll get

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.370 
just like 12 like overnight you'll get
like<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.209> few<00:04:10.600> points<00:04:10.840> if<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:10.989> hold<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.200> lot

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
like a few points if you hold a lot

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.350 
like a few points if you hold a lot
you'll<00:04:11.500> get<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> lot<00:04:11.830> of<00:04:11.860> points<00:04:12.130> for<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.360> so

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
you'll get a lot of points for that so

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.640 
you'll get a lot of points for that so
the<00:04:13.480> holding<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.019> does<00:04:14.170> be<00:04:14.320> you<00:04:14.410> extra<00:04:14.620> points

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
the holding it does be you extra points

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.070 
the holding it does be you extra points
but<00:04:15.430> also<00:04:15.580> brings<00:04:15.910> up<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.120> CP<00:04:16.480> value<00:04:16.780> as<00:04:16.900> well

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
but also brings up the CP value as well

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.080 
but also brings up the CP value as well
so<00:04:17.290> if<00:04:17.380> other<00:04:17.590> clans<00:04:17.769> take<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.100> down<00:04:18.280> then<00:04:18.910> they

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
so if other clans take it down then they

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.909 
so if other clans take it down then they
also<00:04:19.239> get<00:04:19.540> it<00:04:19.690> now<00:04:20.169> another<00:04:20.440> thing<00:04:20.530> about<00:04:20.799> that

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
also get it now another thing about that

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.890 
also get it now another thing about that
is<00:04:21.040> if<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.820> can<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.419> know<00:04:22.510> if<00:04:22.539> you<00:04:22.780> have

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
is if you can you know if you have

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.000 
is if you can you know if you have
obviously<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.380> know<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.530> have<00:04:23.710> more<00:04:23.860> members

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
obviously you know you have more members

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.380 
obviously you know you have more members
playing<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:24.490> other<00:04:24.640> clans<00:04:24.910> do<00:04:25.060> like<00:04:25.150> if<00:04:25.270> you

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
playing in other clans do like if you

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.280 
playing in other clans do like if you
have<00:04:25.539> all<00:04:25.780> 12<00:04:25.990> m

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
have all 12 m

deathmatch<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.970> they<00:04:34.030> don't<00:04:34.120> have<00:04:34.210> really

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
deathmatch and they don't have really

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.450 
deathmatch and they don't have really
any<00:04:34.720> already<00:04:35.410> he'll<00:04:35.530> only<00:04:36.040> have<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.250> couple

wins<00:04:36.820> or<00:04:36.970> any<00:04:37.090> 01<00:04:37.480> do<00:04:37.570> something<00:04:37.780> like<00:04:37.870> that

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
wins or any 01 do something like that

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.830 
wins or any 01 do something like that
honestly<00:04:39.640> I<00:04:39.700> would<00:04:39.940> let<00:04:40.090> them<00:04:40.210> neutralize<00:04:40.660> it

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
honestly I would let them neutralize it

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.820 
honestly I would let them neutralize it
that's<00:04:40.990> what<00:04:41.080> we<00:04:41.170> need<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:41.350> do<00:04:41.440> we<00:04:41.590> usually

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
that's what we need to do we usually

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.140 
that's what we need to do we usually
just<00:04:41.890> keep<00:04:42.220> going<00:04:42.490> for<00:04:42.640> something<00:04:42.790> else<00:04:43.030> at

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
just keep going for something else at

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.360 
just keep going for something else at
some<00:04:43.270> other<00:04:43.330> clans<00:04:44.050> have<00:04:44.260> so<00:04:44.950> for<00:04:45.280> example

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
some other clans have so for example

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.100 
some other clans have so for example
let's<00:04:45.700> say<00:04:45.910> our<00:04:46.060> team<00:04:46.390> deathmatch<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.900> being

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
let's say our team deathmatch is being

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.780 
let's say our team deathmatch is being
taken<00:04:47.380> down<00:04:47.500> by<00:04:47.770> another<00:04:47.920> client<00:04:48.100> with<00:04:48.250> seven

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
taken down by another client with seven

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.580 
taken down by another client with seven
members<00:04:49.030> playing<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.840> we<00:04:49.960> have<00:04:50.080> a<00:04:50.110> full<00:04:50.320> 12

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
members playing and we have a full 12

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.710 
members playing and we have a full 12
entries<00:04:50.740> on<00:04:51.010> and<00:04:51.250> we<00:04:52.060> were<00:04:52.150> going<00:04:52.360> for<00:04:52.390> search

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
entries on and we were going for search

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.970 
entries on and we were going for search
and<00:04:52.810> destroy<00:04:52.990> let's<00:04:53.350> say<00:04:53.500> that<00:04:53.770> was<00:04:53.860> like

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
and destroy let's say that was like

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.590 
and destroy let's say that was like
worked<00:04:54.520> like<00:04:54.670> 12<00:04:55.060> wins<00:04:55.270> or<00:04:55.360> something<00:04:55.540> like

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
worked like 12 wins or something like

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.200 
worked like 12 wins or something like
that<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.810> we<00:04:55.990> needed<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.700> we<00:04:57.700> didn't<00:04:57.970> hold

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
that that we needed and we didn't hold

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.820 
that that we needed and we didn't hold
it<00:04:58.330> so<00:04:58.420> we<00:04:58.540> wanted<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:58.810> take<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.200> down<00:04:59.350> take

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
it so we wanted to take that down take

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.650 
it so we wanted to take that down take
search<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.400> destroy<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:01.210> we<00:05:01.300> go<00:05:01.390> ahead<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:01.600> do

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
search and destroy so we go ahead and do

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.760 
search and destroy so we go ahead and do
that<00:05:01.720> by<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.050> time<00:05:02.200> we're<00:05:02.410> done<00:05:02.440> doing<00:05:02.680> that

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
that by the time we're done doing that

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.920 
that by the time we're done doing that

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
after they neutralize it and then go and

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.360 
after they neutralize it and then go and
recap<00:05:22.060> it<00:05:22.240> again<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.840> beat<00:05:23.260> them<00:05:23.440> to<00:05:23.650> it<00:05:23.680> so

recap it again and beat them to it so

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.440 
recap it again and beat them to it so
that's<00:05:24.520> what<00:05:24.640> we<00:05:24.700> usually<00:05:24.790> do<00:05:25.030> we<00:05:25.150> just<00:05:25.330> let

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
that's what we usually do we just let

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.430 
that's what we usually do we just let
them<00:05:25.540> take<00:05:25.690> it<00:05:25.810> down<00:05:25.960> if<00:05:25.990> we<00:05:26.230> have<00:05:26.320> more

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
them take it down if we have more

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.050 
them take it down if we have more
members<00:05:26.620> on<00:05:26.830> it<00:05:26.950> they<00:05:27.070> have<00:05:27.220> not<00:05:27.520> been<00:05:27.670> remade

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
members on it they have not been remade

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.210 
members on it they have not been remade
very<00:05:28.540> many<00:05:28.690> wins<00:05:28.870> on<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.140> we<00:05:29.530> can<00:05:29.560> come<00:05:29.830> back<00:05:29.980> on

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
very many wins on it we can come back on

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.040 
very many wins on it we can come back on
there<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.520> basically<00:05:30.670> take<00:05:31.180> let<00:05:31.900> them

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
there and basically take let them

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.690 
there and basically take let them
neutralize<00:05:32.410> it<00:05:32.590> for<00:05:32.800> us<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.130> then<00:05:33.250> take<00:05:33.550> it

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
neutralize it for us and then take it

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.430 
neutralize it for us and then take it
more<00:05:33.850> on<00:05:33.970> well<00:05:34.180> it's<00:05:34.300> just<00:05:34.450> all<00:05:34.570> so<00:05:34.930> we<00:05:35.200> do<00:05:35.320> that

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
more on well it's just all so we do that

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.630 
more on well it's just all so we do that
for<00:05:35.470> other<00:05:35.620> crimes<00:05:35.830> like<00:05:35.980> a<00:05:36.040> good<00:05:36.220> on<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.460> if

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
for other crimes like a good on you if

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.010 
for other crimes like a good on you if
we<00:05:36.730> don't<00:05:36.850> even<00:05:37.090> own<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.450> territory<00:05:37.840> like<00:05:37.900> I

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
we don't even own the territory like I

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.240 
we don't even own the territory like I
say<00:05:38.170> we<00:05:38.290> didn't<00:05:38.470> even<00:05:38.530> own<00:05:38.710> team<00:05:38.920> deathmatch

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
say we didn't even own team deathmatch

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.010 
say we didn't even own team deathmatch
we<00:05:39.730> also<00:05:39.910> can<00:05:40.210> go<00:05:40.330> for<00:05:40.510> other<00:05:40.630> things<00:05:40.900> like

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
we also can go for other things like

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.170 
we also can go for other things like
smaller<00:05:41.350> ones<00:05:41.620> while<00:05:42.220> we<00:05:42.310> let<00:05:42.520> other<00:05:42.760> clans

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
smaller ones while we let other clans

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.970 
smaller ones while we let other clans
neutralize<00:05:43.690> it<00:05:43.840> for<00:05:44.080> us<00:05:44.230> do<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.470> work<00:05:44.500> for<00:05:44.650> us

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
neutralize it for us do the work for us

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.950 
neutralize it for us do the work for us
so<00:05:45.490> then<00:05:45.640> we<00:05:45.730> end<00:05:45.850> up<00:05:45.910> capturing<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.660> smaller

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
so then we end up capturing the smaller

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.170 
so then we end up capturing the smaller
one<00:05:47.230> and<00:05:47.380> then<00:05:47.680> taking<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:48.700> capturing<00:05:49.060> a

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
one and then taking and capturing a

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.790 
one and then taking and capturing a
bigger<00:05:49.390> one<00:05:49.600> after<00:05:49.870> they<00:05:49.960> neutralized<00:05:50.410> for<00:05:50.680> us

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
bigger one after they neutralized for us
