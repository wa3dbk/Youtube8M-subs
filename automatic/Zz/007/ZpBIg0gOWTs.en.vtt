 cut I made of the iron man then 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
 You must have watched these two 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.550

 and soon the team can be another 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.109
 book 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.600
 on one side we also have one of the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.890
 characters more modinha sadc and the other 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.240
 We have one of the most 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.240
 marvel modinhas 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.490
 I'm going to tell you, it 's your job. 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.399
 The harder I've ever had a carnival 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 it does not have 100 percent accuracy 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.289
 What I'm going to tell you is not 100% 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.149
 I'll tell you when they use me. 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.979
 I came with the script to life the two 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.049
 with the ability of both attacks 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.479
 But that does not mean that what I 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.210
 talking here will be a winner in any 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.100
 in case the iron man who bass them 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.740
 are extremely strange professionals 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.959
 this was extremely similar or in the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.670
 version of tide or in the basic version 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.099
 same character we only have 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.740
 some peculiarities of each one that 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.560
 speak just one to beat the other man 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.789
 iron it has a much larger arsenal 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.280
 of what I hit rode 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.619
 it has the power to fire destructive power 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.530
 so where times take everything good from the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.079
 Batman get up if nothing is 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.899
 where they live there, the court in the 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.239
 However he does not fight for anything 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.310
 the neighborhood is very cautious is that I do not 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.260
 I'll tell you about the neighborhood with preparation coming 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.209
 cooperating this is not a rule that you 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.060
 are only you can afford not handle that 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.160
 but finally the batman to prepare for 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.160
 start let's put the two of the same 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.329
 online universe batman and loads 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.519
 also that the iron man is a 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.350
 obstacle because what I am in the state 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.930
 he makes no secret of hiding 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.700
 secret identity be also with batman 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.139
 is the largest of the kind in the world it has a 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.120
 from the tokyo satellite and 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.250
 any information he wants to 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.109
 strategic as I was going through 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.900
 things says your secret identity 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:44.970
 it is very easy for him to need 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.980
 the state on the other hand the driver 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.740
 this identity disorder secretes the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.170
 Because, because as I said in the video 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.690
 Batman is his top priority 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.680
 leave your secret identity in 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.990
 secret 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.550
 No one can know that my dream for 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.170
 this until you change both your 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.420
 personality when I was in a neighborhood 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.950
 and when he takes office fully 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.580
 different look like two people 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.550
 many different 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.830
 already the state took strength but here taking 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.710
 along this path that the bass with certainty 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.290
 absolute would know who the iron man is 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.700
 he was going to prepare for a possible with 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.260
 low against the iron man 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.930
 She said that he's going to work on time. 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.740
 of the fight not the male he is already a person 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.050
 cautious 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.020
 he is already prepared to fight with 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.910
 any hero or villain of the land because 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.520
 because he from the moment he 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.620
 have added that that person 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.959
 how to prepare and fight against 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.700
 Tony stark flying with an armor that 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.820
 came to instruct telstar amateurs 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.830
 because the neighborhood where I got to grip 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.350
 of the douro in one of the iron man but 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.230
 so he would build an armor look 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.850
 Maria a plan to win the whole state 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.670
 for example featured in china 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.620
 investing amateur announced but is not 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.750
 cheering in front of the project called 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.900
 from within your bones out into your 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.910
 body i know but tony stark design is 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.850
 called the owner has no life of his own 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.380
 in the book sense ayrton afif knows the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.600
 his body because the state has to 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.180
 would then activate if the iron man 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.950
 caught dancing unaware would not 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.930
 interactive time in amateur eg 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.540
 This is a very radical example where 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.609
 dominates poorly can kill in simple listening 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.260
 the ex-friends also of the power of armor 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.120
 of Iron Man and get hacked 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.010
 any computer or satellite in the world 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.450
 that it can block the computer from 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.850
 husband to whom to discover the identity 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.710
 Secret on the down can can is more 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.180
 Difficult than I think to find out 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.240
 there leave the iron man's beer 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.419
 much harder then so with socks 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.400
 even the batman has much more 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.750
 chance to win hell in the lives of 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.850
 12 is very 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.250
 it is more likely that baptism is already going 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.740
 be prepared in advance knowing that 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.750
 identity the tone starke than the state 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.620
 is prepared and know the identity of 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.170
 button 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.710
 then if the probability custom of 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.500
 year 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.840
 Batman wins Iron Man is 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.090
 but with this image he prepared a 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.980
 man guiding a robust people does not 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.140
 take a side represented by the fact that 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.240
 batman has a wife fit the people 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.670
 put the goal is only the second 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.310
 common bid that batman souza de assis 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.320
 maintains control of social justice 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.360
 iron man is going to take supplies and get 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.750
 someone who looks for the boots 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.670
 members fix a bat and 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.060
 one arm in the belly and one of s 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.800
 So yes, you have the same day. 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.450
 that the red neighborhood and other armor 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.270
 and iron man also has other 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.640
 female students that even their best is nice 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.650
 now there is another thing that also gives 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.440
 the right victory in the vatican 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.840
 It's just not to consider this video. 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.030
 Do not talk to your little friend 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.830
 earned fame because of that I'm going to talk 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.870
 Batman was part of exchange 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.240
 white lanterns I already have 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.060
 a video the troops already believe in the card 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.410
 who showed up here right now and watch 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.930
 also after the kiss for you to see 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.680
 It's ok, as it was part of the test. 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.390
 white 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.070
 through twitter the ring that has the 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.110
 power to create manipulate or destroy 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.690
 any drink then there are five batteries 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.700
 - God power then he easily 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.740
 could pay for the man's existence. 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.720
 iron is to manipulate the existence of 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.430
 iron man understood but yes of course 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.320
 that this is not a bubble in the bass 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.450
 this is just an exchange of flashlights in the 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.680
 hpv report of the denser night than 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.530
 beyond justice 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.530
 You used that, so it 's not to be considered. 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.600
 then warn the batman to play ball 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.970
 in my opinion, it earns 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.020
 his preparation for being the cautious guy 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.970
 and insightful 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.560
 so the man has a project is 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.440
 Of course you have a chance to win but with 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.400
 old batman probability you think 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.830

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.449
