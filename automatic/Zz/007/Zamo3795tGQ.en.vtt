was it haha alright and I'm gonna take

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.620 
was it haha alright and I'm gonna take
my<00:02:50.870> half<00:02:51.380> stone<00:02:51.590> blocks<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.819> shits<00:02:53.480> and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
my half stone blocks just for shits and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.430 
my half stone blocks just for shits and
giggles<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:54.049> guess<00:02:54.230> put<00:02:54.920> them<00:02:55.069> all<00:02:55.190> right<00:02:55.370> there

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
giggles I guess put them all right there

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.229 
giggles I guess put them all right there
make<00:02:57.440> sure<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:57.799> not<00:02:57.950> around<00:02:58.340> anything<00:02:58.760> would

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
make sure it's not around anything would

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.690 
make sure it's not around anything would
I<00:02:59.540> think<00:03:00.079> it's<00:03:00.200> like<00:03:00.410> within<00:03:00.859> two<00:03:01.100> blocks<00:03:01.370> of

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
I think it's like within two blocks of

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.530 
I think it's like within two blocks of
it<00:03:03.040> if<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.220> is<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.639> could<00:03:04.760> probably<00:03:04.910> put<00:03:05.209> stone

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
it if it is you could probably put stone

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.970 
it if it is you could probably put stone
in<00:03:05.750> between<00:03:06.079> it<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.440> don't<00:03:06.620> think<00:03:06.829> it'll

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
in between it and I don't think it'll

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.270 
in between it and I don't think it'll
burn<00:03:07.130> up<00:03:07.370> I'm<00:03:07.579> not<00:03:07.730> 100%<00:03:08.150> sure<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:12.280> and

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
burn up I'm not 100% sure on that and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.729 
burn up I'm not 100% sure on that and
what<00:03:13.880> you're<00:03:14.030> gonna<00:03:14.150> do<00:03:14.389> is<00:03:14.540> take<00:03:14.750> your<00:03:15.019> Flint
