00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
talking local now as far as the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.990 
talking local now as far as the
microphones<00:01:47.170> go<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:47.710> think<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.580> reason<00:01:48.760> they

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
microphones go I think the reason they

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.640 
microphones go I think the reason they
told<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.390> your<00:01:49.540> stock<00:01:49.780> Mike<00:01:50.080> sounds<00:01:50.440> better

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
told you your stock Mike sounds better

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.560 
told you your stock Mike sounds better
is<00:01:50.890> because<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.700> don't<00:01:51.880> understand<00:01:52.390> the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
is because you don't understand the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.940 
is because you don't understand the
noise<00:01:52.750> cancelling<00:01:53.380> feature<00:01:53.620> of<00:01:53.860> this

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
noise cancelling feature of this

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.920 
noise cancelling feature of this
microphone<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:55.150> let<00:01:55.300> me<00:01:55.390> show<00:01:55.540> you<00:01:55.570> what<00:01:55.840> the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
microphone so let me show you what the

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.470 
microphone so let me show you what the
difference<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.470> because<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:57.670> would<00:01:57.820> go<00:01:58.000> and

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
difference is because you would go and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.890 
difference is because you would go and
put<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.870> stock<00:01:59.110> my<00:01:59.350> kin<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.330> then<00:02:01.510> let's<00:02:01.720> say

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
put the stock my kin and then let's say

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.570 
put the stock my kin and then let's say

close you want this microphone they say
you're<00:02:51.070> too<00:02:51.220> loud<00:02:51.400> turn<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.820> mic<00:02:52.000> gain<00:02:52.180> down

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you're too loud turn the mic gain down

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.810 
you're too loud turn the mic gain down
but<00:02:53.140> do<00:02:53.350> not<00:02:53.560> separate<00:02:54.100> from<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.430> microphone

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
but do not separate from the microphone

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.560 
but do not separate from the microphone
stay<00:02:55.180> very<00:02:55.390> close<00:02:55.570> for<00:02:55.930> full<00:02:56.500> audio<00:02:56.860> spectrum

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
stay very close for full audio spectrum

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.670 
stay very close for full audio spectrum
so<00:02:58.570> if<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.840> get<00:02:59.019> really<00:02:59.170> close<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
so if I get really close to the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.380 
so if I get really close to the
microphone<00:02:59.920> one<00:03:00.489> two<00:03:00.700> three

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
microphone one two three

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.450
