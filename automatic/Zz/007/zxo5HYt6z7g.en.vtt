00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it'll kind of be gauged on how my

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.800 
it'll kind of be gauged on how my

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
condition is and you know how I'm

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.570 
condition is and you know how I'm
looking<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.740> far<00:02:05.010> as<00:02:05.100> running<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.520> down

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580
