and rumors for the galaxy a8 smartphone

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.499 
and rumors for the galaxy a8 smartphone
so<00:00:10.380> we<00:00:10.500> have<00:00:10.590> seen<00:00:10.769> three<00:00:11.040> galaxy<00:00:11.759> s3<00:00:12.150> smart

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
so we have seen three galaxy s3 smart

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.419 
so we have seen three galaxy s3 smart
phones<00:00:12.690> from<00:00:12.900> Samsung<00:00:12.960> which<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.769> galaxy<00:00:14.280> a3

the a5 and the a7 and now this is the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.109 
the a5 and the a7 and now this is the
successor<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> a7<00:00:20.100> which<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.430> called

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
traveling 615 Qualcomm which and which

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.520 
traveling 615 Qualcomm which and which
isn't<00:00:43.920> basically<00:00:44.550> an<00:00:44.610> upper<00:00:45.000> mid-range

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
isn't basically an upper mid-range

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
isn't basically an upper mid-range
processor<00:00:46.530> pretty<00:00:47.399> good<00:00:47.670> i've<00:00:47.850> tested<00:00:48.059> out<00:00:48.300> in

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
processor pretty good i've tested out in

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.180 
processor pretty good i've tested out in
terms<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.809> gaming<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> everything<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.039> is

other four cores are clocked at one
point<00:01:02.670> seven<00:01:02.850> years<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.270> yeah<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.780> has<00:01:04.260> this

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
point seven years so yeah it has this

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.969 
point seven years so yeah it has this
that<00:01:05.000> big.little<00:01:06.000> architecture<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that big.little architecture it is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.940 
that big.little architecture it is
pretty<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:09.450> likely<00:01:09.659> starting<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.229> 400

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
pretty good not likely starting in 400

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.920 
pretty good not likely starting in 400
or<00:01:11.100> 410<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:11.939> flop<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.570> terms<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
or 410 you know flop in terms of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.460 
or 410 you know flop in terms of
handling<00:01:13.799> hind<00:01:14.460> games<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:16.049> far<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
handling hind games and so as far as the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.190 
handling hind games and so as far as the
memory<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.860> concerned<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.520> galaxy<00:01:17.970> a8<00:01:18.200> is

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
memory is concerned the galaxy a8 is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
memory is concerned the galaxy a8 is
said<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.409> come<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.189> two<00:01:20.430> gigabyte<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.970> RAM

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
said to come with it two gigabyte of RAM

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.320 
said to come with it two gigabyte of RAM
I'm<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.320> sure<00:01:22.490> maybe<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:23.880> were<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
I'm not sure maybe they were going to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.570 
I'm not sure maybe they were going to
change<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.220> leak<00:01:26.430> at

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
change it you know it's just a leak at

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
change it you know it's just a leak at
the<00:01:26.700> moment<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.030> bikes<00:01:27.450> III<00:01:27.869> gotta<00:01:28.110> Ram

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the moment so bikes III gotta Ram

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.999 
the moment so bikes III gotta Ram
because<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> phablet<00:01:30.409> category<00:01:31.409> device

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
because it is a phablet category device

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.870 
because it is a phablet category device
so<00:01:32.430> probably<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> see<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.420> RAM<00:01:33.930> there

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
so probably going to see more RAM there

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.120 
so probably going to see more RAM there
so<00:01:35.880> 16<00:01:36.450> gigabyte<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.960> integrated<00:01:37.890> storage

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
so 16 gigabyte of integrated storage

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.690 
so 16 gigabyte of integrated storage
space<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.350> no<00:01:40.350> word<00:01:40.619> about<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.100> micro<00:01:41.400> SD

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
space and no word about the micro SD

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.920 
space and no word about the micro SD
card<00:01:42.060> slot<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.619> galaxy<00:01:44.270> s7<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> 5

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
card slot as the galaxy s7 and the a 5

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.760 
card slot as the galaxy s7 and the a 5
and<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.140> 3<00:01:46.439> has<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> yeah<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> will<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and a 3 has so yeah it will have that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.350 
and a 3 has so yeah it will have that
same<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.430> metallic<00:01:51.240> build<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.490> they<00:01:53.490> did<00:01:53.880> so

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
same all metallic build and they did so

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.260 
same all metallic build and they did so
they<00:01:54.390> haven't<00:01:54.960> talked<00:01:55.590> about<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.100> know

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
they haven't talked about you know

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.209 
they haven't talked about you know
anything<00:01:57.270> about<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.780> is-6<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.740> AAA<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
anything about the is-6 and the AAA and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.899 
anything about the is-6 and the AAA and
Andy<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> 9<00:02:00.500> probably<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:02.040> might<00:02:02.280> see<00:02:02.549> those

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
Andy a 9 probably we might see those

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.870 
Andy a 9 probably we might see those
also<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> future<00:02:04.100> with<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> galaxy<00:02:05.670> aid

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
also in the future with the galaxy aid

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.479 
also in the future with the galaxy aid
so<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.619> also<00:02:07.829> rumored<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so it is also rumored to have a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.020 
so it is also rumored to have a
thickness<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.599> five<00:02:10.050> point<00:02:10.440> nine

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
thickness of just five point nine
