00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.460
 and although much of Miami and Dade and 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.860
 Broward has remained under a sky 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.719
 Mostly sunny if there are some 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.730
 storms affecting lots of boyton 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.919
 and also from mouse mouth while 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.320
 so much that conditions start to 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:19.779
 change a bit and little by little I have them 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.779
 the details has returned thanks 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.410
 how about very good afternoon and good though 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 the atmospheric conditions in your 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 most were mostly stable 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.989
 if there was a downpour over the region 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.260
 from miami international airport and 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.120
 also currently over the county of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.580
 palm beach exactly affecting the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.460
 southern portion of boyton currently the 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.280
 atmospheric conditions have dissipated 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 the precipitations some fell like 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.879
 I was telling you about the airport 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.370
 International of Miami between 11 and 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.409
 one in the afternoon and already the conditions 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 they start to cloud a bit I'm not 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.870
 discarding a slight risk of downpours 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 starting this afternoon especially towards 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.530
 the region of miami county from the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.239
 wind has been a little different 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.039
 entering mostly from the west as well 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.560
 we have not felt a lot of humidity 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.200
 not these very sticky conditions like 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.910
 you can say but if we have felt a 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.190
 little heat the maximum temperature 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.720
 it reached about 89 degrees but it was made 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.369
 feel a little warmer as if 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.570
 we were jana the low rank of the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.160
 90 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.110
 Currently the cloudiness starts to 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.640
 increase and that's why we can 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.380
 have a slight risk of a downpour 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.360
 scattered going towards portions 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.520
 metropolitan to early hours 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.380
 tonight there is a front band if 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.300
 they heard a frontal band towards the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.070
 central portion of florida but this 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.170
 is dissipating so do not be happy 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.940
 much the good thing about all this is that there 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.740
 a high pressure system which 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.270
 begins to take the reins of our 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.250
 meteorological pattern and it will bring us 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.870
 very stable conditions for tomorrow 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.540
 Sunday so these are excellent 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.550
 news if you have already been tired 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.650
 of all these rains which we have 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.090
 had during not only the last 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.490
 weekends but also during 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.350
 much of this work week the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.900
 rains for tomorrow will be 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.750
 practically obsolete a bit of 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.340
 cloudiness at afternoon hours already but 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.470
 we can expect the conditions in 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.509
 yes they stay mostly stable in the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.640
 maritime forecast on the day was very 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.530
 pleasant for bobic sailors it 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.020
 he lost it and for tomorrow the wind 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.970
 it will continue light enough also the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.640
 wind tonight mostly from the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.130

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.140
 with a swell of up to 2 feet and the bay 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.300
 quite light in the forecast 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.830
 extended we will continue under conditions 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.230
 mostly stable for this Sunday 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.209
 while for Monday it increases a 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.319
 little the risk of downpours enters another 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.150
 time the greater wind 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.670
 it's the south and again we'll have 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.889
 pretty hot temperatures and for 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.230
 supposedly much more humidity along 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.510

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.790

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.239

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.189
