00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.280
 hello everyone is welcome on 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.179
 pink carpet 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.040
 today we find ourselves in a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.420
 cooking I know it's not common on 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.250
 this channel but I really wanted to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.990
 you make a custeau pink with charles 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.470
 today of the chain facing a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.850
 cooked 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.140
 we present a little bit explains 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.609
 what you do is what all the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.470
 world do not know you me I know 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.359
 so well it's been two years since 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.699
 youtube I challenge myself by doing 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.539
 marcum recipes the key case 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.189
 Ferrero super nutella this way 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.540
 a lot more fun would be easier 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.430
 and with healthy products that can be 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.500
 to do well to the soul and therefore easily 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.480
 so today I started a little 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760
 challenge I told myself why not 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.219
 go kitchen and make-up 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.840
 it is a challenge here and there so I had 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.030
 very want to make a little mixture of 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.350
 pink and white I had told myself that a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 blog it could be pretty good but 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.530
 packaging is a little difficult to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.870
 find so we're going to go on a balm to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 lips with flat packaging agree 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.379
 so I'd like to do something 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.660
 something like that I know it's a 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.170
 little bit complicated but I think you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.629
 can do it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.040
 remain to wade this spiral clan or else I 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.869
 you turn from this kitchen explains us 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.400
 what are you going to use to do this 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.170
 little guy it's really very 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 simple you see it will take 20 honey 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.100
 then from the base of a pure it will take 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.229
 a blush for the color you can take 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.640
 also food coloring if you 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 want to give a little more pep to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 the color then prom of the rose and we 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 we have road 13 and if you want 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.640
 find the whole list of ingredients 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.900
 will be on the blog 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.430
 blog will be time the info bar so 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.780
 do not hesitate to see them all then 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.850
 for the ingredients you can find everything 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.020
 in the supermarket that's what's good and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.729
 and then the recipe is really 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.250
 very very simple so you 'll start to 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.680
 take the pure petrolatum and you 'll come 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.300
 put twenty two teaspoons in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.650
 a bowl then we will put duels so 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.900
 you can choose a type of honey 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.280
 scented or not and at the honey level 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.380
 why did you choose this one and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.000
 our so I took a honey with aloe 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.890
 because my girlfriend told me that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.479
 it was very good for the hydration of 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.810
 the skin what is true now we're going 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.750
 give it a taste by adding a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.140
 little drop down so you see like that 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.330
 Feel how strong it feels the mixture 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.720
 strawberries tagada plus malabar more 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.730
 here we have to end it's hyper 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.590
 concentrated so next day just put a 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.500
 tiny little son of someone 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.670
 little net but in fact he said well 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.720
 that's true name be ok and once that 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.290
 these facts there we go so suddenly the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.140
 pigmentation 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.640
 Ok, you 'll do it 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.800
 listen yes I loose you lose you say it 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.350
 you tell me stop here it's about a 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.010
 half hour to coffee to stay for 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.910
 talk cooking 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.530
 according to m then you have to be careful 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.750
 because as the dye these liquids 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.400
 you go after that can change the texture 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.820
 so we're just going to put a little 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.830
 drop 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.700
 it's more huawei it's like that 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.140
 so now we made the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.250
 first color we said we 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.480
 was going to make a second one all 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.770
 little bit more clear to be able to do 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.000
 a nice palette a little bit like the 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.980
 early model simply 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.120
 so we will redo the same thing except 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.489
 that this time we'll put a little 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.670
 little less bluff I respect more the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.290
 proportions announced but half qr 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.670
 will put a little less blush and 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:16.250
 especially no dye this time 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.250
 for me wade is so thank you 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.770
 so now that charles did the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.630
 three colors what are we doing 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.860
 put some white too I still 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.760
 introduce you to the different little ones 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.410
 pots in which you can 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.490
 so put to several solutions either 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.590
 you can go buy some in 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.350
 small shops decor brico etc 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.480
 like this little battery compartment to 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.070
 which is really super convenient or so 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.540
 you can also ask your 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.430
 grandmother if she does not have elders 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.200
 potty boulez really cute 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.450
 I like the spirit a little vintage me 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.250
 I find it really super nice and the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.900
 last option is to recover in 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.610
 made taxes that you already had by 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.620
 example I take this one let's admit 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.990
 that the middle is fast you can very 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.230
 clean it really well when 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.030
 even 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.220
 and reuse it just that you 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.600
 avoids wasting and especially the 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.830
 packagings are usually very pretty 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.890
 we find it rather practical 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.160
 so with charles first we will do the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.740
 trio super simple raspberry tech and 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.920
 white then it's gone we see fill 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.000
 the little pot so the trick of qr hope 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.560
 that we do not touch being the fingers with 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.140
 it's still serious so we start 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.100
 by some colors the white yeah 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:24.270
 so you will take a quantity 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.190
 average mean rather my back is coming 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.900
 fill the pot or delicately is worth 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.420
 better go little by little you will use 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.950
 the beyond proud of their bonuses after I 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.120
 wanted it so now it's good 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.590
 I think we have the technique so we're going 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.700
 do last compartment for you 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.200
 simply explain so as 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.540
 you said before we take two 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.360
 spoons filled in so that 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.440
 it's still pretty fair enough 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.840
 still need to pay attention to 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.280
 quantities and when we get to the top it 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.560
 take another spoon 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.090
 uses the back and we read this so as to 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.080
 what really everything is very flat is 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.880
 rather clean 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.290
 so it's me who will do it then 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.020
 this time I take the spoon a 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.360
 simple blue plastic spoon 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.550
 and I'm going to try to slide the 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.880
 work of 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.200
 two pigs of charles and so after 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.110
 once it's done I take a 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.910
 cotton swab to clean the edges 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.560
 so just now that we have 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.210
 do what we do now 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.430
 we just see him put a little bit of 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.470
 time in the fridge a dozen or so 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.820
 minutes ok story it's okay 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.040
 in fact that it really takes a 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.610
 lip balm consistency and after 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.740
 I will test it 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.440
 how long is it and especially 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.900
 why can you keep it between 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.550
 a week and I want to say less 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.780
 a month or three weeks and after 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.120
 if you want to keep 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.580
 put them in the fridge and then when you 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.350
 need to use it you go out twenty 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.790
 ten minutes 20 minutes before and that 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.050
 it was homemade products there is 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.670
 not everything that is conservative and 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.200
 that's really products that 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.750
 are perishable so it's worth 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.490
 better avoid here to keep it too 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.390
 a long time and especially to expose it to the 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.860
 heat are already visually speaking 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.720
 I think it's pretty pretty it's not 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.240
 the same reasons but in any case that 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.140
 pretty colorful and I find that I 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.610
 find it pretty 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.980
 ok so crash test 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.450
 I mean precise anyway that your 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.960
 girlfriend tested it and it was good 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:17.340
 passed because I was scared no it was 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.500
 the air is that the test no no no 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.300
 not this level of taste in any case the 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.260
 room two sentences it is really there 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.670
 it is there it is the impression texture I 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.200
 think we really feel the base line 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.270
 and that's good because suddenly it's 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.090
 not dry at all so we feel that there 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.420
 hydrate and it is against 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.450
 color it's okay it's neither too much nor not enough 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.870
 and we took the most 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.640
 dark 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.740
 so I think after the two colors 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.550
 it will really do very little to my 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.170
 opinion on the lips 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.540
 good after you can always strengthen in 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.430
 using bath be a blush a little more 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.830
 dark is human little more than 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.820
 dyes and then good husband for 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.650
 to conclude christ we thought 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.990
 ben me I like the texture and 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.540
 especially the taste that I too want to 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.900
 eat it but hey I do not clear ok so 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.280
 that for over a year nounced bourgeois 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.930
