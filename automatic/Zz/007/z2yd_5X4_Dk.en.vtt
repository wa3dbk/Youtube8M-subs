way<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.840> knew<00:03:44.079> what<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.440> was<00:03:44.590> signing<00:03:44.739> up<00:03:44.980> for<00:03:45.040> and

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
way I knew what I was signing up for and

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.190 
way I knew what I was signing up for and
I<00:03:45.519> think<00:03:45.760> he<00:03:45.880> knew<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.150> same<00:03:46.329> so<00:03:46.660> once<00:03:47.049> you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
I think he knew the same so once you

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.140 
I think he knew the same so once you
realize<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.590> then<00:03:48.069> that's<00:03:48.579> half<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.790> battle

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
realize that then that's half the battle

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.250 
realize that then that's half the battle
because<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.450> think<00:03:49.510> sometimes<00:03:49.989> people<00:03:50.109> think

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
because I think sometimes people think

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.720 
because I think sometimes people think
things<00:03:50.859> are<00:03:50.980> gonna<00:03:51.069> change<00:03:51.340> when<00:03:51.489> they<00:03:51.579> get
