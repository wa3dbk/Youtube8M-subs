00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
problem with rock music and I think

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.790 
problem with rock music and I think
that's<00:03:00.150> where<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> tribute<00:03:00.870> band<00:03:01.140> comes<00:03:01.620> in

that's where the tribute band comes in

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.070 
that's where the tribute band comes in

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
in many ways tribute band is a kind of a

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.310 
in many ways tribute band is a kind of a
halfway<00:03:04.890> point<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.360> fact<00:03:06.660> what<00:03:06.930> probably

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
halfway point and in fact what probably

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.230 
halfway point and in fact what probably
will<00:03:07.560> end<00:03:07.740> up<00:03:07.860> happening<00:03:08.220> in<00:03:08.460> my<00:03:08.580> estimation

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
will end up happening in my estimation

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.510 
will end up happening in my estimation
is<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.900> groups<00:03:10.440> will<00:03:10.650> begin<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.100> form<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
is that groups will begin to form that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.950 
is that groups will begin to form that

this is the way I can see forward so for

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.010 
this is the way I can see forward so for
the<00:03:37.860> for<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.520> continuation<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.660> live

music<00:03:43.920> which<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.160> run<00:03:44.400> with<00:03:44.520> ironic<00:03:44.970> about<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
music which I run with ironic about it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.449 
music which I run with ironic about it
is<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.989> as<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.470> said<00:03:46.500> before<00:03:46.680> most<00:03:47.220> rock

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
is that as I said before most rock

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.660 
is that as I said before most rock
journalists<00:03:48.090> do<00:03:48.720> not<00:03:48.900> give<00:03:49.430> tribute<00:03:50.430> band

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670

musicians<00:03:51.180> very<00:03:51.450> much<00:03:51.690> respect<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.440> may

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
musicians very much respect but it may

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.400 
musicians very much respect but it may
turn<00:03:53.160> out<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.640> end<00:03:53.850> that<00:03:54.480> tribute<00:03:54.930> bands

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
turn out in the end that tribute bands

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.880 
turn out in the end that tribute bands
have<00:03:55.830> more<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.610> with<00:03:57.270> rocks<00:03:57.600> future<00:03:58.290> than
