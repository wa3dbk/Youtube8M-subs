quicker<00:01:44.450> you're<00:01:45.450> also<00:01:45.979> prone<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.009> more

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
quicker you're also prone to more

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.340 
quicker you're also prone to more
slippage<00:01:47.880> because<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.290> week<00:01:49.970> covers<00:01:50.970> here

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
slippage because as the week covers here

slippage because as the week covers here
you<00:01:52.350> sweat<00:01:52.829> because<00:01:53.399> you've<00:01:53.579> covered<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.119> and

you sweat because you've covered it and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.139 
you sweat because you've covered it and
it's<00:01:55.049> soft<00:01:55.350> around<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> edges<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it's soft around the edges and the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's soft around the edges and the
results<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> softness<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.579> rubbing

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
results of the softness is the rubbing

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.469 
results of the softness is the rubbing
wet<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> create<00:02:03.210> sleep<00:02:03.840> which<00:02:05.479> means

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
wet and you create sleep which means

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.639 
wet and you create sleep which means
you're<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.869> sitting<00:02:07.200> up<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.500> bit

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you're going to be sitting up a bit

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.559 
you're going to be sitting up a bit
longer<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.310> you're<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.300> paying

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
longer and you're going to be paying

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.650 
longer and you're going to be paying
more<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.649> bear<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.250> mind<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.120> that's<00:02:12.390> why

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
more so bear that in mind and that's why
