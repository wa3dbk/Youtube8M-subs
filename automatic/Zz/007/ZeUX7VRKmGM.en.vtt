for skate too we've really focused on
doubling<00:00:12.839> our<00:00:12.990> bag<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.230> tricks<00:00:13.410> getting<00:00:14.039> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
doubling our bag of tricks getting a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.100 
doubling our bag of tricks getting a
bunch<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.370> new<00:00:14.519> stuff<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> game<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.450> lot<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
bunch of new stuff in the game a lot of

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.840 
bunch of new stuff in the game a lot of
tricks<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.920> didn't<00:00:17.190> have<00:00:17.220> before<00:00:17.310> that

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
tricks that we didn't have before that

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.240 
tricks that we didn't have before that
we<00:00:17.940> knew<00:00:18.090> we<00:00:18.210> wanted<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:19.190> there's<00:00:20.190> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
we knew we wanted to get to there's a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.530 
we knew we wanted to get to there's a
lot<00:00:20.370> of<00:00:20.400> other<00:00:20.640> stuff<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.940> talk<00:00:21.180> about<00:00:21.240> but

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:21.540 
lot of other stuff to talk about but

lot of other stuff to talk about but
right<00:00:21.720> now<00:00:21.870> we<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.080> want<00:00:22.440> to<00:00:22.500> focus<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:23.150> how

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
right now we really want to focus on how

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.580 
right now we really want to focus on how
we<00:00:24.180> doubled<00:00:24.630> our<00:00:24.690> bag<00:00:24.870> of<00:00:24.900> tricks<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.410> let's

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
we doubled our bag of tricks so let's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.410 
we doubled our bag of tricks so let's
take<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> look<00:00:25.980> at<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.550> new<00:00:26.700> test<00:00:26.940> is<00:00:27.090> doing

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
take a look at what new test is doing

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.350 
take a look at what new test is doing
big<00:00:28.170> thing<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.440> we<00:00:28.680> wanted<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.490> allow

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
big thing that we wanted to do is allow

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.510 
big thing that we wanted to do is allow
you<00:00:30.420> when<00:00:30.690> by<00:00:31.050> pushing<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.219> stuff<00:00:32.489> like

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you when by pushing to do stuff like

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.100 
you when by pushing to do stuff like
that<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.879> I'm<00:00:33.000> pushing<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> air<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that if I'm pushing the air I do a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.340 
that if I'm pushing the air I do a
one-foot<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:35.430> i<00:00:35.579> push<00:00:35.880> when<00:00:36.870> i'm<00:00:36.990> doing<00:00:37.230> an

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
one-foot if i push when i'm doing an

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.010 
one-foot if i push when i'm doing an
invert<00:00:37.770> i'm<00:00:38.490> doing<00:00:38.880> one<00:00:39.030> footed<00:00:39.300> invert<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
invert i'm doing one footed invert I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.190 
invert i'm doing one footed invert I
didn't<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.410> bonuses<00:00:41.010> by<00:00:41.130> pushing<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> take<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
didn't do bonuses by pushing so take a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.319 
didn't do bonuses by pushing so take a
look<00:00:43.470> in<00:00:43.800> let's<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.880> got<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
look in let's see what you got it you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.639 
look in let's see what you got it you
got<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.480> one-foot<00:00:47.120> got<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> foot<00:00:48.420> plant<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.500> he

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
got a one-foot got a foot plant so he

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.229 
got a one-foot got a foot plant so he
jumped<00:00:49.980> off<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.399> he's<00:00:50.640> got<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.820> foot<00:00:51.120> plant

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
jumped off there he's got a foot plant

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.330 
jumped off there he's got a foot plant
another<00:00:54.239> foot<00:00:54.570> plant<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> bail<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:56.130> that's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
another foot plant to bail so that's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.500 
another foot plant to bail so that's
really<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.850> wanted<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.239> make<00:00:57.480> sure

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
really what we wanted to do is make sure

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.030 
really what we wanted to do is make sure
that<00:00:57.720> you<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> variety<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.559> things<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:58.920> I'm

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
that you have a variety of things if I'm

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.370 
that you have a variety of things if I'm
in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.220> air<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.640> push<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.450> one<00:01:00.630> of<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.780> push

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
in the air I push my one of my push

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.130 
in the air I push my one of my push
buttons<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> new<00:01:03.239> trick<00:01:03.540> we

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
buttons I'm going to get a new trick we

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.390 
buttons I'm going to get a new trick we
got<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.409> invert<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.920> one-footed<00:01:05.549> invert<00:01:07.400> yeah

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
got an invert a one-footed invert yeah

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760 
got an invert a one-footed invert yeah
so<00:01:09.270> once<00:01:09.450> you're<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:09.870> in<00:01:09.900> bar<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.620> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
so once you're in you're in bar it's the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
so once you're in you're in bar it's the
same<00:01:10.950> as<00:01:11.010> last<00:01:11.190> time<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.790> skate<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.600> right

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
same as last time with skate the right

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.330 
same as last time with skate the right
stick<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.380> board<00:01:13.650> control<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.220> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
stick is your board control so if you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.740 
stick is your board control so if you
move<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> around<00:01:14.729> you'll<00:01:15.090> be<00:01:15.210> able<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.450> tweak

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
move it around you'll be able to tweak

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.440 
move it around you'll be able to tweak
tweak<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.530> invert<00:01:16.950> left-right<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> whole

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
tweak your invert left-right get a whole

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.820 
tweak your invert left-right get a whole
bunch<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.750> different<00:01:18.810> kinds<00:01:19.200> inverts<00:01:19.560> just

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
bunch of different kinds inverts just

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
bunch of different kinds inverts just
based<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.549> thing<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.479> skate<00:01:21.900> one

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
based on the one thing in skate one

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
based on the one thing in skate one
because<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.860> got<00:01:23.010> this<00:01:23.130> amazing<00:01:23.310> physics

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
because we got this amazing physics

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.420 
because we got this amazing physics
system<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.869> wanted<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> make<00:01:25.380> sure<00:01:25.440> that<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
system we wanted to make sure that you

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.030 
system we wanted to make sure that you
use<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.299> some<00:01:27.510> good<00:01:27.659> down<00:01:27.930> hills<00:01:28.200> but

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
use it we have some good down hills but

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.649 
use it we have some good down hills but
we<00:01:29.130> said<00:01:29.310> forget<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.760> we<00:01:29.970> want<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.390> bigger

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
we said forget it we want to make bigger

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.020 
we said forget it we want to make bigger
down<00:01:30.930> hills<00:01:31.200> where<00:01:31.979> we're<00:01:32.640> based<00:01:32.850> in

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
down hills where we're based in

Vancouver crazy mountains to we were
inspired<00:01:37.830> by<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> test<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
inspired by that so I'm the test is

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.320 
inspired by that so I'm the test is
starting<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> skate<00:01:40.350> down<00:01:40.670> Sam<00:01:41.670> down<00:01:41.909> mountain

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
starting to skate down Sam down mountain
