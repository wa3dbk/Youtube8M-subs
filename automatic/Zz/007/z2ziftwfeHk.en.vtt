00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.360
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.549
 Appeal videos on the map book in the book 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.799
 to the film on the way with through pistols 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.930
 such and so now only times to the beginning 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.460
 is not live commentary now because of me 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.580
 just wanted to have a nice one again 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.800
 play round relaxed and easy 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.450
 a little lava at what do you give 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.550
 I really have to tell him now 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.960
 pretty active on youtube i can 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.090
 now also slowly getting better here 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.950
 divide the time and so I do too 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.020
 a lot together with the good old fritz 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.790
 this is my buddy for all who are not 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.380
 Who that is that is my buddy 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.570
 and he lives on plus three houses of 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.460
 me away and there it offers itself 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.970
 just once together always like this 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.440
 few projects to keep up and running 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.239
 project I had this here 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.059
 Exercises videos made this eleven 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.950
 tasks which you had placed me he 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.770
 I always have to do 22 things 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.570
 I have already fulfilled eleven of them and that 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.730
 thing is going on so I have something extra 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.410
 I have chosen very very hard tasks 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.540
 Do not really want it that way now 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.620
 were also light tasks thereby 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.070
 was not so exciting for you now 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.580
 but I want you too 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.250
 offer something and is what I am there 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.500
 if I had not tried it flo 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.180
 drinking water so the choice between 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.890
 I would have chlorine water and mustard water 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.260
 Chlorine water taken but by both it 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.760
 tried 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.070
 old people never drink in the water 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.090
 is so disgusting that is so disgusting is me 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 do not want to say the chlorine water 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.500
 delicate yes but I do not understand it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 I can not do that at all 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.180
 imagine that mustard water is so disgusting 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.980
 that you have to puke so that's it 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.370
 and I am sorry that I have this yes 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:51.920
 what the freedom is 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.910
 I was looking for that yes 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.210
 have recorded and showed you 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.560
 but no pig believes me in 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.540
 my rubbish bin row are water 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 but it was really so disgusting to say it 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.210
 we use 10 percent water and 90 percent 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 that did not work 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:13.200
 Actually, I like that yes, yes, we are 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.550
 so now I am forced 22 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.890
 tasks and of which are the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.370
 first eleven done and the other eleven 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.170
 still have to come but the following 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.820
 problem is that now at the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.470
 remaining tasks which they are to me 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.660
 either personally something too easy 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.430
 or just I do not want one like that 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.900
 turn one-sided video that's me 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.790
 I do not want to eat eleven things now 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.980
 every day or so there was also a 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.120
 cool idea with donath and i close 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.550
 think that I imagine quite well 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.260
 Maybe I still do that myself 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.790
 would like to do something more difficult 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.300
 do not have to eat anything so 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.739
 otherwise you have been pretty creative so far 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.700
 a task that I celebrate the right 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.430
 I probably do too 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.200
 I'll call the cinema and go 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.820
 say yes I have a tripod there 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.480
 they can somehow forget me 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.400
 safely pack away or something until then 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.459
 I forgot my tripod in the room 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.989
 you filmed the movie that's one 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.070
 Good job I think I do 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.510
 but the thing is I have 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.060
 now maybe four to five 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.799
 very good for the second part 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.500
 So I'll give up another eleven 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.250
 meet soon 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.960
 Let's say one week to two 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.480
 weeks ago the video was about to come 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.160
 but I just miss a few creative 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.840
 The tasks now not only with what 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.610
 to eat or to do so 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.090
 yes and that's why I really would 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.090
 very happy if you join again 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.070
 little thought what can we do 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.709
 maybe celebrate gamer still do and 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.260
 times really bad tasks under again 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.550
 I write the video I know I believe 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.440
 That's the second or third 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.450
 video where I say yes writes tasks 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.150
 and really really pretty 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.360
 creative tasks what is good 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.440
 I had volunteered 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.640
 But I will not say how it ends 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.709
 because I do not want to tell you everything 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.390
 did you know this trend from the 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.010
 So the berner kasse is always the case 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.690
 disconnect what customer bought what 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.320
 and I tried so a bar 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.970
 to buy 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.350
 but I will not quite do it now 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.370
 just say how it went out 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.830
 and on the idea i am a game 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.300
 come because I fritz so that 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.519
 want to go shopping, said hague open 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.109
 are in both said yes okay 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.120
 I had such a hidden camera and was 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.890
 I'm pretty funny but I'll tell you 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.140
 Do not you like that went out I am 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.220
 I do not know if I still have that 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.510
 I do not know in what context 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.169
 not that we'll upload but 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.940
 Maybe someday it will be at the 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.800
 fw tasks again in between as an end 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.080
 as a bonus or so because me 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.729
 has passed again to the conclusion 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.640
 what i buy in my spare time or something 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.640
 seperate a shit well 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.130
 In any case, I must say these eleven 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.419
 tasks from the last video have 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.610
 We were actually made fun 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.750
 funny so end with maren who was 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.729
 then, finally, a bit easy 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.310
 mutilated but otherwise has 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.580
 actually pretty fun and was 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.190
 pretty cool but that further problem 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.970
 I 'm not going to fuck me in the ass 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.490
 push 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.139
 I have nothing in ashes you can 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.419
 do whatever you want me I am 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.820
 somehow in front of one of them so yes me 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.830
 would have had tasks but have nothing 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.440
 Hard in the ass I do not stand on it 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.240
 I can imagine that in front of her today 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.070
 have video on the internet where you guys are 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.389
 In the ass I push my that is 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.520
 now not solemn that is now 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.830
 just really disgusting I have so 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.090
 comments we currently have the 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.590
 Videos comments have been posted 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.530
 are 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:35.220
 I think 400 comments and easy 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.350
 100 comments are with any 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.520
 I taped that I nen 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.320
 To push ass, for example 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.419
 Handstand stands in the rocket in 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.760
 asch and read it from a distance so 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.229
 first a handstand I get back the 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.850
 is not so much the problem 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.660
 I would just have to tackle the wall 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.210
 or so but I what am I doing if that 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.680
 Rocket stuck and what to do 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.930
 me if my future employer 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.930
 looks like a rocket from Maras start 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:10.800

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.500
 is not possible 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:36.840

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.520
 accidents with rockets in the house yes me 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.460

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.050
 in front 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.560

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.150

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.860
