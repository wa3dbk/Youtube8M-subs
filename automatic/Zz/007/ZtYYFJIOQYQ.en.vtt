 the university's main focuses are education 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.210
 and religion to the latter also counts 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 study of religion

 Germany are known addition 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.989
 since 1999 the subject 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 Religious Studies in Erfurt both 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.909
 in the bachelor as main or secondary subject as 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.070
 also in the master are studied the 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.060
 Students are involved in this 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.890
 a variety of religious traditions 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.979
 You can choose from antique religion 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.929
 Judaism Islamic Studies as well as the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.080
 cultural history of the Latin and 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.119
 orthodox christian one 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.740
 the focus is on cultural history 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.890
 concrete European policy 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.450
 me and my research and the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.640
 courses with the religion of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.569
 ancient greece and the ancient 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.740
 but beyond that comes the 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.170
 religion of the whole ancient 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.180
 mediterranean in the view that is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.520
 also, for example, ancient Judaism 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.220
 or ancient christianity the early 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.530
 Christianity is involved 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.659
 we have a singular here in erfurt 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.850
 situation in which we have one 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.860
 Islam science has embedded them 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.180
 is in a bigger one 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.030
 religious context and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.170
 therefore we have the possibility 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.250
 Islamic cultural articulation 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.039
 to form 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.930
 I was with those of other religious ones 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.320
 to compare traditions 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.450
 that is certainly unique to the second 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.430
 Islam science is less here 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.220
 philologically classically oriented 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.570
 but first of all 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.739
 cultural science and that's just 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.739

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.420

 at any time on historical and religious 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.380
 texts fall back on the study 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.380
 of religious studies are necessary 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.490
