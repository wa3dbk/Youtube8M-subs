00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
usage kind of thing it's about thirty

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
when I was looking and another twenty or

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.530 
when I was looking and another twenty or
so<00:00:38.590> dollars<00:00:38.890> for<00:00:39.190> shipping<00:00:39.220> so<00:00:39.550> I<00:00:39.790> maybe<00:00:40.330> by

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
so dollars for shipping so I maybe by

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.790 
so dollars for shipping so I maybe by
the<00:00:40.600> time<00:00:40.840> you're<00:00:40.990> done<00:00:41.020> you've<00:00:41.230> spent<00:00:41.500> fifty

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
the time you're done you've spent fifty

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
the time you're done you've spent fifty
dollars<00:00:42.130> and<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.860> this<00:00:44.980> is<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.220> so<00:00:45.430> shotgun

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
dollars and and this is it so shotgun

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.910 
dollars and and this is it so shotgun
microphone<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:46.840> idea<00:00:47.170> is<00:00:47.320> it's<00:00:47.620> much<00:00:47.740> more

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
microphone the idea is it's much more

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.280 
microphone the idea is it's much more
sensitive<00:00:48.250> in<00:00:48.640> this<00:00:48.790> pointing<00:00:49.480> at<00:00:49.630> the<00:00:49.900> source

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
sensitive in this pointing at the source

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.600 
sensitive in this pointing at the source
direction<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.100> good<00:00:54.250> thing<00:00:54.370> about<00:00:54.430> that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
direction and the good thing about that

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.400 
direction and the good thing about that
then<00:00:55.090> is<00:00:55.300> that<00:00:55.420> it's<00:00:55.570> more<00:00:55.720> sensitive<00:00:55.900> to<00:00:56.380> what

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
then is that it's more sensitive to what

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.840 
then is that it's more sensitive to what
you're<00:00:56.710> really<00:00:56.950> trying<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.220> record<00:00:57.550> and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
you're really trying to record and

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.430 
you're really trying to record and
shouldn't<00:00:58.420> pick<00:00:58.600> up<00:00:58.750> a<00:00:58.870> lot<00:00:59.020> of<00:00:59.110> extraneous

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
shouldn't pick up a lot of extraneous

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.190 
shouldn't pick up a lot of extraneous
signal<00:01:00.370> extraneous<00:01:01.270> noises<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:01.870> things<00:01:01.960> like

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
signal extraneous noises and things like

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.530 
signal extraneous noises and things like
echoes<00:01:02.590> and<00:01:02.860> and<00:01:03.130> hissing<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.089> background

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
echoes and and hissing and background

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.240 
echoes and and hissing and background
noises<00:01:04.720> and<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.080> kind<00:01:05.290> of<00:01:05.320> thing<00:01:05.530> like<00:01:06.070> me

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
noises and that kind of thing like me

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.440 
noises and that kind of thing like me
rubbing<00:01:06.549> on<00:01:06.670> my<00:01:06.760> pants<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.210> kind<00:01:07.420> of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
rubbing on my pants and that kind of

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.929 
rubbing on my pants and that kind of
stuff<00:01:07.630> so<00:01:08.380> hopefully<00:01:09.189> the<00:01:09.399> sound<00:01:09.579> quality<00:01:09.909> is

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
stuff so hopefully the sound quality is

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:10.709 
stuff so hopefully the sound quality is
pretty<00:01:10.149> good

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
pretty good

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.630 
pretty good
takes<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.289> double-a<00:01:11.740> battery<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.159> it<00:01:12.250> by<00:01:12.579> the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
takes a double-a battery in it by the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.899 
takes a double-a battery in it by the
way<00:01:12.789> and<00:01:13.539> then<00:01:14.289> comes<00:01:14.979> with<00:01:15.159> some<00:01:15.399> some

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
way and then comes with some some

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.459 
way and then comes with some some
cabling<00:01:16.299> which<00:01:16.539> long<00:01:16.869> enough<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.140> put<00:01:17.289> on<00:01:17.380> that

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
cabling which long enough to put on that

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.520 
cabling which long enough to put on that
boom<00:01:17.649> or<00:01:17.859> something<00:01:18.189> and<00:01:18.630> plug<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:20.229> plug<00:01:20.259> it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
boom or something and plug to plug it

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.289 
boom or something and plug to plug it
into<00:01:20.679> a<00:01:20.829> DSLR<00:01:22.530> I'm<00:01:23.530> gonna<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:24.969> out<00:01:25.060> and

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
into a DSLR I'm gonna take it out and

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.120 
into a DSLR I'm gonna take it out and
put<00:01:25.810> it<00:01:25.929> back<00:01:26.020> on<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.289> camera<00:01:26.560> microphone<00:01:27.009> so

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
put it back on the camera microphone so

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.350 
put it back on the camera microphone so
you<00:01:27.189> get<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.399> before<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:27.789> after

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.150 

so<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:31.930> is<00:01:32.080> where<00:01:32.230> sounds<00:01:32.470> like<00:01:32.620> three<00:01:32.980> feet

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
so this is where sounds like three feet

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.860 
so this is where sounds like three feet
away<00:01:34.440> probably<00:01:35.440> quite<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.220> lot<00:01:36.400> less<00:01:36.870> distinct

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
away probably quite a lot less distinct

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.050 
away probably quite a lot less distinct
and<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:39.520> little<00:01:39.850> bit<00:01:39.940> more<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:41.350> then<00:01:42.100> many

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
and a little bit more and then many

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.760 
and a little bit more and then many
further<00:01:43.390> distance<00:01:43.810> -<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.200> just<00:01:44.320> gets<00:01:44.560> much

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
further distance - it just gets much

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.710 
further distance - it just gets much
much<00:01:44.980> worse<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.030> have<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.300> be<00:01:46.390> really

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
much worse so you have to be really

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.210 
much worse so you have to be really
within<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:47.020> few<00:01:47.200> feet<00:01:47.440> from<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.830> camera<00:01:48.010> to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
within a few feet from the camera to

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.300 
within a few feet from the camera to
pick<00:01:48.490> up<00:01:48.670> voice<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:49.890> mean<00:01:50.890> you'll<00:01:51.040> pick<00:01:51.220> up

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
pick up voice I mean you'll pick up

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.550 
pick up voice I mean you'll pick up
ambient<00:01:51.760> sounds<00:01:52.120> if<00:01:52.300> you're<00:01:52.480> a<00:01:52.510> hobby<00:01:53.380> or

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
ambient sounds if you're a hobby or

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.500 
ambient sounds if you're a hobby or
something<00:01:53.920> but<00:01:54.100> that's<00:01:54.580> not<00:01:54.730> necessarily

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
something but that's not necessarily

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.550 
something but that's not necessarily
what<00:01:55.600> you're<00:01:55.810> trying<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.020> pick<00:01:56.140> up<00:01:56.260> so

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
what you're trying to pick up so

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.630 
what you're trying to pick up so
hopefully<00:01:57.250> this<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.610> good<00:01:57.820> back<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.120> back

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.790
