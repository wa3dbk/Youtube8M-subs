00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.390
 a beautiful choir here 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:12.240
 isar angle for the canal zucchini 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.219
 technology and I may you right 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.789
 warmly welcome to another 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.880
 Review a little review I have before 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.550
 recently had an unboxing of this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.109
 nice device here from the super lux hd 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.359
 66 8 b and I already have one 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.210
 ask how the head gets in like that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.300
 that 's how I want to be in here now 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 answer this little review the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.579
 sawed her first you see her 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.379
 content there is the headphone view in it 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.930
 then there is a bag that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:52.530
 instructions for use 1 1 63 click 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:56.120
 adapter plug and there is a cable 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 clamp and there is once a cable with 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.430
 15 meters length 1 meter length and 1 x 3 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.409
 meter length i believe it in three meters 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.119
 I do not know exactly if that in three 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.200
 meter 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:14.610
 yes and the sounds are the headphones 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:19.409
 he sounds really good actually it is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.479
 So a half-open headphones is not 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.280
 of course that means the ears are closed 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.840
 relatively big, even my ears fit 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.610
 clean well they do not mean as great 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.530
 a half-open headphones that means 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.680
 that you also hear sounds from outside 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.970
 from outside perceives winzen 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.350
 Closed headphones would be then 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.299
 that so well isolated that he actually 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.439
 nothing is heard anymore or not much anymore 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.320
 It has almost nothing at all 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.920
 of your things your voice the music or 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.290
 anything else 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.240
 and here it is so you can still hear 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.729
 a little bit when you are out there behind you 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.670
 then one responds or hears then 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.170
 the luckily still discussed question 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.450
 the volume, of course, but in the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.110
 normal volume then uses normal 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.790
 you can hear that half open 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.590
 what else is there to say nice 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.270
 the sound pressure is 98 decibels 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.910
 maximum sound pressure or grenzfall 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.780
 made that decision clear 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:19.640
 the balance at 56 is the frequency range 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.780
 is between 10 and 30 thousand heart yes 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.940
 the weight maybe in the headphones 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.060
 without cable , the headphones are 222 grams 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.830
 G 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.910
 what about this headphones maybe 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.950
 something special you can do that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.989
 Earcups like you do not really 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.099
 take off or single that as well as the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.360
 head is big or small 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.239
 that does not work for 11 somehow 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.060
 The headband is supplied with patch and 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.540
 because somehow they are flexible 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.560
 and that is one exist the headband 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.940
 pad is called this this 2 the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.450
 You can see that I what course 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.280
 better 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.920
 This 2 patch theme above ever forms 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.810
 After how big the head is you are 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.849
 movable to move the even that the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.110
 the pad with 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:14.819
 this actually fits almost to 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:19.560
 every head so standard head so me 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.239
 I would like to say yes, I'm just thinking 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.760
 Yes, what else I say 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.170
 the sound is ok I think 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.450
 he dropped it to the heights though 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.430
 perhaps deceives even I can I 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.019
 stop and that is already easy 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.319
 were damaged by the loud music 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.670
 discotheques and yes I mean it too 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.670
 but still I'm missing is the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.200
 a little bit that sounds a bit 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.780
 dull I can compensate for that though 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.930
 not when i put the headphones on the tail 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.819
 fully connected from I have no 3 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.890
 Do not even tape eq at the control room 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.420
 no, a good guy 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.080
 So for me it sounds a bit stupid 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.689
 which is good what I really class 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.490
 find this is actually this cable 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:13.070
 Plug the headphone cables into the chambers 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.680
 and stake out the danger of 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.040
 You do not have to break a cable 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.150
 fear because when cable is broken 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:28.070
 then you just get new cable 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:31.280
 35 sound in flour and female connections 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.300
 in stereo of course you can still 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.170
 then pick what she can then 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:41.930
 everything works so well again 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.630
 but what bothers me are the earpads 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.050
 So this is the headphones is relative 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.310
 badly ventilated in warm weather me 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.010
 So she knows my turtle beach 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.140
 is not so blatant there is somehow too 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.290
 foam on it on the day 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.070
 earcups and and these too 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:06.110
 then also it ajar a halt 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.760
 gamer headset and there it is 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.270
 so warm it will be a bit 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.840
 Warn the headphones on this awesome 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.000
 lux around these petz on top of the head on the temple 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.780
 a bit too 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.760
 getting used to that expresses the beginning 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.380
 That kind of pushes that patch 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.030
 but you get used to it 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.220
 you play it after a short time 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.910
 not necessarily because you have a few 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.530
 times your headphones use this one 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.450
 this artificial leather 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.130
 which can be I know you can see the 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.590
 Replace I think even the chamber of 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.970
 1000 times if they are the ones now 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.770
 down 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.360
 but that's the problem with this relative 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.180
 poorly ventilated and through this 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.740
 Plastic through the imitation leather is true though 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.200
 feels soft though 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.460
 but it is somehow you are sweating 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.270
 including some only not so pleasant 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.020
 especially in summer when it's really hot 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.410
 then that's nothing at all 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.390
 So which of course I remember well 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.920
 Of course, that's the cable 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.420
 also supplied in three 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.740
 meter cable man if you are not that much 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.360
 Cable needs to be made one meter 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.940
 It takes a bit more to connect the cable to it 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.950
 cable then you just do that three meters 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.950
 cable my turn have a moment in the 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.630
 Meter cable because my mixa is the 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.710
 not so far away I do not need any 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.710
 three meters of cable 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.560
 but it has just stopped 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:30.080
 somewhere in the shelf on the shelf should now 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.550
 is loo yes there I was in mine 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.530
 movement restricted there I have to 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.449
 first free 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.639
 yes and that was it already for 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.139
 this short review more more probably more 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.180
 There is nothing at all together than in the 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.759
 headphone 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.590
 that was a good part of it was the 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.840
 price, of course, the price 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.910
 People for the price is natural 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:56.380
 excellent the thing costs 29 euro 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:07:00.280
 and that's the sound as well 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.539
 wear comfort is okay is also good and 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.639
 that has something to it of course 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.389
 Also great for 29 euros you can 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.169
 do not complain 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:11.300
 I can actually use the headphones 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.909
 unreservedly recommend to buy freely 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.099
 You can buy yours here, so to speak 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:18.919
 good dish is worth it for the price 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:19.940
 you can not go wrong so that 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:22.400
 it should have been 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.199
 I thank have me listen for the 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.550
 to watch for the pictures 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.050
 I hope I could give you a little bit 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.909
 help if you have questions as always in 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.440
 the comments thank you 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:32.150
 I'll say goodbye to both winners 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.560
 Here it was a wink for the channel 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.340
 zucchini technique 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.340
