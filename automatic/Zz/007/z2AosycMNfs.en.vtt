00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.500
 Hello everyone and welcome again to 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.450
 our YouTube channel this week 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.390
 taking advantage of the launch of the gtx 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.400
 760 we have the opportunity to count on 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.949
 a unit that we have compared with a 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.990
 graph of the previous generation in 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.509
 this occasion the chosen one has been the gtx 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.099
 660 so you can see all the 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.470
 potential of the new generation of 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.880
 nvidia continuing with the presentation 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.680
 of the latest generation of cards 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.020
 nvidia graphics this manufacturer 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.360
 completes its enthusiastic range with the gtx 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.550
 760 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.870
 in the absence of seeing the model t and by the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.730
 moment they have sent us a model 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.650
 the latter probably closed 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.840
 graphic is one of the most expected 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.320
 because of its high performance at a price 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.660
 more aesthetically adjusted is 760 ha 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.580
 increased its dimensions and with it 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.270
 has improved ventilation by mounting the 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.430
 wing force 3x of course riding in 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.960
 its interior the core of the 670 has 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.850
 with the need to increase 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.610
 of power so it incorporates two 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.610
 Connectors one of 8 and another of 6 pins 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.590
 this new graphic incorporates a gpu 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.530
 coming from the previous generation of 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.409
 nvidia specifically of the series 6 the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.049
 gpu chosen is the jec to 104 with a 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.230
 28 nanometer architecture and a total 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.480
 of 1,152 cuda corts 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.240
 the clock speeds range from 2 thousand 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.060
 85 megahertz by default reaching 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.950
 the 1150 in post mode the amount of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.090
 memory arrives in this case at 2 gb 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.740
 with a 256-bit interface its 13 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.740
 will be around 170 watts 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.700
 these are the specifications of the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.270
 two models of graphics used for this 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.270
 comparative 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.460
 the testing environment has been 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.260
 carefully chosen if it is true 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.310
 6 maybe missing the choice of 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.680
 a plate with PCI Express 3.0 port still 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.030
 well the performance results are not 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.030
 very different from those obtained 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.090
 the selected team is the pc with 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.930
 apocalypse with 17 38 20 socket 2011 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.599
 also it includes 16 GB of RAM to 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.409
 1866 megahertz and a hard disk ssd of 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.409
 128gb 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.780
 before going through the results of the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.600
 comparative we wanted to highlight the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.240
 software and games used these go 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.800
 from 3 de mar a jane in bali or full 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.660
 marc up to grid 2 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.660
 battlefield 3 or far cry 3 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.900
 for temperature monitoring 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.490
 the well-known monitor hardware has been used 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.130
 these are the results that have 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.690
 thrown the various tests as you see 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.030
 despite incorporating a system of 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.240
 3x wind force ventilation 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.150
 temperatures of the 760 are higher what 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.890
 they are both down as high performance in 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.180
 relation to the three graphs already 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.370
 appreciates a notable increase in 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.550
 performance that goes from 28 per 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.850
 hundred in a james haven up to 25% in 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.220
 the most extreme test of three subjects 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.890
 these results put the 760 at 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.550
 level of the 660 ti and even something by 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.550
 on top of her 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.180
 in the games section both graphs 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.490
 in conjunction with the team they offer a 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.870
 outstanding performance considering 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.210
 that we have used the maximum resolution 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.400
 supported and mode settings 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.400
 ultra varying only the resolution 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.440
 you can appreciate that the performance 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.840
 obtained at 760 is prominently 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.850
 superior what makes it a 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.100
 alternative to consider in face 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.460
 the renewal or new purchase of our 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.460
 graph 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.989
 7 cristian marked the beginning of the new 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.680
 range of nvidia graphics taking your 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.150
 graphic core to the gtx 780 despite 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.069
 the strong commitment to this new core 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.439
 those of santa clara have not taken it to 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.290
 the whole range of graphics have bet 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.450
 by Sheikh 104 from his 770 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.579
 replacing the sheikh to 102 that was used 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.560
 in the 660 the use of this graphic core 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.739
 has meant an increase in performance 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.739
 that puts 760 between 660 of iu 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.019
 and the 670 without reaching the results of 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.210
 the latter in the absence of confirmation 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.100
 the rumors that there will not be a 760t 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.690
 The truth is that the increase in 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.340
 performance with respect to the model of the 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.580
 previous generation has been more than 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.580
 outstanding 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.210
 we hope that finally the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.190
 rumor and do not appear a model of iu ya 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.340
 that can condemn ostracism to these 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.129
 760 look at the comparison with their 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.039
 rivals of md this is inevitable 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:48.860
 would be framed between 78 70 and 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.080
 39 50 we leave you the choice 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.169
 since probably many of you will have 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.180
 account the return per euro invested 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.370
 there is no doubt that the highlight of these 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.169
 results and improvement in ventilation 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.449
 at least in the case of the assembler 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.340
 Taiwanese are aspects that will make it 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.390
 in an alternative if we are thinking 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.700
 in changing or acquiring a new graph 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.620
 and this has been all we hope that you 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.170
 I liked it and if it was like that, 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.120
 forget to give the aik in addition to follow 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.250
 aware of all the news of pc 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.380
 components you can follow our 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.050
 various social networks and of course 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.010
 our blog a greeting and see you in the 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.010
 next video guys
