bobber<00:00:37.920> look<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.430> problem<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> gets

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
bobber look but the problem is it gets

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.660 
bobber look but the problem is it gets
in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> way<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> exhaust<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:41.309> dilemma

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
in the way of the exhaust and my dilemma

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.420 
in the way of the exhaust and my dilemma
is<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:42.960> want<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.860> spend<00:00:44.040> money<00:00:44.280> on

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
is I don't really want to spend money on

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.119 
is I don't really want to spend money on
a<00:00:44.550> four<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.510> header<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> bike

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
a four to one header for the bike

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.850 
a four to one header for the bike
because<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> budget<00:00:48.120> build<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.829> two<00:00:49.829> I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
because this is a budget build and two I

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
because this is a budget build and two I
don't<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.760> open<00:00:51.030> header<00:00:51.180> sound

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
don't really like the open header sound

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240 
don't really like the open header sound
so<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> want<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.320> some<00:00:52.590> sort<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> exhaust

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so I want to have some sort of exhaust

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
so I want to have some sort of exhaust
on<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> best

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
on it so this is kind of the best

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770 
on it so this is kind of the best
budget-friendly<00:00:56.460> option<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.180> found<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.660> are

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
budget-friendly option I found these are

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.760 
budget-friendly option I found these are
these<00:00:57.960> mufflers<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.620> around<00:00:58.829> 50<00:00:59.129> bucks<00:00:59.340> each

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
these mufflers are around 50 bucks each

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.200 
these mufflers are around 50 bucks each
on<00:01:01.770> Amazon<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:04.519> more<00:01:05.519> than<00:01:05.640> likely<00:01:05.700> I'm

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
on Amazon so more than likely I'm

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.960 
on Amazon so more than likely I'm
probably<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> take<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.290> move<00:01:07.970> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
probably going to take and move the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.940 
probably going to take and move the
taillight<00:01:09.420> either<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.229> upper<00:01:10.619> strut

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
taillight either to this upper strut

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.910 
taillight either to this upper strut
here<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> lower<00:01:12.030> area<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.380> kind<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
here or this lower area here and kind of

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.530 
here or this lower area here and kind of
tack<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.000> quite<00:01:15.240> sure<00:01:15.270> yet

really<00:03:25.720> fine<00:03:26.020> lines<00:03:26.410> kind<00:03:27.070> of<00:03:27.160> in<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
really fine lines kind of in the in the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.490 
really fine lines kind of in the in the
chrome<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.630> basically<00:03:29.050> it's<00:03:29.290> still

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
chrome and that basically it's still

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.090 
chrome and that basically it's still
smooth<00:03:29.800> to<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.010> touch<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.330> really<00:03:31.570> just

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
smooth to the touch but that really just

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.410 
smooth to the touch but that really just
helps<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.220> paint<00:03:33.459> kind<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:33.820> stick<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.270> let's

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
helps the paint kind of stick so let's

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.640 
helps the paint kind of stick so let's
go<00:03:34.540> ahead<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:34.780> get<00:03:34.900> these<00:03:35.020> over<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.440> where<00:03:35.560> I'm

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
go ahead and get these over to where I'm

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.170 
go ahead and get these over to where I'm
going<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.830> spray<00:03:36.070> em<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.730> then<00:03:36.880> we'll<00:03:37.000> take<00:03:37.120> it

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
going to spray em and then we'll take it

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.970 
going to spray em and then we'll take it
from<00:03:37.300> there

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
from there

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.770 
from there
I've<00:03:38.980> here<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.490> just<00:03:39.670> a<00:03:39.790> citrus<00:03:40.150> degreaser

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
I've here is just a citrus degreaser

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.920 
I've here is just a citrus degreaser
this<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.800> basically<00:03:42.310> I'm<00:03:43.000> just<00:03:43.090> going<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.390> go

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930

this is basically I'm just going to go
ahead<00:03:43.990> and<00:03:44.230> kind<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.040> coat<00:03:45.220> these<00:03:45.600> real<00:03:46.600> good

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
ahead and kind of coat these real good

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.340 
ahead and kind of coat these real good
with<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:46.959> degreaser<00:03:48.990> here<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:51.160> that'll

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
with the degreaser here and that'll

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.280 
with the degreaser here and that'll
that'll<00:03:53.350> get<00:03:53.620> any<00:03:53.740> grease<00:03:54.040> from<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.900> oils<00:03:56.170> on

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
that'll get any grease from the oils on

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.790 
that'll get any grease from the oils on
my<00:03:56.440> hands<00:03:56.800> off<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:56.950> there<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:58.410> it'll<00:03:59.410> let<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
my hands off of there and it'll let the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.130 
my hands off of there and it'll let the
paint<00:04:00.610> stick<00:04:00.850> down<00:04:01.030> nice<00:04:01.300> so<00:04:01.570> let's<00:04:01.720> get<00:04:01.930> that

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
paint stick down nice so let's get that

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.230 
paint stick down nice so let's get that
let's<00:04:02.890> let<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.070> go<00:04:03.400> ahead<00:04:03.490> and<00:04:03.670> soak<00:04:03.940> down

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
let's let that go ahead and soak down

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.630 
let's let that go ahead and soak down
and<00:04:04.630> then<00:04:04.840> I'll<00:04:04.990> rinse<00:04:05.920> these<00:04:06.100> off<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.580> then

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
and then I'll rinse these off and then

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.610 
and then I'll rinse these off and then
get<00:04:06.790> them<00:04:06.910> getting<00:04:07.390> sprayed<00:04:07.720> here<00:04:07.959> rinse<00:04:08.350> down

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
get them getting sprayed here rinse down

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.010 
get them getting sprayed here rinse down
see<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.459> water<00:04:09.760> there<00:04:10.030> I'm<00:04:10.720> going<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.930> go

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
see the water there I'm going to go

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.360 
see the water there I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.260> dry<00:04:11.440> these<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.860> spray<00:04:12.100> them<00:04:12.220> with

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
ahead and dry these and spray them with

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
ahead and dry these and spray them with
the<00:04:13.020> exhaust<00:04:14.020> pipe<00:04:14.520> nice<00:04:15.520> and<00:04:15.820> securely

the exhaust pipe nice and securely
resting<00:04:17.290> on<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.950> pop<00:04:18.760> can

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
resting on a pop can

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.620 
resting on a pop can
box<00:04:20.459> with<00:04:21.459> very<00:04:21.699> low<00:04:21.880> wind<00:04:22.150> you're<00:04:22.449> going<00:04:22.569> to

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
box with very low wind you're going to

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.760 
box with very low wind you're going to
want<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.840> go<00:04:23.020> ahead<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.289> start<00:04:23.470> spraying

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
these down take everything really well

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.580 
these down take everything really well
this<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.389> self-explanatory<00:04:28.900> if<00:04:29.319> anyone's

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
this is self-explanatory if anyone's

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.010 
this is self-explanatory if anyone's
ever<00:04:29.680> spray-painted<00:04:30.280> anything<00:04:30.550> before

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
ever spray-painted anything before

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.950 
ever spray-painted anything before
basically<00:04:32.729> what<00:04:33.729> it's<00:04:33.849> gonna<00:04:33.970> be<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.870> just

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
basically what it's gonna be is just

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.629 
basically what it's gonna be is just
real<00:04:35.849> kinda<00:04:36.849> light<00:04:37.240> coats<00:04:37.569> like<00:04:37.750> this<00:04:38.639> onto

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
real kinda light coats like this onto

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.370 
real kinda light coats like this onto
that<00:04:39.759> chrome<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.599> want<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.810> kind<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.080> let<00:04:41.349> it

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
that chrome you want to kind of let it

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.189 
that chrome you want to kind of let it
sit<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:41.800> dry<00:04:42.180> like<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.750> then<00:04:43.840> revisit

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
sit and dry like that and then revisit

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.350 
sit and dry like that and then revisit
it<00:04:44.470> don't<00:04:44.770> lay<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.220> all<00:04:45.430> down<00:04:45.669> at<00:04:45.880> once<00:04:45.910> this

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
it don't lay it all down at once this

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.460 
it don't lay it all down at once this
paints<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:46.750> little<00:04:46.960> bit<00:04:47.050> different<00:04:47.380> than

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
paints a little bit different than

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.950 
paints a little bit different than
regular<00:04:47.620> paint<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.460> it'll<00:04:48.759> run<00:04:49.000> so<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:49.750> want

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
regular paint and it'll run so you want

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.900 
regular paint and it'll run so you want
to<00:04:50.020> kind<00:04:50.110> of<00:04:50.289> finesse<00:04:50.650> this<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.610> let's<00:04:51.789> go

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
to kind of finesse this so let's go

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.490 
to kind of finesse this so let's go
ahead<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.240> get<00:04:52.539> a<00:04:52.599> first<00:04:52.840> coat<00:04:53.080> on<00:04:53.110> I'll<00:04:53.410> show

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
ahead and get a first coat on I'll show

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.839 
ahead and get a first coat on I'll show
you<00:04:53.590> what<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.740> looks<00:04:53.860> like<00:04:54.009> hey<00:04:54.430> there's<00:04:54.669> your

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
you what it looks like hey there's your

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.850 
you what it looks like hey there's your
first<00:04:55.090> coat<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:55.810> you'll<00:04:56.380> see<00:04:56.590> that<00:04:56.740> it's

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
first coat and you'll see that it's

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.520 
first coat and you'll see that it's
still<00:04:57.009> a<00:04:57.070> little<00:04:57.099> wet<00:04:57.599> but<00:04:58.599> what<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.900> does<00:04:59.110> is

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
still a little wet but what it does is

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.490 
still a little wet but what it does is
this<00:05:00.490> camera<00:05:00.789> doesn't<00:05:01.000> really<00:05:01.150> do<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.419> justice

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
this camera doesn't really do it justice

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.260 
this camera doesn't really do it justice
but<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.650> lays<00:05:02.800> down<00:05:02.979> real<00:05:03.310> even<00:05:03.820> when<00:05:04.150> you

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
but it lays down real even when you

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.260 
but it lays down real even when you
scuff<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:04.599> up<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:04.900> that<00:05:05.880> kind<00:05:06.880> of<00:05:06.940> see<00:05:07.090> all

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
scuff it up like that kind of see all

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.310 
scuff it up like that kind of see all
the<00:05:07.300> way<00:05:07.509> throughout<00:05:07.810> it's<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.169> very

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
the way throughout it's a very

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.890 
the way throughout it's a very
consistent<00:05:08.770> flat<00:05:09.250> black<00:05:09.580> it's<00:05:10.539> not<00:05:10.720> like<00:05:10.870> a

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
consistent flat black it's not like a

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.580 
consistent flat black it's not like a
wavy<00:05:11.729> flat<00:05:12.729> black<00:05:13.030> so<00:05:13.690> I'll<00:05:13.840> go<00:05:13.960> back<00:05:14.169> through

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
wavy flat black so I'll go back through

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.290 
wavy flat black so I'll go back through
and<00:05:14.889> probably<00:05:15.250> lay<00:05:15.460> down<00:05:15.639> about<00:05:15.880> two<00:05:16.120> or<00:05:16.270> three

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
and probably lay down about two or three

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.760 
and probably lay down about two or three
more<00:05:16.630> coats<00:05:16.960> on<00:05:17.169> this<00:05:17.380> let<00:05:18.340> it<00:05:18.430> dry<00:05:18.759> for<00:05:18.819> a<00:05:19.210> good

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
more coats on this let it dry for a good

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.399 
more coats on this let it dry for a good
48<00:05:20.770> hours<00:05:21.099> to<00:05:21.310> 72<00:05:21.759> hours<00:05:21.789> a<00:05:22.360> long<00:05:22.810> time<00:05:23.110> and

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
48 hours to 72 hours a long time and

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.110 
48 hours to 72 hours a long time and
then<00:05:24.070> I'll<00:05:24.190> go<00:05:24.310> ahead<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.610> actually<00:05:24.759> start

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
then I'll go ahead and actually start

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.580 
then I'll go ahead and actually start
the<00:05:25.210> installation<00:05:25.449> process<00:05:25.750> getting<00:05:26.500> these

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
the installation process getting these

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.070 
the installation process getting these
babies<00:05:26.979> mounted<00:05:27.280> onto<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.580> bike<00:05:27.789> but<00:05:28.509> flat

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
black is going to look a lot better than

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.629 
black is going to look a lot better than
that<00:05:30.520> ugly<00:05:31.210> chrome<00:05:31.479> on<00:05:31.659> that<00:05:31.780> bike<00:05:31.990> so<00:05:32.639> here's

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
that ugly chrome on that bike so here's

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.490 
that ugly chrome on that bike so here's
your<00:05:33.759> side-by-side<00:05:34.449> while<00:05:34.930> this<00:05:35.080> is<00:05:35.229> kind<00:05:35.440> of

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
your side-by-side while this is kind of

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.279 
your side-by-side while this is kind of
doing<00:05:36.099> its<00:05:36.219> final<00:05:36.550> dry<00:05:36.789> here<00:05:37.090> I<00:05:37.300> want<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.110> kind

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
doing its final dry here I want to kind

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.950 
doing its final dry here I want to kind
of<00:05:38.500> show<00:05:39.190> you<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.430> difference<00:05:39.789> between<00:05:39.960> that

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
of show you the difference between that

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.129 
of show you the difference between that
Chrome<00:05:41.409> and<00:05:41.919> then<00:05:42.240> what<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.270> flat<00:05:43.659> black<00:05:43.930> is

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
Chrome and then what that flat black is

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.659 
Chrome and then what that flat black is
going<00:05:44.259> to<00:05:44.320> look<00:05:44.560> like<00:05:44.590> that's<00:05:45.070> kind<00:05:45.340> of<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.520> good

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
going to look like that's kind of a good

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.089 
going to look like that's kind of a good
contrast<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.570> no<00:05:46.750> we're<00:05:47.560> not<00:05:47.680> leaving<00:05:48.009> the

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
contrast and no we're not leaving the

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.370 
contrast and no we're not leaving the
gas<00:05:48.280> tank<00:05:48.610> that<00:05:48.729> poorly<00:05:49.360> painted<00:05:49.570> that'll<00:05:50.229> get

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
gas tank that poorly painted that'll get

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.379 
gas tank that poorly painted that'll get
a<00:05:50.409> seam<00:05:50.680> that'll<00:05:51.550> get<00:05:51.639> the<00:05:51.759> same<00:05:51.969> type<00:05:52.210> of

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
a seam that'll get the same type of

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.680 
a seam that'll get the same type of
finish<00:05:52.570> as<00:05:52.840> this<00:05:52.960> pipe<00:05:53.229> that'll<00:05:53.949> be<00:05:54.690> actually

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
finish as this pipe that'll be actually

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.999 
finish as this pipe that'll be actually
what<00:05:55.840> I'll<00:05:55.900> probably<00:05:56.020> do<00:05:56.259> to<00:05:56.349> that<00:05:56.500> tank<00:05:56.740> is

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
what I'll probably do to that tank is

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.200 
what I'll probably do to that tank is
get<00:05:57.159> all<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.460> paint<00:05:57.610> off<00:05:57.789> of<00:05:57.820> it<00:05:58.030> with<00:05:58.180> a

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
get all the paint off of it with a

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.510 
get all the paint off of it with a
stripper<00:05:58.630> sand<00:05:59.560> the<00:05:59.680> hell<00:05:59.830> out<00:06:00.009> of<00:06:00.159> it<00:06:00.250> for<00:06:00.490> a

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
stripper sand the hell out of it for a

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.209 
stripper sand the hell out of it for a
long<00:06:01.030> time<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.930> then<00:06:02.469> lay<00:06:02.620> down<00:06:02.650> some<00:06:03.039> nice

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
long time and then lay down some nice

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.499 
long time and then lay down some nice
flat<00:06:03.550> on<00:06:03.759> that<00:06:03.810> but<00:06:04.810> you<00:06:04.840> can<00:06:05.080> kind<00:06:05.320> of<00:06:05.409> see<00:06:06.509> the

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
flat on that but you can kind of see the

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.290 
flat on that but you can kind of see the
difference<00:06:07.930> there<00:06:08.259> in<00:06:08.530> the<00:06:08.830> chrome<00:06:09.300> which

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
difference there in the chrome which

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.659 
difference there in the chrome which
just<00:06:11.050> isn't<00:06:11.289> happening<00:06:11.830> on<00:06:11.949> this<00:06:12.099> bike<00:06:12.370> and

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
just isn't happening on this bike and

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.540 
just isn't happening on this bike and
the<00:06:13.000> flat<00:06:13.240> black<00:06:13.509> so<00:06:14.409> I<00:06:14.440> hope<00:06:14.860> this<00:06:15.039> inspired

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
the flat black so I hope this inspired

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.459 
the flat black so I hope this inspired
anybody<00:06:16.090> out<00:06:16.300> there<00:06:16.330> that's<00:06:16.599> kind<00:06:17.020> of<00:06:17.110> doing<00:06:17.380> a
