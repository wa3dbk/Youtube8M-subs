00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.050
 let's make a defrosting today 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.789
 of breads for the subject of oxidation 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.590
 fermentation of each baked because 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:47.589
 we have an hour and a half to get the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:51.510
 people and we have to be all ready and 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:54.750
 we use sourdough 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.820
 It helps us to give sensitivity to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.400
 dough to give flavor to give 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.930
 consistency 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.200
 for us for all our plans 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.700
 we use them for all these issues and the 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.980
 we use depends on proportions 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.510
 different depends on the bread when 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.820
 appear even though zinos a little more than 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.590
 this and when they are loaves like a video if 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.130
 this in good quantities 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:29.150
 this applies flavor this texture friend 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:33.610
 crust in any case there is nothing like that 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:38.090
 the moon is not full the night it looks 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.119
 penalty is not erased is it understood maybe the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.119
 light that blinds you illuminates at once 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.720
 knows where you 're going if you're going to 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.650
 we in that we use the eggs of 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.320
 corral are eggs 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.680
 a special farm for us eggs 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.300
 They are fresh and they serve us 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.430
 to be different and with the sandwich and 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.480
 breakfasts as what you see here then 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.760
 We work with 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.580
 sausages stuffed our neighbor of 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.050
 renzo will see marked or what makes us 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.630
 after hams rossville 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.630
 bacon of cachete types 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.240
 example sausage of maple honey that is 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.390
 interesting for a type of sandwich that 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.380
 we make 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.710
 what we know too 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.370
 much the subject of a lot of sausages 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.370
 egg theme 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.180
 I'm actually a marketing graduate 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.880
 I came to the coffee world basically with 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.310
 a professor of market development 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.810
 who worked in a coffee world was 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.490
 event organizer until a 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.890
 moment I was very struck by 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.760
 all the productive triple the art the art 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.460
 and what it really is to be a barista and 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.380
 how do you get to ego does how much being in 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.050
 the beginnings of the project like that 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.300
 basically since August that when 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.720
 it was not yet complete and until 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.030
 still missing some details for 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.430
 in this case 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.140
 I really liked the concept with a friend 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.700
 what friend told me he is trying 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.890
 also harrison neira who is 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.110
 currently a national champion of 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.200
 baristas 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.020
 he contacted me with renato I liked all the 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.080
 ego concept 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.000
 and well I arrived here 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.650
 he had a pretty intense practice in 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.590
 the first months to be able to improve the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.960
 express technique all the peasants 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.690
 which are art and the themes are 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.780
 guests to know during the whole day 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.910
 but then it remains in the mill in the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.580
 doors of the plain just in 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.920
 Tahiti street 175 behind the wall of the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.630
 premise where we look for 8 to 8 and 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.590

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:07.880
