00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello friends how are you I'm luken and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.870
 today I come with a new video before 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.210
 to start it I want to say that any 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.610
 offensive comment will be deleted and the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.950
 user will be blocked since this is my 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.800
 opinion and nobody can change it for me 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.410
 let's start this video called top 15 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.740
 the best nintendo ds games I hope 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.199
 enjoy it guys let's start in the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.869
 position number 15 is super 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.420
 Mario 64 of that some are going to throw me 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.880
 shit if I'm a fan of mario but I 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.460
 I will say that this game the sincere truth does not 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.620
 it's a wonder this game in my 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.739
 opinion is not even half as good as 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.170
 the super mario 64 original because in 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 first one has a frightful gameplay 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.570
 uncomfortable and annoying the graphics though 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.550
 they are not essential I liked them too 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.219
 the good point that I give to super mario 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.140
 64 of that is that you can play with several 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.840
 characters and the extra missions and 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.870
 minigames but good let's leave this game 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.600
 where he deserves to be in the number position 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.299
 14 awaited us anxious call of duty 4 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 modern warfare of the gameplay of this 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.060
 game 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.340
 it is very good the graphics not so much but 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.990
 Fuck that this is a game that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.760
 deserves the nintendo ds 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.960
 I hope you get a call of duty to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.420
 nintendo 3ds hopefully but I'll wait xd on 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.730
 step 13 was mario and sonic in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.040
 the Olympic Winter Games this 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.840
 game I did not put it on my top the wheel anymore 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.970
 that I greatly prefer the version of 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.310
 nintendo ds has better gameplay 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.560
 well you know everything this has 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.840
 game if they have played it clear if you do not 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.450
 have you played play it right now shit 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.390
 a lie but I recommend it is very 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 good jajajajajajajaja xdddd I do not know 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.610
 why the fuck am I laughing 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.070
 let's follow the fucking top we come to the post 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.840
 number 12 that awaited us anxious mario 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.940
 and sonic in the Olympic games ' 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.430
 hahahaha two of the games of the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.530
 olympics go together xd but good 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.390
 I prefer this than the winter one because of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.910
 simple fact of having more mini-games 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.460
 better gameplay so I lean a 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.930
 little more to traditional games 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.270
 giving all the respect to the game of 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.760
 Winter Olympics has several 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.330
 characters as I said I prefer the 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.520
 versions of that to which the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.880
 but good that you have to follow me 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.010
 I'm delaying shit you look at the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.920
 place 11 and it's nothing more, nothing less 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.290
 what star fox command or gold this great game 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.450
 I played it a little while ago when my 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.120
 friend master luiz yo 9 lent me the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.820
 game I really liked the gameplay the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.320
 story and all that crap but good what 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.540
 What I liked the most about what I've 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.670
 researched is that you can choose 9 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.190
 ends for the game and they finish 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.380
 differently that's cool but for 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.050
 now I do not remember those endings but 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.240
 no way in summary this is a great game 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.730
 the saga of star fox maybe one of the 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.580
 better so if you have not played it 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.010
 I recommend them a lot we expected in the 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.350
 put 10 kÃ­rov and super star ultra makes 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.270
 time I played this game is 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.550
 in general all kirby games 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.950
 absorb your enemies and then win 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.200
 your powers you know that I am not 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.850
 so fan of Kirby video games but 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.190
 I put this game because I liked it a lot 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.620
 the gameplay is very good and the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.660
 graphics like the true classics of 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.850
 the nes but I will not talk much about this 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.600
 game so I said xdddd so 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.150
 let's follow the fucked up 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.640
 we see the 9th place and we find 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.410
 the great game of super mario bros this new 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.080
 game is the first in the saga of new 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.570
 super mario bros although the first one was 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.790
 very good so much that is in this top the 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.980
 spectacular worlds is like a 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.140
 combination of Super Mario Bros 3 and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.420
 exploration of super mario world yes no 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.790
 bad memory are 8 worlds that you must 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.010
 complete by defeating a boss in each 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.990
 world if they have played mario I guess that 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.180
 You know what I mean, it's like 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.670
 old marios but boy I am 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.800
 asshole if for something the damn game is 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.440
 call new super mario ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.480
 I'm a real subnormal xd but 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.330
 well I'm talking a lot and I think that 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.790
 they want me to continue with the top in the post 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.190
 8 we stumbled on sounds this 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.020
 juegazo de la nintendo ds is a work 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.750
 teacher of the sounds of sega is my 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.700
 second favorite sonic after 1 what 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.500
 what makes this game special is that 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.690
 take advantage of the two screens of the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.030
 nintendo ds to take advantage of the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.490
 game what is great is that how are graphics 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.200
 polygonal the scroll is scroll 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.980
 lateral but the graphics are 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.110
 three-dimensional 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.080
 good if they have played the game they will know 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.520
 the plot but I do not think it's necessary 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.360
 explain it in this video since it gives me 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.640
 laziness xd xd xd xddddd I'm a lazy 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.740
 the re thousand balls hahaha 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.930
 we go flying to the number one 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.790
 7 where nothing else is 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.890
 nothing less than sonic classic collection 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.780
 I do not have much to explain about this 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.180
 game since it is a compilation of the 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.340
 sonic classics of the legendary sega 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.920
 genesis what is great because my 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.680
 sonic favorites are 1 and 2 so 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.570
 I love being able to play the classics 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.480
 clasicazos in my nintendo ds I will not talk 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.060
 much more so let's continue on top of 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.120
 the pyramid and at number 6 is 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.370
 the graham tetris that yes and although 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.650
 do not believe it whenever I turn on my ds 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.680
 I put this game to warm fingers 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.020
 xdddd but already seriously this game is very 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.820
 good retains the classic mode of tetris 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.590
 but with other game modes and 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.050
 minigames to play with the mode 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.020
 classic but no way let's continue with the top 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.450
 I'm in a hurry hehehe in 5th place 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.860
 and finishing is the great game of zelda 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.229
 spirit tracks 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.270
 and some will wonder if I'm such a fan 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.770
 of the saga of the legend of zelda because 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.289
 I did not put it between the first three 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.360
 because honestly with all the pain 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.610
 of the soul I will have to say that I do not 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.860
 It deserves since what disappointed me 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.110
 Poquillo is your little difficulty I do not 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.750
 criticize what the fuck is my opinion 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.000
 besides the 6a team graphics sincerely 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.680
 I do not like it is one of the reasons why 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.080
 those that I do not like much came to quer 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.629
 but well, this game is great 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.270
 it still has the essence of the cells like this 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.759
 I recommend them, we keep climbing 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.919
 and this cell is on step 4 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.870
 phantom hourglass remember that this 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.939
 game in general uses the same mechanics 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.279
 that spirit tracks only with a 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.770
 story a bit changing another plot 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:19.139
 et cetera but in general it is almost what 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.419
 same xdddd so as you know no 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.550
 I'll talk a lot about him so let's just keep going 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.889
 that we had the time to choose the 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.650
 three best games of d &amp; s so here 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.419
 they are ranked number 3 and with the 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.400
 bronze trophy is the 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.949
 great game of warioware &amp; touch and 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.349
 I loved this game has a variety 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:40.440
 huge micro games wait said 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.930
 huge not that is a bad point of the game 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.610
 It has little variety of micro games but 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.159
 it is preferred to quality before the 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.169
 quality so it does not matter hahahaha but 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:52.560
 good in conclusion is a great 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:54.539
 game worthy of this podium in the second 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.060
 put and with the silver trophy it 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:59.729
 find the big one of the greats if I 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.710
 I mean mario kart ds wahaha haha ââis 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.080
 great this great title better than 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.089
 such nintendo ds racing even such 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.729
 better time than wil for its 

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:10.589
 good tracks all in general but I 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:12.509
 I think this game does not deserve so much 

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:15.870
 presentation so let's move on to the first 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:18.029
 put if they saw my previous tops they 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.620
 they will have realized that before saying the 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:22.020
 first place I put a music 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:24.810
 exciting but it gives me lazy so 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.759
 imagine that I put it hahaha 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.979
 they will ask what game deserves an honor 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:30.990
 bigger than mario kart ds to be 

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:33.509
 at number 1 and receive the 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.460
 gold trophy and my answer is that the 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:37.740
 game that deserves such great respect 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.719
 is the legendary platinum pokÃ©mon this 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.819
 game marked a legend among the 

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:43.350
 pokemon players I do not like 

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:45.390
 a lot rpg 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.030
 with this great game I send that rule to 

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.490
 Fuck is a game worth admiring the 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.250
 exploration designs pokemon
