00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.130

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.660

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.240
 well today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.040
 new crash as usual so 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.619
 today it is the motogp game 14 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.079
 so I had already had a crash on this 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.599
 game but it was for the 2013 so 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.710
 today I decided again to 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.800
 do a crash on this game so for the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.660
 2014 so as usual I you 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.040
 invite to go in the description 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.050
 just below the video 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.820
 you will find the different links so 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.760
 for this game we will have to install micro 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.390
 torrent and modes of winrar software 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.750
 tonight 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.280
 we do not need it for this crash even if 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.500
 I think you already have all these 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.650
 software since time 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.839
 so here is to start in the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.299
 description you have a link 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:10.390
 kickasstorrents so it's motogp 2014 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.079
 black box so this is a version we are going 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.850
 say improve and less cumbersome than that 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.670
 from right sky seems to me I'm not sure 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.280
 in any case it is less cumbersome 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.109
 if I win I do here giga 25 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.170
 so it's really not bad at all 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:28.509
 to start the download you 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.460
 click torrent download and this 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.509
 without will be automatically in the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.520
 microsoft software 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.829
 once you have the game you have 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.749
 a file called motogp 2014 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.130
 act up what you double click 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:44.109
 above my euro issue for you 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.959
 facilitate explanations we will everything 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.850
 just extract all this on the 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.170
 office so extract file I have in 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.539
 English so you if you have it in 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.340
 French so much better for you then the 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.310
 password it's very simple you 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.069
 go to the link that 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.899
 break and password and 3 w bin 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.939
 box rybak dot com 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.939
 so we will note this so 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:17.600
 black box flu that point like 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.430
 here we do ok and now all 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.860
 files that are inside you 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.900
 get out on the desk so that's fine 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.700
 takes a minute or so so 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.050
 will I cut the video well 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.880
 go i'm going to cut the video because 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.680
 if not a minute it'll be a little too much 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.540
 long so we find ourselves right away 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.620
 once all this is extracted on 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.220
 back on immediately 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.930
 so that's all over as you 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.560
 can see it on the desk it's 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.900
 now brothel in the decor so 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.090
 you have plenty of files so we this 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.140
 which interests us is simply 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.560
 set up have double-clicked on it and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:05.360
 we will simply install the game 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:09.739
 so we wait a little bit here we are 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.930
 done next have made next to the screams the icon 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.959
 on desk and in the menu have done 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.040
 install and now install 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.170
 start I'm going to cut the video again 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.299
 so do not worry about 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
 the installation does not last deezer 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.200
 not last this hour does not last a 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.799
 hour but lasts about twenty minutes 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.340
 pretty much at least that depends on that 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.110
 depend 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.290
 I put about twenty minutes there 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.049
 seems to me to be able to install this game 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.190
 We are right now for the 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.780
 end of installation immediately 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.510
 so that's the installation is over 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.400
 I do not know how long it took you 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.950
 taken myself by the way because I 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.660
 did a race in the meantime so I 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.010
 left setup and I left 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.000
 do a race so I do not know the 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.350
 how long did it take 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.540
 feel free to comment 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.010
 how long is that true? 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.110
 took you so once it's over 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.010
 down you click on fennish and there 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.010
 as you can see 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.170
 the game icon appeared on the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.440
 offices so there is nothing left to 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.530
 make 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.440
 you can play quietly 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:22.420
 vosgien I'm going to delete that's so 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.180
 there you said happy with the game when 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.550
 you have to click on it 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.350
 we offer you the language you have 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.280
 all languages ​​the audio options and 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.020
 et cetera and so on 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.480
 of course there is no 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.770
 multiplayer as usual so you 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.830
 do if it is the order in French 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.790
 unless you want to play with it 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.230
 other language 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.840
 so here's for this game the installation and 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.660
 all the tutorial is over so 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.310
 I hope you had a good 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.950
 moment with me as you could the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.770
 notice finally I do not know if a 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.230
 difference is that I changed 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.690
 microphones so I do not think there is a 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.370
 big difference 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.750
 maybe if you put a headset 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.810
 the headphones there may be a 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.200
 difference so that's all that's 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.790
 I can say so if this tutorial she 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.580
 you liked it and do not hesitate to 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.950
 put 1 inch blue and put a 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.240
 comment right below the video 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.360
 do not worry about others 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.540
 cracks it's going to happen in very few 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.430
 time 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:30.790
 I do not know when there will be games 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:36.910
 who came out a few days ago that 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:40.170
 this is on the sniper autosport grid 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.370
 elite 2 3 dead raids 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.380
 and then we have others I may be 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.080
 there are a lot of people who 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.400
 ask to crack the counter 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.860
 offensive global strike 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.470
 I will try to do it why not 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.630
 I tried to do 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.820
 so do not hesitate to put your 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.270
