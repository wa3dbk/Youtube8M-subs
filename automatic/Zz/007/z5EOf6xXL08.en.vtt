00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.920
 hello I can you as you see I am 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.160
 already made up and after the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.140
 slalom of care models wine and what 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.820
 its look really makes it look like that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.039
 never with block and just that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.770
 Eyebrows are very much emphasized 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.730
 he just totally is in the coming 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.460
 and how I do it step by step 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.559
 You have done that now as you see 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.390
 I see you already have a page 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.140
 Prepare the effect for you 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.920
 to show 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.070
 before and after, and they look 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.520
 now with the other side around the whole 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.410
 make up ready to start 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.340
 I look at the eyes because the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 I already have that primer 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.360
 applied and indeed set up 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.610
 shadow palette once the lighter tone 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:08.700
 and distribute it once completely on the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:11.689
 this song is beautifully distributed until after 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.689
 above the eyebrow 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.530
 it goes on with the dark 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.450
 party with the middle before the first 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 dark eyeshadow is also possible 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.290
 a little bit around the corner and 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.280
 brewers mix this little bit 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.760
 Swimming Club Knocking thinks of me 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.760
 I have daily on the face then I start 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.240
 on the moving to the sound too 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.850
 just because of what the blog distribute 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.070
 So Caravelle always has wine 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.119
 very smoke his eyes on the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:02.220
 screen look around others and almost all 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:04.110
 are like star sad that paid 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.240
 Now the beautiful in the bÃ¼tt 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.189
 to suspend further to the bit 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.689
 With that, something really gets softer 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.689
 this sad lux 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:35.970
 we represent the foreign 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:38.250
 inside go in another yet 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.410
 unused neutral brush again 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.190
 is also very far and that again here 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:49.200
 all these hard and long really these 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:52.190
 always whole ones do not class a bit 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.190
 too blatant from the edge 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.420
 then I'll take a smaller one again 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.760
 brush up to the eye must because the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.970
 both shades of brown also nice 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:15.000
 Expire and like your friend's eye 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.950
 along to the front quietly says so 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.250
 is slightly wider and the eye 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.440
 really ran like that 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.860
 and now the eyelashes with the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.480
 mascara is nice too 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.310
 the eyelashes are not too tightly glued to the 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.310
 Often , that's how it is 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.380
 lumps are or so that makes them to 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.470
 Good luck is not too good 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:48.330
 though through the zig zag movement 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:51.150
 separate the left super background 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.890
 that I'm out of because that's easy to me 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.420
 much advertising just for this new black 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.380
 he should still be quite natural 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.110
 different upper eyelashes 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.450
 now come the eyebrows that because he 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.450
 always very strong and pronounced 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.280
 already by nature 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.870
 I also have very good arm brown too 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.060
 already well developed but that will be 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.820
 now also a bit reinforced and 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.769
 Although great with a eyebrow pencil 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.239
 is also that a bit with 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.750
 ran.de 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.370
 side that the other is this piece 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.250
 you also always equip the same 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.750
 can 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.750
 we bring the eyebrows my front 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.139
 we thus canceled 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.699
 really strong on the eyebrows 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:53.460
 along also beautiful she already has that 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:55.830
 Eyes from the ground, the hairs also right 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.690
 to connect to it and that is to us 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.979
 painted looks like if you still 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.979
 look much more natural 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.650
 Now it goes on with the use there 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.159
 you see it here on the side 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.159
 that is very tender support 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.139
 I really only for the banks very much 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:28.460
 easy to do and a little bit 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.460
 more contour in the face and 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.820
 It is not bad either because you 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.060
 really this weeks always right 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.490
 located has the cheekbones 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.750
 Now it's on with the lips 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.080
 I find the gap closure of the 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:54.360
 harden soft rose tone affects his dog 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:06:11.280
 moderately on the lips rule of law not 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:12.660
 too strong and I wish you all 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.580
 I am very happy about that 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.750
