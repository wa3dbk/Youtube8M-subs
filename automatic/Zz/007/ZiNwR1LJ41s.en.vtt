some bulk ammunition and UMC I've had

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.490 
some bulk ammunition and UMC I've had
three<00:00:12.420> failure<00:00:13.080> two<00:00:13.200> feeds<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:15.320> 115<00:00:16.320> grain

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
three failure two feeds and 115 grain

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.650 
three failure two feeds and 115 grain
and<00:00:17.070> my<00:00:17.250> wife<00:00:17.490> has<00:00:17.699> been<00:00:17.730> out<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.180> shoot<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.510> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
and my wife has been out to shoot it and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.390 
and my wife has been out to shoot it and
she's<00:00:19.020> had<00:00:19.170> some<00:00:19.380> limp-wristed<00:00:19.680> problems

she's had some limp-wristed problems
with<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.230> thought<00:00:22.529> I'd<00:00:22.710> bring<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.039> out

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
with it so I thought I'd bring it out

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
with it so I thought I'd bring it out
today<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.090> brought<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.330> hundred<00:00:24.570> rounds<00:00:25.140> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.380 
today and I brought a hundred rounds of
some<00:00:25.470> more<00:00:25.710> bulk<00:00:25.980> ammo<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.609> Winchester<00:00:27.150> white

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
some more bulk ammo the Winchester white

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.990 
some more bulk ammo the Winchester white
box<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.930> 115<00:00:28.650> grain<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.609> it's<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> same

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
box it's 115 grain so it's the same

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.330 
box it's 115 grain so it's the same
grain<00:00:30.330> as<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.929> UMC's<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.710> wanted<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.160> see

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
grain as the UMC's but I wanted to see

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.120 
grain as the UMC's but I wanted to see
if<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.700> difference<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.329> put<00:00:33.930> about<00:00:34.130> 450

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
if there is a difference I put about 450

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.770 
if there is a difference I put about 450
rounds<00:00:35.340> through<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> today<00:00:36.540> we're<00:00:36.690> gonna

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.690 
rounds through it and today we're gonna
shoot<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.170> hundred<00:00:37.530> rounds<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> white<00:00:38.430> box

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.940 
shoot a hundred rounds of the white box
and<00:00:38.969> then<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> hundred<00:00:40.020> rounds<00:00:40.140> again<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.890> that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and then a hundred rounds again of that

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830 
and then a hundred rounds again of that
UMC<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.910> I've<00:00:42.000> been<00:00:42.120> having<00:00:42.420> problems<00:00:42.450> with

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
UMC that I've been having problems with

UMC that I've been having problems with
with<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> failure<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.710> feed<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.250> we'll<00:00:44.969> just

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
with the failure to feed so we'll just

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.139 
with the failure to feed so we'll just
get<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.780> what<00:00:45.899> happens<00:00:49.670> now<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.730> wish<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
get to it see what happens now I wish I

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.819 
get to it see what happens now I wish I
had<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> variety<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:52.079> different<00:00:52.289> animal<00:00:52.800> to

had a variety of different animal to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
had a variety of different animal to
bring<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.059> us<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
bring out here and more of us but the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
bring out here and more of us but the
reality<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.800> hard<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.070> find<00:00:56.340> right

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
reality is one it's hard to find right

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
reality is one it's hard to find right
now<00:00:56.629> -<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> money<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.399> I

everything<00:01:37.369> is<00:01:37.490> fit<00:01:37.729> flawlessly<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.990> maybe

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
everything is fit flawlessly so maybe

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.749 
everything is fit flawlessly so maybe
the<00:01:39.320> guns<00:01:39.530> break<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.039> in<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.250> little<00:01:40.430> bit<00:01:40.549> maybe

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
the guns break it in a little bit maybe

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.969 
the guns break it in a little bit maybe
the<00:01:40.970> springs<00:01:41.299> break<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.960> little<00:01:42.170> bit<00:01:42.289> who

the springs break it in a little bit who

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.190 
the springs break it in a little bit who

knows now we're going to move on to the
hundred<00:01:45.590> rounds<00:01:46.009> of<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.220> UMC<00:01:46.520> which<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.360> where

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
hundred rounds of the UMC which is where

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.450 
hundred rounds of the UMC which is where
I've<00:01:47.630> had<00:01:47.750> all<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.020> failures<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.680> let's<00:01:49.340> see

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
I've had all the failures and let's see

00:01:49.460 --> 00:02:27.660 
I've had all the failures and let's see
what<00:01:49.580> happens

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.229 

there<00:02:28.670> goes<00:02:28.879> 50<00:02:29.599> rounds<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.709> UMC<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.580> not

there goes 50 rounds of the UMC and not
a<00:02:32.269> problem<00:02:32.810> yet<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.620> that's<00:02:33.769> a<00:02:33.890> good<00:02:34.010> sign

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
a problem yet so that's a good sign

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.210 
a problem yet so that's a good sign
let's<00:02:34.970> go<00:02:35.090> ahead<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.480> put<00:02:35.629> another<00:02:35.890> 50<00:02:36.890> rounds

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:04:14.140 

that's<00:03:41.799> just<00:03:42.099> fun

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150
