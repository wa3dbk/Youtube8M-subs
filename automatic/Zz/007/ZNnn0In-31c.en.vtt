 title in Canada and the United States was 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.720
 indigo prophecy in stripe and you will have to

 control all the characters 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040
 main 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.350
 be careful all the actions that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 David's own story will affect 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.000
 cage co ceo of wanted dream and at the same time 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.159
 writer and director of his games was 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.890
 who was leading them in the tutorial of 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.290
 indispensable step to know what 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.990
 would wait for us and what differentiated this 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.119
 product of the rest of adventures 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.130
 fahrenheit started with a stranger 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.590
 murder in the toilets of a small 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.689
 strange restaurant because the own 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.880
 assassin lukas cane claimed to have been 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.820
 possessed by an uncontrollable force that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.119
 the push attraction being the one simple 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.049
 puppet after achieving escape in the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.909
 first minutes 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.880
 the police investigation in charge of 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.610
 Carla Valentin and Tyler Mails would start at 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 close the fence while in turn the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.420
 murderer was also trying to discover that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.899
 had pushed him to perform such 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.310
 barbarism in this race against time and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.650
 we are controlling the different 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.049
 main characters can choose 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.540
 even with whom we were still 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.750
 story that was taking shape according to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.030
 we used all the characters each 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.880
 he had his own personality situations 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.860
 and possible actions to be taken and 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.650
 non-playable characters reacted 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.600
 according to our acts and decisions give 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.430
 one answer or another do or not is the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.970
 action to discover everything we could 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.950
 do or not in each situation some of 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.230
 these gave us points that improved the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.980
 situation of our character going on 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.560
 of tense 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.989
 quiet for example, thus varying the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.310
 mental health or the physical state of 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.620
 character 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.790
 David Cage knew how to catch us with his 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.670
 story that included touches 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.489
 supernatural spirits black witchcraft 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.620
 mystery and strange creatures were given 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.050
 hand in this absorbing proposal that 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.750
 It arrived totally localized with a good 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.670
 dubbing was emphasized in certain 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.580
 aspects of the situation by offering 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.250
 emerging cartoons that highlighted such or 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.250
 which object movement or action for 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.680
 elena the gameplay of the title was his 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.060
 main feature we moved to 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.209
 our character with the left stick 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.030
 but the actions were done using 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.980
 the right stick taking one of the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.440
 different options when moving the stick in 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.390
 one or the other direction 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.370
 it was usual to have a limited time of 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.610
 response marked by a top bar 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.299
 that was rapidly running out of what 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.860
 gave more tension to the game 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.690
 some combined situations had 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.670
 to be done in a concrete way or 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.269
 the appropriate chain of 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.670
 possible actions at certain times the 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.780
 direct action took control 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.760
 making quick time events that we 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.980
 they forced to move the sticks according to 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.829
 delete the different addresses in 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.730
 screen only in a few moments 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.989
 the pad buttons were used 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.030
 graphically we were before a product 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.920
 of remarkable technical bill with some 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.859
 well-modeled characters that showed 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.940
 fluid and credible movements 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.769
 moving in third person by 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.650
 well-reproduced scenarios and 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.220
 set we can change the angle of 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.660
 vision to not lose detail of the area 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.580
 Fahrenheit has not only kept his 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.190
 popularity but also has 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.720
 increased over the years 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.300
 still one of the most games 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.510
 interesting that we remember from the catalog 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.750
 Precision 2 and Xbox is a game that 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.430
 currently it is very difficult to find 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.229
 fahrenheit has been one of the games that 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.840
 more insistently you have asked us 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.920
 remember in this section where 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.780
 will also be heavy 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.050
 what will we remember when we analyze 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:57.390
 billion two souls and in the next 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.390
 chapter we remember water daggett
