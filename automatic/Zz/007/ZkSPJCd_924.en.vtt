00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
looking up in that with my farming

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.930 
looking up in that with my farming
strategy<00:03:04.110> all<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> recommend<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.430> play

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
strategy all I recommend you do is play

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.420 
strategy all I recommend you do is play
on<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.239> highest<00:03:06.530> difficulty<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.860> tiger<00:03:08.280> if

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
on the highest difficulty the tiger if

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.009 
on the highest difficulty the tiger if
you<00:03:08.549> are<00:03:08.700> level<00:03:08.970> 24<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.510> up<00:03:09.599> this<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.870> what<00:03:09.989> I

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
you are level 24 and up this is what I

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.870 
you are level 24 and up this is what I
recommend<00:03:10.440> if<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.769> are<00:03:10.920> less<00:03:11.160> than<00:03:11.310> 24<00:03:11.580> I

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
recommend if you are less than 24 I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.670 
recommend if you are less than 24 I
recommend<00:03:12.480> picking<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:12.959> that's<00:03:13.140> within

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
recommend picking the one that's within

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.470 
recommend picking the one that's within
one<00:03:14.010> level<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.549> your<00:03:14.730> level<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.120> because

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
one level of your level just because

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.569 
one level of your level just because
picking<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.470> higher<00:03:16.709> ones<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.130> end<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.340> dying

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
picking the higher ones you end up dying

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.400 
picking the higher ones you end up dying
a<00:03:17.760> lot<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.480> really<00:03:18.780> often<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.290> it's

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
a lot and really really often so it's

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.080 
a lot and really really often so it's
often<00:03:19.590> all<00:03:19.859> you've<00:03:19.980> wasted<00:03:20.190> time<00:03:20.549> if<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.880> put

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
often all you've wasted time if you put

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.000 
often all you've wasted time if you put
pick<00:03:21.299> one<00:03:21.450> that's<00:03:21.570> too<00:03:21.900> high<00:03:22.079> for<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.799> pick

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
pick one that's too high for you so pick

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.740 
pick one that's too high for you so pick
one<00:03:23.190> that's<00:03:23.400> pretty<00:03:23.579> much<00:03:23.730> at<00:03:23.940> your<00:03:24.180> level<00:03:24.570> or

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
one that's pretty much at your level or

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.680 
one that's pretty much at your level or
one<00:03:25.170> below<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:26.459> because<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.359> can<00:03:27.540> do<00:03:27.660> it

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
one below it just because you can do it

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.059 
one below it just because you can do it
more<00:03:27.959> efficiently<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.530> once<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.829> start

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
more efficiently and once you start

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.500 
more efficiently and once you start
getting<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.430> level<00:03:29.579> 24<00:03:30.180> play<00:03:30.359> that's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
getting to the level 24 play that's

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.270 
getting to the level 24 play that's
pretty<00:03:30.900> much<00:03:31.079> any<00:03:31.290> garden<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:31.859> find<00:03:32.130> in

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
pretty much any garden that you find in

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.610 
pretty much any garden that you find in
that<00:03:32.400> will<00:03:32.549> be<00:03:32.579> like<00:03:32.910> 25<00:03:33.269> 26<00:03:33.600> isn't<00:03:34.290> up<00:03:34.410> and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
that will be like 25 26 isn't up and

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.170 
that will be like 25 26 isn't up and
you'll<00:03:35.069> be<00:03:35.100> able<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.400> grind<00:03:35.579> out<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.790> mission

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
you'll be able to grind out the mission

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.420 
you'll be able to grind out the mission
anywhere<00:03:36.660> from<00:03:36.900> 15<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.350> 30<00:03:37.680> minutes<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.100> if

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes and if

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.800 
anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes and if
you<00:03:38.519> think<00:03:38.730> about<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.120> you'd<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.329> able<00:03:39.390> to

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
you think about it you'd be able to

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.620 
you think about it you'd be able to
actually<00:03:40.079> complete<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.190> cap<00:03:41.519> out<00:03:41.760> your<00:03:41.970> your

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
actually complete and cap out your your

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.110 
actually complete and cap out your your
amount<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.310> marks<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.519> can<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:44.940> in

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
amount of marks that you can get in

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.090 
amount of marks that you can get in
about<00:03:45.389> 8<00:03:45.630> hours<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:46.079> gameplay<00:03:46.500> if<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.920> could

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
about 8 hours of gameplay if you could

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.949 
about 8 hours of gameplay if you could
say<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.730> takes<00:03:48.150> about<00:03:48.269> half<00:03:48.420> an<00:03:48.690> hour<00:03:48.780> to

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
say that takes about half an hour to

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.020 
say that takes about half an hour to
complete<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.230> strike<00:03:49.470> mission<00:03:49.829> in<00:03:50.609> that<00:03:50.790> time

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
complete a strike mission in that time

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.640 
complete a strike mission in that time
so<00:03:51.389> that<00:03:51.690> that's<00:03:51.900> just<00:03:51.959> kind<00:03:52.170> of<00:03:52.230> an<00:03:52.350> average

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
so that that's just kind of an average

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.590 
so that that's just kind of an average
one<00:03:53.100> things<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.400> do<00:03:53.459> recommend<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.180> never

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
one things I do recommend is never

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.090 
one things I do recommend is never
playing<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.200> Mars<00:03:55.410> mission<00:03:55.739> if<00:03:55.829> you<00:03:55.920> see

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
playing on the Mars mission if you see

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.740 
playing on the Mars mission if you see
Mars<00:03:56.340> mission<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:56.940> back<00:03:57.180> out<00:03:57.389> and<00:03:57.569> leave

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
Mars mission just back out and leave

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.479 
Mars mission just back out and leave
it's<00:03:57.959> kind<00:03:58.109> of<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.230> douche<00:03:58.380> move<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:59.100> really

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
it's kind of a douche move but it really

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.539 
it's kind of a douche move but it really
is<00:03:59.850> just<00:04:00.230> takes<00:04:01.230> way<00:04:01.709> way<00:04:01.950> longer<00:04:02.160> than<00:04:02.430> any<00:04:02.519> of

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
is just takes way way longer than any of

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.830 
is just takes way way longer than any of
the<00:04:02.700> other<00:04:02.850> ones<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.180> don't<00:04:03.420> recommend<00:04:03.540> you
