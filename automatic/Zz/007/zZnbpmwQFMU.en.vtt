completely sure I address there with up
for<00:00:31.890> vice<00:00:32.099> grips<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.530> well<00:00:34.530> here's<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.640> we

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
for vice grips and well here's what we

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.770 
for vice grips and well here's what we
got

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.720 

ended<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.469> back<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.860> using<00:00:44.100> megatoon

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
ended up going back to using megatoon

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:53.029 
ended up going back to using megatoon
2.25<00:00:50.719> for<00:00:51.719> some<00:00:51.870> odd<00:00:52.020> reason<00:00:52.050> mechatronics<00:00:52.920> is

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
2.25 for some odd reason mechatronics is

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.450 
2.25 for some odd reason mechatronics is
one<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> leaders<00:00:53.579> anymore<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.129> goes

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
one of the leaders anymore so on goes

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.369 
one of the leaders anymore so on goes
the<00:00:56.489> fuel<00:00:56.850> pressure<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.390> you'll<00:00:58.079> hear<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the fuel pressure and you'll hear that

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.670 
the fuel pressure and you'll hear that
the<00:00:58.649> pump<00:00:59.309> sounds<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.850> under<00:01:00.059> load<00:01:00.180> now

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
the pump sounds like it's under load now

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.590 
the pump sounds like it's under load now
say<00:01:01.820> it's<00:01:02.820> low<00:01:03.180> tone

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.770 

and<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:07.280> maximize<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:09.370> here<00:01:10.370> we<00:01:10.460> go<00:01:10.610> 1<00:01:11.479> 2

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
and the maximize this and here we go 1 2

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.640 
and the maximize this and here we go 1 2

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:38.649 

cause<00:01:19.220> it's<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:19.550> really<00:01:20.030> loud
