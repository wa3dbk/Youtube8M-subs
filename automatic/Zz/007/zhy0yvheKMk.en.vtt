00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
track this guy is not afraid to go

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.600 
track this guy is not afraid to go
anyway<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.870> he<00:01:45.500> will<00:01:45.650> find<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.100> way<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.280> make<00:01:46.580> it

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
anyway and he will find a way to make it

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.820 
anyway and he will find a way to make it
work<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.180> later<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.840> day<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.260> works<00:01:48.620> out

work and later in the day it works out

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.650 
work and later in the day it works out
usually<00:01:49.250> because<00:01:49.520> he's<00:01:49.550> staying<00:01:49.970> out<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.510> the

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
usually because he's staying out of the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.500 
usually because he's staying out of the
deep<00:01:50.870> lines<00:01:51.260> and<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.710> rough<00:01:52.310> at<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.450> know

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
deep lines and the rough at the you know

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.120 
deep lines and the rough at the you know
the<00:01:53.600> braking<00:01:53.990> bumps<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.530> deeper<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.920> ruts

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
the braking bumps the deeper the ruts

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.060 
the braking bumps the deeper the ruts
all<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.790> combined<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:57.560> better<00:01:57.770> off<00:01:57.920> going

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
all that combined you better off going

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.620 
all that combined you better off going
the<00:01:58.220> long<00:01:58.370> way<00:01:58.400> around<00:01:58.790> where<00:01:58.970> it's<00:01:59.090> smoother

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
the long way around where it's smoother

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.010 
the long way around where it's smoother
you<00:01:59.960> make<00:02:00.110> less<00:02:00.320> mistakes<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.979> often

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
you make less mistakes and often

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.990 
you make less mistakes and often
you<00:02:03.290> just<00:02:03.500> has<00:02:03.650> his<00:02:03.799> ability<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.640> go<00:02:04.759> fast

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
you just has his ability to go fast

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.990 
you just has his ability to go fast
anyway<00:02:05.360> he<00:02:06.079> makes<00:02:06.259> it<00:02:06.409> faster<00:02:06.799> as<00:02:06.920> well<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.850> it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
anyway he makes it faster as well so it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.580 
anyway he makes it faster as well so it
might<00:02:08.090> not<00:02:08.270> be<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.539> ideal<00:02:08.569> line<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:09.380> just

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
might not be the ideal line it just

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.190 
might not be the ideal line it just
makes<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:09.979> into<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> expedite<00:02:11.270> exactly<00:02:11.930> you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200
