 the furp the foundation of the river of silver 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.700
 that by the way the foundation that promotes 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.729
 leadership with intensity and has 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.950
 sown leaders in the economy in the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.409
 politics here in argentina and outside 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.759
 Argentina Argentina did not bring it 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.840
 well the invitation of precisely the 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.000
 shape 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.590
 to that beautiful province 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.980
 jumps with his governor Juan Manuel 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.229
 young man of vision I love the 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.229
 new generation of politicians with new 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.890
 ideas with a plurality and a 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.160
 understanding that working together 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.950
 much more is achieved than imposing 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.630
 models or imposing ideas and comes to give 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.930
 a conference a conference speak 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.760
 of different topics the subject of 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.850
 Latin America to explain a little what 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.759
 happen in Mexico and talk about the relationship 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.100
 with the us and canada that has mexico 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.459
 that's the way I've greatly enjoyed 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.730
 those three days there in in jumps the weather 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.530
 wonderful wonderful people and it's the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.860
 province that I esteem so much and both 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.860
 I want 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.470
 see one of the problems of that country 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.670
 Mexico is the drug trade 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.080
 that here in the Argentine Republic 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.630
 it also has us worried we can 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.110
 tell how the drug issue is today 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.330
 in your country although well it is a very 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.730
 special for mexico because we are not a 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.430
 drug producing country 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.459
 we produce very little we are not a country 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.549
 drug user and yet there 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.379
 we are in the middle of the gigantic market 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.680
 of the drug in the United States and the 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:00.340
 Canada and the drug producers to 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.610
 South as Venezuela as Colombia as 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.620
 Bolivia as Ecuador and better the touch 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.709
 be in the middle of this circumstance and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.599
 be facing a problem that is 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.970
 really serious and that is 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:17.200
 wearing our nation without 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.720
 deserve it and therefore what we are is 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.769
 looking for exits get out of this trap in 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.010
 which we are before it gets more 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.069
 complex the situation in our country 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.609
 that gigantic consumer market of the 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.120
 United States generates 50 billion 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:42.430
 dollars per year themselves that are collected in 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:46.020
 USA come to Mexico already washed in the USA 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.680
 they are used to bribe policemen over 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.290
 public officials bribe to 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.370
 a lot of people in mexico are used 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.900
 to hire many young people who very 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.600
 unfortunately for lack of employment and 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.050
 opportunities fall into this trap and by 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:09.270
 little money are passed to the ranks of 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.310
 crime so the fight is final it 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.710
 is following a strategy that until 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.280
 the date has not worked we have already 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:22.530
 almost five years where there have been 45,000 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.820
 dead 45,000 45,000 dead mostly 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:30.030
 young people between 15 and 25 years old 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.550
 imagine your other 45 thousand who killed them 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.430
 and many others who are working to 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.580
 the cartels really is a sangria 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.580
 huge for mexico if I saw that one of the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.310
 characters is narco is 12 years old 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.300
 and it has sprouted and caused killings 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.969
 impressive 12 years if there are now 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.210
 I do not like to point out guilty and 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.349
 make judgments because all those people nor 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.949
 has even gone through a process 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:01.530
 judicial still and is watching a lot 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.599
 violation of human rights there is the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.460
 direct intervention by the army that does not 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.009
 is prepared to do homework 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.349
 police and therefore the solutions 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.830
 that until today have been raised not 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:16.830
 seem to resolve the issue I think there 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.620
 to be more radical, it seems to me that 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.710
 urgent measure is no longer just discuss 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.569
 but proceed to structure a path in 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.039
 the way to legalizing 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.740
 drugs are you in favor of the 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:30.120
 legalization if totally that will be 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.979
 changed then his speech when 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.930
 this was president will be totally in 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.930
 against drugs the companies the 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.779
 fought strongly something has varied in 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.909
 Soils not now not in my conception but 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.009
 that if there is a law, it must be fulfilled and 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.870
 If the law prohibits drugs, you have to 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.820
 comply with that law 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.370
 my proposal now is to change the 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.830
 law so that then the 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.580
 circumstances because I think it has 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:00.570
 first ethical and moral aspects 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:03.780
 fundamental because if you want that 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.180
 you live in freedom and exercise that 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.640
 freedom with responsibility as there 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.980
 that remove the prohibitions and leave 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.610
 that the citizen himself his family the 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.700
 educational system educate us 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.500
 report of each action that for example 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.960
 they have been collapsing all the 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.000
 prohibitions today smoking is worth and there 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.300
 tens of thousands of deaths from smoking in 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.450
 excess and alcohol is worth it since 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.610
 back in the USA the promotion was removed and 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.010
 holy remedy for violence when 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.500
 alcohol consumption was authorized today the 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.680
 Free sex today abortion or marriage 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.440
 between people of the same sex have left 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.380
 of being prohibited is curious that in the 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.020
 drug is perhaps the last frontier of 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.180
 the prohibitions then ask the 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.020
 been asking the government that he 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.660
 order 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.460
 to prevent our children from having 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.349
 access to drugs is to ask 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.650
 Too much I think it's something that 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:03.870
 is never going to achieve the drugs are 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.599
 there will still be there and what 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:10.199
 we prevent our children that the 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:11.819
 young people that consumers understand 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:15.770
 well how serious is it to consume a drug 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.770
 and stop doing the present
