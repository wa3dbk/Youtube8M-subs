00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello everyone and I hope you are 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.860
 very good I'm here again in this 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.719
 I bring you a hall so let's go to 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.459
 start I hope you like it good not what 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.100
 I said but the goals is for clothes or 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.810
 good clothes and accessories almost everything is 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.330
 of primark and first of all I'm going 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.890
 to teach these socks that are from 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.750
 these invisible little ones 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.119
 well it was a pack of three what happens 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.920
 that the other one I think was a panda bear 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.410
 in black and white plan but I gave it to him 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.030
 my mother and I stayed these little ones and 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.060
 bunny whites 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.430
 and this is that I do not know what a tiger is or 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.200
 or something like that it 's in brown tones and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.330
 White 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.330
 Well, those are socks 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.090
 invisible to wear it with tennis like this 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.880
 short or with some type of sneaker 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.350
 that you do not want it to obviously look like 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.120
 sock but maybe not what 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 You can take with nothing and I thought they were 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.489
 so cute that I chose it were also 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 in solid colors and in stripes but I 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.420
 they liked the little animals and the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.640
 I think it was about three 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.920
 euros I think the pack of these espadrilles 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 I already have similar ones or they are not 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.880
 the same ones that are not striped blue 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.509
 marine and that's how the sole is 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.210
 like hemp that I do not know what it is 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.740
 because it's just the border of the sole of 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.420
 others 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.930
 the gummy 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.580
 and well they are the typical espadrilles 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.100
 of white strips and a coral because 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.240
 it is neither red nor pink 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.659
 and the price 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.659
 this week opens 25 euros 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.040
 the truth is that he had said that 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.490
 you have not released but I have blue 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.140
 marine are super comfortable it goes great and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.880
 for the summer I think they are very 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.880
 chulas I also took these shoes 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.229
 and it is so brown and blue stripes 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.289
 marine and white with the cord and what 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.289
 is the border this as well as in leatherette 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.430
 and well it is a kind of demo almost 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.250
 as nautical because when wearing the cord 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.760
 He cited as nautical type also super 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.730
 comfortable because very soft and I 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.230
 It cost eight euros after I wanted to look 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.150
 some backpacks and how there is also 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.680
 very well priced because I do not know either 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.720
 I carry backpack every day simply 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.360
 so to vary and not go somewhere 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.070
 with a bag then change the backpack but 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.010
 that is a little bit will be to dress 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.450
 a sport backpack my uncle gave me 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.170
 two from there 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.319
 this is so super soft 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.980
 very cool brown because he also makes type 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.420
 leatherette 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.420
 with the pockets here 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.330
 basic and its price is 13 euros 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.190
 and this other one that is kind to know the 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.130
 appearance is like crochet or something 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.910
 that then in the crochet but not the 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.220
 crochet is as it is durito as esparto 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.510
 also a pipe or whatever it is that it does not 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.950
 I understand it a lot about fabrics and good 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.100
 It takes to follow the details 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.290
 laces and that and the handles in color 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.480
 light brown not like camel 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.060
 closes with square brackets 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.060
 and this price is ten euros 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.470
 I loved both of them and I'm sure that 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.810
 He took a lot of game later also 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.909
 I wanted a basic denim shirt for 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.349
 take it mainly 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.480
 unbuttoned but also how some 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.610
 moment under holes or whatever 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.470
 and I caught is also in primark 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.890
 what's wrong with it 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.220
 a very dark blue and light blue 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.220
 Clear 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.220
 the damn ones I'm usually less 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.220
 floor fold 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.290
 the truth is that it is very cool 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:29.480
 and it cost me eleven euros later in inside 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:35.570
 this little thing that I now so hurry gives 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:37.580
 with the lace and a brace today these 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.460
 neighbors how they scream 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.849
 and so the sleeve looks the shoulder by the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.189
 little hole is a bit long 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.039
 but come on it has a perfect measure to 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:52.409
 I really like the colors I do not know if it 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.919
 you will see well it is like bill gates because not 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:57.119
 It's white and it cost me 12 12 euros yes 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.129
 because with the discounts that they make 

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:01.800
 take that he stayed in 12 and I also caught 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.039
 this basic tee 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.419
 with the fold milestones here in the sleeve 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.569
 then and how velvet is pretty 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.990
 short but I also can not see the 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.340
 navel I think we see not the premiered but 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.139
 well, it seems super cool to me 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.080
 Touch is very nice and to wear it 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.090
 because inside like that it was a high trouser 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.300
 or simply because with some shorts for 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.849
 summer I liked it a lot and I think that 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.460
 I stayed at seven euros and something yes 7 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:32.090
 did not get to 8 euros I wanted some 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.440
 high waisted high waist pants 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.969
 so I fucked these pull and bear 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.830
 that we have not released because I know 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.160
 buy very little 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.150
 and they are like that 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.600
 as you can see from high waist shot 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.600
 high let's go 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.659
 I liked them a lot because they are from 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.340
 cotton and also carry the astana are 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.430
 elastic but carry a percentage 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.710
 quite tall cotton and that's why they are 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.229
 very nice to wear is that way 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.669
 adjusted and also what I liked a lot 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.960
 is that I do not have long left 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.389
 perfect to the ankle because they are 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.400
 ankles another thing that I loved 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.400
 and they have that yes the little ones 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.440
 great and its price is 25 with 99 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.790
 and well these have been my purchases until 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.650
 that the hall has arrived I hope that you 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.450
 I liked it if you want to leave me 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.430
 Any comment question you already know

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.120
