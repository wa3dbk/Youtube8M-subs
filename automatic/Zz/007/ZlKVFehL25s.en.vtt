00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.350 

for<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.830> video<00:00:20.189> we're<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.790> to<00:00:20.880> do<00:00:21.090> an

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
for this video we're going to do an

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.940 
for this video we're going to do an
operation<00:00:21.480> video<00:00:22.230> we're<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.619> actually

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
operation video we're going to actually

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.550 
operation video we're going to actually
go<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.790> water<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.360> show<00:00:25.290> you<00:00:25.349> how<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
go out on the water and show you how to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.240 
go out on the water and show you how to
use<00:00:25.770> a<00:00:25.800> hydro<00:00:26.070> rain<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:28.259> variable<00:00:28.860> axis

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
use a hydro rain the variable axis

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.550 
use a hydro rain the variable axis
feature<00:00:29.610> allows<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.450> to<00:00:30.480> adjust<00:00:31.079> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
feature allows you to adjust the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.160 
feature allows you to adjust the
inclination<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> vein<00:00:32.910> based<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
inclination of the vein based on the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.710 
inclination of the vein based on the
conditions<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.340> light<00:00:35.880> airs<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.540> have

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
conditions so in light airs we can have

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.139 
conditions so in light airs we can have
the<00:00:36.840> vein<00:00:37.050> upright<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.370> maximum<00:00:38.880> sensitivity

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the vein upright for maximum sensitivity

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.110 
the vein upright for maximum sensitivity
and<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.829> heavy<00:00:41.070> heavy<00:00:41.519> weather<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:42.090> can

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and for heavy heavy weather we can

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.330 
and for heavy heavy weather we can
actually<00:00:42.690> deep<00:00:42.930> power<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.379> vein<00:00:43.590> by<00:00:43.859> raking

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
actually deep power the vein by raking

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.209 
actually deep power the vein by raking
the<00:00:44.460> axes<00:00:44.879> aft<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.570> locking<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> knob

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the axes aft and locking down the knob

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.439 
the axes aft and locking down the knob
so<00:00:47.760> you're<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.230> desensitizing<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.530> vein<00:00:50.449> so

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
so you're just desensitizing the vein so

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270 
so you're just desensitizing the vein so
the<00:00:51.570> next<00:00:51.809> control<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> ratio<00:00:52.620> control

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the next control is the ratio control

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
the next control is the ratio control
and<00:00:53.489> what<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.300> does<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.899> actually<00:00:55.230> allows

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and what this does is it actually allows

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.189 
and what this does is it actually allows
you<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.039> tune<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.030> vein<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> conditions

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
you to tune the vein for the conditions

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
you to tune the vein for the conditions
so<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.800> either<00:00:58.980> add<00:00:59.280> power<00:00:59.670> or<00:00:59.969> take<00:01:00.179> away

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
so you can either add power or take away

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.139 
so you can either add power or take away
power<00:01:00.629> from<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.079> vein<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.059> in

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
power from the vein so right now it's in

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.939 
power from the vein so right now it's in
the<00:01:03.239> far<00:01:03.449> right<00:01:03.629> position<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.559> neutral

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the far right position which is neutral

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.090 
the far right position which is neutral
just<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:05.940> disengaged<00:01:06.710> that's<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.920> emergency

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
just or disengaged that's your emergency

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.600 
just or disengaged that's your emergency
steering<00:01:08.790> option<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.840> need<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> use<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
steering option if you need to use it

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.220 
steering option if you need to use it
and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:11.940> we<00:01:12.180> go<00:01:12.300> all<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.540> way<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.020> left

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
and then we go all the way to the left

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.500 
and then we go all the way to the left
for<00:01:13.830> light<00:01:14.040> errors<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.580> light<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.210> moderate

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
for light errors to light to moderate

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.540 
for light errors to light to moderate
conditions<00:01:16.050> that's<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.980> three<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.370> ratio

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
conditions that's a three to one ratio

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.540 
conditions that's a three to one ratio
here<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.480> it<00:01:18.600> gives<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> maximum<00:01:19.170> power<00:01:19.740> but

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
here so it gives you maximum power but

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.280 
here so it gives you maximum power but
least<00:01:20.820> amount<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.270> rudder<00:01:21.480> deflection<00:01:22.110> from

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
least amount a rudder deflection from

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.610 
least amount a rudder deflection from
side<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.860> which<00:01:23.160> is<00:01:23.310> 15<00:01:23.700> degrees

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
side to side which is 15 degrees

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.960 
side to side which is 15 degrees
moderate<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.770> heavy<00:01:25.980> conditions<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:26.910> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
moderate to heavy conditions we go to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.470 
moderate to heavy conditions we go to
the<00:01:27.120> middle<00:01:27.390> setting<00:01:27.650> that's<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> one

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
the middle setting that's two to one

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.510 
the middle setting that's two to one
ratio<00:01:30.480> and<00:01:31.020> gives<00:01:31.170> us<00:01:31.290> 25<00:01:31.800> degrees<00:01:32.280> rudder

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
ratio and gives us 25 degrees rudder

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
ratio and gives us 25 degrees rudder
deflection<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.260> real<00:01:34.500> extreme

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
deflection and then in real extreme

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.070 
deflection and then in real extreme
conditions<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.900> one

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
conditions you can go to the one to one

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.630 
conditions you can go to the one to one
setting<00:01:37.530> which<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.070> least<00:01:38.220> amount<00:01:38.490> of

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
setting which is the least amount of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480 
setting which is the least amount of
power<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.660> most<00:01:39.870> amount<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.490> rudder

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
power but the most amount of rudder

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.880 
power but the most amount of rudder
deflection<00:01:42.090> from<00:01:42.360> side<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.690> side<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.800> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
deflection from side to side so you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
deflection from side to side so you
basically<00:01:44.190> put<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.940> setting<00:01:45.240> most

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
basically put it in the setting most

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
basically put it in the setting most
sailing<00:01:46.320> you're<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
sailing you're going to have it in the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.780 
sailing you're going to have it in the
far<00:01:47.520> left<00:01:47.850> setting<00:01:49.100> for<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.580> your

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
far left setting for you know your

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550 
far left setting for you know your
average<00:01:50.940> conditions<00:01:51.690> average<00:01:52.110> downwind

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
average conditions average downwind

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.980 
average conditions average downwind
conditions

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.360 

so<00:02:01.990> we're<00:02:02.140> out<00:02:02.260> on<00:02:02.410> the<00:02:02.500> water<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.980> beautiful

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
so we're out on the water and beautiful

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.490 
so we're out on the water and beautiful
burrard<00:02:03.700> inlet<00:02:04.090> we've<00:02:04.900> got<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.260> sails

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
burrard inlet we've got the sails

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.420 
burrard inlet we've got the sails
balanced<00:02:06.190> right<00:02:06.970> now<00:02:07.150> we're<00:02:07.920> close<00:02:08.920> hauling

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
balanced right now we're close hauling

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.790 
balanced right now we're close hauling
to<00:02:09.610> close<00:02:09.820> reaching<00:02:10.650> somewhere<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.740> between

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
to close reaching somewhere in between

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.220 
to close reaching somewhere in between
we've<00:02:12.310> locked<00:02:12.550> off<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.090> main<00:02:13.270> rudder<00:02:13.570> in<00:02:13.870> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
we've locked off the main rudder in that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.250 
we've locked off the main rudder in that
sweet<00:02:14.500> spot<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.920> balances<00:02:15.340> out<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.520> boat

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
sweet spot that balances out the boat

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.900 
sweet spot that balances out the boat
we'll<00:02:17.260> come<00:02:17.470> back<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:18.100> we<00:02:18.370> get<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.640> leading

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
we'll come back here we get the leading

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.790 
we'll come back here we get the leading
edge<00:02:19.060> leading<00:02:19.630> edge<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.900> vein<00:02:20.080> into<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> wind

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
edge leading edge the vein into the wind

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.530 
edge leading edge the vein into the wind
whenever<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.640> vane<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.970> standing<00:02:22.360> tall

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
whenever the vane is standing tall

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.560 
whenever the vane is standing tall
you're<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:22.990> course<00:02:23.290> according<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> vein

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
you're on course according to the vein

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.090 
you're on course according to the vein
so<00:02:25.570> what<00:02:25.780> we'll<00:02:25.900> do<00:02:26.050> is<00:02:26.170> we'll<00:02:26.320> engage<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.860> all

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
so what we'll do is we'll engage it all

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.160 
so what we'll do is we'll engage it all
the<00:02:27.340> way<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.640> left<00:02:27.880> for<00:02:28.720> maximum

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
the way to the left for maximum

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.949 
the way to the left for maximum
sensitivity<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:30.070> maximum<00:02:30.459> power<00:02:30.840> we've<00:02:31.840> got

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
sensitivity and maximum power we've got

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.870 
sensitivity and maximum power we've got
the<00:02:32.050> vein<00:02:32.230> standing<00:02:32.709> tall<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.430> now<00:02:33.730> what

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
the vein standing tall and now what

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.300 
the vein standing tall and now what
happens<00:02:34.240> is<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.480> boat<00:02:34.630> falls<00:02:34.900> off<00:02:35.110> course<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
happens is the boat falls off course the

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.370 
happens is the boat falls off course the
leading<00:02:36.670> edge<00:02:36.850> moves<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:37.750> side<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.020> side

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
leading edge moves from side to side

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.590 
leading edge moves from side to side
which<00:02:39.130> moves<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.610> rudder<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.180> keeps<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
which moves the rudder and keeps the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.630 
which moves the rudder and keeps the
boat<00:02:40.750> on<00:02:40.870> course<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.980> have<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.310> remember

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
boat on course so you have to remember

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.250 
boat on course so you have to remember
that<00:02:42.730> you're<00:02:42.850> always<00:02:43.060> steering<00:02:43.690> an<00:02:43.810> apparent

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
that you're always steering an apparent

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.690 
that you're always steering an apparent
wind<00:02:44.410> based<00:02:44.650> course<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.190> if<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> wind<00:02:45.610> shifts

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
wind based course so if the wind shifts

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.790 
wind based course so if the wind shifts
10<00:02:46.120> degrees<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:47.080> vanes<00:02:47.290> are<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.620> follow

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
10 degrees the vanes are going to follow

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.820 
10 degrees the vanes are going to follow
if<00:02:48.340> there's<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.790> dramatic<00:02:48.970> sail<00:02:49.570> wind<00:02:50.560> shift

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
if there's a dramatic sail wind shift

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.380 
if there's a dramatic sail wind shift
you<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.070> actually<00:02:51.340> use<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.850> remote<00:02:52.120> course

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
you can actually use the remote course

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.990 
you can actually use the remote course
sighting<00:02:52.720> line<00:02:52.900> by<00:02:53.500> moving<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.950> vane<00:02:54.160> which

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
sighting line by moving the vane which

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.610 
sighting line by moving the vane which
puts<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.360> vane<00:02:55.510> hard<00:02:55.780> over<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.290> gets<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.590> on

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
puts the vane hard over and gets you on

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.070 
puts the vane hard over and gets you on
the<00:02:56.740> course<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.220> want<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.520> be<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.630> but

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
the course that you want to be on so but

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.020 
the course that you want to be on so but
usually<00:02:59.740> once<00:02:59.980> you've<00:03:00.130> got<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.400> vane<00:03:00.580> set<00:03:00.880> up

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
usually once you've got the vane set up

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.800 
usually once you've got the vane set up
properly<00:03:02.400> it'll<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.700> stand<00:03:03.970> tall<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.540> do<00:03:04.690> it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
properly it'll just stand tall and do it

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.670 
properly it'll just stand tall and do it
it's<00:03:05.200> small<00:03:05.620> tweaking<00:03:06.160> from<00:03:06.430> side<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.910> side<00:03:07.680> so

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
it's small tweaking from side to side so

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.110 
it's small tweaking from side to side so
that's<00:03:08.890> kind<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.340> motion<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.850> should<00:03:10.030> be

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
that's kind of the motion you should be

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.210 
that's kind of the motion you should be
looking<00:03:10.450> for<00:03:10.720> if<00:03:10.959> it's<00:03:11.500> constantly<00:03:12.070> getting

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
looking for if it's constantly getting

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.130 
looking for if it's constantly getting
pinned<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.790> one<00:03:12.970> side<00:03:13.300> then<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.810> know<00:03:13.959> that

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
pinned to one side then you know that

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.600 
pinned to one side then you know that
you<00:03:14.230> haven't<00:03:14.440> engaged<00:03:14.680> on<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> right<00:03:15.370> point

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
you haven't engaged on the right point

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.280 
you haven't engaged on the right point
of<00:03:15.700> sail<00:03:17.489> another<00:03:18.489> big<00:03:18.790> feature<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.989> hydro

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
of sail another big feature of the hydro

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.960 
of sail another big feature of the hydro
vane<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.769> fact<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.250> also<00:03:21.400> doubles<00:03:21.910> as

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
vane is the fact that it also doubles as

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.870 
vane is the fact that it also doubles as
an<00:03:22.120> emergency<00:03:22.480> rudder<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.459> did<00:03:24.670> have

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
an emergency rudder so if you did have

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.280 
an emergency rudder so if you did have
problems<00:03:25.269> with<00:03:25.390> your<00:03:25.540> steering<00:03:25.810> whether<00:03:26.080> it's

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
problems with your steering whether it's

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.759 
problems with your steering whether it's
a<00:03:26.380> quadrant<00:03:26.830> failure<00:03:27.250> hydraulic<00:03:27.880> failure

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
a quadrant failure hydraulic failure

a quadrant failure hydraulic failure
something<00:03:29.769> happen<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.100> your<00:03:30.190> main<00:03:30.400> rudder

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
something happen to your main rudder

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.250 
something happen to your main rudder
you've<00:03:30.910> always<00:03:31.060> got<00:03:31.330> that<00:03:31.450> fallback<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:31.959> all

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
you've always got that fallback and all

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.110 
you've always got that fallback and all
you<00:03:32.410> have<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.709> do<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:33.070> disengage<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.760> unit

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
you have to do is disengage the unit

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.540 
you have to do is disengage the unit
right<00:03:34.810> here<00:03:34.870> putting<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.800> ratio<00:03:36.100> knob<00:03:36.310> so

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
right here putting the ratio knob so

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.120 
right here putting the ratio knob so
it's<00:03:36.670> disengaged<00:03:37.260> then<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.470> rudder<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.860> free

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
it's disengaged then the rudder is free

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.250 
it's disengaged then the rudder is free
trailing<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.300> what<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.570> can<00:03:40.750> do<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.110> can

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
trailing and what you can do is you can

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.840 
trailing and what you can do is you can
take<00:03:41.380> your<00:03:41.530> bilge<00:03:41.799> pump<00:03:42.100> handle<00:03:42.489> which<00:03:42.670> is<00:03:42.700> a

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
take your bilge pump handle which is a

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.830 
take your bilge pump handle which is a
3/4<00:03:43.510> inch<00:03:43.540> OD<00:03:44.130> slide<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.340> inside<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:46.299> hydro

3/4 inch OD slide it inside the hydro
vane<00:03:47.400> tiller<00:03:48.400> stub<00:03:51.239> just<00:03:52.239> like<00:03:52.420> that

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
vane tiller stub just like that

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.870 
vane tiller stub just like that
and<00:03:53.019> now<00:03:53.709> we've<00:03:53.890> got<00:03:54.040> emergency<00:03:54.280> tiller<00:03:54.700> and

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
and now we've got emergency tiller and

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.910 
and now we've got emergency tiller and
rudder<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.540> we<00:03:55.690> can<00:03:55.870> actually<00:03:56.049> steer<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.709> boat

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920

modern boats you know all most of them
having<00:04:05.110> Spade<00:04:05.410> rudders<00:04:05.830> your<00:04:06.040> rudder<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.370> more

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
having Spade rudders your rudder is more

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.180 
having Spade rudders your rudder is more
vulnerable<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.120> hitting<00:04:07.480> something

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
vulnerable to hitting something

damage or shaft failure or whatever it

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.350 
damage or shaft failure or whatever it
is<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:10.530> having<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.550> Hydra<00:04:11.880> vein<00:04:12.030> as<00:04:12.240> an

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
is so having the Hydra vein as an

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.390 
is so having the Hydra vein as an
emergency<00:04:12.810> rudder<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.320> a<00:04:13.350> big<00:04:13.650> big<00:04:14.130> feature

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
emergency rudder is a big big feature

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.039 
emergency rudder is a big big feature
and<00:04:14.700> gives<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:14.970> lot<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.210> confidence<00:04:15.690> when

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
and gives you a lot of confidence when

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.310 
and gives you a lot of confidence when
you're<00:04:16.230> sailing<00:04:16.739> beyond<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.190> horizon<00:04:18.320> one

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
you're sailing beyond the horizon one

you're sailing beyond the horizon one
one<00:04:19.709> other<00:04:19.860> feature<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.370> did<00:04:20.670> want<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.940> mention

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
one other feature I did want to mention

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.720 
one other feature I did want to mention
is<00:04:21.510> that<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.840> can<00:04:22.019> also<00:04:22.230> hook<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.650> tiller<00:04:23.190> pilot

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
is that you can also hook a tiller pilot

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.440 
is that you can also hook a tiller pilot
onto<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.630> Hydra<00:04:24.960> vein<00:04:25.140> tiller<00:04:25.980> and<00:04:26.450> that's

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
onto the Hydra vein tiller and that's

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.540 
onto the Hydra vein tiller and that's
also<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.960> great<00:04:28.170> thing<00:04:28.290> because<00:04:28.830> you<00:04:29.070> know<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.520> a

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
also a great thing because you know to a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.450 
also a great thing because you know to a
pilots<00:04:29.970> are<00:04:30.090> relatively<00:04:30.540> inexpensive

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
pilots are relatively inexpensive

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.550 
pilots are relatively inexpensive
because<00:04:32.460> it's<00:04:32.850> pushing<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.420> semi<00:04:34.050> balanced

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
because it's pushing a semi balanced

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.560 
because it's pushing a semi balanced
rudder<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.370> know<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.640> loads<00:04:35.880> on<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.180> are<00:04:36.420> very

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
rudder you know the loads on it are very

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.840 
rudder you know the loads on it are very
small<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.020> any<00:04:37.470> tiller<00:04:37.830> pilot<00:04:38.280> will<00:04:38.400> drive<00:04:38.610> it

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
small so any tiller pilot will drive it

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.520 
small so any tiller pilot will drive it
and<00:04:39.090> what<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:39.660> do<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:40.140> just<00:04:40.170> have<00:04:40.410> your

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
and what you do is you just have your

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.010 
and what you do is you just have your
tulip<00:04:40.980> pilot<00:04:41.400> mounted<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.540> stern<00:04:42.780> rail

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
tulip pilot mounted on the stern rail

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.200 
tulip pilot mounted on the stern rail
somewhere<00:04:43.500> about<00:04:43.680> here<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.280> drive<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:45.060> right

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
somewhere about here and drive it right

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.570 
somewhere about here and drive it right
on<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.750> tiller<00:04:46.230> so<00:04:46.590> when<00:04:46.770> you're<00:04:46.920> motoring

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
on to the tiller so when you're motoring

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.600 
on to the tiller so when you're motoring
or<00:04:47.970> light<00:04:48.390> airs<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:49.260> actually<00:04:49.860> will<00:04:50.070> control

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
or light airs it actually will control

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.300 
or light airs it actually will control
the<00:04:50.790> hydro<00:04:51.090> vein<00:04:51.240> rudder<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.870> you've<00:04:52.740> got<00:04:52.950> an

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the hydro vein rudder and you've got an

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.310 
the hydro vein rudder and you've got an
auto<00:04:53.520> pilot<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> relatively<00:04:54.960> inexpensive

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
auto pilot so a relatively inexpensive

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.300 
auto pilot so a relatively inexpensive
way<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:56.700> have<00:04:56.910> an<00:04:57.300> auto<00:04:57.540> pilot<00:04:57.810> on<00:04:58.740> top<00:04:59.070> of

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
way to have an auto pilot on top of

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.980 
way to have an auto pilot on top of
you're<00:04:59.460> having<00:04:59.970> an<00:05:00.090> emergency<00:05:00.240> rudder<00:05:00.720> and

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
you're having an emergency rudder and

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.630 
you're having an emergency rudder and
the<00:05:01.080> soft<00:05:01.440> steering<00:05:01.860> for<00:05:02.070> wind<00:05:02.220> beam<00:05:02.400> so

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
the soft steering for wind beam so

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.830 
the soft steering for wind beam so
you're<00:05:02.790> essentially<00:05:03.240> killing<00:05:03.600> three<00:05:03.810> birds

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
you're essentially killing three birds

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.150 
you're essentially killing three birds
in<00:05:04.230> one<00:05:04.260> stone<00:05:04.410> by<00:05:04.800> having<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.160> knife<00:05:06.500> so<00:05:07.500> here

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
in one stone by having a knife so here

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.010 
in one stone by having a knife so here
we've<00:05:08.340> got<00:05:08.370> our<00:05:08.640> remote<00:05:09.270> core<00:05:09.540> setting<00:05:09.840> line

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
we've got our remote core setting line

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.690 
we've got our remote core setting line
which<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.470> basically<00:05:10.800> just<00:05:10.920> an<00:05:11.190> endless<00:05:11.490> loop

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
which is basically just an endless loop

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.550 
which is basically just an endless loop
going<00:05:12.060> back<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.540> unit<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.080> we've

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
going back to the unit and we've

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.500 
going back to the unit and we've
attached<00:05:13.919> it<00:05:14.130> onto<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.430> bungee<00:05:14.940> cord<00:05:14.970> which<00:05:15.480> is

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
attached it onto a bungee cord which is

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.450 
attached it onto a bungee cord which is
just<00:05:15.870> keeps<00:05:16.080> enough<00:05:16.350> tension<00:05:16.680> on<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.010> so<00:05:17.310> that

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
just keeps enough tension on it so that

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.130 
just keeps enough tension on it so that
it's<00:05:17.580> not<00:05:17.730> going<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:17.970> skip<00:05:18.240> off<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.600> worm<00:05:18.780> over

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
it's not going to skip off the worm over

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.100 
it's not going to skip off the worm over
there<00:05:19.320> and<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.330> nice<00:05:21.540> feature<00:05:21.780> because

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
there and this is a nice feature because

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.960 
there and this is a nice feature because
if<00:05:22.290> it's<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.919> know<00:05:22.950> if<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.190> weather<00:05:23.370> is<00:05:23.490> nasty

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
if it's you know if the weather is nasty

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.550 
if it's you know if the weather is nasty
out<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.330> can<00:05:24.510> be<00:05:24.630> hiding<00:05:25.080> under<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.350> dodger

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
out you can be hiding under the dodger

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.900 
out you can be hiding under the dodger
and<00:05:25.830> if<00:05:26.010> you<00:05:26.130> want<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.370> change<00:05:26.580> your<00:05:26.760> course

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
and if you want to change your course

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.110 
and if you want to change your course
ten<00:05:27.240> degrees<00:05:27.570> all<00:05:28.080> you<00:05:28.380> do<00:05:28.500> is<00:05:28.620> lean<00:05:28.860> over<00:05:29.130> tug

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
ten degrees all you do is lean over tug

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.050 
ten degrees all you do is lean over tug
the<00:05:30.300> line<00:05:30.510> and<00:05:31.320> you're<00:05:31.860> done<00:05:32.040> rather<00:05:32.940> than

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
the line and you're done rather than

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.970 
the line and you're done rather than
having<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.450> go<00:05:33.570> back<00:05:33.600> and<00:05:33.990> forth<00:05:34.260> between<00:05:34.500> the

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
having to go back and forth between the

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.390 
having to go back and forth between the
back<00:05:35.490> of<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:35.760> boat<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.210> where<00:05:36.810> you<00:05:36.960> are<00:05:37.140> so<00:05:37.560> a

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
back of the boat and where you are so a

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.520 
back of the boat and where you are so a
lot<00:05:38.790> of<00:05:38.820> people<00:05:39.030> don't<00:05:39.780> run<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.140> all<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.350> way

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
lot of people don't run it all the way

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.170 
lot of people don't run it all the way
down<00:05:40.710> I<00:05:40.919> like<00:05:41.100> to<00:05:41.250> have<00:05:41.370> it<00:05:41.490> run<00:05:41.669> as<00:05:41.820> far<00:05:42.000> as

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
down I like to have it run as far as

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.850 
down I like to have it run as far as
possible<00:05:42.390> so<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:42.990> can<00:05:43.110> reach<00:05:43.320> from<00:05:43.500> anywhere

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
possible so you can reach from anywhere
