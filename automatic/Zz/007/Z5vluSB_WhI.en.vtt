00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.730 
try and keep this to a real minimum now
I<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.689> think<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.080> really<00:01:22.290> important<00:01:22.680> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
I do think it's really important you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
I do think it's really important you
interact<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.310> your<00:01:23.520> crowd<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.479> think

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
interact with your crowd but I think

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.120 
interact with your crowd but I think
maybe<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> microphone<00:01:25.530> isn't<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> best<00:01:25.979> way

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
maybe the microphone isn't the best way

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
maybe the microphone isn't the best way
to<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> sometimes<00:01:27.420> stepping<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.110> from

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to do it sometimes stepping out from

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.870 
to do it sometimes stepping out from
behind<00:01:28.320> your<00:01:28.799> DJ<00:01:29.130> booth<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.520> actually<00:01:29.759> going

behind your DJ booth are actually going

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
behind your DJ booth are actually going
to<00:01:30.000> talk<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> people<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.229> best<00:01:31.439> way<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
to talk to the people is the best way to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
to talk to the people is the best way to
get<00:01:32.460> an<00:01:32.579> interaction<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.270> audience<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
get an interaction with your audience so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.630 
get an interaction with your audience so
I<00:01:34.350> try<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.680> keep<00:01:34.799> an<00:01:34.979> announcements<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
I try and keep an announcements on the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.340 
I try and keep an announcements on the
microphone<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> minimum<00:01:36.570> unless<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.049> need<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
microphone to a minimum unless I need to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.719 
microphone to a minimum unless I need to
give<00:01:37.530> everyone<00:01:37.799> some<00:01:38.130> important<00:01:38.520> information

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
give everyone some important information

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
give everyone some important information
or<00:01:39.240> possibly<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.930> occasional<00:01:40.380> song<00:01:40.560> request

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
or possibly the occasional song request

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.100 
or possibly the occasional song request
nothing<00:01:41.729> kills<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.150> mood<00:01:42.270> more<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> dance

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
nothing kills the mood more on the dance

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
nothing kills the mood more on the dance
floor<00:01:43.259> than<00:01:43.619> absolute<00:01:44.100> silence<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
floor than absolute silence so what I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.460 
floor than absolute silence so what I
try<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.869> when<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.140> making<00:01:46.380> an

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
try and do is when I'm making an

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.139 
try and do is when I'm making an
announcement<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.340> talk<00:01:47.520> over<00:01:47.640> music
