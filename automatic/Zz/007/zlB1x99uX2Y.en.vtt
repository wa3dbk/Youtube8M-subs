really good um I changed amount of the
settings<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.729> bit<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.030> now<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.420> sounds

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
settings a little bit so now it sounds

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.350 
settings a little bit so now it sounds
different<00:01:13.140> than<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.380> would<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.760> if

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
different than it would be if it was if

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.789 
different than it would be if it was if
the<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.720> didn't<00:01:16.170> mess<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.320> any<00:01:16.650> other

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
how good I can make one if it doesn't

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.990 
how good I can make one if it doesn't
work<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.549> doesn't<00:01:44.579> work<00:01:44.880> well<00:01:46.100> but<00:01:47.100> yeah<00:01:47.340> so

much<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.950> say<00:01:53.100> about<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.119> studio

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

condenser<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.570> picks<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:58.079> ambient<00:01:58.890> noises

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.880 
condenser so it picks up ambient noises
sometimes<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.290> turn<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.619> gain<00:02:01.860> up

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
sometimes you have to turn the gain up

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.350 
sometimes you have to turn the gain up
we<00:02:02.280> allowed<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> pop

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
filter like I do you would need to turn

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.760

up<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> gain<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.509> board<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.590> pick

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770
