deterioration<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.080> material<00:03:50.680> um<00:03:50.920> just

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
deterioration of the material um just

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.570 
deterioration of the material um just
from<00:03:52.240> putting<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.840> in<00:03:52.930> taking<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.470> off<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.250> I

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
from putting it in taking it off so I

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.970 
from putting it in taking it off so I
think<00:03:54.760> it'd<00:03:55.060> be<00:03:55.090> much<00:03:56.050> better<00:03:56.260> they<00:03:56.710> kind<00:03:56.920> of

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
think it'd be much better they kind of

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.890 
think it'd be much better they kind of
include<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.550> grip<00:03:57.820> or<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.150> different<00:03:58.690> kind<00:03:58.840> of

include a grip or a different kind of

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.150 
include a grip or a different kind of
material<00:03:59.350> that's<00:03:59.380> all<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.770> to<00:03:59.830> start

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
material that's all going to start

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
case and a one kind of being not really

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.880 
case and a one kind of being not really
so<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.150> only<00:04:22.270> thing<00:04:22.360> i'd<00:04:22.540> actually<00:04:22.690> fix<00:04:23.590> from

so the only thing i'd actually fix from

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.070 
so the only thing i'd actually fix from
this<00:04:24.040> case<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.700> peeling<00:04:25.150> up<00:04:25.270> here<00:04:25.600> but<00:04:25.990> i'm

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
this case is the peeling up here but i'm

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.240 
this case is the peeling up here but i'm
sure<00:04:26.200> they<00:04:26.320> can<00:04:26.440> fix<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.770> with<00:04:26.890> a<00:04:26.919> little<00:04:27.040> bit

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
sure they can fix that with a little bit

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.550 
sure they can fix that with a little bit
of<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.570> material<00:04:28.570> change<00:04:28.780> or<00:04:29.229> a<00:04:29.260> grip<00:04:29.470> petition

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560

of a material change or a grip petition
top<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:31.040> think<00:04:31.490> it'd<00:04:31.580> be<00:04:31.610> an<00:04:31.730> improvement<00:04:31.850> if

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
top I think it'd be an improvement if

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.440 
top I think it'd be an improvement if
the<00:04:33.380> case<00:04:33.620> was<00:04:34.340> more<00:04:34.700> tight-fitting<00:04:35.180> up<00:04:35.300> on

the case was more tight-fitting up on

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.030 
the case was more tight-fitting up on
top<00:04:35.720> even<00:04:36.139> though<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.320> case<00:04:36.470> is<00:04:36.710> really

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
top even though the case is really

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.700 
top even though the case is really
really<00:04:37.190> good<00:04:37.610> fitting<00:04:38.030> for<00:04:38.360> your<00:04:38.540> iphone<00:04:38.840> I'll
