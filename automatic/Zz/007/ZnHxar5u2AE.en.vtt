00:00:02.879 --> 00:01:01.390
 Impossible to forget those times of the bustle in the station, the sound 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:44.759
 from the office bell, the whistle of the trains, the beautiful girls of the place. 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:58.200
 our fun We got together teenagers and adults to share, to talk, to look 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:22.290
 and / or try to conquer the girls we liked, in the case of them the other way around. 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.610
 The town lived, the people breathed the diesel of the machines, vibrated with the passing of the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:59.040
 Iron Giant. It is past, the station is desolate and the platform empty, but still 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:10.650
 everything that we long for seems to be heard. This was my tribute to all those people, to the employees 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:32.390
 of the railroad, to their families, to the inhabitants of both towns. I was not born there but it's like 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:48.520
 If it had been, I was 22 years old. I formed a family ... Thank the people for their warmth. 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.130
