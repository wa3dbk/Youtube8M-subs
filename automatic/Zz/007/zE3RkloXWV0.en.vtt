00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
couple years ago this really stood out

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
go ahead more we did and there's some

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.110 
go ahead more we did and there's some
really<00:00:29.970> nice<00:00:30.180> touches<00:00:31.079> on<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.120> spine

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
really nice touches on it like the spine

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
really nice touches on it like the spine
going<00:00:33.449> down<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.720> gas<00:00:33.900> tank<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> split

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
going down the gas tank and the split

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.640 
going down the gas tank and the split
here<00:00:35.129> and<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.090> scallops<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.080> side<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
here and the scallops on the side and

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.350 
here and the scallops on the side and
then<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> first<00:00:39.600> mass<00:00:40.590> production

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
then this was the first mass production

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.160 
then this was the first mass production
cruiser<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> come<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.900> 250<00:00:43.500> rear<00:00:43.680> tire<00:00:43.949> and

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
cruiser to come with a 250 rear tire and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.240 
cruiser to come with a 250 rear tire and
unfortunately<00:00:46.170> while<00:00:46.260> riding<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.830> 250

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
unfortunately while riding it the 250

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670 
unfortunately while riding it the 250
rear<00:00:47.400> tire<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.970> actually<00:00:48.330> comes<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.110> as

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
rear tire this actually comes up as

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.009 
rear tire this actually comes up as
maybe<00:00:50.610> its<00:00:50.790> biggest<00:00:51.180> negative<00:00:51.720> as<00:00:51.870> well

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
maybe its biggest negative as well

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.469 
maybe its biggest negative as well
because<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.650> rode<00:00:53.580> Campbell<00:00:54.089> really

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
because it really rode Campbell really

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:00.560 
because it really rode Campbell really
attached<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.019> tire<00:00:55.229> and<00:00:59.210> it's<00:01:00.210> got<00:01:00.360> a<00:01:00.390> lot<00:01:00.540> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
attached the tire and it's got a lot of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.270 
attached the tire and it's got a lot of
great<00:01:00.780> features

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.210 

during<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.550> you<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> fat<00:01:06.570> tire<00:01:06.810> look

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
during that you want that fat tire look

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.430 
during that you want that fat tire look
yeah<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.940> noticed<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> same<00:01:09.720> thing<00:01:12.440> it's

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
yeah I noticed the same thing it's

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.960 
yeah I noticed the same thing it's
definitely<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:13.860> lesson<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.310> counter-steering

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
definitely a lesson in counter-steering

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.990 
definitely a lesson in counter-steering
riding<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.420> victory<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.890> also<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.729> lot

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
riding the victory but it's also a lot

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
riding the victory but it's also a lot
more<00:01:18.060> comparable<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.229> radar<00:01:19.440> in<00:01:19.620> terms<00:01:19.650> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
more comparable to the radar in terms of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.830 
more comparable to the radar in terms of
overall<00:01:20.460> power

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.670 

and<00:01:23.320> it's<00:01:23.500> also

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
and it's also

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.740 
and it's also
and<00:01:25.680> also<00:01:25.980> has<00:01:26.100> very<00:01:26.310> similar<00:01:26.670> goes<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and also has very similar goes the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.530 
and also has very similar goes the
sculpted<00:01:28.230> saddle<00:01:28.650> sits<00:01:29.400> low<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.360> very

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
sculpted saddle sits low it's very

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660 
sculpted saddle sits low it's very
comfortable<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.080> be<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.260> the<00:01:31.710> wide<00:01:31.980> bars<00:01:32.280> maybe

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
comfortable to be in the wide bars maybe

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.810 
comfortable to be in the wide bars maybe
a<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.540> comfortable<00:01:33.870> with<00:01:34.050> greater<00:01:34.820> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
a little more comfortable with greater I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.790 
a little more comfortable with greater I
5<00:01:36.810> felt<00:01:37.110> most<00:01:37.290> comfortable<00:01:38.510> getting<00:01:39.510> nervous

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
5 felt most comfortable getting nervous

00:01:39.800 --> 00:02:00.960 
5 felt most comfortable getting nervous
bars<00:01:40.800> to<00:01:41.190> see<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.700> probably<00:01:42.120> shorter

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.020 

in<00:02:01.450> my<00:02:01.600> opinion<00:02:01.840> it's<00:02:02.020> just<00:02:02.350> hard<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.190> beat<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
in my opinion it's just hard to beat the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.910 
in my opinion it's just hard to beat the
Raider<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.480> this<00:02:04.600> group<00:02:04.840> can<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.350> bring<00:02:05.650> price

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
Raider in this group can you bring price

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.650 
Raider in this group can you bring price

as I'm standing breaking it still has a
fat<00:02:20.530> tire<00:02:20.740> but<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:21.280> narrow<00:02:21.640> enough<00:02:21.910> where<00:02:22.300> it

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
fat tire but it's narrow enough where it

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.660 
fat tire but it's narrow enough where it
handles<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:23.560> much<00:02:23.800> now<00:02:23.830> her<00:02:24.160> entire<00:02:24.250> bike

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
handles like much now her entire bike

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.240 
handles like much now her entire bike
it's<00:02:25.630> got<00:02:25.780> loads<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.230> power<00:02:26.380> where<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.860> roll

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
it's got loads of power where you roll

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.430 
it's got loads of power where you roll
the<00:02:27.400> throttle<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.750> bike<00:02:28.960> still<00:02:29.230> just

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
the throttle on and the bike still just

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.210 
the throttle on and the bike still just
takes<00:02:29.710> off

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
takes off

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.070 
takes off
I<00:02:30.250> really<00:02:31.090> ride<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.600> full<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
I really ride it like a full on the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.560 
I really ride it like a full on the
freeways<00:02:32.530> at<00:02:32.800> times<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.160> darting<00:02:33.790> getting

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
freeways at times just darting getting

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.680 
freeways at times just darting getting
out<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.780> traffic<00:02:34.990> slicing<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.800> cars<00:02:36.690> it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
out of traffic slicing up the cars it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.990 
out of traffic slicing up the cars it
does<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.900> transition<00:02:38.530> quite<00:02:38.740> as<00:02:38.890> quickly<00:02:39.130> as

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
does a transition quite as quickly as

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.020 
does a transition quite as quickly as
the<00:02:40.240> rocker<00:02:40.450> because<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.870> think<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.170> rocker

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the rocker because I think the rocker

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.460 
the rocker because I think the rocker
some<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.180> dimensions<00:02:44.080> on<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.260> rocker

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
some of the dimensions on the rocker

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.960 
some of the dimensions on the rocker
make<00:02:44.710> eternally<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.250> quicker<00:02:45.490> it's<00:02:45.700> also<00:02:45.940> a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
make eternally the quicker it's also a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.600 
make eternally the quicker it's also a
lighter<00:02:46.240> bike<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.650> rocker<00:02:47.860> transitions

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
lighter bike so the rocker transitions

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.880 
lighter bike so the rocker transitions
little<00:02:48.820> better<00:02:49.060> feels<00:02:49.420> like<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.780> smaller<00:02:50.530> bike

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
little better feels like a smaller bike

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:02.190 
little better feels like a smaller bike
handles<00:02:51.430> for<00:02:51.610> emphasis

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.750 

yeah<00:03:02.590> there's<00:03:02.800> two<00:03:02.860> things<00:03:03.160> about<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.550> Raider

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
yeah there's two things about the Raider

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.970 
yeah there's two things about the Raider
which<00:03:04.210> I<00:03:04.600> think<00:03:04.959> are<00:03:05.080> really<00:03:05.110> worth<00:03:05.560> noting

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
which I think are really worth noting

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.390 
which I think are really worth noting
one<00:03:06.160> functionally<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:08.380> really<00:03:08.709> doesn't<00:03:09.220> have

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
one functionally it really doesn't have

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.250 
one functionally it really doesn't have
as<00:03:09.550> many<00:03:09.670> compromises<00:03:10.450> as<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.690> other<00:03:10.810> bikes<00:03:11.050> I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
as many compromises as the other bikes I

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.199 
as many compromises as the other bikes I
don't<00:03:11.440> think<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:12.190> just<00:03:12.430> works<00:03:12.730> there's<00:03:13.090> no

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
don't think it just works there's no

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.480 
don't think it just works there's no
getting<00:03:14.020> used<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.410> anything<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.040> get<00:03:15.160> on<00:03:15.340> it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490

getting used to anything and get on it
ride<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.660> other<00:03:16.810> thing<00:03:17.020> is<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.260> Rock

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.340 
ride and the other thing is that Rock
Yamaha<00:03:18.190> has<00:03:18.340> really<00:03:18.700> stepped<00:03:18.970> up<00:03:19.209> its<00:03:19.870> fit<00:03:20.200> and
