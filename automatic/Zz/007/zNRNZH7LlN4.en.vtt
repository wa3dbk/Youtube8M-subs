00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.120
 Well preparation is for all sorts of things 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.120
 try it out 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.150
 new players that you get to the 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.939
 smoothly to flow into 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.039
 just look a best positions are how 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.530
 did they come back from vacation 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.880
 ok and what steps can we take in such 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.930
 make preparation to it is one 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.250
 channel 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.630
 it has been a bit like me 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.280
 for example , we need them from the latter 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.900
 not good but very educational 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.119
 this is becoming an offensive attack 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.010
 actually did not work against mallorca 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.899
 then there is another eye opener that you 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.859
 thinks okay we don't have anything there 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.870
 well done 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.980
 we still have to take a step in that, well 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.860
 yes we just have to meet each other 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.050
 better choice to actually find in 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.910
 can actually not really each other yet 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.070
 good to create opportunities 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.020
 after from behind it is in 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.719
 principle good only to the structure 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.180
 it must be faster and there must be something 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.500
 with pace and occur in itself too 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.050
 before the cabbage have the scenes 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.790
 points for improvement the team can still do 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.530
 make a lot of steps 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.809
 yet it has in recent weeks also 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.939
 not completely worried because by 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.770
 various injuries still have lodeweges 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.280
 cannot with his strongest formation 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.830
 play 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.420
 yes if there is a ball on the tip of you 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.210
 toes coming and being shot and 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.460
 which makes your knee go away and that you there 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.990
 so with your medial band or that you are here 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.970
 The problem you are going with your knee 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.710
 and that happens three times 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.280
 one after the other in three different ones 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.250
 players 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.810
 yes then you really can't do anything about it 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.970
 it's just pure bad luck too 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.250
 it is also a shame that jos for example 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.650
 from last year has not been able 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.009
 to connect that diving has not been restored 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.930
 that he needed surgery, but his 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.220
 on the way back and it is going well 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.490
 no i would rather it is about me 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.880
 too fixed fixed center or in the back with a 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.710
 stuck 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.939
 Celebrates could have played there but that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.070
 is simply not the way you don't have it 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.900
 hand and and then you can work like that 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.579
 lie down but that has none 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 no yes no sense I find 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.479
 we continue to be there last year 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.710
 but I also think that Saturday was not 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.280
 good against majorca then I am completely 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.759
 agree 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 and that must know it is again 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.060
 want to be 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.540
 which player did you expect during the 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.100
 tour well yes i am very happy to be there 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.810
 several players but I am also 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.040
 very happy with erwin possibly the keeper 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.780
 they had to come from me very 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.510
 nice received the study from the fans 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.210
 there that was very nice 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.350
 certainly for him and he just does it 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.930
 fantastic 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.580
 she is connected a little later but it is 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.960
 precise rope 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.700
 it no him and we need in us 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.430
 young team 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.420
 of course there is some difference 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.860
 feyenoord is a top club with very good ones 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.140
 players and you walk a lot 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.670
 talented players around and of course 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.890
 the pace is perhaps that butcher and 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.750
 maybe a some players level 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.370
 is lower than at Feyenoord but that 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.870
 makes sense but what i say we have 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.970
 a very good talented group 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.680
 it was chosen from heerenveen there 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.340
 even more clubs intensive this summer 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.890
 now but that club interested so 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.510
 also in the media which club 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.610
 I was just interested 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.870
 nose also very strong feeling that I 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.700
 just stay in the Netherlands euro 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.470
 of course as a beautiful club 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.830
 come from abroad 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.780
 AEK Athens had been interested 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.610
 but I don't feel good about it myself 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.580
 it does make the club a nice club and 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.370
 ambitious club but also with it 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.290
 what what the now go is too one then 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.370
 don't you choose that 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.459
 then I also visited the Netherlands 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.049
 to watch we at clubs and you 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.000
 none was in the time though 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.320
 interested and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.360
 because I had had a conversation with rene 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.100
 then that has been quiet but on it 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.540
 end is going rather fast and what i said 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.610
 I already feel good Heerenveen 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.900
 and I also just stay in Netherlands 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.000
 girlfriend is pregnant 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.200
 that all fills in but I do 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 he had a good feeling and I can here 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.780
 just play so that was also quite 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.190
 important 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.600
 yes, that step and your future 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.070
 still might have to make good 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.900
 of course here I of course 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.650
 I am 26 and still a goalkeeper 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.810
 relatively young 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.690
 if i have been here just one or two years 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.850
 just full tubers then maybe there is 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.070
 a nice step in the preparation 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.739
 score heerenveen 20 times in eight matches 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.890
 12 of those goals were scored 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.989
 from amateurs to appear in Heerenveen 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.269
 it is therefore difficult to have previous 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.950
 year around this time we also had m 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.260
 we go hell ron flavors 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.220
 then sander come to mark how that 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.229
 starts turning 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.270
 luciano feather that which one pair 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.010
 months to wear warm and that 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.599
 also all went well but we go 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.000
 rather yourself than you have to 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.500
 becomes the other players for the sun 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.270
 of course shorten the trance period 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.000
 is still open so who knows what 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.200
 happens yes you do not know I say had 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.729
 that way you see your own little garden 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.990
 and then we move on to time 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.300
 starts to urge were also the 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.590
 matches are almost starting them 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.430
 should really have 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.430
 we must go and see 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.069
 what is my strength i call it other 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.770
 but actually a bit 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.780
 go and say what my strength is but i can 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.370
 still good everywhere 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.819
 can only be one is all yours mine 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.819
 strengths 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.210
 Well play football that goes well with me 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.330
 finished so but everything can be improved ears 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.789
 I never finished learning even at BF 33 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.599
 not yet learned so can always 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.949
 better 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.139
 are you already a bit out of the way with it? 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.580
 ten o'clock very start to the league 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.800
 end of preparations normally 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.449
 spoken we we sat two or three days 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 before the start of the competition 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.440
 both for the most part out 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.620
 only I am chuckling with with then 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.690
 and the current mures have so look like 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.599
 sam could not play or play in 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.900
 Italians don't or Jerry's Adjuster 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.060
 no yes then you would have problems there 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.620
 so then you should have done differently 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.599
 that cases comes the police strikes 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.150
 in goodness 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.500
 have it is it is as it is it is 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.240
 not nice for the football 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.050
 clearly not so that you in we 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.759
 just be able to play football but if so 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.650
 is then we must margot my ben 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.400
 learn to live and a few days later 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.620
 found it 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.650
 I'm eager to start but there 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.659
 is overtaken one in the same week 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.099
 barrier namely injuries but then 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:04.840
 it might be good that it is something 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.060
 let it start a little later it 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.560
 first duel against the county 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.440
 to say his mother still a PhD student 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.729
 but what do you expect from the county 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.710
 well what i expect from them is like the 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.530
 Franken figs play football and I expect 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.539
 that they have a lot of energy 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.190
 because they have lost nothing about 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.729
 nothing won we certainly have nothing 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.409
 to lose 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.389
 nobody actually expected anything from it 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:26.050
 and that is an advantage of 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.639
 their 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.440
 and for us it is again one 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:32.080
 challenge and how are you doing 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.060
 how to deal with that 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.099
 so for that young team that we have 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.020
 a very interesting one if I have to now 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:40.730
 even then have anyway in point so then 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.680
 we don't lose but no 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.570
 i just want to do my best and my and 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.460
 keep the zero and I have what it does 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.420
 trust that we have one anyway 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.440
 times and then start shooting again 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.700
 depth t just 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.860
 Buzz was actually the same 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.210
 story against dordrecht because you 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.740
 phones feelings 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.780
 for that take it is a nice one 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.520
 warning finger from watch hey 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.020
 all of them form dordrecht last year 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.550
 you yourself played well by why I three 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.600
 four and have to stand as west as it is 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.070
 about 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.570
 well that whole we didn't even get for 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:10.850
 rest I am just before rest a one 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:12.230
 mistake by christopher well that must be 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.550
 you just don't happen again and want to 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.260
 neither did you have us afterwards 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.690
 very nice set in the season too 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.130
 of that defeat but that must be done immediately 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.430
 you just want a good start to the 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.430
 League
