00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.380 
I thought let's just go ahead and open
it<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.279> camera<00:00:23.519> we'll<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> assembly

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it up on camera we'll do the assembly

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.730

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.000 
works all right this is a just a massive
box<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.140> gonna<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.380> difficult<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.859> keep

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
box so it's gonna be difficult to keep

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.529 
box so it's gonna be difficult to keep
everything<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.580> camera<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.269> there<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.420> can

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
everything on camera but there you can

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.759 
everything on camera but there you can
see<00:00:30.630> there's<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.900> huge<00:00:31.140> amount<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.380> styrofoam

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
see there's a huge amount of styrofoam

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.900 
see there's a huge amount of styrofoam
in<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.099> sandwiching<00:00:32.579> everything

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
in there just sandwiching everything

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.260 
in there just sandwiching everything
together

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
together

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.520 
together
all<00:00:33.540> right<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.380> bit<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
all right and with a little bit of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.750 
all right and with a little bit of
effort<00:00:34.860> I've<00:00:34.950> managed<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.370> go<00:00:35.460> ahead<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.670> get

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
effort I've managed to go ahead and get

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.400 
effort I've managed to go ahead and get
the<00:00:35.850> entire<00:00:36.149> box<00:00:36.480> standing<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.989> its<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.200> so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the entire box standing on its in so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.990 
the entire box standing on its in so
hopefully<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.100> lift<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.489> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
hopefully I can just lift it up and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
hopefully I can just lift it up and
it'll<00:00:39.239> come<00:00:39.510> right<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.320> there's<00:00:40.559> an<00:00:40.620> awful

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

it'll come right out so there's an awful
lot<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.010> styrofoam<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.030> can

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
lot of styrofoam here but there you can

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.970

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
see it does have a parts list and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.590 
see it does have a parts list and
instruction<00:00:44.489> manual<00:00:44.520> showing<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> just

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
together this will appear to be these

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
together this will appear to be these
top<00:00:48.989> surface<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.770> place<00:00:49.950> where<00:00:50.129> you're

top surface the place where you're
actually<00:00:50.309> gonna<00:00:50.520> use<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> laptop<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.690> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
actually gonna use the laptop this is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.240 
actually gonna use the laptop this is
actually<00:00:52.230> bigger<00:00:52.559> than<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.860> thought<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.100> was

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
actually bigger than I thought it was

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
actually bigger than I thought it was
gonna<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.480> would<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
gonna be there is that that would be the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.840 
gonna be there is that that would be the
bottom<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.500> there's<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.829> top<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.670> got<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
bottom and there's the top it's got a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.819 
bottom and there's the top it's got a
really<00:00:57.180> nice<00:00:57.570> finish<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.500> sort<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.710> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
really nice finish on it it's sort of a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.979 
really nice finish on it it's sort of a
woodgrain<00:00:59.250> finish<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.879> course<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
woodgrain finish of course this is the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.229 
woodgrain finish of course this is the
espresso<00:01:01.350> model<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.730> dark<00:01:02.969> version

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
espresso model so it's the dark version

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
espresso model so it's the dark version
definitely<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.350> mind<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
top sandwich piece off very strong smell

top sandwich piece off very strong smell
of<00:01:16.799> styrofoam<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> moment

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of styrofoam in here at the moment

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
of styrofoam in here at the moment
presumably<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.750> much<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.140> broke

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
presumably because so much of it broke

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.200 
presumably because so much of it broke
in<00:01:19.619> transport<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.460> you'll<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.060> have

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
in transport here you'll see we have

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
in transport here you'll see we have
long<00:01:21.479> metal<00:01:21.780> piece<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.320> presume<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.950> used

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
long metal piece I presume this is used

long metal piece I presume this is used
with<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.610> stand<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> bag

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
with a little stand here we have a bag

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
with a little stand here we have a bag
full<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.229> testers<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.220> pieces<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.850> along

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
full of testers and pieces to go along

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
full of testers and pieces to go along
with<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:27.900> some<00:01:28.110> more<00:01:28.259> nuts<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
with that we have some more nuts and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.039 
with that we have some more nuts and
washers<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.729> allen<00:01:30.299> wrench<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.689> all<00:01:30.810> sorts

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
of little pieces and parts and what

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.700 
of little pieces and parts and what
appear<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> couple<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> tools<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.560> they

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
appear to be a couple of tools but they

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.399 
appear to be a couple of tools but they
might<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:36.329> pieces<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.170> here

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
might also be just pieces to go on here

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.840 
might also be just pieces to go on here
as<00:01:37.470> well<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.130> styrofoam<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.729> just

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
as well in this styrofoam was just

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.370 
as well in this styrofoam was just
absolutely<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.450> everywhere<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.259> I

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
absolutely going everywhere but this I

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
absolutely going everywhere but this I
would<00:01:40.500> assume<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> part<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> stand<00:01:41.520> this

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
would assume is a part of the stand this

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.760 
would assume is a part of the stand this
is<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> base<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.110> looks<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.530> fits

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
is the base it looks like this fits

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230 
is the base it looks like this fits
right<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
right in here like that and that is a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.789 
right in here like that and that is a
decently<00:01:45.689> large<00:01:45.899> base<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.680> on

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
decently large base but you can see on

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.990 
decently large base but you can see on
here<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> places<00:01:47.369> where<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> wheels<00:01:47.759> will

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
here the places where the wheels will

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.030 
here the places where the wheels will
screw<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> bottom<00:01:48.689> everything<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.680> very

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
screw into the bottom everything is very

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280 
screw into the bottom everything is very
solid<00:01:50.460> metal<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.479> this<00:01:51.570> last<00:01:51.780> component

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
solid metal and in this last component

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.749 
solid metal and in this last component
would<00:01:52.350> probably<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.130> part<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.460> makes<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
would probably be the part that makes it

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
would probably be the part that makes it
all<00:01:53.909> stand<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> where<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> desk<00:01:55.649> will

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
all stand up this is where the desk will

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
all stand up this is where the desk will
screw<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.149> go<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.540> down

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
screw in and then it can go up and down

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.450 
screw in and then it can go up and down
from<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.530> I'm<00:01:58.799> gonna<00:01:58.890> take<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> few

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
from there so I'm gonna take just a few

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.380 
from there so I'm gonna take just a few
minutes<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.790> start<00:01:59.909> putting<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.240> together

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
minutes and start putting this together

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
minutes and start putting this together
and<00:02:00.780> also<00:02:01.049> clean<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.979> styrofoam

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
and also clean up all this styrofoam

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.100 
and also clean up all this styrofoam
that<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.729> now<00:02:02.820> everywhere<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.689> setup<00:02:03.960> process

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that is now everywhere the setup process

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.959 
that is now everywhere the setup process
was<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:04.590> terribly<00:02:04.920> difficult<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> didn't

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
was not terribly difficult but I didn't

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.399 
was not terribly difficult but I didn't
go<00:02:06.060> ahead<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.329> talk<00:02:06.540> while<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> was<00:02:07.049> doing<00:02:07.200> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
go ahead and talk while I was doing it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.050 
go ahead and talk while I was doing it
because<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.799> didn't<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.369> waste<00:02:08.489> time<00:02:08.670> you

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
because I didn't want to waste time you

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.490 
because I didn't want to waste time you
basically<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.420> put<00:02:09.539> four<00:02:09.840> screws<00:02:10.140> into<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
basically just put four screws into the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.960 
basically just put four screws into the
top<00:02:10.590> section<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.190> hold<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> middle<00:02:11.790> section

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
top section to hold the middle section

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.600 
top section to hold the middle section
on

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
on

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.950 
on
you<00:02:12.790> screw<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.240> center<00:02:13.540> bar<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.900> holds

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
you screw in the center bar that holds

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.870 
you screw in the center bar that holds
it<00:02:14.140> onto<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.410> bottom<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.280> put<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.460> big<00:02:15.610> metal

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
it onto the bottom you put a big metal

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.940 
it onto the bottom you put a big metal
cover<00:02:16.120> over<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.480> bar<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.260> screw<00:02:17.500> four<00:02:17.710> bolts

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
cover over that bar you screw four bolts

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.380 
cover over that bar you screw four bolts
into<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.250> base<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.550> hold<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.820> casters<00:02:19.240> in

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
into the base to hold the casters in

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.180 
into the base to hold the casters in
place<00:02:19.600> push<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.200> casters<00:02:20.590> on<00:02:20.710> there<00:02:20.890> making

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
place push the casters on there making

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.620 
place push the casters on there making
sure<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.520> ones<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.000> Stoppers<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.510> them

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
sure the ones that have Stoppers on them

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.330

go<00:02:22.780> toward<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> front<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.590> then<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.070> attach

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
go toward the front and then you attach

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.190 
go toward the front and then you attach
the<00:02:24.580> base<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.000> rest<00:02:25.210> of<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.390> body<00:02:25.600> all

told<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.590> think<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.890> took<00:02:27.070> me<00:02:27.190> about<00:02:27.220> five<00:02:27.610> or

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
told I think this took me about five or

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.100 
told I think this took me about five or
ten<00:02:27.940> minutes<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.300> put<00:02:28.450> together<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.930> was

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
ten minutes to put together this was

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.660 
ten minutes to put together this was
actually<00:02:29.440> potentially<00:02:29.770> easier<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.520> put

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
actually potentially easier to put

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.490 
actually potentially easier to put
together<00:02:30.760> than<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.210> IKEA<00:02:31.540> table<00:02:31.780> all<00:02:32.290> righty

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
together than the IKEA table all righty

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.750 
together than the IKEA table all righty
so<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.740> can<00:02:32.860> sort<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.100> see<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> before<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
so you can sort of see the before and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.910 
so you can sort of see the before and
after<00:02:34.030> here<00:02:34.480> this<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.900> IKEA<00:02:35.230> table<00:02:35.410> I<00:02:35.710> was

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
after here this is the IKEA table I was

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.290 
after here this is the IKEA table I was
using<00:02:36.250> before<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:36.850> is<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.090> one<00:02:37.180> I've<00:02:37.270> been

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
using before this is the one I've been

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.790 
using before this is the one I've been
using<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.750> make<00:02:37.930> videos<00:02:38.260> with<00:02:38.470> for<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> long

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
using to make videos with for a long

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.530 
using to make videos with for a long
time<00:02:39.040> now<00:02:39.250> at<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.640> lowest<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:40.000> desk<00:02:40.240> will<00:02:40.390> go

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
time now at the lowest this desk will go

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.420 
time now at the lowest this desk will go
it's<00:02:40.750> about<00:02:40.840> 28<00:02:41.350> inches<00:02:41.800> which<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.100> about

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
it's about 28 inches which is about

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.890 
it's about 28 inches which is about
where<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.670> keep<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:43.480> that's<00:02:43.570> pretty

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
where I keep this so that's pretty

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.520 
where I keep this so that's pretty
convenient

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
convenient

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.080 
convenient
however<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:44.920> little<00:02:45.130> IKEA<00:02:45.459> table<00:02:45.790> will<00:02:45.940> go

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
however this little IKEA table will go

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.090 
however this little IKEA table will go
down<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.570> being<00:02:46.750> really<00:02:47.020> really<00:02:47.350> short<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.980> mean

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
down to being really really short I mean

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.560 
down to being really really short I mean
there<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.490> at<00:02:48.670> its<00:02:48.790> lowest<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:49.330> gonna<00:02:49.420> be

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
there it is at its lowest it's gonna be

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.940 
there it is at its lowest it's gonna be
really<00:02:49.780> hard<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.959> get<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.140> sense<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.470> scale<00:02:50.590> but

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
really hard to get a sense of scale but

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.979 
really hard to get a sense of scale but
it's<00:02:51.070> about<00:02:51.520> six<00:02:51.940> inches<00:02:52.239> lower<00:02:52.450> so<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.840> is

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
it's about six inches lower so this is

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.410 
it's about six inches lower so this is
about<00:02:53.200> 22<00:02:53.739> inches<00:02:53.770> high<00:02:54.250> right<00:02:54.459> now<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:55.239> is

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
about 22 inches high right now this is

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.240 
about 22 inches high right now this is
still<00:02:55.600> at<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.780> 28<00:02:56.170> inches<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.770> at<00:02:57.130> its

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
still at the 28 inches and at its

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.670 
still at the 28 inches and at its
absolute<00:02:57.370> tallest<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:58.390> about<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.230> don't<00:02:59.620> know

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
absolute tallest it's about I don't know

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.470 
absolute tallest it's about I don't know
I<00:02:59.709> would<00:02:59.860> say<00:02:59.920> 32<00:03:00.489> inches<00:03:00.850> it's<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.239> slightly

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
I would say 32 inches it's just slightly

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.229 
I would say 32 inches it's just slightly
higher<00:03:01.930> than<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.620> Jesper<00:03:03.400> workstation<00:03:04.000> here

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
higher than the Jesper workstation here

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.090 
higher than the Jesper workstation here
but<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.170> may<00:03:05.350> require<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.680> camera

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
but and this may require a camera

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.060 
but and this may require a camera
readjustment<00:03:06.700> here<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.440> jumps<00:03:08.950> up

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
readjustment here and it just jumps up

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.860 
readjustment here and it just jumps up
like<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.580> see<00:03:09.730> how<00:03:09.760> high<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.180> goes<00:03:10.360> this

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
like that you see how high it goes this

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.350 
like that you see how high it goes this
goes<00:03:11.080> up<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.440> height<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.860> think<00:03:12.220> 41<00:03:12.910> inches

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
goes up to a height of I think 41 inches

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.540 
goes up to a height of I think 41 inches
so<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.840> significantly<00:03:14.440> higher<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.980> sits<00:03:15.280> six

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
so it's significantly higher it sits six

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.820 
so it's significantly higher it sits six
inches<00:03:15.850> higher<00:03:16.090> or<00:03:16.360> more<00:03:16.510> than<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.440> IKEA

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
inches higher or more than the IKEA

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.229 
inches higher or more than the IKEA
table<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.340> which<00:03:18.610> means<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:18.910> got<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.030> much

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
table is which means it's got a much

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.850 
table is which means it's got a much
wider<00:03:19.450> use<00:03:19.750> case<00:03:20.019> at<00:03:20.170> least<00:03:20.350> for<00:03:20.560> me

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
wider use case at least for me

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.259 
wider use case at least for me
I'll<00:03:20.950> primarily<00:03:21.400> be<00:03:21.580> using<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:21.910> down<00:03:22.060> at<00:03:22.209> this

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
I'll primarily be using it down at this

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.150 
I'll primarily be using it down at this
28<00:03:22.660> inch<00:03:22.840> height<00:03:23.080> I'll<00:03:23.350> have<00:03:23.530> my<00:03:23.709> Bluetooth

28 inch height I'll have my Bluetooth

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.220 
28 inch height I'll have my Bluetooth

keyboard and a tablet of some kind on
there<00:03:26.470> all<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.709> time<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.950> may<00:03:27.310> have<00:03:27.489> my<00:03:27.610> work

additional laptop on there so the weight
this<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.600> gonna<00:03:31.750> be<00:03:31.840> holding<00:03:31.959> is<00:03:32.230> definitely

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
this is gonna be holding is definitely

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.770 
this is gonna be holding is definitely
not<00:03:32.709> gonna<00:03:32.830> be<00:03:32.920> much<00:03:33.250> but<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.269> order<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.570> give

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
not gonna be much but in order to give

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.180 
not gonna be much but in order to give
to<00:03:34.900> even<00:03:35.110> go<00:03:35.230> down<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.590> first<00:03:35.769> time<00:03:36.010> I

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
to even go down the first time I

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.620 
to even go down the first time I
practically<00:03:36.640> had<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.820> put<00:03:37.000> about<00:03:37.060> half<00:03:37.360> my

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
practically had to put about half my

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.780 
practically had to put about half my
weight<00:03:37.900> on<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.530> get<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.769> even<00:03:39.010> move<00:03:39.190> so

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
weight on this to get it to even move so

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.610 
weight on this to get it to even move so
it<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:40.000> extraordinarily<00:03:40.630> Surti

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
it is extraordinarily Surti

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.050 
it is extraordinarily Surti
the<00:03:41.920> grand<00:03:42.130> majority<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.549> it<00:03:42.610> is<00:03:42.700> made<00:03:42.820> out<00:03:42.970> of

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
the grand majority of it is made out of

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.789 
the grand majority of it is made out of
metal<00:03:43.209> except<00:03:43.630> for<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.810> top<00:03:44.019> which<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:44.320> I

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
metal except for the top which is I

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.860 
metal except for the top which is I
think<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:45.400> plastic<00:03:45.850> coated<00:03:46.120> wood<00:03:46.299> kind<00:03:46.660> of<00:03:46.750> like

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
think a plastic coated wood kind of like

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.870 
think a plastic coated wood kind of like
the<00:03:47.019> wood<00:03:47.170> in<00:03:47.350> this<00:03:47.530> but<00:03:47.860> it's<00:03:48.010> it's<00:03:48.489> quite<00:03:48.850> a

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
the wood in this but it's it's quite a

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.520
