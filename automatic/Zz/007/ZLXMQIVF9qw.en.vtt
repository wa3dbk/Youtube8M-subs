00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.090
 Hello to you missing tea and barn 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.510
 today we have to queue 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:25.160
 to the Chinese tablet from the manufacturer 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.930
 next top model of 9x is a tablet 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.300
 competes with such famous 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.689
 tablet computers like ainol spark 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.160
 and he 989 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:39.770
 built not on quad 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.780
 a31 elvenar processor has a platform 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.350
 two gigabytes of ram a 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.120
 also ip with retina display with 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.280
 resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.930
 The only difference between this tablet and 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 its competitors is his 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.880
 price range tablet costs 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.320
 about 40 50 dollars cheaper 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.050
 what can its competitors immediately say about 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.950
 the fact that since the tablet on the order 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.350
 cheaper it is used and 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.180
 components are cheaper by 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.630
 comparison with competitors to start 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.479
 pay attention to the touchscreen on it 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.179
 visible grid that says about his low 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.340
 cost back cover though done 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:29.179
 from aluminum but there is a plastic 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.490
 layer that is not peculiar specifically 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.000
 let's competing manufacturer 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.220
 let's look at what's inside 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.530
 standard for such tablets with 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.240
 Aluminum back cover we do not see 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.709
 no screws all assembled on 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.399
 plastic snaps 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.530
 although sborochka tight enough you 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.349
 you see it does not even work right away 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:01.940
 make out get close to him so close 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:02.800
 say we will clean the clicking running 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.230
 in advance 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.840
 can say that 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.380
 in the characteristics of this tablet there and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.390
 for example spro compare them with ainol 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.880
 spark 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.650
 we won't see stereo speakers as 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.380
 we only see one behind 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:28.910
 grid and dynamics also manufacturer 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.040
 states that this tablet is worth 5 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.830
 megapixel camera though the writing on 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.200
 back cover reads 2 megapixels 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.480
 how many megapixels actually 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.510
 Komi of this tablet we will see a fugitive 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.020
 plan step gave our way to the thieves 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.990
 opened we see the back cover 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.670
 aluminum plastic frame glued 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.450
 double-sided tape unfortunately 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.530
 design can not be called reliable and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.540
 so main elements 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.360
 tablet battery banks 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.090
 indeed 8000 milliamps says 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:07.400
 the inscription on the battery banks 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:10.910
 main board sensor cable and cable 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.830
 display speaker is really mono 0 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.180
 very powerful judging by the appearance of sound 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.800
 let's go and talk text part 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.140
 review 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.760
 but the main elements are the processor on 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.230
 it has a special compartment 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.209
 firm conducting sticker which 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.489
 conducts heat to the aluminum cap on 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.110
 cover left a trace from the sticker that 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.120
 says she is snug 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.700
 and dissipate heat accordingly 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.930
 effectively enough two memory bars 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:46.790
 on 8 gigabytes therefore the tablet goes 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.500
 16 gigabytes of memory and 8 tablet 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.450
 bring all 6 megabytes of operative 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.709
 of memory 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.150
 which means that the tablet is mostly 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.060
 two gigabytes total 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.900
 RAM that you can immediately 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.569
 say antenna wi fi ordinary 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.299
 she foil 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:10.409
 glued to the display screen but 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.840
 The design is very simple and I think 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.900
 that the sensitivity of the wi-fi module will be 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.930
 very weak no locks nothing 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.239
 we will not see the usual ration such a ration 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.740
 peculiar to 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:29.389
 Cheap budget tablet see for 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.389
 grated display label 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.610
 most likely the display is used 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.490
 some on intelligent producer 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.389
 if we compare the assembly of this tablet with 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.060
 already in advance 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:45.389
 us disassembled tablet ainol spark 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.270
 we can see with you all the elements 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.400
 absolutely identical ie used 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:58.320
 the same board is the same chip and 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:02.070
 completely and the only thing that soldering you 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.060
 it is of higher quality and it speaks of 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.409
 tom that 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.180
 tatoi nola cloak should cost much 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.490
 expensive 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.220
 well let's see for yourself since 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.460
 tablet from the manufacturer of its worth 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.849
 40 to 50 dollars cheaper if it makes sense 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.760
 overpay for the manufacturer and well on 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.860
 in fact the main characteristics 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.260
 which do not differ then rechargeable 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.699
 2000 milliamp batteries you decide 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.389
 how important is this to you 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:36.440
 the same 2 megapixel camera is small 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:39.419
 window there is no hint of 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.230
 autofocus absolutely nothing 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:46.620
 No, again, we are able to display 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:49.500
 weak wi-fi antenna here in this place 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.290
 should have been present in the vibration motor 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.960
 it does not have though wiring on the board 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.630
 present here should be solder 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.390
 chose the motor on this manufacturer here 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.880
 same saved very cool as already 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.490
 mentioned earlier 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:09.270
 the touchscreen has a grid that says it 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.700
 small cost but still if this 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.920
 tablet will cost up to 200 dollars 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.680
 with such top screams 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:20.310
 display 2 gigabytes of RAM 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.430
 4 nuclear platform I think that he 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.350
 absolutely has a right to exist and 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.470
 sure to find their fans 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.840
 among buyers 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.870
 our countries in general, I do not see the point 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.090
 continue to disassemble charge 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.420
 as we had previously disassembled 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.450
 ainol spark and you can watch the video 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.030
 and understand that they are absolutely identical 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:49.190
 everything else you see will read in 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.190
 text review of all the best
