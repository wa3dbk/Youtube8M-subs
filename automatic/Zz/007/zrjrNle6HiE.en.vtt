the past you don't have to take the
separate<00:00:32.330> elements<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:32.900> then<00:00:33.019> place<00:00:33.379> them

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
separate elements and then place them

upon the character this you know whether

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.229 
upon the character this you know whether
it<00:00:35.809> be<00:00:36.400> capturing<00:00:37.400> just<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.790> face<00:00:38.000> or

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
it be capturing just the face or

capturing<00:00:38.600> just<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:38.960> voice<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:39.440> then<00:00:39.559> going

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
capturing just the voice and then going

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.139 
capturing just the voice and then going
and<00:00:39.950> capturing<00:00:40.280> your<00:00:40.430> body<00:00:40.610> movement<00:00:41.059> and

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
and capturing your body movement and

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.520 
and capturing your body movement and
then<00:00:41.270> trying<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.570> melt<00:00:41.809> them<00:00:41.960> together<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:42.410> it

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
then trying to melt them together and it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.130 
then trying to melt them together and it
just<00:00:42.710> wasn't<00:00:42.890> in<00:00:43.700> my<00:00:43.880> opinion<00:00:44.239> inefficient

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
just wasn't in my opinion inefficient

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.139 
just wasn't in my opinion inefficient
process<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:45.829> well<00:00:46.129> it<00:00:46.280> just<00:00:46.460> was<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:46.879> was

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
process but well it just was it was

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.900 
process but well it just was it was
dated<00:00:47.390> now<00:00:48.140> it's<00:00:48.410> just<00:00:48.559> it's<00:00:49.430> gotten<00:00:49.730> so<00:00:49.850> much

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
dated now it's just it's gotten so much

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.670 
dated now it's just it's gotten so much
more<00:00:50.120> streamlined<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.780> they<00:00:50.870> they<00:00:51.469> don't

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
more streamlined and they they don't

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.350 
more streamlined and they they don't
lose<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.370> information<00:00:52.520> that<00:00:53.030> they're<00:00:53.180> trying

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
lose the information that they're trying

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.540 
lose the information that they're trying
to<00:00:53.390> get<00:00:53.570> from<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.750> performance<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:55.190> how<00:00:55.340> has

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
to get from the performance and how has

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.310 
to get from the performance and how has
the<00:00:55.730> motion<00:00:56.059> capture<00:00:56.270> helped<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:57.110> as<00:00:57.230> an

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
the motion capture helped you as an

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.970 
the motion capture helped you as an
actor<00:00:58.000> it's<00:00:59.000> just<00:00:59.300> it<00:00:59.539> really<00:00:59.750> it<00:01:00.590> allows<00:01:00.829> me

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
actor it's just it really it allows me
