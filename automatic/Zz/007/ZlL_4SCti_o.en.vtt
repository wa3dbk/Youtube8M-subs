automobiles<00:00:31.980> trucks<00:00:34.579> well<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> decided<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
automobiles trucks well I decided that

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.920 
automobiles trucks well I decided that
since<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.469> demand<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.129> high<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.930> I'm

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
since the demand was so high that I'm

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.400 
since the demand was so high that I'm
going<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.140> start<00:00:40.379> building<00:00:41.870> some<00:00:42.870> big<00:00:43.050> cells

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
going to start building some big cells

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.080 
going to start building some big cells
for<00:00:43.710> people<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.100> buy<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.530> my<00:00:46.710> idea<00:00:47.039> was

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.430 

building<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.180> cell<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.719> produce<00:00:51.899> 50

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
building a cell that can produce 50

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.459 
building a cell that can produce 50
liters<00:00:52.949> per<00:00:53.160> minute<00:00:54.020> that's<00:00:55.020> something<00:00:55.320> that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
liters per minute that's something that

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.380 
liters per minute that's something that
could<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.890> purchased<00:00:57.260> I'm<00:00:58.260> off<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.620> website

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
could be purchased I'm off my website

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:08.500 
could be purchased I'm off my website
this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> my<00:01:00.719> idea<00:01:03.439> what<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.780 

backup<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.970> basically<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.420> cut<00:01:12.689> out

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
backup to see it basically have cut out

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:23.359 
backup to see it basically have cut out
two<00:01:14.790> end<00:01:15.060> caps<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:17.090> a<00:01:18.090> 3/4<00:01:18.810> inch<00:01:19.700> HDPE<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> if

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
two end caps and a 3/4 inch HDPE and if

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:33.069 
two end caps and a 3/4 inch HDPE and if
you<00:01:23.490> look<00:01:23.670> close<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:29.540> can<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:31.520> this<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
you look close you can see this is a

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.590 
you look close you can see this is a
being<00:01:34.079> cap<00:01:34.320> off<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.770> these<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
being cap off of these you can see the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.760 
being cap off of these you can see the
pattern<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.939> matches<00:01:39.229> one<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.259> these<00:01:40.470> small

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
pattern there matches one of these small

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.219 
pattern there matches one of these small
ones<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.180> I've<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:44.520> six

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.380 

basically<00:01:49.229> six<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.890> these<00:01:50.220> small<00:01:50.610> end<00:01:50.880> caps<00:01:51.119> in

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
basically six of these small end caps in

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.810 
basically six of these small end caps in
one<00:01:51.570> big<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:53.360> I'm<00:01:54.360> taking<00:01:54.540> some<00:01:54.810> 3/4<00:01:55.380> inch<00:01:55.820> and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
one big one I'm taking some 3/4 inch and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.170 
one big one I'm taking some 3/4 inch and
what<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.899> do<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:59.149> I'm<00:02:00.149> going

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
what I what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.950 
what I what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:02:00.299> build<00:02:00.570> these

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
to build these

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.920 
to build these
look<00:02:02.960> like<00:02:03.230> this<00:02:04.360> there's<00:02:05.360> going<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.510> be<00:02:05.600> six

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
look like this there's going to be six

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.270 
look like this there's going to be six
of<00:02:06.050> these<00:02:06.170> 59<00:02:06.740> plate<00:02:07.010> cells<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:07.580> there<00:02:09.280> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
of these 59 plate cells in there and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.570 
of these 59 plate cells in there and
each<00:02:10.550> cell<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.930> going<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.680> be<00:02:12.860> individually

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
each cell is going to be individually

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.830 
each cell is going to be individually
controlled<00:02:14.350> with<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.380> controller<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:17.600> then<00:02:17.750> it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
controlled with a controller and then it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.340 
controlled with a controller and then it
will<00:02:17.930> have<00:02:17.960> a<00:02:18.080> main<00:02:19.720> circuit<00:02:20.720> breaker<00:02:20.840> on/off

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
will have a main circuit breaker on/off

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.630 
will have a main circuit breaker on/off
switch<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.980> can<00:02:22.610> be<00:02:22.670> driven<00:02:22.940> by<00:02:24.220> 220<00:02:25.220> volt<00:02:25.460> or

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
switch and can be driven by 220 volt or

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.240 
switch and can be driven by 220 volt or
110<00:02:26.510> volt<00:02:27.310> your<00:02:28.310> choice<00:02:30.190> these<00:02:31.190> these<00:02:31.880> cells

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
110 volt your choice these these cells

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.920 
110 volt your choice these these cells
will<00:02:34.250> be<00:02:34.400> able<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.790> be<00:02:35.000> broken<00:02:35.360> down<00:02:35.570> into<00:02:37.030> two

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.290 

basically<00:02:41.930> there's<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.290> cut<00:02:42.980> here<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.459> I've

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
basically there's a cut here and I've

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.150 
basically there's a cut here and I've
got<00:02:44.330> pegs<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:45.740> that<00:02:47.920> join<00:02:48.920> this

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
got pegs and here that join this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.860 
got pegs and here that join this
together

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
together

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.860 
together
but<00:02:50.870> for<00:02:51.530> shipping<00:02:51.950> we'll<00:02:52.459> be<00:02:52.580> able<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:53.030> break

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
but for shipping we'll be able to break

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.150 
but for shipping we'll be able to break
these<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.290> half<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.280> ship<00:02:55.550> them<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:55.820> sections
