so we figured we'd update this and make
it<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> little<00:00:13.440> bit<00:00:13.620> easier<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.040> everybody

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
and then we want the JDK for our version

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.650 
and then we want the JDK for our version
of<00:01:10.380> Windows<00:01:10.800> so<00:01:11.010> either<00:01:11.220> windows<00:01:11.610> 64-bit<00:01:12.270> or

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
of Windows so either windows 64-bit or

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.060 
of Windows so either windows 64-bit or
windows<00:01:13.650> 32-bit<00:01:14.280> which<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.820> x86<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.980> need

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
windows 32-bit which is x86 so you need

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.370 
windows 32-bit which is x86 so you need
to<00:01:17.220> download<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.550> one<00:01:17.730> directly<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.600> yours

so for me I'm using a 64-bit accept and
then<00:01:24.210> click<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.350> 64-bit<00:01:25.950> windows<00:01:26.310> 1<00:01:27.860> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
until it installs okay and then once

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.880 
until it installs okay and then once
that's<00:02:00.479> done<00:02:00.810> it'll<00:02:01.200> say<00:02:01.470> instead<00:02:01.829> of

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that's done it'll say instead of

completed<00:02:02.340> hit<00:02:02.460> close<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:07.459> get<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.550> back<00:02:08.810> on

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
completed hit close and get it back on

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
completed hit close and get it back on
our<00:02:09.959> Android<00:02:10.200> SDK<00:02:10.649> setup<00:02:11.130> hit<00:02:11.430> next<00:02:11.700> again<00:02:11.760> now

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
our Android SDK setup hit next again now

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.949 
our Android SDK setup hit next again now
it<00:02:12.270> should<00:02:12.450> say<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> found<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:14.160> next

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
it should say that it found it it next

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.600 
it should say that it found it it next
and<00:02:15.959> we're<00:02:16.080> gonna<00:02:16.170> change<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.190> here

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and we're gonna change this in here

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.880 
and we're gonna change this in here
because<00:02:17.880> it's<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.180> very<00:02:18.420> long<00:02:18.890> lead

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
because it's just very long lead

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.390 
because it's just very long lead
everything<00:02:20.220> inside<00:02:20.760> here<00:02:20.819> between<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:23.370> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
everything inside here between that and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.110 
everything inside here between that and
that<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.660> shows<00:02:24.840> C<00:02:25.910> colon<00:02:26.910> slash

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
that so it just shows C colon slash

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.430 
that so it just shows C colon slash

sure that Google USB driver package is

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.410 
sure that Google USB driver package is
also<00:03:07.440> checked<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.489> should<00:03:08.609> be<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.730> total<00:03:09.180> of

about a packages but depending on what
version<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.959> Android<00:03:13.320> you're<00:03:13.470> looking<00:03:13.739> at

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
version of Android you're looking at

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.460 
version of Android you're looking at
when<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.130> do<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:16.140> make<00:03:16.260> sure<00:03:16.290> those

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
when you do this so just make sure those

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.289 
when you do this so just make sure those
are<00:03:16.530> checked<00:03:16.829> then<00:03:17.220> we're<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.370> hit<00:03:17.519> install

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
are checked then we're in hit install

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.990 
are checked then we're in hit install
eight<00:03:19.140> packages<00:03:21.109> hit<00:03:22.109> accept<00:03:22.530> all<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.100> then

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
eight packages hit accept all and then

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.750 
eight packages hit accept all and then
hit<00:03:24.150> install<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.370> wait<00:03:26.370> for<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.579> to<00:03:26.609> install

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
hit install and wait for it to install

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:37.069 
hit install and wait for it to install
all<00:03:26.940> these<00:03:27.090> things

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.949 

eventually<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.980> Android<00:03:39.459> SDK<00:03:39.579> will<00:03:40.090> say<00:03:40.359> done

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
eventually the Android SDK will say done

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.099 
eventually the Android SDK will say done
loading<00:03:41.230> packages<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.069> we<00:03:42.159> can<00:03:42.310> hit<00:03:42.430> close<00:03:43.109> and

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
loading packages so we can hit close and

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.750 
loading packages so we can hit close and
then<00:03:44.200> we<00:03:44.290> can<00:03:44.409> actually<00:03:44.530> close<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.489> Android

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
then we can actually close the Android

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.349 
then we can actually close the Android
SDK<00:03:45.959> okay<00:03:46.959> now<00:03:47.109> on<00:03:47.349> your<00:03:47.680> Android<00:03:48.250> device

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
SDK okay now on your Android device

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:55.220 
SDK okay now on your Android device
you're<00:03:49.359> going<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.959> go<00:03:50.439> into<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> settings<00:03:53.159> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
you're going to go into the settings and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.500 
you're going to go into the settings and
then<00:03:56.230> if<00:03:56.409> you're<00:03:56.530> using<00:03:57.060> most<00:03:58.060> Android<00:03:58.359> device

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
then if you're using most Android device

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.229 
then if you're using most Android device
it's<00:03:58.689> gonna<00:03:58.810> be<00:03:58.959> applications<00:03:59.829> in<00:04:00.040> here<00:04:00.280> then

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
it's gonna be applications in here then

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.259 
it's gonna be applications in here then
development<00:04:01.989> then<00:04:02.409> USB<00:04:02.950> debugging<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:04.150> we're

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
development then USB debugging and we're

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.629 
development then USB debugging and we're
gonna<00:04:04.359> check<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:04.989> now<00:04:05.799> on<00:04:06.129> Ice<00:04:06.400> Cream

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
gonna check that on now on Ice Cream

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.399 
gonna check that on now on Ice Cream

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
isn't there we're gonna click that and

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.890 
isn't there we're gonna click that and
that'll<00:05:05.680> bring<00:05:05.830> us<00:05:06.009> a<00:05:06.190> command<00:05:07.060> window<00:05:07.300> that

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
that'll bring us a command window that

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.620 
that'll bring us a command window that
already<00:05:08.259> has<00:05:08.440> this<00:05:09.070> path<00:05:09.400> in<00:05:09.669> it<00:05:09.820> so<00:05:10.509> we<00:05:10.599> can

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
already has this path in it so we can

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.779 
already has this path in it so we can
start<00:05:10.810> using<00:05:10.960> programs<00:05:11.710> inside<00:05:12.070> here<00:05:12.340> like<00:05:12.370> a

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
start using programs inside here like a

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.820 
start using programs inside here like a
B<00:05:13.090> for<00:05:13.330> example<00:05:16.289> it's<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.380> next<00:05:17.590> thing<00:05:17.650> we're

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
B for example it's the next thing we're

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.290 
B for example it's the next thing we're
gonna<00:05:17.919> do<00:05:18.130> is<00:05:18.159> we're<00:05:18.550> gonna<00:05:18.610> check<00:05:18.849> to<00:05:18.880> see<00:05:19.120> if

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
gonna do is we're gonna check to see if

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.060 
gonna do is we're gonna check to see if
ADB<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.720> can<00:05:19.870> see<00:05:20.139> our<00:05:20.470> device<00:05:20.710> so<00:05:20.979> we're

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
ADB you can see our device so we're

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.670 
ADB you can see our device so we're
gonna<00:05:21.190> type<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.580> words<00:05:21.789> or<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.870> letters<00:05:23.169> adb

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
gonna type the words or the letters adb

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.770 
gonna type the words or the letters adb
space<00:05:25.110> devices<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.349> hit<00:05:26.590> enter<00:05:27.090> if<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.270> serial

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
space devices and hit enter if a serial

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.110 
space devices and hit enter if a serial
number<00:05:29.020> comes<00:05:29.229> up<00:05:29.380> like<00:05:29.590> this<00:05:29.650> one<00:05:30.120> then

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
number comes up like this one then

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.120 
number comes up like this one then
you're<00:05:31.539> all<00:05:31.659> set<00:05:31.960> adb<00:05:32.500> is<00:05:32.590> set<00:05:32.800> up<00:05:32.919> you<00:05:33.099> have

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
you're all set adb is set up you have

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.189 
you're all set adb is set up you have
the<00:05:33.430> drivers<00:05:33.789> that<00:05:33.820> you<00:05:34.060> need<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.020> can

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
the drivers that you need and you can

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.540 
the drivers that you need and you can
just<00:05:35.349> continue<00:05:35.440> from<00:05:35.770> here<00:05:35.830> with<00:05:36.220> whatever

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
just continue from here with whatever

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.270 
just continue from here with whatever
you<00:05:36.639> need<00:05:36.759> any<00:05:36.909> be<00:05:37.090> for<00:05:37.330> now<00:05:37.840> if<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.169> driver<00:05:38.620> or<00:05:39.250> a

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
you need any be for now if a driver or a

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.550 
you need any be for now if a driver or a
serial<00:05:40.000> number<00:05:40.180> does<00:05:40.300> not<00:05:40.330> show<00:05:40.900> up<00:05:41.050> here<00:05:41.320> you

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
serial number does not show up here you

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.050 
serial number does not show up here you
just<00:05:41.590> says<00:05:41.949> list<00:05:42.159> of<00:05:42.280> devices<00:05:42.490> attached<00:05:42.849> and

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
just says list of devices attached and

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.000 
just says list of devices attached and
it's<00:05:43.150> blank<00:05:43.509> then<00:05:44.409> there<00:05:44.560> are<00:05:44.650> a<00:05:44.680> few<00:05:44.860> things

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
it's blank then there are a few things

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.399 
it's blank then there are a few things
we<00:05:45.190> can<00:05:45.219> do<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.580> kind<00:05:46.029> of<00:05:46.180> force<00:05:46.599> it<00:05:46.750> to<00:05:47.080> find

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
we can do to kind of force it to find

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.990 
we can do to kind of force it to find
our

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
our

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.820 
our
USB<00:05:49.390> drivers<00:05:49.840> so<00:05:50.140> that's<00:05:50.320> what<00:05:50.470> we'll<00:05:50.590> do<00:05:50.710> next

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
USB drivers so that's what we'll do next

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.440 
USB drivers so that's what we'll do next
okay<00:05:51.430> so<00:05:51.490> there<00:05:51.700> are<00:05:51.790> two<00:05:51.940> ways<00:05:52.090> we<00:05:52.300> can

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
okay so there are two ways we can

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.740 
okay so there are two ways we can
manually<00:05:52.810> install<00:05:53.230> these<00:05:53.410> drivers<00:05:53.920> if<00:05:54.880> it

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
manually install these drivers if it

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.390 
manually install these drivers if it
didn't<00:05:56.020> automatically<00:05:56.560> install<00:05:57.040> it<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.280> we

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
didn't automatically install it and we

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.800 
didn't automatically install it and we
weren't<00:05:57.520> fortunate<00:05:57.910> enough<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:58.150> have<00:05:58.300> to<00:05:58.690> have

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
weren't fortunate enough to have to have

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.100 
weren't fortunate enough to have to have
that<00:05:58.960> work<00:05:59.640> one<00:06:00.640> of<00:06:00.730> the<00:06:00.790> ways<00:06:00.940> and<00:06:01.240> the<00:06:01.660> way<00:06:01.840> I

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
that work one of the ways and the way I

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.140 
that work one of the ways and the way I
like<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.530> best<00:06:02.710> is<00:06:02.980> using<00:06:03.760> a<00:06:03.820> program<00:06:04.120> called

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
like the best is using a program called

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.390 
like the best is using a program called
PDA<00:06:04.570> now<00:06:04.720> PDA<00:06:05.260> met<00:06:05.530> so<00:06:05.860> now<00:06:05.950> normally<00:06:06.310> this

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
PDA now PDA met so now normally this

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.280 
PDA now PDA met so now normally this
program<00:06:07.000> is<00:06:07.120> used<00:06:07.270> to<00:06:07.360> wire<00:06:07.570> tether<00:06:08.080> your

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
program is used to wire tether your

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.410 
program is used to wire tether your
phone<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:09.490> internet<00:06:09.820> from<00:06:09.940> your<00:06:10.000> phone<00:06:10.240> to

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
phone the internet from your phone to

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.840 
phone the internet from your phone to
your<00:06:10.480> computer<00:06:10.960> but<00:06:11.440> it<00:06:11.710> also<00:06:11.860> can<00:06:12.400> be<00:06:12.430> used<00:06:12.580> to

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
your computer but it also can be used to

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.600 
your computer but it also can be used to
install<00:06:13.120> ADB<00:06:13.420> drivers<00:06:13.720> kind<00:06:14.410> of<00:06:14.470> forcibly<00:06:14.890> so

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
install ADB drivers kind of forcibly so

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.410 
install ADB drivers kind of forcibly so
what<00:06:15.730> you're<00:06:15.820> gonna<00:06:15.880> do<00:06:16.000> is<00:06:16.060> are<00:06:16.120> gonna<00:06:16.270> click

download the latest version of PDA net

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.050 
download the latest version of PDA net
then<00:06:21.790> once<00:06:22.419> that's<00:06:22.630> completely<00:06:23.050> installed

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
then once that's completely installed

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.850 
then once that's completely installed
you're<00:06:25.060> gonna<00:06:25.150> unplug<00:06:25.510> your<00:06:25.720> device<00:06:25.770> plug<00:06:26.770> it

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
you're gonna unplug your device plug it

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.670 
you're gonna unplug your device plug it
back<00:06:26.919> in<00:06:27.280> and<00:06:27.520> then<00:06:27.669> we're<00:06:27.760> gonna<00:06:27.850> go<00:06:27.970> back<00:06:28.150> up

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
back in and then we're gonna go back up

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.080 
back in and then we're gonna go back up
to<00:06:29.850> step<00:06:30.850> number<00:06:31.300> eight<00:06:32.130> and<00:06:33.130> then<00:06:33.310> basically

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
to step number eight and then basically

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.480 
to step number eight and then basically
just<00:06:34.210> type<00:06:34.600> adb<00:06:34.990> devices<00:06:35.110> again<00:06:35.680> into<00:06:36.280> the

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
just type adb devices again into the

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.220 
just type adb devices again into the
command<00:06:36.790> prompt<00:06:37.120> and<00:06:37.210> see<00:06:37.450> if<00:06:37.570> that<00:06:37.810> works

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
command prompt and see if that works

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.110 
command prompt and see if that works
if<00:06:38.830> the<00:06:38.980> serial<00:06:39.250> number<00:06:39.430> comes<00:06:39.610> up<00:06:39.730> then<00:06:39.910> and

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
if the serial number comes up then and

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.630 
if the serial number comes up then and
we're<00:06:40.630> good<00:06:40.860> now<00:06:41.860> if<00:06:42.010> that<00:06:42.130> still<00:06:42.610> doesn't

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
we're good now if that still doesn't

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.760 
we're good now if that still doesn't
work<00:06:42.910> you<00:06:43.810> go<00:06:43.930> down<00:06:44.050> to<00:06:44.200> the<00:06:44.290> next<00:06:44.470> step<00:06:44.650> which

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
work you go down to the next step which

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.409 
work you go down to the next step which
is<00:06:44.800> to<00:06:44.890> basically<00:06:45.100> manually<00:06:45.700> install<00:06:46.330> the

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
is to basically manually install the

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:47.820 
is to basically manually install the
drivers<00:06:46.780> so<00:06:47.169> you're<00:06:47.290> gonna<00:06:47.440> look<00:06:47.560> for<00:06:47.710> your
