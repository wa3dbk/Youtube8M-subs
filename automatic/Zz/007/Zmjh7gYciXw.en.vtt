00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
kind of holding it tight at the fulcrum

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.850 
kind of holding it tight at the fulcrum
like<00:02:11.070> semi-tight<00:02:12.410> loosen<00:02:13.410> up<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.710> back

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
like semi-tight loosen up with the back

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.410 
like semi-tight loosen up with the back
fingers<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.550> kind<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:14.880> let<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.090> float

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
fingers and just kind of let it float

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.660 
fingers and just kind of let it float
around<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.590> circle<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.070> just<00:02:17.220> all<00:02:17.550> you're

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
around in a circle and just all you're

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.640 
around in a circle and just all you're
doing<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:17.940> whipping<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.300> outside<00:02:18.660> back<00:02:19.440> in

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
doing is whipping it outside back in

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.220 
doing is whipping it outside back in
again<00:02:20.100> walking<00:02:20.880> tip<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.240> drumstick<00:02:21.630> going

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
again walking tip of the drumstick going

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.990 
again walking tip of the drumstick going
clockwise<00:02:23.240> circle<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:25.700> that's<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.850> whole

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
clockwise circle and that's the whole

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.160 
clockwise circle and that's the whole
motion<00:02:27.180> you're<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.570> looking<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.840> out<00:02:27.990> and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
motion you're just looking it out and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.870 
motion you're just looking it out and
then<00:02:28.230> out<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.100> then<00:02:29.190> back<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.580> set<00:02:29.760> position

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
then out and then back to set position

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.360 
then out and then back to set position
and<00:02:31.070> left<00:02:32.070> hand<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:33.450> before<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and left hand just before that the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.310 
and left hand just before that the
motion<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.790> basically<00:02:36.240> just<00:02:36.570> stirring<00:02:37.230> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
motion is basically just stirring the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.830 
motion is basically just stirring the
pot<00:02:37.500> kind<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:37.800> emotion<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:38.610> you're<00:02:38.780> here<00:02:39.780> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
pot kind of emotion if you're here to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.390 
pot kind of emotion if you're here to
take<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.050> spoon<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.530> try<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.830> stir<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> pot<00:02:41.160> of

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
take a spoon you try to stir a pot of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.570 
take a spoon you try to stir a pot of
water<00:02:42.150> or<00:02:42.330> something<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:44.010> go<00:02:44.160> again

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
water or something just go again

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.340 
water or something just go again
clockwise<00:02:45.090> when<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.450> doubt<00:02:45.570> clockwise<00:02:46.140> this

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
clockwise when in doubt clockwise this

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.160 
clockwise when in doubt clockwise this
whole<00:02:46.500> visual<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.920> clockwise<00:02:47.570> circles<00:02:48.570> all

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
whole visual is clockwise circles all

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.490 
whole visual is clockwise circles all
right<00:02:49.320> all<00:02:49.500> you're<00:02:50.280> doing<00:02:51.110> is<00:02:52.110> whipping<00:02:52.320> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
right all you're doing is whipping the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500 
right all you're doing is whipping the
drum<00:02:52.680> stick<00:02:52.920> around<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.790> as<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> ferret

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
drum stick around like this as a ferret

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.110 
drum stick around like this as a ferret
stirring<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.900> pot<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.340> again<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.880> going

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
stirring the pot and again just going

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.640 
stirring the pot and again just going
around<00:02:57.209> clockwise<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.930> it's<00:02:58.050> obviously<00:02:58.470> it's

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
around clockwise and it's obviously it's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.770 
around clockwise and it's obviously it's
much<00:02:58.800> more<00:02:59.390> exaggerated<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.510> way<00:03:00.630> I'm<00:03:00.750> just

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
much more exaggerated this way I'm just

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.090 
much more exaggerated this way I'm just
showing<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.380> motions<00:03:01.740> right<00:03:01.890> here

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
showing you the motions right here

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.490 
showing you the motions right here
basically<00:03:03.090> what<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.840> looks<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:04.380> just

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
basically what it looks like it's just

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.030 
basically what it looks like it's just
kind<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.860> snap<00:03:05.570> out<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.930> then<00:03:07.050> similar<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.010> a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
kind of a snap out and then similar to a

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.770 
kind of a snap out and then similar to a
pancake<00:03:08.520> where<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.760> goes<00:03:08.850> out<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.120> then<00:03:09.270> out

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
pancake where it goes out and then out

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.740 
pancake where it goes out and then out
in<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.440> side<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:11.310> just<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.750> slightly

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
in it for this side it's just a slightly

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.900 
in it for this side it's just a slightly
different<00:03:12.989> kind<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.320> motion<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.760> you're

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
different kind of motion and so you're

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.600 
different kind of motion and so you're
doing<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:16.470> file<00:03:16.680> by<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.890> other<00:03:17.130> goes<00:03:17.310> left

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
doing one file by the other goes left

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.170 
doing one file by the other goes left
right<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:19.400> make<00:03:20.400> sure<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.640> get<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.820> wave

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
right so make sure you get that wave

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.240 
right so make sure you get that wave
thing<00:03:21.930> down<00:03:22.110> that's<00:03:22.410> that's<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.920> vehicle

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
thing down that's that's the vehicle

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.040 
thing down that's that's the vehicle
that's<00:03:23.489> what<00:03:23.700> makes<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.060> visual<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.570> cool<00:03:24.840> is

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
that's what makes the visual so cool is

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's what makes the visual so cool is
the<00:03:25.140> fact<00:03:25.320> that<00:03:25.410> it's<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.250> wave<00:03:26.459> motion<00:03:27.230> if

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the fact that it's in a wave motion if

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.840 
the fact that it's in a wave motion if
you<00:03:28.320> watch<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.769> video<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.250> Cavaliers

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
you watch the video of the Cavaliers

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.729 
you watch the video of the Cavaliers
doing<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.239> if<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.110> want<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.380> look<00:03:31.440> up<00:03:31.590> their

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
doing it if you want to look up their

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.710 
doing it if you want to look up their
finals<00:03:32.100> lot<00:03:32.280> video<00:03:32.550> you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.180> all<00:03:33.330> seven

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
finals lot video you can see all seven

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.000 
finals lot video you can see all seven
of<00:03:33.780> them<00:03:33.870> doing<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.200> once<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.800> looks

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
of them doing it once and it looks

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.280 
of them doing it once and it looks
amazing<00:03:38.300> if<00:03:39.300> you<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.480> if<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.930> did<00:03:40.080> both<00:03:40.260> of

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
amazing if you just if you did both of

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.680 
amazing if you just if you did both of
them<00:03:40.530> at<00:03:40.590> once<00:03:40.769> it's<00:03:41.130> just<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:42.330> know<00:03:42.420> big

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
them at once it's just like you know big

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.650 
them at once it's just like you know big
whoop<00:03:43.640> doesn't<00:03:44.640> look<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.790> fancy<00:03:45.209> HS<00:03:45.450> oh<00:03:45.570> my

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
whoop doesn't look that fancy HS oh my

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.449 
whoop doesn't look that fancy HS oh my
god<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:46.200> I<00:03:46.320> could<00:03:46.470> do<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.160> do<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.370> as<00:03:47.430> a

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
god if I could do that if you do it as a

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.040 
god if I could do that if you do it as a
wave<00:03:47.670> motion<00:03:48.000> they're<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.269> whoa<00:03:48.420> what<00:03:48.930> was

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
wave motion they're like whoa what was

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.560 
wave motion they're like whoa what was
that<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.890> know<00:03:49.980> what<00:03:50.100> i<00:03:50.130> mean<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.570> definitely

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
that you know what i mean so definitely

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.340 
that you know what i mean so definitely
get<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.750> wave<00:03:52.080> motion<00:03:52.470> down<00:03:53.570> and<00:03:54.570> in<00:03:54.810> context

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
get that wave motion down and in context

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.449 
get that wave motion down and in context
you<00:03:55.500> know<00:03:55.980> before<00:03:56.459> they<00:03:56.580> go<00:03:56.790> into<00:03:56.910> their<00:03:58.459> you

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
you know before they go into their you
