00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090

I<00:00:27.210> thought<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:28.289> think<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:28.800> can't<00:00:29.010> have

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
I thought was I think they can't have

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.800 
I thought was I think they can't have
the<00:00:29.220> black<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.580> white<00:00:29.699> thing<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.539> but

having<00:00:31.590> done<00:00:31.619> wrestling<00:00:32.369> before<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:33.059> thought

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
having done wrestling before I thought

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
having done wrestling before I thought
it<00:00:34.079> was<00:00:34.200> cool<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.860> show<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.910> was<00:00:36.059> from<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it was cool to show what it was from the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.240 
it was cool to show what it was from the
other<00:00:36.510> perspective<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:37.800> does<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.100> like

there in the back

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.709 
there in the back
you<00:00:44.940> know<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.120> expensive<00:00:45.390> looking

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
you know it's expensive looking

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.090 
you know it's expensive looking
production<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.350> never<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> see<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
production but you never get to see that

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.979 
production but you never get to see that
and<00:00:47.760> what<00:00:48.210> does<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.390> feel<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.960> be

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and what does it feel like to be

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.299 
and what does it feel like to be
communicating<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.710> another<00:00:49.890> restaurant

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
communicating with another restaurant

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.360 
communicating with another restaurant
and<00:00:50.550> next<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.329> thought<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.170> was<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:53.340> most

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and next I thought that was the most

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310 
and next I thought that was the most
innovative<00:00:53.670> part<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.510> think<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.140> all

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
innovative part of all I think that all

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.510 
innovative part of all I think that all
suits<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.420> quick<00:00:57.780> cuts<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.530> football<00:00:58.890> yeah

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
suits in the quick cuts of football yeah

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.680 
suits in the quick cuts of football yeah
actually<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.410> my<00:01:01.410> idea<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.449> NW<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.539> just

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
actually my my idea there was NW is just

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.149 
actually my my idea there was NW is just
starting<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.170> well<00:01:04.739> maybe<00:01:04.949> their

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
starting right well maybe their

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.880 
starting right well maybe their
production<00:01:05.519> crews<00:01:05.700> not<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.390> ah

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
production crews not all that do it ah

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.359 
production crews not all that do it ah
so<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.220> said<00:01:08.790> well<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.570> make<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> look<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.710> kid

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
