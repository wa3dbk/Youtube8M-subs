where you'll see the ripple stitch a lot
ISM<00:00:21.180> scarves<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:22.580> Afghans<00:00:23.660> blankets<00:00:24.660> and

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
ISM scarves or Afghans blankets and

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.890 
ISM scarves or Afghans blankets and
really<00:00:26.010> all<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.490> essentially<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> series

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
really all it is essentially is a series

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.470 
really all it is essentially is a series
of<00:00:27.990> increases<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.160> decreases<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.939> create<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
of increases and decreases that create a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
of increases and decreases that create a
little<00:00:30.779> wave<00:00:31.019> effect<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.489> stitch

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
little wave effect and for this stitch

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.549 
little wave effect and for this stitch
it's<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.510> basic<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.079> really<00:00:34.320> simple

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
it's really basic it's really simple

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.590 
it's really basic it's really simple
it's<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> first<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.420> first

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it's actually the first one of the first

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.350 
it's actually the first one of the first
projects<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.170> ever<00:00:37.350> crocheted<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.640> when<00:00:39.239> we

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
projects I ever crocheted but when we

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.500 
projects I ever crocheted but when we
get<00:00:39.540> started<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.370> chain<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
get started we want to do the chain and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
get started we want to do the chain and
when<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.590> your<00:00:43.770> foundation<00:00:44.250> chain<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
when you do your foundation chain you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.299 
when you do your foundation chain you
want<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> use<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.300> bigger<00:00:46.020> hook<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
want to use a bigger hook it's just a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.880 
want to use a bigger hook it's just a
little<00:00:47.520> easier<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> work<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.690> work<00:00:49.620> into

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
little easier to work with and work into

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.799 
little easier to work with and work into
those<00:00:50.039> stitches<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.670> also<00:00:51.120> another<00:00:51.539> reason

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
those stitches and also another reason

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.920 
those stitches and also another reason
is<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.620> want<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:53.420> stretch<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.660> base

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
is you want a stretch of your base

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.720 
is you want a stretch of your base
because<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> mimic<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> top<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
because you want it to mimic the top of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
because you want it to mimic the top of
your<00:00:56.879> your<00:00:57.239> blanket<00:00:57.629> when<00:00:57.780> you're<00:00:57.870> done<00:00:57.989> or

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
your your blanket when you're done or

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.959 
your your blanket when you're done or
your<00:00:58.379> scarf<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.489> we're<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> use<00:00:59.910> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
your scarf so we're going to use a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.380 
your scarf so we're going to use a
bigger<00:01:00.239> hook<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:02.699> ripple<00:01:03.149> stitch

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
bigger hook here and this ripple stitch

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.770 
bigger hook here and this ripple stitch
pattern<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.290> simply<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.860> multiple<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.909> 14

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
pattern is just simply a multiple of 14

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
pattern is just simply a multiple of 14
stitches<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.710> we're<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.950> add

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
stitches and then we're going to add

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.609 
stitches and then we're going to add
three<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> multiple<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:10.110> our<00:01:10.200> turning

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
three to that multiple for our turning

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.399 
three to that multiple for our turning
chain<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.299> demonstration<00:01:12.570> I'm

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
chain so for this demonstration I'm

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.200 
chain so for this demonstration I'm
going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.710> chain<00:01:14.070> thirty-one<00:01:14.700> stitches

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
going to chain thirty-one stitches

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.910 
going to chain thirty-one stitches
because<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.780> multiple<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.259> 14<00:01:16.619> twice

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
because that's a multiple of 14 twice

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.030 
because that's a multiple of 14 twice
plus<00:01:17.340> three<00:01:17.549> stitches<00:01:21.140> okay<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.650> when<00:01:22.920> you're

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
plus three stitches okay so when you're

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.999 
plus three stitches okay so when you're
done<00:01:23.280> with<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.049> foundation<00:01:25.049> chain<00:01:25.320> you're

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
done with that foundation chain you're

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.679 
done with that foundation chain you're
going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> insert<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.240> hook<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.570> you're

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
going to insert the hook that you're

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.830 
going to insert the hook that you're
going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> use<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.470> ripple<00:01:28.920> stitch<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
going to use for your ripple stitch and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.030 
going to use for your ripple stitch and
as<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.960> said<00:01:31.140> we're<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.650> turning

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
as I said we're going to have a turning

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.469 
as I said we're going to have a turning
chain<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.369> three<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.939> we're<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> skip

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
chain of three so we're going to skip

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.539 
chain of three so we're going to skip
one<00:01:33.900> two<00:01:34.110> three<00:01:34.259> chains<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
one two three chains and we're going to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.630 
one two three chains and we're going to
work<00:01:35.670> into<00:01:35.850> our<00:01:36.030> four<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.009> I<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> work<00:01:38.460> in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
work into our four and I like to work in

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.819 
work into our four and I like to work in
that<00:01:38.790> back<00:01:39.000> bump<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> stitch<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.619> just

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that back bump of the stitch that just

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.389 
that back bump of the stitch that just
leaves<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.189> nice<00:01:41.400> clean<00:01:41.729> edge<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.189> have

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
leaves a nice clean edge so what we have

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.280 
leaves a nice clean edge so what we have
here<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:44.909> our<00:01:45.360> first<00:01:45.720> double<00:01:46.170> crochet

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
here is we have our first double crochet

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.859 
here is we have our first double crochet
in<00:01:46.860> our<00:01:46.979> turning<00:01:47.280> chain<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.390> second

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
in our turning chain and then a second

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.389 
in our turning chain and then a second
double<00:01:49.110> crochet<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.560> we're<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.130> one

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
double crochet so we're going to do one

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.380 
double crochet so we're going to do one
more<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> same<00:01:51.329> chain<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.270> our

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
more in that same chain so this is our

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.749 
more in that same chain so this is our
first<00:01:54.630> increase<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.710> three<00:01:56.070> double<00:01:56.340> crochets

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
first increase of three double crochets

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.420 
first increase of three double crochets
now<00:01:57.110> we're<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> double<00:01:58.619> crochet<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
now we're going to double crochet in the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.570 
now we're going to double crochet in the
next<00:01:59.630> three<00:02:01.250> chains<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.909> one<00:02:04.549> two

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.880 

three<00:02:10.850> so<00:02:11.850> we've<00:02:12.000> done<00:02:12.180> our<00:02:12.330> first<00:02:12.890> increase

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
three so we've done our first increase

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.790 
three so we've done our first increase
and<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:15.360> we've<00:02:15.780> done<00:02:15.930> three<00:02:16.200> double<00:02:16.440> crochets

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and now we've done three double crochets

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.790 
and now we've done three double crochets
we're<00:02:17.100> going<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.580> decrease<00:02:18.510> over<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.410> next

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
we're going to decrease over the next

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.890 
we're going to decrease over the next
three<00:02:19.980> stitches<00:02:20.270> with<00:02:21.270> our<00:02:21.420> three<00:02:21.630> double

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
three stitches with our three double

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.130 
three stitches with our three double
crochets<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.040> way<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.190> do<00:02:23.430> that

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
crochets and the way you do that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.990 
crochets and the way you do that
yarn<00:02:25.140> over<00:02:25.260> draw<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.950> loop<00:02:26.130> pull<00:02:26.400> through

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
yarn over draw up a loop pull through

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.350 
yarn over draw up a loop pull through
two<00:02:27.270> that's<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.290> first<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:29.070> our<00:02:29.250> set<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.090> three

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
two that's the first of our set of three

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.880 
two that's the first of our set of three
double<00:02:30.720> crochets<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:31.380> we're<00:02:31.620> going<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.800> go

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
double crochets now we're going to go

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.330 
double crochets now we're going to go
into<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.190> second<00:02:32.700> chain<00:02:33.350> drop<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.410> loop<00:02:34.740> yarn

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
into the second chain drop a loop yarn

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580 
into the second chain drop a loop yarn
over<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.700> pull<00:02:35.820> through<00:02:36.000> two<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.320> there's<00:02:37.500> our

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
over and pull through two so there's our

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.650 
over and pull through two so there's our
second<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.220> then<00:02:39.180> we're<00:02:39.270> going<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.420> go<00:02:39.510> into

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
second and then we're going to go into

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.590 
second and then we're going to go into
the<00:02:39.780> very<00:02:40.080> last<00:02:40.530> stitch<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.160> third<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:41.640> yarn

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
the very last stitch the third one yarn

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.090 
the very last stitch the third one yarn
over<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.840> pull<00:02:42.930> through<00:02:43.080> two<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.709> here's<00:02:43.950> our

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
over and pull through two so here's our

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.090 
over and pull through two so here's our
three<00:02:44.459> double<00:02:45.150> crochets<00:02:45.570> ready<00:02:46.500> yarn<00:02:46.770> over

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
three double crochets ready yarn over

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.340 
three double crochets ready yarn over
and<00:02:47.130> draw<00:02:47.370> through<00:02:47.520> all<00:02:47.880> four<00:02:48.150> loops<00:02:48.350> so

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
and draw through all four loops so

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.740 
and draw through all four loops so
that's<00:02:49.560> our<00:02:49.890> decrease<00:02:50.700> we're<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> do

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that's our decrease we're going to do

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.630 
that's our decrease we're going to do
two<00:02:51.990> of<00:02:52.020> these<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.590> row<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:53.040> create<00:02:53.400> our

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
two of these in a row to create our

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.760 
two of these in a row to create our
little<00:02:53.820> wave<00:02:54.060> pattern<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.959> let's<00:02:55.170> repeat<00:02:55.530> that

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
little wave pattern so let's repeat that

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.140 
little wave pattern so let's repeat that
again<00:02:56.150> go<00:02:57.150> through<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.480> back<00:02:57.720> bump<00:02:59.150> pull

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
again go through the back bump pull

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.570 
again go through the back bump pull
through<00:03:00.360> two<00:03:00.740> pull<00:03:01.740> through<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:02.040> second

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
through two pull through the second

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.010 
through two pull through the second
chain<00:03:04.310> with<00:03:05.310> your<00:03:05.550> two<00:03:05.790> go<00:03:06.300> through<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.660> third

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
chain with your two go through the third

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:15.140 
chain with your two go through the third
chain<00:03:12.350> okay<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.620> we've<00:03:13.769> got<00:03:13.800> our<00:03:14.070> three<00:03:14.340> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
chain okay so we've got our three the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.150 
chain okay so we've got our three the
start<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.540> our<00:03:15.660> three<00:03:15.959> double<00:03:16.290> crochets<00:03:16.709> yarn

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
start of our three double crochets yarn

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.000 
start of our three double crochets yarn
over<00:03:17.430> pull<00:03:17.820> through<00:03:17.850> all<00:03:18.180> four<00:03:18.540> stitches<00:03:19.010> so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
over pull through all four stitches so

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.800 
over pull through all four stitches so
if<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.580> stop<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.000> take<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.180> look<00:03:21.390> at<00:03:21.510> our<00:03:21.630> work

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
if we stop and take a look at our work

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.930 
if we stop and take a look at our work
you<00:03:22.170> can<00:03:22.350> see<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.709> we've<00:03:22.860> already<00:03:23.130> started

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
you can see that we've already started

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.970 
you can see that we've already started
at<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.360> top<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.810> we're<00:03:25.050> going<00:03:25.440> down<00:03:25.830> to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
at the top and we're going down to

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.680 
at the top and we're going down to
create<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.370> wave<00:03:26.640> effect<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.450> now<00:03:27.570> we're

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
create that wave effect so now we're

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.449 
create that wave effect so now we're
going<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.840> work<00:03:28.019> our<00:03:28.230> way<00:03:28.350> back<00:03:28.590> up<00:03:28.830> for<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
going to work our way back up for the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.360 
going to work our way back up for the
next<00:03:29.790> part<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.540> our<00:03:30.660> wave<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:32.070> we're<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.310> to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
next part of our wave so we're going to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.420 
next part of our wave so we're going to
do<00:03:32.790> three<00:03:33.120> double<00:03:33.269> crochets<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.950> get<00:03:35.100> over<00:03:35.400> to

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
do three double crochets to get over to

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.960 
do three double crochets to get over to
that<00:03:35.760> next<00:03:36.150> bump<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.410> our<00:03:37.560> wave<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:38.760> one

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.430 

to

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.930 

three<00:03:48.600> now<00:03:49.600> since<00:03:50.230> we<00:03:50.440> decreased<00:03:51.340> last<00:03:51.640> time

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
three now since we decreased last time

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.120 
three now since we decreased last time
in<00:03:52.210> those<00:03:52.630> two<00:03:52.960> stitches<00:03:53.200> we're<00:03:53.770> going<00:03:53.980> to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
in those two stitches we're going to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.920 
in those two stitches we're going to
increase<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:54.940> next<00:03:55.060> two<00:03:55.300> stitches<00:03:55.510> so

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
increase in the next two stitches so

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.260 
increase in the next two stitches so
we're<00:03:56.020> going<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.170> place<00:03:56.470> three<00:03:57.270> double

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
we're going to place three double

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.520 
we're going to place three double
crochets<00:03:58.690> into<00:04:00.060> this<00:04:01.060> next<00:04:01.390> stitch<00:04:01.600> we're

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
crochets into this next stitch we're

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.190 
crochets into this next stitch we're
going<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.710> do<00:04:02.800> that<00:04:02.950> twice<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.840> there's<00:04:05.050> our

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
going to do that twice so there's our

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.320 
going to do that twice so there's our
three<00:04:05.560> double<00:04:06.010> crochets<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.580> one<00:04:06.610> stitch<00:04:06.760> and

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
three double crochets in one stitch and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.640 
three double crochets in one stitch and
we're<00:04:07.420> going<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.570> do<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:07.900> second<00:04:08.320> time<00:04:08.470> in

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
we're going to do that second time in

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.780 
we're going to do that second time in
the<00:04:08.710> next<00:04:08.920> stitch<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.720> go<00:04:10.750> in<00:04:11.370> one<00:04:12.370> double

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
the next stitch so go in one double

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.070 
the next stitch so go in one double
crochet<00:04:14.250> two<00:04:15.250> double<00:04:15.280> crochet<00:04:16.620> three<00:04:19.049> okay<00:04:20.049> so

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
crochet two double crochet three okay so

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.510 
crochet two double crochet three okay so
if<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.500> look<00:04:20.530> here<00:04:21.690> we're<00:04:22.890> rounding<00:04:23.890> over<00:04:24.400> the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
if you look here we're rounding over the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.180 
if you look here we're rounding over the
top<00:04:24.730> of<00:04:24.760> this<00:04:25.090> wave<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:26.380> we're<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.710> work

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
top of this wave so we're going to work

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.980 
top of this wave so we're going to work
our<00:04:27.370> way<00:04:27.400> back<00:04:27.670> down<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:28.150> repeat<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.690> step

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
our way back down and repeat this step

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.340 
our way back down and repeat this step
again<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:31.300> we're<00:04:31.420> going<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.600> crochet<00:04:31.810> in<00:04:32.230> the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
again so we're going to crochet in the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.640 
again so we're going to crochet in the
next<00:04:32.640> three<00:04:33.640> stitches<00:04:33.700> or<00:04:34.540> three<00:04:34.780> chains<00:04:35.370> one

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
next three stitches or three chains one

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:46.180 
next three stitches or three chains one
two<00:04:41.370> three

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.120 

okay<00:04:47.200> and<00:04:48.200> then<00:04:48.350> we're<00:04:48.470> going<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.620> do<00:04:48.800> art

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
okay and then we're going to do art

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.700 
okay and then we're going to do art
decreases<00:04:49.790> again<00:04:50.350> you're<00:04:51.350> just<00:04:51.530> going<00:04:51.680> to

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
decreases again you're just going to

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.770 
decreases again you're just going to
basically<00:04:51.980> repeat<00:04:52.820> this<00:04:53.090> your<00:04:53.510> your

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
basically repeat this your your

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.040 
basically repeat this your your
decreases<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.560> your<00:04:54.680> increases<00:04:55.780> over<00:04:56.780> two

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
decreases and your increases over two

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.660 
decreases and your increases over two
stitches<00:04:57.620> and<00:04:57.860> you're<00:04:57.950> going<00:04:58.100> to<00:04:58.160> continue<00:04:58.490> to

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
stitches and you're going to continue to

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.050 
stitches and you're going to continue to
do<00:04:58.910> that<00:04:58.940> creating<00:04:59.840> this<00:04:59.960> wave<00:05:00.320> effect<00:05:01.060> okay

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
do that creating this wave effect okay

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.360 
do that creating this wave effect okay
so<00:05:02.120> we've<00:05:02.420> done<00:05:02.450> our<00:05:03.080> first<00:05:03.350> decrease<00:05:03.770> over

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
so we've done our first decrease over

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.740 
so we've done our first decrease over
those<00:05:04.490> three<00:05:04.730> stitches<00:05:04.940> so<00:05:05.420> we're<00:05:05.540> going<00:05:05.630> to

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
those three stitches so we're going to

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.220 
those three stitches so we're going to
do<00:05:05.870> our<00:05:06.020> second<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:06.620> decrease<00:05:07.870> go<00:05:08.870> through<00:05:09.110> the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
do our second to decrease go through the

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:17.710 
do our second to decrease go through the
first<00:05:09.470> chain<00:05:11.050> second<00:05:12.050> chain<00:05:13.840> third<00:05:14.840> chain<00:05:16.720> and

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
first chain second chain third chain and

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.120 
first chain second chain third chain and
then<00:05:17.900> we're<00:05:17.990> going<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.170> yarn<00:05:18.680> over<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:18.980> draw

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
then we're going to yarn over and draw

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.360 
then we're going to yarn over and draw
through<00:05:19.310> all<00:05:19.640> four<00:05:20.180> so<00:05:20.930> we've<00:05:21.140> created<00:05:21.370> the

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
through all four so we've created the

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.510 
through all four so we've created the
last<00:05:22.550> part<00:05:22.850> of<00:05:22.970> that<00:05:23.000> little<00:05:23.330> wave<00:05:24.340> now<00:05:25.340> we're

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
last part of that little wave now we're

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.470 
last part of that little wave now we're
going<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.670> do<00:05:25.850> three<00:05:26.540> double<00:05:26.750> crochet<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:29.330> get

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
going to do three double crochet to get

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.000 
going to do three double crochet to get
to<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.750> end<00:05:29.960> of<00:05:30.200> our<00:05:30.410> row<00:05:30.890> and<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:33.650> very<00:05:33.830> last

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
to the end of our row and the very last

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.920 
to the end of our row and the very last
thing<00:05:34.250> we're<00:05:34.370> going<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.520> do<00:05:34.730> of<00:05:35.000> this<00:05:35.300> row<00:05:35.600> and

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
thing we're going to do of this row and

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.230 
thing we're going to do of this row and
every<00:05:36.200> row<00:05:36.830> after<00:05:37.340> this<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.090> ripple

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
every row after this and the ripple

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.960 
every row after this and the ripple
stitch<00:05:38.630> will<00:05:39.020> have<00:05:39.170> one<00:05:39.470> stitch<00:05:39.950> left<00:05:39.980> after

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
stitch will have one stitch left after

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.880 
stitch will have one stitch left after
our<00:05:41.090> three<00:05:41.300> double<00:05:41.570> crochets<00:05:41.990> we're<00:05:42.680> going<00:05:42.830> to

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
our three double crochets we're going to

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.040 
our three double crochets we're going to
do<00:05:43.040> our<00:05:43.070> increase<00:05:43.640> because<00:05:44.420> if<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:44.750> remember

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
do our increase because if you remember

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.890 
do our increase because if you remember
we<00:05:45.230> started<00:05:45.740> out<00:05:45.980> this<00:05:46.400> round<00:05:46.760> with<00:05:47.660> three

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
we started out this round with three

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.960 
we started out this round with three
double<00:05:48.680> crochets<00:05:49.160> in<00:05:49.340> that<00:05:49.370> first<00:05:49.730> stitch

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
double crochets in that first stitch

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.060 
double crochets in that first stitch
essentially<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.350> we're<00:05:51.470> going<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.620> finish<00:05:51.830> off

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
essentially so we're going to finish off

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.710 
essentially so we're going to finish off
the<00:05:52.280> same<00:05:52.490> exact<00:05:52.850> way<00:05:53.030> we're<00:05:53.300> going<00:05:53.420> to<00:05:53.510> work

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
the same exact way we're going to work

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.680 
the same exact way we're going to work
into<00:05:54.080> that<00:05:54.200> last<00:05:54.530> chain<00:05:55.660> three<00:05:56.660> double

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
into that last chain three double

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.310 
into that last chain three double
crochets<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:58.660> that's<00:05:59.660> going<00:05:59.840> to<00:05:59.900> make<00:06:00.080> our

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
crochets and that's going to make our

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.640 
crochets and that's going to make our
project<00:06:01.010> fan<00:06:01.550> out<00:06:01.790> and<00:06:02.060> be<00:06:02.360> nice<00:06:03.140> and<00:06:03.169> uniform

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
project fan out and be nice and uniform

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.460 
project fan out and be nice and uniform
and<00:06:04.450> then<00:06:05.450> all<00:06:05.780> you're<00:06:05.960> going<00:06:06.050> to<00:06:06.110> want<00:06:06.290> to<00:06:06.350> do

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
and then all you're going to want to do

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.380 
and then all you're going to want to do
at<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:06.680> point<00:06:06.919> is<00:06:07.220> chain<00:06:07.610> three<00:06:07.970> for<00:06:08.270> your

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
at this point is chain three for your

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.230 
at this point is chain three for your
height<00:06:08.620> of<00:06:09.620> your<00:06:09.770> double<00:06:10.070> crochet<00:06:10.460> turn<00:06:11.000> your

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
height of your double crochet turn your

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.850 
height of your double crochet turn your
work<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:11.810> you're<00:06:12.350> going<00:06:12.440> to<00:06:12.500> repeat<00:06:12.830> that

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
work and you're going to repeat that

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.570 
work and you're going to repeat that
exact<00:06:13.340> same<00:06:13.370> stitch<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:14.450> exact<00:06:14.810> same

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580

exact same stitch the exact same
instructions<00:06:16.580> that<00:06:16.790> we<00:06:16.910> followed<00:06:17.840> in<00:06:17.990> the

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
instructions that we followed in the

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.450
