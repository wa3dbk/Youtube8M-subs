00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.360 
UV exposure
you're<00:00:40.360> obviously<00:00:40.840> in<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.649> place<00:00:41.860> much<00:00:42.129> closer

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
you're obviously in a place much closer

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.910 
you're obviously in a place much closer
to<00:00:43.360> unobstructed<00:00:43.719> sunlight<00:00:44.440> so<00:00:44.680> you're<00:00:44.829> gonna

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
to unobstructed sunlight so you're gonna

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.549 
to unobstructed sunlight so you're gonna
have<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.160> Sun<00:00:45.930> coming<00:00:46.930> through<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.109> cockpit

have the Sun coming through the cockpit
a<00:00:47.770> lot<00:00:48.010> more<00:00:48.219> often<00:00:48.430> probably<00:00:48.789> than<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.120> will

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
around like this right the problem I

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.520 
around like this right the problem I

polarized lenses do to digital displays
I'm<00:01:16.450> having<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.900> hard<00:01:17.020> time<00:01:17.079> even<00:01:17.439> seeing<00:01:17.770> the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
I'm having a hard time even seeing the

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.200 
I'm having a hard time even seeing the
display<00:01:18.159> on<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.400> camera<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.820> make<00:01:18.939> sure<00:01:19.090> I'm

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
display on this camera to make sure I'm

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.390 
display on this camera to make sure I'm
still<00:01:19.450> in<00:01:19.630> frame<00:01:19.930> because<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.920> polarized

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
still in frame because the polarized

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.039 
still in frame because the polarized
sunglasses<00:01:21.579> sort<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.540> makes<00:01:22.689> out<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.840> problem

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
sunglasses sort of makes out a problem

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.230 
sunglasses sort of makes out a problem
now<00:01:23.350> I<00:01:23.380> know<00:01:23.500> ten<00:01:24.220> degrees<00:01:24.520> makes<00:01:24.880> all<00:01:25.090> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
now I know ten degrees makes all the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.679 
now I know ten degrees makes all the
difference

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
difference

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.080 
difference
ten<00:01:25.840> fifteen<00:01:26.200> degrees<00:01:26.500> but<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.549> just<00:01:27.820> don't

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
ten fifteen degrees but I just don't

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.819 
ten fifteen degrees but I just don't
like<00:01:28.270> having<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.720> kind<00:01:28.930> of<00:01:29.079> adjust<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.619> SI

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
like having to kind of adjust the SI

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.310 
like having to kind of adjust the SI
thing<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.390> don't<00:01:31.720> like<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.110> when<00:01:32.170> I'm

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
thing so and I don't like it when I'm

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.859 
thing so and I don't like it when I'm
driving<00:01:32.850> necessarily<00:01:33.850> because<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.659> know<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
driving necessarily because you know the

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.899 
driving necessarily because you know the
windshields<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.560> different<00:01:35.890> cars<00:01:36.070> gets

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
windshields of different cars gets

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.060 
windshields of different cars gets
splotchy<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.479> all<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.049> stuff<00:01:38.320> but<00:01:38.560> anyway

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
splotchy and all that stuff but anyway

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.139 
splotchy and all that stuff but anyway
that's<00:01:39.520> beside<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.820> point

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
that's beside the point

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.940 
that's beside the point
the<00:01:40.360> other<00:01:40.479> thing<00:01:40.689> is<00:01:40.869> they<00:01:41.500> have<00:01:41.619> pretty

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
the other thing is they have pretty

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
the other thing is they have pretty
thick<00:01:42.340> bows<00:01:43.180> on<00:01:43.479> them<00:01:43.630> as<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.079> can<00:01:44.259> see<00:01:44.560> here

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
thick bows on them as you can see here

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.749 
thick bows on them as you can see here
so<00:01:46.570> they're<00:01:47.200> not<00:01:47.320> very<00:01:47.380> comfortable<00:01:47.770> in<00:01:48.640> a

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759

a neutral gray color so it doesn't

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.009

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.150 
least that's my opinion they don't look
too<00:03:01.239> bad<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.080> decided<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.590> buy<00:03:02.769> them<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:03.130> a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
whim but I also wanted to pursue what a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.949 
whim but I also wanted to pursue what a

when I went into sunglass hut and tried

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.099 
when I went into sunglass hut and tried
on<00:03:50.799> a<00:03:50.829> bunch<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.130> sunglasses<00:03:51.540> these<00:03:52.540> fit<00:03:52.930> me

made I do have the drivers gradient it's
a<00:04:11.139> subtle<00:04:11.739> gradient<00:04:12.069> but<00:04:12.370> it's<00:04:12.489> there<00:04:12.730> and

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
a subtle gradient but it's there and

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.449 
a subtle gradient but it's there and
there's<00:04:13.750> still<00:04:13.930> quite<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.260> bit<00:04:14.350> of<00:04:14.500> tinting<00:04:15.400> and

brightens<00:04:22.930> up<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.110> little<00:04:23.289> bit<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:23.890> know

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
brightens up a little bit you know

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.350 
brightens up a little bit you know
because<00:04:24.310> my<00:04:24.460> narrow<00:04:24.700> face<00:04:24.970> these<00:04:25.210> are<00:04:25.330> a

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
because my narrow face these are a

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.310 
because my narrow face these are a
little<00:04:25.479> bit<00:04:25.570> wider

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
little bit wider

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.410 
little bit wider
they<00:04:26.500> claim<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.830> be<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> medium<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.210> large

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
they claim to be a medium to large

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.500 
they claim to be a medium to large
universal<00:04:29.320> fit<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:30.040> my<00:04:30.520> narrow<00:04:30.790> face<00:04:31.120> probably

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
universal fit so my narrow face probably

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.910 
universal fit so my narrow face probably
doesn't<00:04:31.780> fit<00:04:31.900> medium<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.320> large<00:04:32.530> I'm<00:04:32.740> more

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
doesn't fit medium to large I'm more

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.410 
doesn't fit medium to large I'm more
like<00:04:33.100> small<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.550> medium<00:04:33.850> they're<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> little

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
like small to medium they're a little

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.600 
like small to medium they're a little
bit<00:04:34.600> wider<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.800> then<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.100> problem<00:04:36.430> there<00:04:36.580> is

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
bit wider and then the problem there is

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.670 
bit wider and then the problem there is
the<00:04:36.880> bows<00:04:37.090> start<00:04:37.570> out<00:04:37.690> further<00:04:38.020> away<00:04:38.350> from<00:04:38.380> my

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
the bows start out further away from my

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.650 
the bows start out further away from my
face<00:04:38.890> and<00:04:39.220> then<00:04:39.700> they<00:04:39.790> go<00:04:39.940> back<00:04:40.150> which<00:04:40.390> leaves

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
face and then they go back which leaves

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.900 
face and then they go back which leaves
more<00:04:40.900> gap<00:04:41.200> between<00:04:41.590> my<00:04:41.980> head<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.580> probably

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
more gap between my head you probably

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.240 
more gap between my head you probably
can't<00:04:43.090> see<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:44.200> glass<00:04:44.410> so<00:04:44.710> from<00:04:45.040> a

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
can't see it and the glass so from a

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.310 
can't see it and the glass so from a
clamping<00:04:46.060> perspective<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.900> headset

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
clamping perspective of the headset

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.620 
clamping perspective of the headset
there's<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.370> little<00:04:48.610> bit<00:04:48.730> more<00:04:48.760> space<00:04:49.270> there

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
there's a little bit more space there

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.000 
there's a little bit more space there
for<00:04:50.610> sound<00:04:51.610> leakage<00:04:52.030> but<00:04:52.900> they're<00:04:53.800> nice

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
for sound leakage but they're nice

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.380 
for sound leakage but they're nice

do have a gradient tint it's a more
pronounced<00:05:24.640> gradient<00:05:25.240> so<00:05:25.450> it's<00:05:25.660> definitely

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
pronounced gradient so it's definitely

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.040 
pronounced gradient so it's definitely
lighter<00:05:26.800> tint<00:05:27.190> here<00:05:27.520> in<00:05:27.970> my<00:05:28.240> view<00:05:28.510> than<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:28.960> is

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
lighter tint here in my view than it is

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.800 
lighter tint here in my view than it is
up<00:05:29.260> here<00:05:29.560> which<00:05:30.280> is<00:05:30.790> really<00:05:31.180> nice<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.570> kind<00:05:31.780> of

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
up here which is really nice and kind of

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.480 
up here which is really nice and kind of
what<00:05:31.930> I<00:05:31.960> was<00:05:32.140> going<00:05:32.320> for<00:05:32.590> for<00:05:32.860> cockpit<00:05:33.250> or

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
what I was going for for cockpit or

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.300 
what I was going for for cockpit or
inside<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.420> car<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:35.170> frames<00:05:35.500> are<00:05:35.830> smaller

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
inside the car the frames are smaller

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.010 
inside the car the frames are smaller
narrower<00:05:36.670> this<00:05:36.970> is<00:05:37.090> for<00:05:37.300> probably<00:05:37.630> a<00:05:37.690> smaller

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
narrower this is for probably a smaller

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.750 
narrower this is for probably a smaller
face<00:05:38.320> which<00:05:38.590> is<00:05:38.890> why<00:05:39.130> they<00:05:39.310> work<00:05:39.490> for<00:05:39.670> me

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
face which is why they work for me

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.000 
face which is why they work for me
really<00:05:40.030> well<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:41.110> because<00:05:41.380> of<00:05:41.410> that<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.800> bows

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
really well and because of that the bows

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.720 
really well and because of that the bows
start<00:05:42.430> out<00:05:42.580> closer<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.770> actually<00:05:44.770> are<00:05:45.040> almost

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
start out closer and actually are almost

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.210 
start out closer and actually are almost
touching<00:05:46.270> my<00:05:46.840> head<00:05:47.080> as<00:05:47.230> they<00:05:47.380> go<00:05:47.500> back<00:05:47.740> where

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
touching my head as they go back where

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.030 
touching my head as they go back where
the<00:05:48.310> ear<00:05:48.460> cups<00:05:48.700> would<00:05:48.880> go<00:05:49.000> so<00:05:49.330> I<00:05:49.840> think<00:05:50.350> sound

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
the ear cups would go so I think sound

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.490 
the ear cups would go so I think sound
linkage<00:05:51.460> would<00:05:51.640> be<00:05:51.760> a<00:05:51.790> lot<00:05:52.060> less<00:05:52.330> there<00:05:53.140> and

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
linkage would be a lot less there and

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.240 
linkage would be a lot less there and
then<00:05:54.270> you<00:05:55.270> know<00:05:55.390> the<00:05:55.900> wife<00:05:56.170> and<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.470> son<00:05:56.920> both
