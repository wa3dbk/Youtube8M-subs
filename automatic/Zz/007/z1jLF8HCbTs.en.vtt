00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
um I just was really thinking about this

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.270 
um I just was really thinking about this
just<00:02:33.010> because<00:02:33.310> I've<00:02:33.700> been<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:34.360> person<00:02:34.750> who<00:02:35.280> have

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
just because I've been a person who have

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.510 
just because I've been a person who have
felt<00:02:37.180> down<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.930> I've<00:02:38.530> allow<00:02:38.950> other<00:02:39.220> people<00:02:39.310> to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
felt down and I've allow other people to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.280 
felt down and I've allow other people to
make<00:02:39.700> me<00:02:40.000> feel<00:02:40.209> down<00:02:40.420> or<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.870> bring<00:02:41.110> me<00:02:41.260> down

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
make me feel down or to bring me down

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.000 
make me feel down or to bring me down
and<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:43.720> definitely<00:02:44.110> not<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.380> way<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.560> live<00:02:44.860> is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
and it's definitely not a way to live is

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.890 
and it's definitely not a way to live is
definitely<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.820> because<00:02:46.420> other<00:02:46.600> does<00:02:46.780> is

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
definitely to be because other does is

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.570 
definitely to be because other does is
causing<00:02:47.200> stress<00:02:47.290> upon<00:02:47.590> yourself<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.280> hurts
