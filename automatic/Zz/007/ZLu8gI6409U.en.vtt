00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
have been in the right place but was

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.440 
have been in the right place but was
that<00:02:38.260> good<00:02:38.530> advice<00:02:38.650> or<00:02:39.159> bad<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.909> have<00:02:40.239> never

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
that good advice or bad I have never

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.330 
that good advice or bad I have never
seen<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> Riddick<00:02:41.110> movie<00:02:41.440> before<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.159> my

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
seen a Riddick movie before and my

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.920 
seen a Riddick movie before and my
takeaway<00:02:42.909> is<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.209> he's<00:02:43.450> like<00:02:43.630> Batman

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
takeaway is that he's like Batman

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.170 
takeaway is that he's like Batman
crosses<00:02:44.680> Wolverine<00:02:45.190> which<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> pretty<00:02:45.970> good

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
crosses Wolverine which is a pretty good

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.670 
crosses Wolverine which is a pretty good
idea<00:02:46.209> for<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.840> splice

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
idea for a splice

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.780 
idea for a splice
but<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.490> movie

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
but this movie

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.339 
but this movie
surprised<00:02:49.120> me<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.480> ended<00:02:49.750> up<00:02:49.930> kind<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.290> being

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
surprised me it ended up kind of being

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.949 
surprised me it ended up kind of being
like<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> sci-fi<00:02:51.310> Western<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.329> it<00:02:52.599> was<00:02:52.750> very

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
like a sci-fi Western and it was very

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.160 
like a sci-fi Western and it was very
true<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.709> tropes<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.159> both<00:02:54.340> genres

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
true to the tropes of both genres

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.080 
true to the tropes of both genres
however<00:02:56.170> overall<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:57.250> movie<00:02:57.519> was<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:57.670> too

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
however overall the movie was just too

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.640 
however overall the movie was just too
slow<00:02:58.390> paced<00:02:58.689> and<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.140> tried<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.469> be<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> good

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
slow paced and I tried to be a good

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.380 
slow paced and I tried to be a good
sport<00:03:00.069> about<00:03:00.159> it<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.609> I<00:03:00.670> think<00:03:00.939> I<00:03:01.000> held<00:03:01.209> on<00:03:01.359> for

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
sport about it and I think I held on for

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.229 
sport about it and I think I held on for
as<00:03:01.689> long<00:03:01.750> as<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.109> could<00:03:02.170> but<00:03:03.030> towards<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.150> the

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
as long as I could but towards like the

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.569 
as long as I could but towards like the
end<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.719> film<00:03:04.930> or<00:03:05.769> what<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.159> thought<00:03:06.370> was

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
end of the film or what I thought was

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.309 
end of the film or what I thought was
the<00:03:06.730> end<00:03:06.879> there's<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> scene<00:03:08.140> where<00:03:08.290> a

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
the end there's the scene where a

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.800 
the end there's the scene where a
speeder<00:03:08.650> speeder<00:03:09.519> bike<00:03:09.760> breaks<00:03:10.090> down<00:03:10.329> and<00:03:10.599> Vin

speeder speeder bike breaks down and Vin

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.210 
speeder speeder bike breaks down and Vin

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
Diesel turns to the guy he's with and

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.319 
Diesel turns to the guy he's with and
he's<00:03:12.340> like<00:03:12.459> we're<00:03:12.609> gonna<00:03:12.730> have<00:03:12.939> to<00:03:13.060> take<00:03:13.209> the

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
he's like we're gonna have to take the

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.170 
he's like we're gonna have to take the
long<00:03:13.540> way<00:03:13.569> back<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.709> was<00:03:14.889> like<00:03:15.099> no<00:03:15.579> I

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
long way back and I was like no I

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.089 
long way back and I was like no I
thought<00:03:16.389> this<00:03:16.599> movie<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:16.959> almost<00:03:17.260> over<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:18.040> it

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
thought this movie is almost over and it

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.550 
thought this movie is almost over and it
just<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.430> lost<00:03:18.790> me<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.689> I<00:03:19.900> couldn't<00:03:20.319> take

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
just it lost me it just I couldn't take

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.479 
just it lost me it just I couldn't take
it<00:03:20.590> anymore

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
it anymore

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.670 
it anymore
not<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.120> say<00:03:22.299> there<00:03:22.689> weren't<00:03:22.930> good<00:03:23.139> moments<00:03:23.590> in

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
not to say there weren't good moments in

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.990 
not to say there weren't good moments in
the<00:03:23.799> film<00:03:23.950> it's<00:03:24.189> just<00:03:24.310> as<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.519> said<00:03:24.579> it<00:03:24.730> was<00:03:24.819> just

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
the film it's just as I said it was just

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.140 
the film it's just as I said it was just
too<00:03:25.239> slow<00:03:25.569> it<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:26.290> wasn't<00:03:26.769> enough<00:03:26.859> story<00:03:27.400> and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
too slow it just wasn't enough story and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.970 
too slow it just wasn't enough story and
when<00:03:28.299> there<00:03:28.419> was<00:03:28.450> story<00:03:29.049> even<00:03:29.799> though<00:03:29.889> it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
when there was story even though it

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.500 
when there was story even though it
would<00:03:30.069> stayed<00:03:30.340> true<00:03:30.609> to<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.730> genres<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.419> was

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
would stayed true to the genres it was

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.729 
would stayed true to the genres it was
just<00:03:31.689> a<00:03:31.780> little<00:03:31.900> too<00:03:32.109> derivative<00:03:32.620> there

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
just a little too derivative there

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.039 
just a little too derivative there
weren't<00:03:32.889> a<00:03:32.950> lot<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.159> original<00:03:33.430> ideas<00:03:34.019> but<00:03:35.019> I

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
weren't a lot of original ideas but I

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.080 
weren't a lot of original ideas but I
will<00:03:35.319> say<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.680> for<00:03:35.709> 40<00:03:36.159> million<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.760> movie

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
will say that for 40 million this movie

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.250 
will say that for 40 million this movie
looks<00:03:37.239> good

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
looks good

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.020 
looks good
very<00:03:38.709> well<00:03:38.889> utilized<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.609> terms<00:03:39.819> of<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
very well utilized in terms of the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
new viewers so

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.279 
new viewers so
was<00:05:02.639> just<00:05:02.849> like<00:05:03.030> who's<00:05:03.419> that<00:05:03.660> guy<00:05:03.870> what<00:05:04.110> did<00:05:04.229> he

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.240 
highlight of the character and it was a
good<00:05:44.970> idea<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.479> it's<00:05:45.720> still<00:05:45.990> done<00:05:46.650> well<00:05:46.919> so
