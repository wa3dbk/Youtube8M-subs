00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
red mode that has two so if I just cycle

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.939 
red mode that has two so if I just cycle
through<00:00:35.929> it<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:42.079> to<00:00:42.229> put<00:00:42.409> it<00:00:42.499> onto<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.769> red

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
through it and to put it onto the red

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.579 
through it and to put it onto the red
mode<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:43.609> just<00:00:43.819> hold<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.210> button<00:00:44.510> down<00:00:44.589> and

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
mode you just hold the button down and

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.189 
mode you just hold the button down and
it<00:00:45.710> flicks<00:00:45.979> across<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.460> red<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:46.969> now<00:00:47.510> if<00:00:48.109> I

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
it flicks across to red and now if I

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.020 
it flicks across to red and now if I
wanted<00:00:48.589> to<00:00:48.710> switch<00:00:48.949> on<00:00:49.159> to<00:00:49.339> the<00:00:49.370> struck<00:00:49.789> red

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
wanted to switch on to the struck red

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.329 
wanted to switch on to the struck red
strobe<00:00:50.389> I<00:00:50.690> would<00:00:51.049> just<00:00:51.199> switch<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.769> unit<00:00:51.799> off

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
strobe I would just switch the unit off

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.459 
strobe I would just switch the unit off
again<00:00:52.670> switch<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.359> back<00:00:53.449> on<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.019> click

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
again switch it back on and click

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.520 
again switch it back on and click
through<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.979> red<00:00:55.459> strobe<00:00:56.049> one<00:00:57.049> of<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.229> extra

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
features with this torch is a wide-angle

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.569 
features with this torch is a wide-angle
diffuser<00:01:00.139> that<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:00.739> can<00:01:00.889> flick<00:01:01.190> up<00:01:01.339> at<00:01:01.489> the

front<00:01:01.819> to<00:01:02.629> spread<00:01:02.929> the<00:01:03.049> beam<00:01:03.400> so<00:01:04.400> if<00:01:04.489> I<00:01:04.580> flick

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
front to spread the beam so if I flick

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.600

it<00:01:10.640> particularly<00:01:10.970> well<00:01:11.240> here<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:11.990> there<00:01:12.260> it's

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
it particularly well here but there it's

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.420 
it particularly well here but there it's
in<00:01:12.830> wide-angle<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.850> there<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:14.960> can<00:01:15.170> see<00:01:15.430> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
in wide-angle and there you can see the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.880
