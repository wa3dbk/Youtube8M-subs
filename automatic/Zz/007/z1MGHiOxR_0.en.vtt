00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.950
 Servus friends and welcome to 1 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.750
 well unboxing or test of the headset 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.590
 you have to introduce yourself 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.960
 Well, here is this picture of that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.180
 headset and here is the half of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.949
 which means 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.029
 so put this in here 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.430
 From the outside one sees only the part of the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.320
 rest is hidden in this red link 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.689
 has already unpacked because the whole 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.050
 it gets a bit complicated with one 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:40.190
 hand as you see otto b eleven for 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.899
 the ps3 system and pc 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 and well, we do not see anything from the outside 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.969
 a lot of 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.949
 In any case, the packaging looks very 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:55.730
 nice out in an infinite number of languages 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.199
 so much for packaging from above 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.149
 Also here is the one headphone 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.190
 plugged in and the rest goes up here 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.420
 it is pure that we are in this good box 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.240
 then have to get out there 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.229
 there are the whole cable and back 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.040
 Of course I have everything now 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.170
 rausgeholt 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.720
 Now only the reporter is okay 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.080
 So then I'll show you something 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.590
 it was an idiot I beat must go 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.509
 Cool coal background looks cool here 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:31.079
 former the guys manual and 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.000
 that's what we do not need 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.530
 had to come here just like you around the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.619
 Here you can see this headset 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.329
 bend as you want to be here in front 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.860
 you can not turn the headset either 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.159
 I wonder what you want to do with it 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.520
 make can first believe me 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.520
 design 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.140
 looks nice 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.580
 The parts are also very soft here 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.770
 feels very good 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.590
 roman of course, titles are like that 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.240
 I sound like that and how 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.630
 So it works now 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.960
 have a plug that leads to this 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.420
 the module because I had here once game 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.040
 volume chat volume helps 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.040
 and you can down here 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.440
 minutes or the headset again 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.790
 So do the whole thing for this 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.980
 cable that ends in the two plugs 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.600
 once usb for the energy that means it 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.100
 have no batteries and here one 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.020
 normal jack that is 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.670
 if you 're on the pc, you close that 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.930
 here a pc and this just in the nbs 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:43.150
 from the pc neck of these latches input 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.000
 but if ps3 now wants to gamble 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.220
 her here so usb yes know how everything 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.270
 works down here in the ps3 and 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.470
 that here must be in the tv 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.510
 most people know that a tv 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.120
 left and right audio has been for it 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.769
 also a cable and managed 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.060
 Although this is also here with it 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.420
 that's just what you close so often 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.420
 war 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.680
 so you close that easily here 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.590
 on 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.010
 then this leads to the left and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.660
 right 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.989
 if I know what we do with it 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:25.290
 should be tv and back then you have 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.510
 down here the two left and right 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.000
 audio stick simply plugs an old 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.610
 and then you have the sound of yours 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.670
 tv and chat on the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.390
 headset so that's now actually 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.010
 already from boxing and tutorials we do that 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.680
 whole and I want you 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.480
 now introduce small voice chat with it 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.239
 you are like that, too 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.510
 with the other people sounds like that then 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:56.600
 is the same as if I still want to say that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.930
 whole is 5.1 I mean 5.1 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.790
 7.1 does not support that too 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.370
 is that stupid in any case , we have 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.500
 bass-voice quite sure 5 and 1 or what 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.860
 I definitely know the whole thing 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.940
 with bass, the audio is amplified 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.930
 power supply via usb so stands 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.610
 everything in the back 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.900
 I can do that, I hope you 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.270
 can then somehow make a break and 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.209
 the whole read does not seem like 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.550
 you could read that no matter it is up 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.170
 Every case is good then until the same 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.170
 for a small test 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.140
 so hey friends so that's the one now 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.150
 Sound recorded by the p11 of the 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.830
 headset stop and then I want the time 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.500
 want to use two things say so 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.720
 you can not do it for cellphone ipod no 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.670
 You can not use the idea if you can 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.770
 needs a usb input and a 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.020
 jack input so that the whole 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.860
 then also by usb energy gets 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.870
 and what about you? 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.180
 please what you wanted to say is her 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.350
 have you seen the audio plugs 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.210
 for the tv 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.950
 at the left and right plugs of 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.330
 television you have then yes the 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.560
 Plug your TV into the TV 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.150
 stuck behind it you can do something 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.430
 that is, if you are somehow connected 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.980
 you have a recording device with a headset 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.230
 play and then back to this headset 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.810
 plug there were again so immediately 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.280
 gang equal audio plug there you can 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.090
 then also easier recording device 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.730
 cramming 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.200

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.419
 with you I hope I could you 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.310

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.590
 currently at amazon i can buy you 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.390
 take in the description and yes 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.980
 then maybe you'll pick it up and you 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.550
