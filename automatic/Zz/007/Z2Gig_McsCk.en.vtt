00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
Hi, I show you how to prepare this beautiful and soft roll cake

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.049
It is decorated with beautiful red hearts and it is super soft .

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.749
Inside it is a little known ganache little known, but delicious

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.129
and simple to bake, made with apple and chocolate .

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.569
Besides being tasty, this cake has two advantages

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.789
it is light and quick prepared .

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:23.049
Here is the recipe for 4 persons:

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:25.629
You need for the cake

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.816
60 g flour

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.961
1 teaspoon baking powder

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:32.209
60 g sugar

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.167
2 eggs

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:35.959
1 pinch of salt

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.749
1 tbsp Aroma : I chose orange flower water

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.049
red food coloring

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.289
a kitchen aid or an electric whisk

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:47.289
2 piping bags or freezer bags

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.749
1 baking tray

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.649
You need for the ganache

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:56.889
50 g chocolate

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:58.056
2 small apples

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.309
30 g sugar

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.057
15 g butter

00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:03.017
1 mixer

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:04.669
First I prepare the ganache.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.589
While the apples cook slowly,

00:01:06.809 --> 00:01:08.229
we have time to make the cake.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:10.338
I peel the apples and I cut into cubes

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.549
Well, my daughter does it ;-)

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.789
I add the butter and the sugar

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.729
And I let simmer

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.149
I preheat the oven to 180 Â°

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.209
And I do the cake now

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:31.849
I prepared all the ingredients in containers because

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.129
I prepare the cake in the robot very quickly

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.509
The advantage of this method is that

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.429
I eliminate the painful stage where we need

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.689
to mix slowly the egg whites to the rest of the dough. .

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:44.489
I pour the whites and salt in the bowl of the robot.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.729
I whisk the egg whites at maximum power until they form peakss

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.189
I add the sugar

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.189
I reduce the speed

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.689
I pour the yolks and the orange flower water

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.069
Then I add the flour and yeast, already mixed together.

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.969
I let run 5 seconds

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.909
And that's it!

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.509
I take one fourth of the dough.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.137
I add the red food color.

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:14.129
We will use this dough for the hearts

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.049
I pour the white and red doughs in piping bags

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:21.869
I pour the bags into big glasses

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.884
they are stable

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.949
To form hearts

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.389
I slip a template under the baking sheet

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.609
This way I divide equally the hearts on my cake

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.249
You can freehand

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.349
I draw hearts with the red piping bag

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.549
first contour and then inside

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.149
I quickly surrounds them with the white paste

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.389
to fix the shape

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.469
I pour the rest of the white dough on the tray.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.349
I let cook in the oven for 8 minutes

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.889
I prepare a damp cloth

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.749
I put my cake on it once cooked

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.489
The cake does not look good

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.791
But  it is not a failure ;-)

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.169
The beautiful hearts are below.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.509
I roll the cake with the cloth.

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.149
I let rest a few moments

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.424
I roll out the cake

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:27.949
I roll again and gently remove the baking sheet.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.449
That is how the cake will look like once the cake filled and rolled.

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:34.089
I let it lie flat

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.829
Let's return to the ganache.

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.089
I remove the apples from the heat

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.069
I add the chocolate

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.388
I let it melt

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.829
I mix until well blended

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.376
I let cool

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.009
I pour the ganache on the cake

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:56.729
I roll again

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.849
Cover with cling film and refrigerate it for a few hours

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.109
before serving

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.929
Cut the edges
