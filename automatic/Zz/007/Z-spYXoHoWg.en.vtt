gonna<00:00:19.950> show<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.279> make<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.489> simple<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.029> for

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
gonna show how to make a simple one for

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.810 
gonna show how to make a simple one for
around<00:00:22.320> about<00:00:22.470> $60<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.399> can<00:00:23.520> make<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.759> a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
around about $60 so you can make it a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.639 
around about $60 so you can make it a
lot<00:00:24.000> cheaper<00:00:24.029> than<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.630> that's<00:00:25.230> just<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.619> I

download<00:03:30.480> as<00:03:30.810> well<00:03:30.990> basically<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.830> downloaded

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
download as well basically I downloaded

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.560 
download as well basically I downloaded
a<00:03:32.520> whole<00:03:32.670> bunch<00:03:32.910> pretty<00:03:33.240> much<00:03:33.390> nearly

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
a whole bunch pretty much nearly

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.650 
a whole bunch pretty much nearly
everything<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.110> his<00:03:34.260> site<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:35.090> I've<00:03:36.090> made<00:03:36.540> up

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
everything on his site and I've made up

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.960 
everything on his site and I've made up
a<00:03:36.780> few<00:03:36.960> of<00:03:37.020> my<00:03:37.080> own<00:03:37.170> sequences<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.460> that<00:03:38.820> work

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
a few of my own sequences to that work

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.730 
a few of my own sequences to that work
effective<00:03:39.510> any<00:03:39.660> areas<00:03:40.050> where<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.260> tend<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> get

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
effective any areas where I tend to get

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.760 
effective any areas where I tend to get
hunting<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.960> yeah<00:03:42.960> and<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.350> switch<00:03:43.560> between

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
hunting and yeah and just switch between

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.820 
hunting and yeah and just switch between
and<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.700> see<00:03:45.270> how<00:03:45.360> they<00:03:45.510> work<00:03:45.720> anyway<00:03:46.680> I'll

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
and and see how they work anyway I'll

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.280 
and and see how they work anyway I'll
give<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.100> little<00:03:47.250> bit<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.490> a<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:48.180> test<00:03:49.080> on

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
give you a little bit of a a test on

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.170 
give you a little bit of a a test on
basically<00:03:50.190> how<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.430> sounds<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.850> how<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.000> works

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
basically how it sounds and how it works

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.230 
basically how it sounds and how it works
I<00:03:51.540> mostly<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.560> flick<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:52.920> on<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.400> then<00:03:54.090> this

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
I mostly just flick it on and then this

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.640 
I mostly just flick it on and then this
year<00:03:54.450> we'll<00:03:54.630> just<00:03:54.810> go<00:03:54.930> back<00:03:55.110> straight<00:03:55.440> into

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
year we'll just go back straight into

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:06.350 
year we'll just go back straight into
the<00:03:55.740> box<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.520> um

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.900 

okay<00:04:07.360> so<00:04:07.569> that's<00:04:07.840> pretty<00:04:08.020> much<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.910> yeah

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
okay so that's pretty much it and yeah

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.400 
okay so that's pretty much it and yeah
just<00:04:10.120> put<00:04:10.300> some<00:04:10.420> velcro<00:04:10.569> on<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.959> bottom<00:04:11.230> and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
just put some velcro on the bottom and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.380 
just put some velcro on the bottom and
then<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.800> this<00:04:12.069> sticks<00:04:12.670> back<00:04:12.910> inside<00:04:13.209> the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
then this this sticks back inside the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.930 
then this this sticks back inside the
box<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:13.870> lock<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.470> lid<00:04:14.620> throw<00:04:15.040> a<00:04:15.099> few<00:04:15.310> leaves

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
box I lock the lid throw a few leaves

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.640 
box I lock the lid throw a few leaves
and<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:16.570> know<00:04:16.690> bit<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.930> grass<00:04:17.079> all<00:04:17.290> over<00:04:17.560> the

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
and you know bit of grass all over the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.500 
and you know bit of grass all over the
top<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.579> would<00:04:18.700> never<00:04:18.820> even<00:04:19.030> know<00:04:19.180> see

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
top and you would never even know see

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.790 
top and you would never even know see
but<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:21.459> simple<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.120> make<00:04:22.290> all<00:04:23.290> you<00:04:23.410> need<00:04:23.620> to

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
but so simple to make all you need to

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.830 
but so simple to make all you need to
make<00:04:23.980> this<00:04:24.160> is<00:04:24.490> drill<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.419> drill<00:04:25.450> through

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
make this is drill the drill through

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.550 
make this is drill the drill through
your<00:04:25.960> box<00:04:26.139> a<00:04:26.820> soldering<00:04:27.820> iron<00:04:28.350> because<00:04:29.350> this

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
your box a soldering iron because this

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.500 
your box a soldering iron because this
audio<00:04:30.070> amplifier<00:04:30.520> does<00:04:30.760> come<00:04:31.090> with<00:04:31.240> its<00:04:31.389> own

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
audio amplifier does come with its own

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.170 
audio amplifier does come with its own
speakers<00:04:31.990> at<00:04:32.110> either<00:04:32.230> end<00:04:32.530> although<00:04:33.280> you<00:04:34.060> know

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
speakers at either end although you know

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.140 
speakers at either end although you know
they're<00:04:35.169> not<00:04:35.440> quite<00:04:35.680> sufficient<00:04:35.980> as<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.730> what

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
they're not quite sufficient as to what

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.440 
they're not quite sufficient as to what
I<00:04:37.180> wanted<00:04:37.510> to<00:04:37.720> want<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.050> get<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.260> job<00:04:38.440> done<00:04:38.470> so

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
I wanted to want to get the job done so

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.060 
I wanted to want to get the job done so
use<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.570> bullhorn<00:04:40.780> speaker<00:04:41.380> so<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:41.800> just<00:04:41.979> a

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
use the bullhorn speaker so I just a

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.280 
use the bullhorn speaker so I just a
matter<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.310> soldering<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.300> cable<00:04:43.660> this

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
matter of soldering and cable this

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.100 
matter of soldering and cable this
actually<00:04:44.800> if<00:04:45.100> I<00:04:45.250> want<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.550> take<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.150> out<00:04:46.389> it's

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
actually if I want to take this out it's

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.629 
actually if I want to take this out it's
just<00:04:47.350> a<00:04:47.560> matter<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.830> popping<00:04:48.010> this<00:04:48.280> speaker

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
just a matter of popping this speaker

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.100 
just a matter of popping this speaker
out<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:48.910> it's<00:04:49.000> actually<00:04:49.419> a<00:04:49.450> little<00:04:49.780> plug<00:04:49.960> on

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
out and it's actually a little plug on

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.510 
out and it's actually a little plug on
the<00:04:50.200> inside<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:50.740> can<00:04:50.860> pull<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.100> plug<00:04:51.220> up

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
the inside that I can pull the plug up

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.860 
the inside that I can pull the plug up
and<00:04:51.729> actually<00:04:51.850> take<00:04:52.150> this<00:04:52.270> whole<00:04:52.419> unit<00:04:52.780> out

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
and actually take this whole unit out

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.260 
and actually take this whole unit out
away<00:04:53.139> from<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.380> box<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.040> set<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:54.910> up<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.120> I

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
away from the box so I set that up so I

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.090 
away from the box so I set that up so I
could<00:04:55.479> do<00:04:55.600> that<00:04:55.750> if<00:04:55.930> M<00:04:56.080> rated<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.530> do<00:04:56.950> any

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
could do that if M rated to do any

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.590 
could do that if M rated to do any
running<00:04:57.280> repairs<00:04:57.760> or<00:04:57.940> if<00:04:58.060> I<00:04:58.150> just<00:04:58.180> want<00:04:58.510> to
