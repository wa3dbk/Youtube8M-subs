can scout their plays you can scout
everything<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:36.939> want<00:01:37.090> but<00:01:37.179> it's<00:01:37.419> who<00:01:37.689> can<00:01:37.810> put

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
everything you want but it's who can put

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.300 
everything you want but it's who can put
the<00:01:37.959> ball<00:01:38.020> in<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.289> hoop<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.679> think<00:01:39.069> we<00:01:39.159> just

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
the ball in the hoop I think we just

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.969 
the ball in the hoop I think we just
need<00:01:39.459> to<00:01:39.579> do<00:01:39.669> a<00:01:39.700> really<00:01:39.969> good<00:01:40.599> job<00:01:40.929> of<00:01:41.139> guarding

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
need to do a really good job of guarding

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.830 
need to do a really good job of guarding
the<00:01:42.189> three-point<00:01:42.310> line<00:01:42.579> and<00:01:43.029> boxing<00:01:43.659> y'all

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
the three-point line and boxing y'all

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.330 
the three-point line and boxing y'all
definitely<00:01:44.380> I<00:01:44.439> think<00:01:44.469> they<00:01:44.799> got<00:01:44.919> a<00:01:44.979> lot<00:01:45.310> of

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
definitely I think they got a lot of

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.879 
definitely I think they got a lot of
second-chance<00:01:45.849> shots<00:01:46.239> on<00:01:46.389> us<00:01:46.599> in<00:01:46.779> you<00:01:47.169> know<00:01:47.289> we

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
second-chance shots on us in you know we

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:49.139 
second-chance shots on us in you know we
can't<00:01:48.099> afford<00:01:48.189> to<00:01:48.399> have<00:01:48.489> those<00:01:48.729> in<00:01:48.909> the<00:01:48.999> big

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
can't afford to have those in the big

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.089 
can't afford to have those in the big
game<00:01:49.299> obviously<00:01:49.719> like<00:01:49.899> this<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.619> beat<00:01:50.829> UConn

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
game obviously like this to beat UConn

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.069 
game obviously like this to beat UConn
for<00:01:51.279> four<00:01:51.399> times<00:01:51.639> knees<00:01:51.880> in<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.389> season<00:01:52.599> people

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
for four times knees in a season people

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.839 
for four times knees in a season people
are<00:01:53.169> saying<00:01:53.319> we<00:01:53.409> can't<00:01:53.590> do<00:01:53.739> it<00:01:53.859> so<00:01:54.069> here's<00:01:54.759> a

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
are saying we can't do it so here's a

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:56.550 
are saying we can't do it so here's a
challenge<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.509> difference<00:01:55.869> in<00:01:55.989> us<00:01:56.139> now<00:01:56.169> is

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
challenge the difference in us now is

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.409 
challenge the difference in us now is
that<00:01:56.799> we're<00:01:56.979> all<00:01:57.159> just<00:01:57.189> just<00:01:57.849> being<00:01:58.090> really

that we're all just just being really

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:00.599 
that we're all just just being really
aggressive<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.649> confident<00:02:00.219> and<00:02:00.340> when<00:02:00.489> you

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609
