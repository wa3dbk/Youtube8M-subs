00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello everybody, welcome to another video from 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.410
 Channel geo tv I'm Marcelo 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.930
 in this video here I will give an alternative 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.590
 for you who need to block some 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.820
 sites for some users 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.760
 transparent without them noticing is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.289
 I do not know if you already know more about windows 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.309
 server 2012 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.980
 we no longer have the option to configure 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.980
 site constraint travel worse than 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.840
 people had in 2008 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:49.320
 before we set up through 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:52.350
 that path here and now has eye on 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 some forums some fish websites do not have 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.440
 plus this option of maintaining the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:04.170
 internet explorer is to open the group here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.970
 can be medium and configuration the polis 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 slowriders settings 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.229
 I do not have the maintenance part here 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.680
 from internet explorer 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.530
 already microsoft took here 2012 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.360
 then as plan b 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.750
 Okay, I'll show you one here. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.390
 very good alternative I've already used 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:29.400
 and I believe it will be very useful for 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.180
 You, I'm going to close here and close this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.180
 dude here too 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.689
 Now come on, giving continuity is so 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.119
 What I'm going to do, I'm going to set this up. 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.509
 block on the hosts side of the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.200
 The user's machine itself is then 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.939
 Of course you have that is the user can not 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.189
 have permission to edit that file 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.049
 hosts is otherwise he can do the 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.270
 change 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.079
 So what do we do here? I'll go. 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.450
 access the hosts file from my machine 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:11.920
 client in which the client 0101 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:20.090
 I really go here in a couple of days. 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:21.970
 system32 drivers hosts file from 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.160
 machine here 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.370
 011 open here with notepad add 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.370
 on here 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:42.510
 this line put here google 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:46.260
 reported that here the site of gold 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.090
 these two sites here we test 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.350
 before giving a save here we go there 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.340
 client machine 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.200
 I played here with to the user mary 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.610
 I'm going to open the internet explorer here. 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.900
 to show that I'm opening here 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:09.210
 normal 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:13.450
 google's website and the website of a certain 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.950
 Let's go back there on the controller. 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.290
 domain 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.370
 I'll save the file I have permission 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.340
 all cattle with 11 with the account 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.330
 administrator then has a total 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.990
 autonomy and management of the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:36.450
 user is also 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:39.970
 Note that I put what to the site 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.210
 www.uol.com.br he will use an address 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.610
 local rost 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.770
 then he will find nothing and 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.540
 automatically it will not be able to 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.140
 access to this site 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.710
 I'm going to close here and we 'll go back there 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.200
 client machine 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.540
 Okay, and it takes a little bit sometimes to 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.959
 to replicate 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.959
 Let's test here. 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.100
 Good, I think he's carrying cash. 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.130
 has already been applied to that 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.260
 that block by the hosts file then 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.400
 What I'm going to do, I'm going to close the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.520
 and I'm going to open it again, just one 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.890
 detail did not you see that if I open 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.410
 here on the globe that is a site that is not 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.330
 blocked 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.840
 look april internet singles as one 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.710
 common design that we use today in the 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.600
 windows 7 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.840
 if you open it by the subway here 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.520
 by the icon it will open a way 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.780
 different the address bar here 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.570
 down 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.660
 then you choose the way 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.540
 Do you want to use the close here? 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.740
 stay safe drag down here 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.350
 I closed back here now and I'll do the 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.490
 test or visit the uol and 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.490
 google in sequence 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.110
 the page paa can not be displayed is a 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:28.270
 good signal is already already blocked 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:34.630
 google site was not 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.630
 and here I try to be ok 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.219
 I successfully accessed 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.409
 7 from microsoft I do not block too 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.780
 I accepted it successfully. 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.330
 Okay, so this tip is for you. 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.860
 does not have a firewall on your network 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:59.770
 for you that is an alternative to 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.990
 block and restrict websites to 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.030
 users of your network then this is the tip 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.110
 that I have to spend what they expect 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.009
 that it is useful to you 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.080
 we finished here another video of the 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.969
 windows server 2012 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.000
