 I come from Rome Riccardo Caraceni from Lucca 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.859
 is the most important Italian competition 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.080
 certainly national I think every 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.750
 violinist wants to participate in this 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.990
 competition and is also a great thrill 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.120
 pushed me the prestige of the name of the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.350
 competition and curiosity to participate e 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.000
 to bring a program in short 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.290
 as interesting as the one requested by the 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.699
 competition only a national competition 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.580
 important so i'm happy to be 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.559
 get involved 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.879
 we make a very important competition on 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.010
 my first major competition to do 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.559
 really a contest is an experience 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.119
 positive beautiful formative does anyway 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.830
 so grow very important 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.960
 competition in general I think they go 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 facts we have the opportunity to play 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.260
 in front of a jury of different values 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.820
 different tracks always a new challenge 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.650
 at some point of their own 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.250
 Preparation 1 ends the studies 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.130
 conservatory and the varese within reach a 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.960
 this contest and I hope to be at 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.330
 scope therefore this is one of the most 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.190
 important aprini I have ever attended for 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.990
 which certainly a little curiosity too 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.120
 to see how to level as like 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.250
 experiences like this react a 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.010
 get involved and have the opportunity 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.470
 to play in front of a jury 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.230
 important is however I believe it is a 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.280
 launch pad for 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.180
 for us young people but also a way to 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.610
 confront each other we are if it is 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.020
 well if you can study well for 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.790
 the environment in the piano convent 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.090
 workers are great pianists that is 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.880
 always a pleasure to play with them 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.430
 there seems to be a good level and that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:10.650
 it is stimulating proof after test 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.770
 participate because the other violinists 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.590
 they are good guys and then they are created 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.620
 also a nice environment between us 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.390
 in short, we know each other and go to dinner 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.670
 together, in short, even fun 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.840
 and the atmosphere is very quiet too 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.540
 compared to other competitions he has 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.970
 participated very serene much everyone 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.730
 sounds a little like that according to what he knows 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:39.780
 to do is in the case of free much happiness 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:46.130
 Then you have to knead they gave Sversa 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.130
 it was really already concrete opposite
