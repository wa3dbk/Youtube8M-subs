00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
should be you should get some useful

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.389 
should be you should get some useful
information<00:00:37.770> from<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.460> video

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.930 

so<00:00:42.149> let's<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:42.449> this<00:00:42.600> started<00:00:43.610> at<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> very

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so let's get this started at the very

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
so let's get this started at the very
beginning<00:00:45.120> whenever<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.719> start<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
beginning whenever I start and the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.610 
beginning whenever I start and the
racing<00:00:47.640> game<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.090> need<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> go<00:00:49.320> through<00:00:49.590> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
racing game I need to go through a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
racing game I need to go through a
certain<00:00:49.980> procedure<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:50.699> I'm<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.329> too<00:00:51.510> sure

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
certain procedure now I'm not too sure

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.329 
certain procedure now I'm not too sure
if<00:00:52.199> that's<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.589> problem<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.250> wheel<00:00:54.170> or

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
if that's the problem with my wheel or

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.250 
if that's the problem with my wheel or
within<00:00:56.339> my<00:00:56.640> computer<00:00:57.180> some<00:00:57.659> something<00:00:58.140> wrong

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
within my computer some something wrong

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.439 
within my computer some something wrong
the<00:00:58.409> driver<00:00:58.649> or<00:00:59.430> maybe<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.300> just

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the driver or maybe this really is just

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.460 
the driver or maybe this really is just
the<00:01:01.019> way<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.989> but<00:01:03.989> whenever<00:01:04.259> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the way it is and but whenever I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.130 
the way it is and but whenever I
calibrated<00:01:05.210> there's<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.990> see

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
calibrated there's a as you can see

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.410 
calibrated there's a as you can see
there<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> spring<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.820> spring<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.149> on

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
there is a spring on it the spring is on

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.419 
there is a spring on it the spring is on
as<00:01:09.659> default<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:11.149> don't<00:01:12.149> know<00:01:12.240> why<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.039> to<00:01:14.039> just

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
as default I don't know why so to just

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.029 
as default I don't know why so to just
disable<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.179> spring<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.770> spring

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
disable this spring and this spring

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.419 
disable this spring and this spring
actually<00:01:17.690> whenever<00:01:18.690> I<00:01:18.869> put<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> game<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.770> most

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
actually whenever I put the game on most

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:22.910 
actually whenever I put the game on most
of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> time<00:01:20.789> it<00:01:21.149> stays<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:22.259> interferes

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
of the time it stays on then interferes

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.240 
of the time it stays on then interferes
with<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> 4-speed<00:01:23.729> work<00:01:23.910> from<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> game<00:01:25.250> cell

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
with the 4-speed work from the game cell

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.850 
with the 4-speed work from the game cell
to<00:01:26.460> turn<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.880> off<00:01:27.440> just<00:01:28.440> go<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.649> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
to turn this off just go to the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.719 
to turn this off just go to the
properties<00:01:29.429> of<00:01:29.899> game<00:01:30.899> controllers<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.490> once

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100 
to have an extra effect just crank it up

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.230 
to have an extra effect just crank it up
a<00:07:26.280> bit<00:07:26.430> higher<00:07:27.169> it<00:07:28.169> doesn't<00:07:29.130> really<00:07:29.310> make<00:07:30.180> a

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.430 
okay so I think we got everything
