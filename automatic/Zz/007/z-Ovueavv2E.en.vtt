00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello my friends welcome another video 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.180
 to be with you is or is not 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.280
 Do you know, yes, my friends, then what? 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.559
 Today I'll talk a little about how it is that 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 you can have internet access from a 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.599
 very simple and free 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.789
 That's because a lot of people ask me. 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.770
 lots of information about how much this really 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.170
 actively bpn first leaves me 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.890
 explain what is vpl say bpn 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.949
 it's easy a change in the protocols 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 that we are used to seeing is in great 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.090
 part of the links and easy one to say 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.350
 hide some of the information that is 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.480
 important for people 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.320
 They see us some data that we me 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.500
 safety 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.140
 the connection to the bpn is much safer 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.780
 or more or less a thing bpn is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.820
 of 60 always on another platform 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.520
 public internet with a little bit of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.920
 example internet help them damage or 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.789
 Be the baby it's easy to call 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.640
 always uses infrastructure to 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.830
 reach the site is either a page or 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.290
 any information or even many 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.049
 of large companies sometimes 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.790
 do these bindings by bpn because they do not 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.340
 want the information they 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.799
 between companies or between 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.840
 offices or even employees 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.520
 be placed in a simple way as 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.340
 we do when we send an email 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.740
 when we make any other connection 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.020
 person through the internet or giving 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.799
 we make the goal for eight more 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.710
 use is so to say the public is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.170
 internet but baby is not easy 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.640
 say one all regrets the call in the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.310
 moment that it 's kind of like it was a tunnel 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.649
 within another year passes infrastructure 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.380
 all information and ians bpn creates a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.630
 tunnel let's say 11 muraki is yours 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.119
 information only goes personal and this does 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.810
 that everything else is not lush 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.560
 so many streets deserted to vpr 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.439
 so use bpn, let's say when this 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.450
 operator information and why not 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.850
 It's going to take data, this is not a lie. 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.520
 because if you are ratio definitions of 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.670
 equipment and hung say the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.520
 the same phase 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.550
 a paid for example the links of parents 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.010
 is that underneath you have no information 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.690
 or information transition so 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.940
 you can see that it is not that simple 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.670
 but nevertheless achieves in a way 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.470
 very easy to access the internet from 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.910
 one way or another to show how 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.040
 You can do that and we will do as 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.050
 application, but all the same, the ninth 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.360
 but if I do not have internet how is that 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.170
 I will have access and if at first with 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.000
 see them fetch the application before 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.860
 they were if you're not going to have 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.140
 internet will not need to have internet 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.000
 because that does not have internet 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.620
 Of course you will not be able to apply 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.250
 first but download the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.019
 application you can see in the video I'm 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.319
 show you very carefully and it's very simple 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.660
 she is nothing official is free for 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.299
 this can be searched for is just the wi-fi net 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.340
 will stay the application will finep and then 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.030
 which even allows this application 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.830
 get the information 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.590
 both in offline mode because so 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.870
 Imagine you'll go and propose to Porto. 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 and I know eu and I will not have internet or 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.010
 do not run out of data or anything 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.010
 and only wants to authorize wifi and this 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.030
 application for me offline take it all away 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.910
 of data in terms of pairs to one of the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.829
 internet points and then you can have 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.739
 access to the site that this easy question 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.739
 summarizing this application says points and 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.320
 passwords have been defined by the 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.540
 gifts but so difficult public with your 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.090
 way you can not see the internet 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.250
 the neighbor but can see is clear 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.799
 Can you see if I'm not if someone already 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.140
 has been pastor of the internet in this 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.870
 application so it's very simple I 'm 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.180
 here I remember points main points 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.730
 you can never get the internet from 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.989
 quotation marks the food can not access 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.109
 the wifi passwords from their neighbors or 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.060
 your friends or even your enemies 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.319
 in a simple way and if this is 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.989
 possible but I'm sure we will 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.870
 involve a programmer and must enter 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.729
 in a very different way and even 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.380
 Even I do not know how to do it, 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.560
 I would like to fool and I will not be here. 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.500
 cheat I'm bigger and easier not 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.169
 None of this is simply a method 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.320
 simpler way of getting the internet 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.780
 your equipment in an easy and 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.790
 we have to think about Cadin and I 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.620
 I thought 'I'm going to be you were in 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.760
 local one knows that there will not be internet 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.389
 on mobile 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.800
 so I have this leaked application not 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:48.650
 want to download amb years off line 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.169
 of the maps of the Indians would give you 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.330
 and will tell you the passwords of 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.720
 clothes that are distributing the internet and 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.610
