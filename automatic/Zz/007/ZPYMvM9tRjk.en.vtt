00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.650
 happy because because in the video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.029
 earlier that we went up I asked him to tell me 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.680

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.000

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.380

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.790
 brutal the comment that I have 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.189
 than to recognize it but not really 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.750
 because lately I'm working 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.369

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.230
 the time that I have I am dedicating it to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.090

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.890

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.640
 I'm taking note is indeed one thing 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.739
 what I did good is like a letter but 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 what I did was point all the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.270
 tattoos that you have told me is worth everything 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.739
 this each line is a tattoo or a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 design that you have asked me with good 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.800
 with some notes of things that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.149
 I have to do in order and I will do what 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.320
 I'll do it, I promise I'll go 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.030
 making many thanks for 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.739

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.390
 so much in this because I am very motivated 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.500
 this week I'm going to order the machine 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.210
 this past week I could not 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.949
 ask for it and well I have dedicated myself in these 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.420
 days in these two or three days that he does 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.770
 that I uploaded the last dedicated video 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.930
 draw start doing little things that 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.510
 They really wanted to play with me in 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.890
 youtube youtube youtube from youtube 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.750
 all life that I really like how 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.060
 I write and well I will teach a little 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.590
 I've done keep in mind that it's done 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.570
 and I have studied nothing of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.980
 drawing I leave it there for good 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.450
 they are not perfect either but I think 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.130
 the first ones pass, they are not bad 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.860
 this is a girl thinks that the truth is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.540
 that I was very excited to make a 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.010
 final girl face is not very good from 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.170
 everything but that's where I started and 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.210
 well let's say that after I liked it here 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.740
 much the roll of the brightness of the skirt 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.450
 that everything is done to bolivia so that 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.130
 what I like that that all this I have 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.020
 made by boli and although it is not perfect 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.940
 I think he gets to do something better if 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.410
 I keep practicing you can do I started 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.970
 make several cartoons because good and 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.680
 I told you some that I want to dedicate 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.000
 more to the theme of japan designs the truth 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.130
 I really like the topic of 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.570
 tents the flowers queixas and things of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.190
 these the whole issue of this escaped and the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.990
 second I did after the girl 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.790
 pin-up was a folder that I liked 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.680
 How much was left is not invented by me 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.119
 it's true that I noticed another 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.619
 folder that I saw and I did some 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.940
 modification and things of these but good 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.680
 I have to go practicing little by little 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.240
 and take the roll to the cards 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.590
 caritas and these things and the eyes already 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.000
 from there I will start doing my 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.229
 own designs I always like a lot 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.149
 the dragons but he had never given me 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.710
 by drawing none in flat and then 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.360
 I have done this dragon that good is not that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.130
 is also not very well done because it 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.360
 all the scales and these things are missing 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.580
 that in the skin 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.140
 and all this but good also what 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.760
 I wanted to see how he makes faces more or 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.440
 less and these little things I wanted to do 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.750
 letters too and what he did was then 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.370
 what am I going to do next one I'm going to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.350
 do that I think it's very cool this 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.100
 simple invented me and the truth that I 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.660
 Like very much 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.280
 the roll he carries and one thing he wanted 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.290
 do because my mother takes a long time 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.270
 that make us tattoos wanted to draw 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.830
 a dragonfly or a flower and I've made a 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.540
 dragonfly backlight and I 've put him 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.040
 some twigs underneath and your roll to me 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.080
 mother today who taught it has 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.640
 delighted and wants me to make a 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.320
 modification is nothing more in the branch and 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.150
 that when he starts tattooing there 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.530
 Let's do it today, take one of 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.730
 the ideas that I had been told I wanted 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.380
 a nothing on top of a water lily 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.030
 chosen water lily in fact they are from the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.190
 giants that have the edges raised 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.630
 milestone roll and I've made a fairy more or 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.400
 less the truth that I do not fit very well 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.050
 I like the face a lot and the hair too 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.550
 the rest the truth is that I do not like 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.350
 a lot and the water lily does not have to 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.760
 practice a lot this realism 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.160
 it's still not my thing I prefer to do 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.570
 things more of this roll the truth because 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.000
 this roll I think it stays pretty 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.010
 better but look for example the face of 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.959
 fairy I really like the type of hair 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.970
 in short good is not so bad either 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.800
 let's say I have to improve 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.480
 quite in this respect are the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.980
 what I've done so far takes into account 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.110
 that is done to bolt and that I do not 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.820
 I am a cartoonist and little by little I go 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.130
 learning said this I wanted to tell you 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.780
 that today they have given me a very 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.340
 cool for a gift to my brother-in-law because 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.230
 we have made an invisible friend- and good 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.690
 he plays hole and he has had a very good idea 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.600
 and it's a book full of pictures of 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.980
 tattoos is brutal and in fact has 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.940
 discovered a new style of tattoos 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.220
 I do not know what it's called 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.940
 It was a love I love it because it is 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.290
 Like very 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.700
 we can take it to see how 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.099
 I'm going to teach one for example that has 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.230
 really liked the tattoo roll this 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.760
 from here I was delighted to see how it is 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.459
 done with the line as if it were done 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.190

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.600
 I can start to practice a little more 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.370

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.780

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.950
 you really have no idea of ​​the desire 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.810
 What I have to tattoo is 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.780
