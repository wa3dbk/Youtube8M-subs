this<00:00:10.390> is<00:00:10.540> worth<00:00:10.720> taking<00:00:11.170> a<00:00:11.230> look<00:00:11.260> at<00:00:12.570> it's

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
this is worth taking a look at it's

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.330 
this is worth taking a look at it's
going<00:00:13.750> to<00:00:13.809> be<00:00:13.870> an<00:00:13.960> incredibly<00:00:14.410> easy<00:00:14.470> change

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
going to be an incredibly easy change

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.910 
going to be an incredibly easy change
over<00:00:15.700> here<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:17.500> piece<00:00:17.770> goes<00:00:18.070> on<00:00:18.279> right<00:00:18.970> there

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
over here this piece goes on right there

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.700 
over here this piece goes on right there
the<00:00:20.920> disk<00:00:21.220> is<00:00:21.460> going<00:00:21.700> to<00:00:21.790> mount<00:00:22.029> to<00:00:22.119> that<00:00:22.710> and

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
the disk is going to mount to that and

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.900 
the disk is going to mount to that and
that's<00:00:24.010> going<00:00:24.160> to<00:00:24.250> be<00:00:24.310> pretty<00:00:24.550> much<00:00:24.640> a<00:00:24.760> piece

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
that's going to be pretty much a piece

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.530 
that's going to be pretty much a piece
of<00:00:25.090> cake

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
of cake

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.540 
of cake
not<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.260> disk<00:00:26.500> but<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.890> you<00:00:27.160> know<00:00:27.190> the<00:00:27.280> rotor

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
not the disk but the you know the rotor

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.160 
not the disk but the you know the rotor
will<00:00:27.820> not<00:00:28.000> here<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.420> disc<00:00:28.630> will<00:00:28.780> go<00:00:28.900> right<00:00:29.020> on

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
will not here the disc will go right on

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.760 
will not here the disc will go right on
there<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:30.490> going<00:00:30.610> to<00:00:30.670> be<00:00:30.730> easy<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:31.470> will<00:00:32.470> say

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
there that's going to be easy I will say

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.240 
there that's going to be easy I will say
this<00:00:33.600> kits<00:00:34.600> for<00:00:34.900> these<00:00:35.080> old<00:00:35.320> ford<00:00:35.650> axles<00:00:36.129> are

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
this kits for these old ford axles are

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.160 
this kits for these old ford axles are
cheap<00:00:36.520> as<00:00:36.879> a<00:00:37.030> bunch<00:00:37.270> of<00:00:37.420> people<00:00:37.660> making<00:00:37.960> them<00:00:38.050> I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
cheap as a bunch of people making them I

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.200 
cheap as a bunch of people making them I
guessing<00:00:38.650> they're<00:00:39.580> not<00:00:39.610> terribly<00:00:40.030> expensive

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
guessing they're not terribly expensive

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.750 
guessing they're not terribly expensive
I<00:00:40.840> put<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.680> kill<00:00:41.890> in<00:00:42.070> front<00:00:42.250> of<00:00:42.309> my<00:00:42.400> Rambler<00:00:42.729> and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
I put a kill in front of my Rambler and

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.840 
I put a kill in front of my Rambler and
that<00:00:42.909> cost<00:00:43.150> me<00:00:43.239> an<00:00:43.390> arm<00:00:43.449> and<00:00:43.690> leg<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:45.250> I<00:00:45.580> mean

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
that cost me an arm and leg so I mean

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.250 
that cost me an arm and leg so I mean
it's<00:00:46.000> really<00:00:46.089> quite<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.449> bargain<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.930> do<00:00:47.080> this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
it's really quite a bargain to do this

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.189 
it's really quite a bargain to do this
and<00:00:47.589> I<00:00:48.159> think<00:00:48.400> I<00:00:48.610> recommend<00:00:49.030> it<00:00:50.640> okay<00:00:51.640> this<00:00:51.820> is

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and I think I recommend it okay this is

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.840 
and I think I recommend it okay this is
talking<00:00:53.199> about<00:00:53.260> somebody<00:00:54.040> try<00:00:54.400> one<00:00:54.699> of<00:00:54.729> these

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
talking about somebody try one of these

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.579 
talking about somebody try one of these
kits<00:00:55.150> and<00:00:55.390> not<00:00:55.690> be<00:00:55.839> able<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.049> figure<00:00:56.229> it<00:00:56.409> out

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
kits and not be able to figure it out

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.820 
kits and not be able to figure it out
this<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.610> a<00:00:57.640> 44<00:00:58.150> front<00:00:58.479> axle<00:00:58.900> supposedly<00:00:59.589> and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
this is a 44 front axle supposedly and

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.160 
this is a 44 front axle supposedly and
obviously<00:01:00.760> those<00:01:01.030> are<00:01:01.059> 39<00:01:02.430> hubs<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:04.629> my<00:01:04.870> kit

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
obviously those are 39 hubs in my kit

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.250 
obviously those are 39 hubs in my kit
here<00:01:05.470> I've<00:01:05.650> got<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:06.450> thing<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.630> was<00:01:07.780> marked<00:01:08.170> as

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
here I've got a thing that was marked as

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.149 
here I've got a thing that was marked as
a<00:01:08.320> 48<00:01:09.280> spindle<00:01:10.060> adapter<00:01:10.690> when<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:11.650> go<00:01:11.890> to<00:01:11.950> put

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
a 48 spindle adapter when I go to put

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.050 
a 48 spindle adapter when I go to put
this<00:01:12.310> thing<00:01:12.549> together

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
this thing together

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.500 
this thing together
if<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.270> put<00:01:13.450> it<00:01:13.540> together<00:01:13.630> without<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.200> adapter

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
if I put it together without the adapter

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.120 
if I put it together without the adapter
this<00:01:16.510> bearing<00:01:17.160> doesn't<00:01:18.160> fit<00:01:18.700> well<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.950> with

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
this bearing doesn't fit well but with

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.800 
this bearing doesn't fit well but with
the<00:01:21.340> adapter<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:22.030> what<00:01:22.330> I've<00:01:22.420> done<00:01:22.570> is<00:01:22.720> I

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the adapter and what I've done is I

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.520 
the adapter and what I've done is I
measured<00:01:23.260> to<00:01:23.410> make<00:01:23.440> sure<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:25.210> fits<00:01:25.270> right<00:01:26.230> on

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
measured to make sure this fits right on

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.310 
measured to make sure this fits right on
to<00:01:26.950> that<00:01:28.980> and<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:31.270> distance<00:01:31.690> once<00:01:31.900> I<00:01:32.020> get<00:01:32.170> this

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
to that and the distance once I get this

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.260 
to that and the distance once I get this
pressed<00:01:32.590> on<00:01:32.770> here<00:01:33.040> is<00:01:33.160> about<00:01:33.520> right<00:01:33.820> for<00:01:34.060> it<00:01:34.180> to

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
pressed on here is about right for it to

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.680 
pressed on here is about right for it to
fit<00:01:34.510> middle<00:01:34.840> ways<00:01:34.990> in<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.590> caliper<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.580> the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
fit middle ways in the caliper and the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.390 
fit middle ways in the caliper and the
distance<00:01:37.690> between<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.350> here<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.860> three

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
distance between here and here is three

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.890 
distance between here and here is three
inches<00:01:39.730> from<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.030> back<00:01:40.180> of<00:01:40.360> this<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.660> three

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
inches from the back of this to three

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.080 
inches from the back of this to three
inches<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:41.290> front<00:01:41.590> of<00:01:41.680> this<00:01:41.830> which<00:01:42.130> once<00:01:42.910> I

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
inches to the front of this which once I

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.660 
inches to the front of this which once I
get<00:01:43.300> this<00:01:43.450> pressed<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:44.050> here<00:01:44.440> that's<00:01:45.310> going<00:01:45.610> to

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
get this pressed on here that's going to

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.910 
get this pressed on here that's going to
be<00:01:45.760> correct<00:01:47.160> so<00:01:48.160> my<00:01:48.640> thinking<00:01:48.910> is<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:50.470> must<00:01:50.800> be

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
be correct so my thinking is it must be

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.800 
be correct so my thinking is it must be
a<00:01:51.060> 48<00:01:52.060> spindle<00:01:52.600> now<00:01:53.590> how<00:01:53.740> they<00:01:53.890> got<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.159> 39<00:01:54.810> hub

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
a 48 spindle now how they got the 39 hub

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.840 
a 48 spindle now how they got the 39 hub
on<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.200> 48<00:01:56.500> spindle<00:01:56.980> I'm<00:01:57.100> figuring<00:01:57.520> they<00:01:57.640> just

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
on the 48 spindle I'm figuring they just

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.500 
on the 48 spindle I'm figuring they just
changed<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.270> bearings<00:01:58.690> they<00:01:58.960> probably

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.300 

it's<00:02:03.510> probably<00:02:03.990> possible<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.650> get<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> bearing

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
it's probably possible to get a bearing

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.469 
it's probably possible to get a bearing
that<00:02:05.400> works<00:02:05.640> between<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.119> two<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.420> I'm

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that works between the two and I'm

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.520 
that works between the two and I'm
thinking<00:02:06.750> that's<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.110> did

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
thinking that's what you did

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.050 
thinking that's what you did
the<00:02:07.890> reason<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.250> concerned<00:02:08.610> about<00:02:08.819> all<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the reason I'm concerned about all this

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.309 
the reason I'm concerned about all this
is<00:02:09.240> once<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.509> get<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.990> there<00:02:10.080> it's<00:02:10.200> not

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
is once I get this on there it's not

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
is once I get this on there it's not
going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.500> come<00:02:10.679> off<00:02:10.709> easily<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.819> looks<00:02:12.000> like

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
going to come off easily it looks like

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.630 
going to come off easily it looks like
it's<00:02:12.360> quite<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.380> tight<00:02:13.740> little<00:02:13.920> press<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.580> I'm

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
it's quite a tight little press and I'm

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.210 
it's quite a tight little press and I'm
going<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.819> send<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.540> bit<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:17.100> know

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
going to send this a bit and you know

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.330 
going to send this a bit and you know
kind<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.700> probably<00:02:18.209> very<00:02:18.390> gently<00:02:18.980> sort<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.100> tap

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
kind of probably very gently sort of tap

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.370 
kind of probably very gently sort of tap
that<00:02:20.580> on<00:02:20.640> there<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.840> didn't<00:02:22.050> want<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.230> do<00:02:22.350> it

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
that on there but I didn't want to do it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.870 
that on there but I didn't want to do it
unless<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.069> was<00:02:23.130> pretty<00:02:23.400> sure<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.640> was<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
unless I was pretty sure it was the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.340 
unless I was pretty sure it was the
right<00:02:24.000> way<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.239> go<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:25.050> know<00:02:25.170> once

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
right way to go because you know once

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.600 
right way to go because you know once
you<00:02:25.410> get<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.709> there<00:02:25.950> you'd<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> devil

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
you get that on there you'd have a devil

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.340 
you get that on there you'd have a devil
of<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> time<00:02:26.880> getting<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.270> back<00:02:27.390> off<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.140> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
of a time getting it back off so I

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.960 
of a time getting it back off so I
thought<00:02:28.950> I'd<00:02:29.069> show<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.520> because<00:02:29.670> somebody

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
thought I'd show that because somebody

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.520 
thought I'd show that because somebody
else<00:02:30.180> might<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.510> working<00:02:30.959> one<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.110> these<00:02:31.260> kits

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
else might be working one of these kits

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.960 
else might be working one of these kits
and<00:02:31.739> trying<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.010> figure<00:02:32.280> out<00:02:32.310> how<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.700> works

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
and trying to figure out how it works

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.880 
and trying to figure out how it works
and<00:02:33.239> maybe<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.080> all<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.620> give<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:34.860> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
and maybe if it's all that it give you a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.830 
and maybe if it's all that it give you a
little<00:02:35.100> head<00:02:35.220> start

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
little head start

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.180 
little head start
okay<00:02:36.840> I've<00:02:37.019> determined<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.739> was<00:02:37.980> right

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
okay I've determined that I was right

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.550 
okay I've determined that I was right
this<00:02:38.459> does<00:02:38.760> require<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.269> piece<00:02:39.840> being<00:02:40.350> there

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
this does require that piece being there

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.940 
this does require that piece being there
that<00:02:40.760> 48:40<00:02:41.870> way<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:42.900> figured<00:02:43.320> out<00:02:43.500> was<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.769> put

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
that 48:40 way I figured out was I put

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.530 
that 48:40 way I figured out was I put
the<00:02:44.040> wheel<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.250> without<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.730> no<00:02:45.209> way<00:02:45.360> it's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
the wheel on without it no way it's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.750 
the wheel on without it no way it's
going<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> fit<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.100> actually<00:02:47.430> going<00:02:47.610> on

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
going to fit this is actually going on

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.440 
going to fit this is actually going on
here<00:02:48.000> real<00:02:48.150> nice<00:02:48.360> once<00:02:48.690> I<00:02:48.840> got<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.140> figured<00:02:49.320> out

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
here real nice once I got it figured out

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.580 
here real nice once I got it figured out
basically<00:02:51.450> what<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.630> do<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.080> put<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.410> little

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
basically what I do is I put that little

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.580 
basically what I do is I put that little
press-on<00:02:53.100> bearing<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.120> put<00:02:54.300> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
press-on bearing on there and put the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.050 
press-on bearing on there and put the
the<00:02:55.590> tool<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.950> bearings<00:02:56.280> inside<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.910> wheel

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
the tool of bearings inside the wheel

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.180 
the tool of bearings inside the wheel
here<00:02:57.450> no<00:02:57.690> grease<00:02:57.989> or<00:02:58.200> no<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.860> know<00:02:58.950> grease

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
here no grease or no you know grease

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.160 
here no grease or no you know grease
caps<00:02:59.459> or<00:02:59.640> anything<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.209> then<00:03:00.720> I'm<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:00.989> kind

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
caps or anything and then I'm just kind

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.320 
caps or anything and then I'm just kind
of<00:03:01.230> gently<00:03:01.730> tightening<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.910> which<00:03:03.209> is

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
of gently tightening this which is

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.770 
of gently tightening this which is
pushing<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.410> on<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:04.970> don't<00:03:05.970> want<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.269> mess<00:03:06.750> up

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
pushing it on I don't want to mess up

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.670 
pushing it on I don't want to mess up
the<00:03:06.989> bear<00:03:07.260> put<00:03:07.890> too<00:03:08.040> much<00:03:08.190> pressure<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.700> that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
the bear put too much pressure on that

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.979 
the bear put too much pressure on that
but<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:11.220> kind<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.579> just<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.660> tell<00:03:12.840> it's

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989

to fit in here okay this is of interest

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.009 
to fit in here okay this is of interest
I<00:03:28.970> remember<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.299> might<00:03:30.570> have<00:03:30.720> had<00:03:30.810> some

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
I remember I might have had some

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.539 
I remember I might have had some
instructions<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.709> came<00:03:31.860> with<00:03:31.920> all<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.370> as

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
instructions that came with all this as

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.670 
instructions that came with all this as
I<00:03:32.640> lost<00:03:32.880> or<00:03:33.209> something<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.600> don't<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.590> I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
I lost or something I don't know but I

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.020 
I lost or something I don't know but I
remember<00:03:35.040> reading<00:03:35.220> somewhere<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.760> this

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
remember reading somewhere that this

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.660 
remember reading somewhere that this
might<00:03:36.299> require<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:37.170> little<00:03:37.739> touch<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:37.950> grinding

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
might require a little touch of grinding

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.560 
might require a little touch of grinding
to<00:03:38.760> make<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.090> work<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:41.090> right<00:03:42.090> here<00:03:42.450> is

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
to make it work and and right here is

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.050 
to make it work and and right here is
where<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.780> grinding<00:03:43.290> needs<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.620> happen<00:03:44.060> you

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
where the grinding needs to happen you

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.180 
where the grinding needs to happen you
see<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:45.390> big<00:03:45.630> circle<00:03:45.930> right<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
see this big circle right here and the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.920 
see this big circle right here and the
old<00:03:47.370> spindle<00:03:47.940> it's<00:03:48.120> kind<00:03:48.329> of<00:03:48.420> sticking<00:03:48.690> out

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
old spindle it's kind of sticking out
