00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.030
 watson everyone is chris hoy 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.950
 support especially for small tutorial 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.750
 served that we will talk a little bit about the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.340
 new dlc we finish a little on it 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.379
 then after waiting for the hope because 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.820
 that we are a little more info so the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.740
 two little sisters she so the first 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.390
 then the 2 c for online mode 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.070
 after I do not know at all if for the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.269
 promised so it's a big hug 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.609
 military and for the second if you 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.699
 you leave there either the big truck in 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.779
 does police property so there is 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.579
 but I do not think there is 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.469
 so find in the solo mode 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.989
 so so only for the first tip 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.010
 that's good on the big truck 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.870
 military in fact he finds himself so 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.219
 of course north of the amap by the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.540
 little specialties actually is that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.860
 you will be able to move 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.530
 people you will be able to move 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.879
 up to 8 people on each side 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.280
 that is to say 16 people I believe in 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.960
 total thanks to this truck helped him to a 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.670
 nice little interactions possible 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 that is to say that you go up in the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.230
 truck and then after so people 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.910
 can climb behind with a small 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.559
 interactions here they are going to ride everything 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.969
 that and then after they go sit down even 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.930
 to little important things with this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.729
 that they have me there it's actually it's 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.830
 that finally ben besides that there is 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.119
 the driver is that the co-pilot enters 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.770
 quotes ie it can be 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.360
 finally could I believe I know that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 does seventeen that makes eighteen people 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.020
 in a vehicle off that I'm not sure 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.580
 but in any case I think we can 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.810
 put up to 8 people each side 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.430
 in the truck it's really something 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.140
 quite important thing for example you 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.170
 know then to this flood system or and 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.790
 then this system of onlookers gang you 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 can create your own team all that 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.520
 and fight against other teams 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.079
 well, that's why it's important to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.770
 move we will really say a mass 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.540
 people 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.939
 it can be very interesting and well 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.920
 for you so cooked on each side 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.800
 then after two in the front that is to say 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.010
 for the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.210
 the driver and the co-pilot so here we go 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.010
 besides, besides that, that's what it is 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.960
 pretty fast what they have me there a 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.460
 military truck so yeah that does not fart 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.600
 wrong if it's rather a good idea if 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.670
 you want to attack all that it can 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.130
 really do it and we're going 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.570
 so go with this second small 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.030
 tutorial rather tricks actually where are we going 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.560
 therefore find either the vehicle or soul 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.680
 and decision found also in 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.630
 gta iv a big hug ganda police all 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.740
 just what you need to know is 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.910
 that I could not find it so I 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.090
 will you put small pictures end 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.260
 I went but it actually depends on 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.610
 your level all that you know a little 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.830
 as I have said elsewhere 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.320
 for this famous helicopters uss from 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.080
 level 20 or crazy and we'll say see 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.190
 the vehicle so helicopters here I do not 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.780
 do not know at all I do not have that word 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.250
 sorry then I did not really look 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.200
 understand I was told that the box 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.880
 man he has he found her so after I 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.750
 not sure if it's a level 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.070
 because it's true that the days 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.160
 since me so if it will take some 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.630
 level to discover the the vehicle the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.510
 the big truck is good 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.280
 police also eventually I had a 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.780
 bad luck and then that's it 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.760
 must I go back and then after that 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.020
 find it will be available from here so this 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.910
 which is not bad too it is with this 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.680
 vehicle offers transport up to 4 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.090
 people behind and that he is armored 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.050
 on the sides I'm fine and I feel 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.120
 well on the sides because I tried 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.440
 the German lavender from the window can 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.750
 break up so what are the quotas do not 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.459
 does not break recorded impact is well 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.010
 of ball we will bring you this video there 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.900
 by talking and saying well and she got 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.400
 so said ldl c beach boys I like to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.600
 talk about sports activities 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.070
 we will be able to find in 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.170
 since it was indicated by rockstar 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.459
 well who's going to have activities me I 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.959
 take the air at the level of the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.150
 dress code at the level of 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.220
 tattoos sees us of different types 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.570
 hairdresser who will find me 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.500
 it really is a level of activity so 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.950
 I searched for just about every 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.400
 activities well possible and well possible 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.630
 we will say on the beach I find it is 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.400
 just look for it on the net 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.070
 after tax was already discussing my 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.510
 question is what activity 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.280
 you think he'll see and well in 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.310
 this dlc there ie to which activity 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.510
 sporty then at the five on the beach 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.180
 what do we find we find 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.709
 babington flap the fitness gym so 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.700
 we already have but maybe we'll 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.769
 to participate 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.870
 thanks to this dlc there I do not think because 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.140
 it's gone only on the multiplayer mode 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.640
 than on gta online so somewhere and 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.710
 that it can delete something that is 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.790
 also the foot in beach that would surprise me 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.840
 beach soccer 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.850
 it's about the same thing too 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.160
 of MTB us that's things that are 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.070
 relatively close to the square and you 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.270
 have to go along the beach 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.530
 as well as rollers then the roles 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.150
 arts I saw that but I told myself 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.350
 swimming it's going to be right now 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.060
 it may not be possible 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.319
 but it's true me honestly I think 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.390
 that it will be entirely possible in the 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.030
 online mode well as activity the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.739
 volleyball badminton gym fitness for me 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.410
 it seems to me quite possible that they 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.960
 can integrate this kind of mini games 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.340
 you know in wood here is tony c 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.140
 then to stuff in the gulf 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.060
 but why not honestly put yourself 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.410
 a small flap a little hinton pub that's 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.510
 of those two things with the fitness gym 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.800
 in three things or where his share 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.330
 is very possible demonstrated besides I 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.070
 will show you on the screen a little 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.229
 30 place where I found on the beach 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.370
 little balloons with trevor it's 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.640
 just like that I was walking and then I 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.250
 found that it is true that it can give 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.560
 the impression bah here is of a future one of the 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.750
 future games of in this style there with this 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.490
 kind of balloons like volleyball or the 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.080
 badminton or chyme fitness for me 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.460
 it looks quite possible he'll 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.800
 do without it if you agree 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.539
 with the notice that I am recomposing you to 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.060
 about its three main types of 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.919
 game we're going to be very risky 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.229
 sincerely not to find in this future 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.849
 dlc ventures or so do you 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.190
 think there will be other activities 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.180
 who will be present and well in cd 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.860
 amounted to 10.2 months in 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.000

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.650
