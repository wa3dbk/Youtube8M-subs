00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.139
 I'm on the border going to 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.840
 Mauritania and has felt this fear before 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.870
 The fear of the unknown 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.280
 the very essence of adventure is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.280
 precisely the investment 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.410
 over I'm worth 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:32.450
 food purchases 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.450
 I have put new shoes on the car 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 and of course I take my ladies who is 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.500
 the most important 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.980
 are incredible incredible I do not know what 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.590
 What are they 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.590
 but there's the charm of the trip 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.390
 which we 25 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.310
 wakes up mauritania 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.400
 by chance paying for there I know 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.400
 a man loves 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.940
 I tell my plans the next day 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.250
 a couple of the giant is planned 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.620
 will sweep the entire coast they dream 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.770
 with getting to this site more not discovering 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.710
 those waves a true story I just 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.300
 to meet two people and not them 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.510
 I know nothing, I go to the desert with 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.950
 they are going to drive all night 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.990
 because tomorrow morning a swell arrives 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.520
 and we go to a site that is in the middle 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.759
 of the desert although searched by google 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.759
 earth 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.930
 we do not know exactly where we're going 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.860
 and exactly with time but we're leaving 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.860
 to stick all night 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.590
 let's do on the way yes because no 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.390
 come on we are moro 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.980
 are the two posts we are putting the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 road to the area all things 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.840
 before the exit contacted by my 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 I want to meet my mother and her friend 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.610
 tip are going to ask for the days off in their 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.110
 I work and they will accompany me to 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.560
 venture on this expedition to 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:47.170
 heart of the desert I wish with all my 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.170
 forces that tomorrow the waves are there 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.170
 We decided to drive on the beach to avoid 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.459
 lose the mysterious wave but the way 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.459
 it is not easy 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.519
 two 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.870
 after all actions driving 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.950
 we get to the wave the whole thing so 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.950
 we had made so much effort 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.180
 just like my dreams 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.910
 the waves rolled and rolled and I dreamed 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:56.370
 with being warm 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.370
 It has made me the tubes of my life 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.530
 lÃ¶w 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.340
 and hurts 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.340
 cast 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.820
 but failure itself is part of the 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.820
 adventure you learn enriches you 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.060
 the swell has already gone 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.480
 or not 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.730
 I am now rolling the secretary towards 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.750
 Senegalese but I'm never alone and what 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.140
 matter is the way what is left what 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.140
 it does 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.199
 of being and two things 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.880
 good 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.750
 a mou 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.750
 anchored in vilo 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.040
 but no 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.879
 the crisis 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 perandones 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.680
 yes 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.680
 no no 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.120
 do not 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.910
 in the East 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.659
 to me
