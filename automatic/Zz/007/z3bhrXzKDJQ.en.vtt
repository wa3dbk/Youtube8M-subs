00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.960
 a human is electric this is the noise 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.030
 what he does when he sets and now I'm going to 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.490
 release 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.670
 this is the noise and now I put another 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.670
 time 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.300
 and now it started without releasing it 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.300
 with the first 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.820
 I'm going to put back 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.780
 one hand on and now I'm going to start 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.379
 without letting go 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.379
 Wow 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.640
 it is very good is the handbrake 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.700
 since we are in a plain 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.149
 and only with 15 and again I release the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.149
 clutch pedal 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.220
 is released and then gives us the blow that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.800
 they usually give 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.800
 it's perfect it 's very well done 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.950
 I have to see how it is in the automatic 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.760
 but in the manual it is very good 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.760
 solved at 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.409
 how the handbrake is released 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.869
 electric 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 I knew that brother brake how it works 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.409
 I'll put 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.680
 I'm going to put back 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.890
 and a consolidated one also when accelerating 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.869
 is released to the disease 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.990
 I do not understand how the brake works 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.990
 hand this 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.530
 I put it I put it a bit gross 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.360
 I loose the clutch and it is released yesterday in 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.580
 one car was passing me this and in another 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.400
 released the clutch and did not let go and 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.180
 had to give a little bit to the accelerator not 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.180
 I understand very well 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.910
 when something happens or I do not understand 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.260
 very well not too bad I do not understand when 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.050
 one thing happens that when another occurs 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.150
 and this frees us the hand brake as 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.569
 what things 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.290
 because this does not release the handbrake 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.290
 like gasoline 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.980
 what nonsense 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.680
 on one level a phenomenon like gasoline 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.010
 I come to ask me come ask 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.010
 if everything is fine 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.120
 and you know that you must accelerate a little 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.010
 is that you have to accelerate a little and I 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.010
 he did it alone with the clutch
