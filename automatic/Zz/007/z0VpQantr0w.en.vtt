printed up so the eyes are gonna be
facing<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.570> we're<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.930> fold<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.470> in

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
facing up and we're going to fold it in

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.650 
facing up and we're going to fold it in
half<00:00:19.650> diagonally<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> from<00:00:22.830> left<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> right

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
half diagonally so from left to right

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.490 
half diagonally so from left to right
we're<00:00:24.660> going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> fold<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.710> half<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> we're

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
we're going to fold it in half and we're

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.049 
we're going to fold it in half and we're
going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.980> crease<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.699> very<00:00:29.970> well<00:00:31.850> we're<00:00:32.850> going

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
going to crease it very well we're going

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.530 
going to crease it very well we're going
to<00:00:33.450> open<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.410> back<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.880> crease<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
to open it back up and then crease it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.990 
to open it back up and then crease it
from<00:00:36.840> bottom<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.320> top<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:45.059> open<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.020> back<00:00:46.050> up

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
from bottom to top and open it back up

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.220 
from bottom to top and open it back up
next<00:00:48.000> we're<00:00:48.149> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> flip<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.079> other

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
next we're going to flip it to the other

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.000 
next we're going to flip it to the other
side<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:51.390> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.750> crease<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.410> along

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
side so we're going to crease it along

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
side so we're going to crease it along
the<00:00:53.280> middle<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.850> half<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.789> rectangle<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the middle in half like a rectangle so

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.000 
the middle in half like a rectangle so
we're<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> take<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> from<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> bottom

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
we're going to take it from the bottom

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.520 
we're going to take it from the bottom
to<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> top<00:00:59.309> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
to the top and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.390 
to the top and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.140 

crease<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.360> well

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.210 

can<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.840> we're<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.620> it<00:01:10.740> from<00:01:10.980> left

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
can then we're going to do it from left

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.660 
can then we're going to do it from left
to<00:01:11.340> right

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.100 

and<00:01:20.790> unfold<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:23.420> next<00:01:24.420> we're<00:01:24.600> going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> turn

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and unfold it next we're going to turn

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.110 
and unfold it next we're going to turn
our<00:01:25.290> paper<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.370> a<00:01:26.400> 45<00:01:27.090> degree

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
our paper so that it's at a 45 degree

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.790 
our paper so that it's at a 45 degree
angle<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.260> we<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.159> our<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.610> B<00:01:30.450> C<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.409> D

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
angle and we have our a B C and D

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.510 
angle and we have our a B C and D
corners<00:01:32.340> facing<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.300> we<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.520> next

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
corners facing as we have it here next

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.940 
corners facing as we have it here next
we're<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.060> take<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> our<00:01:37.619> C

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
we're going to take our a and our C

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620 
we're going to take our a and our C
corners<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.610> we're<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.270> bring<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> down

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
corners and we're going to bring it down

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.130 
corners and we're going to bring it down
to<00:01:40.020> corner<00:01:40.470> D<00:01:40.800> so<00:01:41.670> taking<00:01:42.330> these<00:01:42.479> two<00:01:42.690> corners

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
to corner D so taking these two corners

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.280 
to corner D so taking these two corners
we're<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.890> pull<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.550> in<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:46.259> will

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
we're going to pull it in and you will

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.109 
we're going to pull it in and you will
find<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.950> paper<00:01:47.190> will<00:01:47.430> fold<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.000> on

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
find that the paper will fold in on

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.719 
find that the paper will fold in on
itself<00:01:48.800> so<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:50.009> looks<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.550> a<00:01:50.790> square<00:01:52.729> next

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
itself so it looks like a square next

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.990 
itself so it looks like a square next
we're<00:01:53.940> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.330> fold<00:01:54.660> in<00:01:54.899> these<00:01:55.640> edges<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
we're going to fold in these edges to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.790 
we're going to fold in these edges to
the<00:01:57.180> middle<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.170> we're<00:01:58.320> going<00:01:58.410> to<00:01:58.470> take<00:01:58.590> our

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
the middle so we're going to take our

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.910 
the middle so we're going to take our
left<00:01:59.100> edge<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.759> we're<00:02:00.000> going<00:02:00.300> to<00:02:00.619> fold<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
left edge and we're going to fold it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:12.620 
left edge and we're going to fold it
inwards<00:02:02.460> towards<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.539> middle<00:02:06.259> like<00:02:07.259> this

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.200 

next<00:02:13.380> we're<00:02:13.620> going<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.070> take<00:02:14.280> our<00:02:14.520> top

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
next we're going to take our top

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.330 
next we're going to take our top
triangle<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.380> we're<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.920> fold<00:02:17.130> it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
triangle and we're going to fold it

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.060 
triangle and we're going to fold it
downwards<00:02:19.580> crease<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.790> really<00:02:21.060> well<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:22.070> then

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
downwards crease it really well and then

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.870 
downwards crease it really well and then
unfold<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:25.010> then<00:02:26.010> we're<00:02:26.190> going<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.460> unfold

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
unfold it and then we're going to unfold

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.440 
unfold it and then we're going to unfold
these<00:02:27.120> flaps<00:02:27.810> as<00:02:28.110> well<00:02:28.940> next<00:02:29.940> we're<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.330> to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
these flaps as well next we're going to

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.380 
these flaps as well next we're going to
take<00:02:30.690> only<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.350> top<00:02:31.590> flap<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.340> we're<00:02:33.150> going

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
take only the top flap and we're going

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.420 
take only the top flap and we're going
to<00:02:33.540> fold<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.020> along<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.650> line<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.070> we<00:02:35.190> just

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
to fold it along the line that we just

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.600 
to fold it along the line that we just
crease<00:02:35.730> upwards<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.580> we're<00:02:38.580> going

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
crease upwards like this and we're going

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.980 
crease upwards like this and we're going
to<00:02:39.030> push<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.840> side<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:42.810> get<00:02:42.930> a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
to push in the side so that we get a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.080 
to push in the side so that we get a
nice<00:02:43.230> diamond<00:02:43.560> shape<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.090> then

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
nice diamond shape so like that and then

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.150 
nice diamond shape so like that and then
we're<00:02:48.210> going<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.480> flip<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.780> over<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.350> we're

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
we're going to flip it over and we're

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.370 
we're going to flip it over and we're
going<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.460> do<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> same<00:02:51.240> thing<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.230> back

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
going to do the same thing on the back

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.750 
going to do the same thing on the back
side<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:54.120> take<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.720> outside<00:02:55.470> edges<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.340> we

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
side so we take the outside edges and we

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:06.230 
side so we take the outside edges and we
fold<00:02:57.090> them<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.540> towards<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.260> middle

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.450 

I'm<00:03:06.780> going<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.140> take<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.350> top<00:03:07.560> triangle<00:03:08.220> and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
I'm going to take the top triangle and

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.220 
I'm going to take the top triangle and
fold<00:03:08.490> it<00:03:08.850> downwards<00:03:11.450> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.540> unfold<00:03:12.960> that

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
fold it downwards going to unfold that

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.400 
fold it downwards going to unfold that
and<00:03:13.500> unfold<00:03:14.100> piece<00:03:15.020> we're<00:03:16.020> going<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.260> take

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
and unfold piece we're going to take

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.250 
and unfold piece we're going to take
only<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> top<00:03:17.250> flap<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.940> then<00:03:18.690> lift<00:03:18.960> it<00:03:19.140> up

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.960 
only the top flap and then lift it up
along<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.740> line<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:19.980> we<00:03:20.310> creased<00:03:21.770> and<00:03:22.970> push

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
along the line that we creased and push

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.890 
along the line that we creased and push
inwards<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.370> we<00:03:26.490> get<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.850> nice<00:03:27.030> diamond

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
inwards so that we get the nice diamond

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.470 
inwards so that we get the nice diamond
shape<00:03:30.350> okay<00:03:31.400> next<00:03:32.400> we're<00:03:32.700> going<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.090> take<00:03:33.300> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
shape okay next we're going to take the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.510 
shape okay next we're going to take the
top<00:03:33.720> flap<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.290> bring<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.650> down<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.190> we're

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
top flap and bring it down and we're

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.850 
top flap and bring it down and we're
also<00:03:35.670> going<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.120> take<00:03:36.330> back<00:03:36.660> flap<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.320> bring

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
also going to take back flap and bring

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:38.320 
also going to take back flap and bring
it<00:03:37.980> down

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.180 
it down
[Music]

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
[Music]

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.300 
[Music]
so<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.370> let<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:41.670> out<00:03:41.790> looks<00:03:42.060> like<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.210> kite<00:03:43.310> next

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
so we let it out looks like a kite next

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.600 
so we let it out looks like a kite next
you'll<00:03:44.850> see<00:03:45.120> two<00:03:45.360> printed<00:03:45.840> lines<00:03:46.080> here<00:03:46.650> we're

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
you'll see two printed lines here we're

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.150 
you'll see two printed lines here we're
going<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.940> fold<00:03:48.150> these<00:03:48.510> outside<00:03:49.200> edges<00:03:49.470> along

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
going to fold these outside edges along

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.980 
going to fold these outside edges along
those<00:03:50.490> printed<00:03:50.820> lines<00:03:51.030> towards<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.720> middle

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
those printed lines towards the middle

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
those printed lines towards the middle
so<00:03:52.620> we<00:03:53.040> take<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:54.060> outside<00:03:54.480> edges<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.140> we<00:03:55.410> fold

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
so we take the outside edges and we fold

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.720 
so we take the outside edges and we fold
them<00:03:56.280> inwards<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.600> middle<00:04:00.200> like<00:04:01.200> that

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
them inwards to the middle like that

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.690 
them inwards to the middle like that
take<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.910> side<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.510> fold<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.650> inwards

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
take the side and fold it inwards

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.540 
take the side and fold it inwards
like<00:04:07.240> that<00:04:07.650> we're<00:04:08.650> going<00:04:08.860> to<00:04:08.980> flip<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.459> entire

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
like that we're going to flip the entire

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.720 
like that we're going to flip the entire
piece<00:04:10.000> over<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.630> do<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.530> same<00:04:11.770> for<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.489> side

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
piece over and do the same for the side

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:21.690 
piece over and do the same for the side
so<00:04:13.660> fold<00:04:14.020> in<00:04:14.200> the<00:04:14.319> outside<00:04:14.709> edges<00:04:20.549> into<00:04:21.549> the

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
so fold in the outside edges into the

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.900 
so fold in the outside edges into the
middle<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:23.710> we<00:04:24.010> have<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.220> diamond<00:04:24.490> shape

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
middle so that we have a diamond shape

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.840 
middle so that we have a diamond shape
again<00:04:25.440> but<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.470> smaller<00:04:26.860> one<00:04:28.889> next<00:04:29.889> we're<00:04:30.639> going

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
again but a smaller one next we're going

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.830 
again but a smaller one next we're going
to<00:04:31.030> open<00:04:31.240> up<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.200> slide<00:04:32.440> flap<00:04:32.889> here<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.840> we're

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
to open up the slide flap here and we're

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.200 
to open up the slide flap here and we're
going<00:04:35.139> to<00:04:35.320> bring<00:04:35.560> out<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.950> wing<00:04:36.130> so<00:04:36.520> we<00:04:36.730> lift

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
going to bring out the wing so we lift

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.480 
going to bring out the wing so we lift
up<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.540> wing<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:39.610> we're<00:04:40.120> going<00:04:40.389> to<00:04:40.419> twist<00:04:40.930> it

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
up the wing and we're going to twist it

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.850 
up the wing and we're going to twist it
so<00:04:42.490> that<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:42.880> turns<00:04:43.180> out<00:04:43.450> words<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.440> you'll<00:04:44.620> see

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
so that it turns out words so you'll see

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.530 
so that it turns out words so you'll see
a<00:04:44.889> dotted<00:04:45.160> line<00:04:45.490> here<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:46.060> we're<00:04:46.330> following

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
a dotted line here and we're following

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.830 
a dotted line here and we're following
the<00:04:46.930> dotted<00:04:47.320> lines<00:04:47.639> we're<00:04:48.639> going<00:04:48.910> to<00:04:49.180> twist

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
the dotted lines we're going to twist

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.190 
the dotted lines we're going to twist
out<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.290> wing<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.680> press<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.520> down<00:04:54.930> it's<00:04:55.930> okay

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
out the wing and press it down it's okay

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.600 
out the wing and press it down it's okay
if<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.440> didn't<00:04:56.770> see<00:04:56.889> that<00:04:57.070> clearly<00:04:57.430> because

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
if you didn't see that clearly because

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.310 
if you didn't see that clearly because
we're<00:04:57.940> going<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.240> be<00:04:58.419> doing<00:04:58.600> it<00:04:58.810> on<00:04:58.930> this<00:04:59.080> side

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
we're going to be doing it on this side

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.370 
we're going to be doing it on this side
again<00:04:59.530> so<00:05:00.100> we<00:05:00.490> open<00:05:01.330> up<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.600> flap<00:05:01.840> on<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.080> side

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
again so we open up the flap on the side

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.780 
again so we open up the flap on the side
a<00:05:02.410> little<00:05:02.979> bit<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.370> we<00:05:03.970> pull<00:05:04.419> up<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.720> wing<00:05:05.139> and

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
a little bit and we pull up the wing and

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.460 
a little bit and we pull up the wing and
you<00:05:06.790> can<00:05:06.970> put<00:05:07.240> your<00:05:07.389> finger<00:05:07.780> where<00:05:08.169> I've

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
you can put your finger where I've

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.560 
you can put your finger where I've
tucked<00:05:08.860> it<00:05:09.070> in<00:05:09.220> between<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.850> line<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:10.090> then

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
tucked it in between the line and then

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.090 
tucked it in between the line and then
this<00:05:10.780> line<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.350> you<00:05:11.410> put<00:05:11.710> your<00:05:11.800> finger<00:05:12.070> there

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
this line and you put your finger there

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.830 
this line and you put your finger there
and<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.760> will<00:05:15.120> automatically<00:05:16.120> follow<00:05:16.510> the

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
and it will automatically follow the

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.650 
and it will automatically follow the
lines<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:18.070> squish<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.900> down<00:05:19.900> like<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:21.660> so

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
lines and we squish it down like that so

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.070 
lines and we squish it down like that so
that<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.050> wings<00:05:23.260> are<00:05:23.560> facing<00:05:24.100> outwards<00:05:25.080> next

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
that the wings are facing outwards next

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.170 
that the wings are facing outwards next
we're<00:05:26.320> going<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.950> there's<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.340> faint<00:05:27.640> dotted

so the Owls feet are facing outwards and

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.960 
so the Owls feet are facing outwards and
