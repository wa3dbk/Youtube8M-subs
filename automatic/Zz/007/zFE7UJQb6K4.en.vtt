through<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.269> past<00:00:30.269> two<00:00:30.509> years<00:00:31.579> just<00:00:32.579> building

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
through and past two years just building

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.689 
through and past two years just building
on<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:33.720> we've<00:00:33.870> done<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:35.040> regular<00:00:35.339> season

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
on what we've done in one regular season

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.030 
on what we've done in one regular season

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
so we did that again so it's next year

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.889 
so we did that again so it's next year
we're<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.149> trying<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.720> same

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
thing got a lot of returners so we uh

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:55.740 
thing got a lot of returners so we uh
hopefully<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.440> good<00:00:43.800> run

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.230

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.990 

I<00:02:02.100> think<00:02:03.100> we<00:02:03.189> had<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.400> people<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.729> do<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:03.970> for

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
I think we had the people to do it for

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.539 
I think we had the people to do it for
brain<00:02:04.360> in<00:02:04.630> like<00:02:05.380> nine<00:02:05.590> or<00:02:05.619> ten<00:02:05.920> dollars<00:02:06.310> so

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
brain in like nine or ten dollars so

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.160 
brain in like nine or ten dollars so
hopefully<00:02:07.210> they<00:02:07.299> feel<00:02:07.540> something<00:02:07.810> spots<00:02:08.020> of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
hopefully they feel something spots of

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.109 
hopefully they feel something spots of
loss<00:02:08.319> but<00:02:08.649> it's<00:02:09.130> all<00:02:09.250> about<00:02:09.429> mentality<00:02:09.970> my

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
loss but it's all about mentality my

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.729 
loss but it's all about mentality my
kind<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.810> think<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.650> right

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
kind of think that we have the right

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.040 
kind of think that we have the right
mentality<00:02:12.069> from<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.550> change<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.000> makes<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.330> if

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.120 
God when the championship I'm sure the
individual<00:02:24.910> awards<00:02:25.480> will<00:02:25.600> follow<00:02:26.130> while

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
individual awards will follow while

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.550 
individual awards will follow while
we're<00:02:27.370> in<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.520> weight<00:02:27.670> room<00:02:27.700> every<00:02:28.120> day

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
we're in the weight room every day

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.979 
we're in the weight room every day
running<00:02:29.560> getting<00:02:30.370> fitter<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.910> faster<00:02:31.750> and

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
running getting fitter and faster and

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.330 
running getting fitter and faster and
then<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:33.670> as<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.850> team<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:36.040> more

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
then just as a team just a be more

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.710 
then just as a team just a be more
together<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.940> think<00:02:37.030> we<00:02:37.239> definitely<00:02:37.390> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
together I think we definitely the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.440 
together I think we definitely the
players<00:02:37.959> obviously<00:02:38.319> we've<00:02:38.850> done<00:02:39.850> well<00:02:40.060> if<00:02:40.239> we

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
players obviously we've done well if we

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.020 
players obviously we've done well if we
lost<00:02:41.040> well<00:02:42.040> we<00:02:42.310> didn't<00:02:42.459> lose<00:02:42.519> last<00:02:42.790> year<00:02:42.970> in

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
lost well we didn't lose last year in

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.610 
lost well we didn't lose last year in
the<00:02:43.090> regular<00:02:43.180> season<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.900> only<00:02:44.080> lost<00:02:44.290> once

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
the regular season we only lost once

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.220 
the regular season we only lost once
here<00:02:45.220> before<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:45.850> we<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.690> beat<00:02:46.840> all<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.050> teams

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
here before so we can beat all the teams

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.690 
here before so we can beat all the teams
we<00:02:47.440> just<00:02:47.620> kind<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:47.860> got<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.370> put<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.519> together

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
we just kind of got to put it together

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.500 
we just kind of got to put it together
on<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.150> Sunday<00:02:50.310> team<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:51.819> past<00:02:51.880> year<00:02:52.360> off

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
on that Sunday team this past year off

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.250 
on that Sunday team this past year off
yet<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:53.620> definitely<00:02:54.489> not<00:02:54.700> worked<00:02:54.910> us<00:02:55.260> for

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
yet they definitely not worked us for

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.559 
yet they definitely not worked us for
most<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.590> game<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.069> just<00:02:57.910> more<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
most of the game so just more of a

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.100 
most of the game so just more of a
mental<00:02:58.750> thing<00:02:59.170> than<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.160> physical<00:03:00.970> or<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.660> player

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
mental thing than a physical or a player

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.780 
mental thing than a physical or a player
need<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.250> think<00:03:03.430> she'll<00:03:03.850> dog<00:03:04.269> by<00:03:04.450> next<00:03:04.750> year
