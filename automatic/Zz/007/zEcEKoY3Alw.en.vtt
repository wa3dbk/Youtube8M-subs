the ice-cold water I'm going to put in a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.859 
the ice-cold water I'm going to put in a
little<00:01:24.330> salt<00:01:27.530> put<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> little<00:01:28.890> cornmeal<00:01:29.310> and

the cornmeal is just roughage it's going

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.880 
the cornmeal is just roughage it's going
to<00:01:33.150> settle<00:01:33.540> down<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.380> any<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to settle down there and if any of the

to settle down there and if any of the
clams<00:01:35.250> open<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.810> they<00:01:37.970> bring<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.119> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
clams open up and they bring this in

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.719 
clams open up and they bring this in
it's<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.439> make<00:01:40.680> them<00:01:40.860> spit<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> back<00:01:41.490> out

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it's going to make them spit it back out

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.320 
it's going to make them spit it back out
and<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.210> spit<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> back<00:01:42.840> out

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
and if they spit it back out

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.480 
and if they spit it back out
then<00:01:44.870> they're<00:01:45.050> going<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.230> spit<00:01:45.560> any<00:01:45.770> sand<00:01:46.190> out

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
then they're going to spit any sand out

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.530 
then they're going to spit any sand out
with<00:01:47.180> it

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
with it

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.750
