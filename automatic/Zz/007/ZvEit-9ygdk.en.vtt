00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
the scene your fork still the same

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.520 
the scene your fork still the same
yourself<00:05:48.090> on<00:05:48.240> 2013<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:48.930> fork<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.289> code

the<00:05:59.879> ride<00:06:00.090> height<00:06:00.389> is<00:06:00.539> still<00:06:00.629> the<00:06:00.810> same

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
the ride height is still the same
