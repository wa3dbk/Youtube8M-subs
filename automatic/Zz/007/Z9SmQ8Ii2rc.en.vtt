unusual<00:00:22.880> looking<00:00:23.210> fish<00:00:23.630> they've<00:00:23.900> got<00:00:24.019> these

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
unusual looking fish they've got these

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.509 
unusual looking fish they've got these

wayne are using electronic tracking to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.150 
wayne are using electronic tracking to
learn<00:00:32.960> more<00:00:33.020> about<00:00:33.470> the<00:00:33.770> threatened

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
learn more about the threatened

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.030 
learn more about the threatened
freshwater<00:00:34.760> catfish<00:00:35.440> all<00:00:36.440> right<00:00:36.559> way<00:00:36.680> no<00:00:36.739> more

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
freshwater catfish all right way no more

freshwater catfish all right way no more
kid<00:00:37.219> out<00:00:37.430> how<00:00:38.030> does<00:00:38.210> it<00:00:38.300> work<00:00:38.450> this<00:00:39.290> is<00:00:39.379> a<00:00:39.410> radio

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
kid out how does it work this is a radio

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.350 
kid out how does it work this is a radio
tracker<00:00:40.039> now<00:00:40.430> each<00:00:40.610> of<00:00:40.760> our<00:00:40.969> radio

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
tracker now each of our radio

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.799 
tracker now each of our radio
transmitters<00:00:42.050> puts<00:00:42.920> our<00:00:43.070> unique<00:00:43.579> signal<00:00:44.090> and

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
transmitters puts our unique signal and

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.420 
transmitters puts our unique signal and
using<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.379> antenna<00:00:45.770> we're<00:00:45.950> able<00:00:46.100> to<00:00:46.190> track

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
using the antenna we're able to track

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.650 
using the antenna we're able to track
the<00:00:46.670> movements<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:47.210> fish

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the movements of the fish

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.300 
the movements of the fish
so<00:00:49.290> wait<00:00:49.470> how<00:00:49.620> long<00:00:49.650> would<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.040> do<00:00:50.130> this<00:00:50.250> for

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
so wait how long would you do this for

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.310 
so wait how long would you do this for
we<00:00:51.239> actually<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.540> some<00:00:51.690> tracking<00:00:51.930> over<00:00:52.290> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
we actually did some tracking over a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.110 
we actually did some tracking over a
couple<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> days<00:00:52.830> getting<00:00:53.489> out<00:00:53.640> every<00:00:53.880> hour

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
couple of days getting out every hour

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
couple of days getting out every hour
over<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.540> period<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.020> pretty<00:00:55.320> pretty<00:00:55.590> long

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
over that period so pretty pretty long

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.830 
over that period so pretty pretty long
sessions<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.940> about<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.239> arms<00:00:57.480> i<00:00:57.570> gave<00:00:57.720> it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
sessions what about your arms i gave it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
sessions what about your arms i gave it
so<00:00:57.989> yeah<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> certainly<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.950> a<00:00:58.980> good<00:00:59.790> recipe

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
so yeah I certainly do a good recipe

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
so yeah I certainly do a good recipe
into<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:01.080> it's<00:01:01.200> worth<00:01:01.410> enough<00:01:01.710> yeah

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
into it but it's worth enough yeah

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
into it but it's worth enough yeah
definitely<00:01:02.340> knowing<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.000> areas<00:01:03.360> are<00:01:03.390> which

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
definitely knowing which areas are which

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
definitely knowing which areas are which
habitats<00:01:04.050> freshwater<00:01:04.440> catfish<00:01:04.769> use<00:01:04.949> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
habitats freshwater catfish use is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.170 
habitats freshwater catfish use is
really<00:01:05.369> important<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.820> means<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.090> those

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
really important it means that those

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.330 
really important it means that those
areas<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.810> protected<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.830> also<00:01:07.979> means

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
areas can be protected it also means

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
areas can be protected it also means
that<00:01:08.520> those<00:01:08.640> sorts<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:09.000> habitats<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.690> be

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that those sorts of habitats can be

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.990 
that those sorts of habitats can be
reinstated<00:01:10.410> in<00:01:10.710> areas<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:11.490> catfish<00:01:11.850> may

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
reinstated in areas where catfish may

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.969 
reinstated in areas where catfish may
have<00:01:12.090> disappeared<00:01:12.540> from<00:01:15.410> now<00:01:16.410> if<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.740> love

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
