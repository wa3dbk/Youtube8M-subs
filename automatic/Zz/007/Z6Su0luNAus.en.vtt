00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.260
 avid i'm very pleased with this game not 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.179
 because we won not because 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 result because of the way we 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.570
 played on acted in the open 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.340
 attacking style creating plenty 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.199
 moments hanged think first half with 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.720
 In terms of creativity turned out 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.670
 very good and it is a good gamma signal 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.470
 Borz will stand out so much that we spent 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.300
 match without opening trained 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 continuing to work without any break 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.870
 and demonstrate in this mode such 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.210
 intensity is very very good 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.860
 what can you say about these fees in general as 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.530
 there is a team work how is preparation 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.360
 no but all is well we are just a few 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.430
 days ago we came here so still 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.940
 we pass acclimatization but in general everything is 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.770
 okay 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.489
 ahead of us are two more control 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.590
 dice games gush of course conditions 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.899
 weather here differs slightly from Qatar 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.270
 cooler but everything suits us more 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.869
 the hotel is near and in general all that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.490
 we need to work here 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.310
 now the most important thing is of course work 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.450
 over preparation and tactics and think what 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.450
 we are moving in the right direction 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.400
 how much in the absence of the injured 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.540
 the language of the legar and you are pretty with actions 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.540
 central defenders 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.240
 Internet injury is what happens 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.799
 football 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.929
 of course we try to do everything to 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.119
 avoid them but unfortunately garay yet 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.100
 got his damage think he 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.929
 will be back in two or three weeks and 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.179
 he will have enough time to 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:47.829
 recover and prepares for the first 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:49.659
 match of the season as I am pleased with how 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.380
 acted central defenders they 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:56.110
 had a nice match cubic meter defense 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.270
 in the course he is here of course you always want not 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.599
 skip goals but in general we repeat 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.599
 we can be happy with your wade swim 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.890
 river level today's level 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.310
 your opponent met your expectations 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.290
 and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.660
 yes they are leading in their championship and 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.799
 wonderfully perform in europe league so 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.090
 that it was a very good test 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.430
 team level we meet 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.829
 further will only grow so such 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.989
 matches are very important to us ende des ditches 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.389
 simpler is the level that was us 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.389
 today is necessary 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.389
