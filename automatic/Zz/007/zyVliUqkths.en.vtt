numbers

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.010 

here<00:00:28.340> we<00:00:28.490> have<00:00:28.700> two<00:00:28.940> problems<00:00:29.210> one<00:00:29.960> is

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
here we have two problems one is

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.920 
here we have two problems one is
addition<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:31.070> other<00:00:31.250> subtraction<00:00:32.090> let's

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
addition and the other subtraction let's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.470 
addition and the other subtraction let's
work<00:00:33.140> on<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.470> addition<00:00:33.890> problem<00:00:34.310> first

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
work on the addition problem first

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
work on the addition problem first
let's<00:00:37.170> solve<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.680> problem<00:00:38.160> using<00:00:38.370> our<00:00:38.610> base

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
let's solve this problem using our base

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.180 
let's solve this problem using our base
ten<00:00:39.060> blocks<00:00:39.090> okay

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.110 

here<00:00:43.149> on<00:00:43.329> top<00:00:43.600> we<00:00:43.809> have<00:00:44.010> 126<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.340> below<00:00:45.879> we

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
here on top we have 126 and below we

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.009 
here on top we have 126 and below we
have<00:00:46.239> 57<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:47.800> need<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.160> add<00:00:48.309> these<00:00:48.550> together<00:00:49.019> to

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
have 57 we need to add these together to

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.649 
have 57 we need to add these together to
do<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.440> we<00:00:50.680> start<00:00:51.010> with<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.250> ones<00:00:51.489> blocks<00:00:51.789> we

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
do this we start with the ones blocks we

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.220 
do this we start with the ones blocks we
combine<00:00:53.050> all<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.620> ones<00:00:53.829> blocks<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.930> tens

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
combine all of the ones blocks the tens

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.329 
combine all of the ones blocks the tens
blocks<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:58.210> hundreds<00:00:58.600> blocks<00:00:58.930> together

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
blocks and the hundreds blocks together

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.709 
blocks and the hundreds blocks together
now<00:01:00.339> we<00:01:00.399> add<00:01:00.729> them<00:01:00.969> starting<00:01:01.420> with<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.570> ones

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
now we add them starting with the ones

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:12.120 
now we add them starting with the ones
we<00:01:02.260> have<00:01:02.860> 1<00:01:03.219> 2<00:01:03.909> 3<00:01:03.940> 4<00:01:04.950> 5<00:01:05.950> 6<00:01:06.610> 7<00:01:07.420> 8<00:01:07.570> 9<00:01:08.220> 10<00:01:09.220> 11<00:01:09.460> 12<00:01:10.450> 13<00:01:11.130> we

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 we

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.550 
we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 we
have<00:01:12.340> 13<00:01:12.909> but<00:01:13.509> when<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:13.810> get<00:01:13.960> to<00:01:14.140> 10

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
have 13 but when we get to 10

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.740 
have 13 but when we get to 10
we<00:01:14.740> need<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:15.039> trade<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.399> 10<00:01:15.610> ones<00:01:15.880> for<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.360> tens

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
we need to trade the 10 ones for a tens

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
we need to trade the 10 ones for a tens
block<00:01:18.810> now<00:01:19.810> how<00:01:20.050> many<00:01:20.259> ones<00:01:20.530> do<00:01:20.740> I<00:01:20.770> have

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.650 

three<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:25.050> three<00:01:25.230> ones<00:01:26.090> now<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.150> count<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
three I have three ones now we count the

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.970 
three I have three ones now we count the
tens<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.980> two<00:01:29.580> three<00:01:29.810> four<00:01:30.810> five<00:01:31.350> six

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
tens we have one two three four five six

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.180 
tens we have one two three four five six
seven<00:01:32.760> eight<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.020> write<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> eight<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
seven eight so we write the eight in the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.810 
seven eight so we write the eight in the
tens<00:01:35.460> place

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
tens place

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.670 
tens place
now<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.880> look<00:01:39.150> at<00:01:39.270> our<00:01:39.360> hundreds<00:01:39.750> place<00:01:39.990> how

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
now we look at our hundreds place how

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
now we look at our hundreds place how
many<00:01:40.710> hundreds<00:01:41.310> blocks<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.909> we<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:43.850> one<00:01:44.850> so

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
many hundreds blocks do we have one so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.230 
many hundreds blocks do we have one so
we<00:01:45.509> put<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:45.990> down<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.580> if<00:01:47.580> we<00:01:48.030> take<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
we put the one down here if we take a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
we put the one down here if we take a
look<00:01:48.450> back<00:01:48.689> at<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> ones<00:01:49.170> place<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.950> see

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
look back at the ones place we can see

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.940 
look back at the ones place we can see
that<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.430> added<00:01:50.640> six<00:01:51.119> plus<00:01:51.479> seven<00:01:51.770> we<00:01:52.770> know

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
that we added six plus seven we know

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.490 
that we added six plus seven we know
that<00:01:53.100> 6<00:01:53.369> plus<00:01:53.610> 7<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.090> 13<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.320> recall

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that 6 plus 7 is 13 and if you recall

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.249 
that 6 plus 7 is 13 and if you recall
once<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.520> had<00:01:56.700> 10<00:01:56.940> once<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.539> traded<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.049> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
once we had 10 once we traded it for a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.950 
once we had 10 once we traded it for a
tens<00:01:58.560> block<00:01:59.119> so<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> put<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> 1<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> tens

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
tens block so I put the 1 in the tens

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.740 
tens block so I put the 1 in the tens
column

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
column

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.200 
column
looking<00:02:03.560> at<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.800> tens<00:02:04.070> place<00:02:04.220> numbers<00:02:04.910> we

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
looking at the tens place numbers we

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.050 
looking at the tens place numbers we
have<00:02:05.390> one<00:02:05.690> at<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.960> top<00:02:06.200> plus<00:02:06.740> two<00:02:07.040> plus<00:02:07.640> five

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
have one at the top plus two plus five

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.350 
have one at the top plus two plus five
which<00:02:08.660> gives<00:02:08.990> us<00:02:09.140> eight<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.740> we<00:02:10.340> have<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.640> 100

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
which gives us eight and we have the 100

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:21.710 
which gives us eight and we have the 100
so<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.320> answer<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:13.240> 183<00:02:14.350> amazing<00:02:15.350> job<00:02:15.620> guys

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.140 

now<00:02:22.290> let's<00:02:22.530> go<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.040> subtraction<00:02:23.490> problem

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
now let's go to the subtraction problem

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.090 
now let's go to the subtraction problem
here<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:24.990> have<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.320> same<00:02:25.530> numbers<00:02:25.920> as<00:02:26.070> before

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
here we have the same numbers as before

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.090 
here we have the same numbers as before
but<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.060> time<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.510> are<00:02:27.540> subtracting<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.860> have

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
but this time we are subtracting we have

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.790 
but this time we are subtracting we have
our<00:02:29.250> block<00:02:29.490> set<00:02:29.790> up<00:02:29.910> again<00:02:30.180> with<00:02:30.410> 126<00:02:31.410> blocks

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
our block set up again with 126 blocks

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.570 
our block set up again with 126 blocks
this<00:02:32.730> time<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.330> need<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.510> take<00:02:34.020> away<00:02:34.310> 57<00:02:35.310> blocks

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580

need to take away 7 blocks 1 2 3 4 5 6
wait<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.830> can't<00:02:47.610> take<00:02:47.790> away<00:02:47.940> 7<00:02:48.390> because<00:02:48.780> there

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
wait I can't take away 7 because there

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.770 
wait I can't take away 7 because there
are<00:02:49.110> not<00:02:49.260> 7<00:02:49.650> ones<00:02:49.860> blocks<00:02:50.270> do<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.390> know<00:02:51.570> what<00:02:51.750> I

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
are not 7 ones blocks do you know what I

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.120 
are not 7 ones blocks do you know what I
need<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.260> do

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.610 

what<00:02:57.820> I<00:02:57.850> need<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.180> do<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.720> trade<00:02:59.050> in<00:02:59.230> one<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.500> my

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
what I need to do is trade in one of my

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.850 
what I need to do is trade in one of my
tens<00:02:59.920> blocks<00:03:00.160> for<00:03:00.850> one's<00:03:01.060> blocks<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.530> take

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
tens blocks for one's blocks so I take

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.150 
tens blocks for one's blocks so I take
away<00:03:03.070> one<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.460> my<00:03:03.580> tens<00:03:03.850> blocks<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:05.770> get<00:03:05.920> ten

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
away one of my tens blocks and I get ten

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.050 
away one of my tens blocks and I get ten
ones<00:03:06.430> blocks<00:03:06.790> from<00:03:07.030> it

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.540 

now<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> have<00:03:11.200> enough<00:03:11.410> ones<00:03:11.680> blocks<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.340> take

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
now I have enough ones blocks to take

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.240 
now I have enough ones blocks to take
away<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.940> seven<00:03:13.300> so<00:03:13.780> we<00:03:13.900> take<00:03:14.110> away<00:03:14.319> one<00:03:14.620> two

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
away the seven so we take away one two

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.430 
away the seven so we take away one two
three<00:03:16.000> four<00:03:16.630> five<00:03:17.290> six<00:03:17.890> seven<00:03:19.020> how<00:03:20.020> many<00:03:20.200> ones

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
three four five six seven how many ones

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.040 
three four five six seven how many ones
blocks<00:03:20.709> do<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.040> have<00:03:21.280> left

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.390 

nine<00:03:24.740> I<00:03:25.160> am<00:03:25.400> left<00:03:25.640> with<00:03:25.730> nine<00:03:26.120> ones<00:03:27.340> now<00:03:28.340> we

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
nine I am left with nine ones now we

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.910 
nine I am left with nine ones now we
move<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.210> tens

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.089 

it<00:03:32.910> says<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.390> we<00:03:33.480> have<00:03:33.630> two<00:03:33.900> tens<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.830> only

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
it says that we have two tens but I only

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.230 
it says that we have two tens but I only
see<00:03:35.430> one<00:03:35.459> do<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.480> know<00:03:36.540> what<00:03:36.810> happened

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.470 

I<00:03:41.890> remember<00:03:42.890> we<00:03:43.400> traded<00:03:43.820> one<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.210> tens

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
I remember we traded one of the tens

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.350 
I remember we traded one of the tens
blocks<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:45.200> get<00:03:45.350> ten<00:03:45.680> ones<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:46.940> let's<00:03:47.150> cross

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
blocks to get ten ones so let's cross

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.030 
blocks to get ten ones so let's cross
out<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.780> two<00:03:47.960> and<00:03:48.230> put<00:03:48.470> one<00:03:50.230> we<00:03:51.230> now<00:03:51.440> have<00:03:51.710> one

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
out the two and put one we now have one

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.520 
out the two and put one we now have one
tens<00:03:52.370> block<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.030> we<00:03:53.570> need<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.870> take<00:03:54.050> away<00:03:54.230> five

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
tens block and we need to take away five

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.960 
tens block and we need to take away five
tens<00:03:54.920> but<00:03:55.310> can<00:03:55.490> we<00:03:55.580> do<00:03:55.760> that

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.880 

the<00:04:02.970> only<00:04:03.300> way<00:04:03.420> we<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.750> do<00:04:03.960> this<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.380> if<00:04:04.590> we

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
the only way we can do this is if we

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.360 
the only way we can do this is if we
trade<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.250> hundreds<00:04:05.610> block<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.270> tens<00:04:07.370> 100's

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
trade the hundreds block for tens 100's

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.630 
trade the hundreds block for tens 100's
block<00:04:08.610> gives<00:04:09.030> us<00:04:09.210> ten<00:04:09.570> tens<00:04:10.050> blocks<00:04:10.520> can<00:04:11.520> you

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
block gives us ten tens blocks can you

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.690 
block gives us ten tens blocks can you
tell<00:04:11.880> me<00:04:12.030> how<00:04:12.180> many<00:04:12.240> tens<00:04:12.630> blocks<00:04:12.840> we<00:04:13.140> have<00:04:13.290> now

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.880 

we<00:04:17.700> have<00:04:17.730> eleven<00:04:18.360> and<00:04:18.570> we<00:04:18.989> need<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.410> take<00:04:19.560> away

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
we have eleven and we need to take away

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.920 
we have eleven and we need to take away
five<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.330> remove<00:04:21.720> one<00:04:22.230> two<00:04:22.920> three<00:04:23.670> four<00:04:24.300> five

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
five so I remove one two three four five

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.130 
five so I remove one two three four five
now<00:04:25.670> how<00:04:26.670> many<00:04:26.850> tens<00:04:27.180> am<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:27.450> left<00:04:27.660> with

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
now how many tens am I left with

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.390 
now how many tens am I left with
I<00:04:29.060> am<00:04:30.060> left<00:04:30.270> with<00:04:30.360> six<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.470> put<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.830> six<00:04:32.070> down

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
I am left with six so I put the six down

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.520 
I am left with six so I put the six down
here<00:04:34.040> if<00:04:35.390> you<00:04:36.390> look<00:04:36.540> at<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.810> numbers<00:04:37.170> we<00:04:37.200> have

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
here if you look at the numbers we have

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.790 
here if you look at the numbers we have
no<00:04:37.770> more<00:04:37.950> hundreds<00:04:38.430> do<00:04:39.090> you<00:04:39.180> remember<00:04:39.480> why<00:04:42.800> you

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
no more hundreds do you remember why you

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.770 
no more hundreds do you remember why you
are<00:04:43.830> right<00:04:44.220> we<00:04:44.670> traded<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.120> hundreds<00:04:45.540> for

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
are right we traded the hundreds for

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.900 
are right we traded the hundreds for
tens<00:04:46.050> so<00:04:46.710> let's<00:04:46.920> cross<00:04:47.130> out<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> one<00:04:47.670> in<00:04:47.820> the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
tens so let's cross out the one in the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.600 
tens so let's cross out the one in the
hundreds<00:04:48.330> place

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.779 

the<00:04:51.060> answer<00:04:51.599> is<00:04:51.780> 69<00:04:52.349> and<00:04:52.919> we<00:04:53.340> solved<00:04:53.729> it

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
the answer is 69 and we solved it

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.420 
the answer is 69 and we solved it
