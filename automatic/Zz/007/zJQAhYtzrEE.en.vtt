all<00:00:06.270> right<00:00:06.390> today<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:07.049> have<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.589> MX<00:00:08.069> our

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
all right today we have the MX our

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.530 
all right today we have the MX our
carbon<00:00:08.880> copy<00:00:09.260> analog<00:00:10.260> delay<00:00:10.620> pedal<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.550> this

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
carbon copy analog delay pedal and this

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.740 
carbon copy analog delay pedal and this
is<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> great<00:00:12.960> delay<00:00:13.259> pedal<00:00:13.620> goes<00:00:14.480> from<00:00:15.480> slap

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
is a great delay pedal goes from slap

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.490 
is a great delay pedal goes from slap
back<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.470> long<00:00:17.250> delay<00:00:17.760> repeats<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.600> it's

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
back to long delay repeats and it's

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.560 
back to long delay repeats and it's
pretty<00:00:19.740> cool<00:00:19.920> analog<00:00:20.340> delay<00:00:20.580> pedal<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.000> I'm

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
pretty cool analog delay pedal and I'm

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.630 
pretty cool analog delay pedal and I'm
playing<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> Fender<00:00:22.350> Strat<00:00:22.710> into<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> vox

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
playing on a Fender Strat into a vox

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.220 
playing on a Fender Strat into a vox
ac30<00:00:24.300> clean<00:00:24.930> signal

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:01:09.180 

alright<00:00:33.230> let's<00:00:33.440> engage<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:35.030> carbon<00:00:35.390> copy

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.980 

so<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.370> controls<00:01:10.820> are<00:01:11.060> regen<00:01:12.190> which<00:01:13.990> controls

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
so the controls are regen which controls

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.250 
so the controls are regen which controls
the<00:01:15.170> trail<00:01:15.500> how<00:01:16.100> long<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.580> delays<00:01:17.020> repeats<00:01:18.020> go

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
the trail how long the delays repeats go

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.610 
the trail how long the delays repeats go
for<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:19.010> got<00:01:19.190> mix<00:01:19.490> we<00:01:20.000> can<00:01:20.150> go<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.930> dry<00:01:21.320> signal

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
for we got mix we can go to dry signal

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.380 
for we got mix we can go to dry signal
guitar<00:01:22.160> mix<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.260> turning<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:24.380> all<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.830> way<00:01:24.980> up

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
guitar mix and turning it all the way up

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.359 
guitar mix and turning it all the way up
will<00:01:26.390> give<00:01:26.630> us<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:27.250> 50/50<00:01:28.250> dry<00:01:28.910> and<00:01:29.210> 50<00:01:29.690> wet<00:01:30.369> mix

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
will give us a 50/50 dry and 50 wet mix

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:39.280 
will give us a 50/50 dry and 50 wet mix
so<00:01:32.260> demonstrate<00:01:33.260> that<00:01:33.440> real<00:01:33.650> quick<00:01:38.170> so<00:01:39.170> we

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
so demonstrate that real quick so we

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.430 
so demonstrate that real quick so we
can't<00:01:39.530> go<00:01:39.650> fully<00:01:40.009> wet<00:01:40.310> on<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:40.700> pedal<00:01:41.060> but

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
can't go fully wet on this pedal but

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.850 
can't go fully wet on this pedal but
it's<00:01:42.440> okay

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
it's okay

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.910 
it's okay
sounds<00:01:43.220> great<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:44.330> got<00:01:44.450> delay<00:01:44.840> time<00:01:45.140> so

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
sounds great and we got delay time so

00:01:45.920 --> 00:02:12.070 
sounds great and we got delay time so
short<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:53.830> medium<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.130> then<00:01:55.280> long<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:11.269> we

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
short to medium and then long and we

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.820 
short to medium and then long and we
also<00:02:12.290> have<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.420> modulation<00:02:14.420> knob<00:02:14.780> well<00:02:15.680> that's

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
also have a modulation knob well that's

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.729 
also have a modulation knob well that's
a<00:02:15.920> button<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:16.580> engage<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.090> blue<00:02:17.900> LED<00:02:18.320> comes<00:02:18.560> on

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
a button we engage it blue LED comes on

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:48.260 
a button we engage it blue LED comes on
and<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.310> modulation

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.199 

we<00:02:49.270> turn<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> little<00:02:49.959> bit<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.260> overdrive

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
we turn on a little bit of overdrive

00:02:51.209 --> 00:03:19.460 
we turn on a little bit of overdrive
from<00:02:52.209> analog<00:02:52.900> man<00:02:53.170> prints<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.890> tone

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.040 

so<00:03:20.470> that's<00:03:20.650> modulation<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.640> let's<00:03:22.630> turn<00:03:22.870> it

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
so that's modulation and let's turn it

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:31.160 
so that's modulation and let's turn it
off

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.160 

very<00:03:32.170> warm<00:03:32.590> it's<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.400> little<00:03:33.670> darker<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.390> the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
very warm it's a little darker on the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.040 
very warm it's a little darker on the
darker<00:03:35.680> side<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:35.920> analog<00:03:36.520> delays<00:03:36.940> but<00:03:37.300> very

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
darker side of analog delays but very

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:48.480 
darker side of analog delays but very
warm

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:04:02.619 

you

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:27.260 

and<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:04.680> will<00:04:05.040> even<00:04:05.310> self<00:04:05.760> oscillate<00:04:26.240> can<00:04:27.240> I

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
and it will even self oscillate can I

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.210 
and it will even self oscillate can I
get<00:04:27.539> a<00:04:27.570> sound<00:04:27.960> wave<00:04:28.199> going<00:04:28.669> but<00:04:29.669> uh

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
get a sound wave going but uh

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.500 
get a sound wave going but uh
oscillation<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:32.669> one<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.210> best

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
oscillation is not one of the best

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.820 
oscillation is not one of the best
features<00:04:34.020> of<00:04:34.229> this<00:04:34.530> pedal<00:04:34.940> but<00:04:35.940> uh<00:04:36.710> but<00:04:37.710> it

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
features of this pedal but uh but it

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.330 
features of this pedal but uh but it
does<00:04:38.039> provide<00:04:38.539> very<00:04:39.539> nice<00:04:39.840> analog<00:04:40.590> lush<00:04:40.889> sound

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
does provide very nice analog lush sound

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.560 
does provide very nice analog lush sound
let's<00:04:42.090> go<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:43.169> a<00:04:43.199> pro<00:04:43.470> quo<00:04:43.650> rap<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.570> this

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
let's go to like a pro quo rap and this

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.629 
let's go to like a pro quo rap and this
is<00:04:45.750> great<00:04:46.050> for<00:04:46.260> like<00:04:46.440> soloing<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.639> having<00:04:48.350> the

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
is great for like soloing and having the

00:04:49.639 --> 00:05:12.740 
is great for like soloing and having the
analog<00:04:50.639> delay<00:04:50.940> con<00:04:51.210> in<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.419> background
