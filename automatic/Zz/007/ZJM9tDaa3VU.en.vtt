00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Why did you choose an audio format for the new chapter written by Kazushige Nojima instead of a video for example ?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The chapter is only for thirty minutes.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You may think it's quite long but compared to the full game it's very short. It's a short content. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So if we were to decide to make it in an image format, then you will just see it and thatâ€™s it. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So if we were to decide to make it in an image format, then you will just see it and that's it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The image will stay in you and we don't want that. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We'd rather leave room for your imagination.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That's why we opted for an decent audio version. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
If FFX/X-2 HD Remaster meets with success, will you think about bringing in new parts to the story with new games emphasizing on the origins of FFX and their heroes Braska, Jecht and Auron?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
When we made X-2, you see it was a very good history with three girls in an adventure together. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We actually had an idea and we wanted to make a different game featuring Jecht, Auron and Braska.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That kind of people in the previous era to the newest generation. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So if we had to do that, we have to create a boot story... 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
with all kind of grown-up man and female travelling together. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So that would require a lot of work.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's was a good idea and we nearly wanted to do that but it didn't happen so probably not.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
After working on a Compilation of FFX HD, do you think you will keep on following this path and work on a Compilation of FFVII HD, including for example Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core ?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We are aware that there is a max expectation from our fans for a FFVII remake and we know that.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
At the moment there is no plan. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
But if we did want to do that, we have to sit down and think carefully what would be the best possible way to do that.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It could be a remaster like X/X-2 HD Remaster or possibly a full remake. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
This time, it's our first ever HD Remaster attempt.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So I think it has broaden up of what we could choose from.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
We have to investigate to be sure what our fans are looking for 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and then we have to take the right decision if we were to do FFVII an another time

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Do you plan to include The Last Mission into the game, as a full chapter or as a downloadable content?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We haven't made the decision on that yet. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
At the moment, we are concentrating about rising the quality of the HD Remaster.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Maybe later.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
You mentioned the possibility of remastering FFXII if FFX/X-2 HD Remaster is a success. On which standards will you decide whether FFX/X-2 HD Remaster is a success or not?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
There are two different way to determine if it has been successful or not.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Obviously, sales is important 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but also we want to assure that we have achieved the quality we wanted to achieve. 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We have to make sure our fans are happy about our work,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
what we presented and particularly we appreciate feedback from community base like yourselves so thank you
