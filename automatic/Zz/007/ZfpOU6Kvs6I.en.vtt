00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
must be better for fuel consumption they

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.230 
must be better for fuel consumption they
all<00:00:56.020> wanted<00:00:56.350> God<00:00:56.500> but<00:00:56.740> this<00:00:56.890> one<00:00:57.130> looks<00:00:57.310> superb

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the a1 against the i-10 I would say that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.930 
the a1 against the i-10 I would say that
they<00:02:20.600> were<00:02:20.660> both<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.410> same<00:02:21.440> type<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.459> car<00:02:22.730> in
