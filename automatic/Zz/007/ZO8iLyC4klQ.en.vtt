00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.289

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.510
 all right is a demand from the channel of 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:17.439
 kick and welcome once again to a new 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.210
 gameplay with fifa physical schemes 13 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.689
 welcome once again to a channel to a 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.849
 game pollada although I started fifa 13 and 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.399
 good the first advice of today watched 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.309
 look at him I have had the team had 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.590
 all bronze cards all 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.920
 cards from the same country as 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.329
 you can see it has a 100% completion 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.020
 that was not going to help him but I 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.260
 I do not know what the hell has happened, I do not know what 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.000
 I will treat worked to my campus area and 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.040
 I liked it so that star 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.260
 it has turned a different color I do not know what 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.710
 it has happened but my advice for this 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.070
 gameplay kids is that you do not trust 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.600
 of no good rival as you see in the background 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.980
 we play a stadium the postman vicente me 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.920
 he played in the first the first one over all 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.989
 what I opened the truth is that having a 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.189
 stadium like that of those characteristics 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.229
 The team helps a lot because they press 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.229
 a lot is full of people not the same 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.450
 than having a field that gives you the one 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.999
 they give you a series as standard and shoot with a 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.560
 fucking tier and have a large field 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:20.380
 youtube strongly current pilot and 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.509
 it looks like people push push and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.859
 push good I started failing that 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.049
 failing but good the other the tibet 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:29.289
 time feels like a rapport I 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.490
 he's 54 he was not dancing he was not 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.560
 dancing like to go from here 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.969
 advance of something first was not 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.730
 dancing but I do not know what the fuck 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.030
 past 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.500
 what the fuck 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.659
 program the tacos but that is 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 triumphant out after matches for 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.229
 more than an hour since I've done it and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.180
 I will teach them because I do not know why 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.420
 I happen to me these things after going 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.340
 winning the 30 subjumping shot to the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.740
 crossbar shot to the stick 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.409
 I have players from here to there and pim 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.170
 pam pum but giving clear occasions I 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.149
 I had it so easy 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.490
 while while we are playing division 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.280
 even the mythical because directors things 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.440
 enchanted these things and sing and 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.010
 we were playing a game of what 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.450
 direct 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.070
 a bronze tournament of those from 10 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.780

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.130
 Purchasing from what happened has given me 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.630
 some people that have been seen 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.060
 believe that look look not only that in this 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.500
 block cough tight here has to be 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.230
 more taboo side the referee sure is that 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.819
 Malian undian that does not allow total 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.670
 secured the penalty and throwing to the 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.700

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.620

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.140

 meters are more stars plus two weeks 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.000
 more activity for the future over looks 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.270
 how badly I change habitat in which they are 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.400
 two 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:18.260
 that gives you the ball was going outside 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.790
 commenting my room right now the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.360
 computer what is a super screen 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.040
 tiny and here I get about a lot 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.810
 and I'm outside uncle about out wrong 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.820
 forgiven another clear passion had come back 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.800
 to forgive but I am and the second that I 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.710
 brand good good good good not when 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.030
 yesterday depending on which brand you are going to laugh 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.400
 because that is not going to be a chain of 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.050
 nonsense the end is infarction of 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.080
 infarcts of infarction I do not know how 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.170
 cojones that really happened because I 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.600
 I say that never trust and never 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.510
 trust you neither expensive nor believe you have to have 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.420
 participated because it is not like that, not the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.790
 the match closes until it 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.850
 they finish the 90 minutes a hard game 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.970
 from 1 to 90 you have to be vigilant 90 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.790
 minutes with penetrating the 90 minutes 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:11.579
 because if it is not, the box stays 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:14.280
 but what the fuck as how can you 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.289
 explain someone if this if this is not 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.289
 pure bad luck that god go down and see it 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.239
 that goes from god sees him to provide that 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.949
 it causes me to be super super super 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.139
 super country in which to leave is that I do not 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.400
 I can really believe it and leave the 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.380
 comments that you think you said 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.060
 spend sometime you have had a 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.340
 party of all that you have won and 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.820
 suddenly being superior to the other rival 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.960
 or has gone up and in a way I that 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.490
 quote the joke and touched the goals are 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.490
 we congratulate the doubles for an hour 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.720
 Mark is now balls I know him 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.460
 things with a great goal mark 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:54.820
 but with the physical system that is not 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:59.230
 officiating that they are commenting that brand 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.790
 the 331 wind to liter hours 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.160
 - arbitrator the time if they already need in the 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.700
 56 minutes steps if we had done 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.920
 others each and on the other hand 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.019
 another side of the computer that I wanted 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.459
 the computer 

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:15.199
 we started the second time of the test 

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:17.239
 I hope to see you for now forgiveness and mark me 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:18.739
 the fourth me freaking out with the commanded the 

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:21.619
 consoled by flipping the line through 

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:25.069
 half when with the games for me to 

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:26.869
 that this my wife has to the girl that 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.999
 all things I did not know I q 

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:31.279
 wait tnt all the mountain to like 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.169
 before the doorman that trash and outside did not 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.519
 I can not believe but do not go yet 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.159
 go to the video that you are watching with 

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:38.479
 vice quiet do not go yet not you 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:40.939
 is already the video that vice I want that 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.469
 see the last play please look 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:45.769
 the last move because I can not 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.119
 believe I can not believe it a sixth 

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:49.789
 match of the mara and again and it takes 

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:50.899
 but hey he throws the ball he took off 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.449
 goalkeeper like when I played football 

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.519
 and I was going to pepín towards asia as well 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.529
 back and I did not look at the ball and they gave me 

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:59.389
 chest in grief gave me any 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.649
 site goes outside as well it appears 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.149
 because man is I do not want it what 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:03.739
 I can believe what was reversed 

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:05.869
 struggling then is that they locked him up his 

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:08.419
 house is your house a user I've had 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:09.799
 multitude of occasions and the last one is already 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.689
 the last idea is that the 

00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:12.970
 last option I had for laugh is for 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:17.139
 that you see 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.180
 Me and I are leaving 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.789
 to a bag 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.789
 what is the series all like 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:33.070

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:34.660
 I thank you from the heart because you have been 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.789
 another one of so many that you have that you see 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.770
 the east gets in the middle and get the 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.900
 double chance in which he has to flip 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.949
 ndiku as if you can escape from 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.270
 this way the truth is that I do not 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.220
 I get it 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.900
 here that ensures look there that is 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.940

 radio stations as if they were seen in
