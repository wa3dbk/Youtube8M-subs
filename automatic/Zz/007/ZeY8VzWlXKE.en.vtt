which<00:00:19.820> is<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.000> way<00:00:20.210> to<00:00:20.240> tighten<00:00:21.020> your<00:00:21.170> drum<00:00:21.500> head

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
which is a way to tighten your drum head

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.850 
which is a way to tighten your drum head
by<00:00:22.550> weaving<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:24.490> cord<00:00:26.860> crossways

by weaving the the cord crossways

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.570 
by weaving the the cord crossways
through<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:28.910> verticals<00:00:29.530> so<00:00:30.530> I'll<00:00:31.340> take<00:00:31.520> a

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
through the verticals so I'll take a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.510 
through the verticals so I'll take a
close-up<00:00:32.090> here<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:33.559> first<00:00:33.829> of<00:00:34.010> all<00:00:34.129> the<00:00:34.280> first

thing you want to be aware of is see how
the<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:37.879> pairs<00:00:38.210> of<00:00:39.070> cords<00:00:40.070> at<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.519> top<00:00:41.739> are

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
the the pairs of cords at the top are

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.869 
the the pairs of cords at the top are
either<00:00:43.070> together<00:00:43.820> or<00:00:44.449> apart<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.760> when<00:00:46.760> you're

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
either together or apart and when you're

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.270 
either together or apart and when you're
running<00:00:47.260> your<00:00:48.260> horizontals<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:50.059> want<00:00:50.239> to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
running your horizontals you want to

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.250 
running your horizontals you want to
keep<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.489> top<00:00:52.699> ones<00:00:52.940> consistent<00:00:53.629> as<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.809> as<00:00:54.199> a

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
keep the top ones consistent as a as a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.009 
keep the top ones consistent as a as a
pair<00:00:54.789> however<00:00:55.789> they<00:00:55.940> are<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.539> next<00:00:56.719> one<00:00:56.899> in

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019

line<00:00:57.050> here<00:00:57.530> our<00:00:58.280> idea<00:00:59.120> will<00:00:59.300> be<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.649> bring

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
line here our idea will be to bring

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.579 
line here our idea will be to bring
these<00:01:00.859> two<00:01:01.219> together<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:03.019> way<00:01:03.140> we're<00:01:03.319> doing

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
these two together the way we're doing

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.079 
these two together the way we're doing
already<00:01:03.979> now<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.519> can<00:01:04.670> go<00:01:04.790> either<00:01:04.970> direction

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
already now you can go either direction

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.480 
already now you can go either direction
either<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:06.260> way<00:01:06.500> or<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.920> way<00:01:06.979> on<00:01:07.370> your

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
either that way or that way on your

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.820 
either that way or that way on your
horizontals<00:01:08.060> some<00:01:08.659> people<00:01:08.930> like<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.110> switch

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
horizontals some people like to switch

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.670 
horizontals some people like to switch
direction<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:10.670> every<00:01:11.600> circuit<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:12.439> once<00:01:12.560> you

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
direction on every circuit and once you

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.899 
direction on every circuit and once you
get<00:01:12.799> all<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:12.979> way<00:01:13.100> around<00:01:13.219> the<00:01:13.460> drum<00:01:13.700> they

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
get all the way around the drum they

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.999 
get all the way around the drum they
like<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.270> go<00:01:14.780> back<00:01:14.990> or<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:15.560> can<00:01:15.710> just<00:01:15.829> keep

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
like to go back or you can just keep

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.190 
like to go back or you can just keep
going<00:01:16.250> around<00:01:16.399> in<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.759> spiral<00:01:17.030> fashion<00:01:17.390> going

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
going around in a spiral fashion going

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.120 
going around in a spiral fashion going
up<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.100> drum<00:01:19.310> head<00:01:19.600> either<00:01:20.600> gets<00:01:20.930> tighter<00:01:21.200> as

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
up the drum head either gets tighter as

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.779 
up the drum head either gets tighter as
you<00:01:22.310> can<00:01:22.460> see<00:01:22.670> I'm<00:01:22.969> getting<00:01:23.420> near<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.780> top<00:01:23.990> of

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
you can see I'm getting near the top of

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.550 
you can see I'm getting near the top of
what's<00:01:25.789> practical<00:01:26.750> for<00:01:26.960> tightening<00:01:27.380> this

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
what's practical for tightening this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.410 
what's practical for tightening this
drum<00:01:27.860> because<00:01:28.009> I've<00:01:28.280> only<00:01:28.430> got<00:01:28.670> room<00:01:28.850> for<00:01:29.060> this

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
drum because I've only got room for this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.249 
drum because I've only got room for this
last<00:01:29.829> horizontal<00:01:30.829> here<00:01:31.070> but<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.990> enough

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
last horizontal here but it's enough

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.539 
last horizontal here but it's enough
room<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.560> show<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.640> couple<00:01:35.329> knots<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:36.549> how

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
room to show you a couple knots and how

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.349 
room to show you a couple knots and how
to<00:01:37.609> do<00:01:37.820> it<00:01:37.969> it's<00:01:38.479> quite<00:01:38.719> simple

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
to do it it's quite simple

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:45.670 
to do it it's quite simple
basically<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:42.380> take<00:01:42.859> this<00:01:44.049> free<00:01:45.049> cord<00:01:45.380> from

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
basically you take this free cord from

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.149 
basically you take this free cord from
your<00:01:45.859> last<00:01:46.009> knot<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:48.560> start<00:01:48.859> by<00:01:48.979> going

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
your last knot and you start by going

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.480 
your last knot and you start by going
across<00:01:49.850> these<00:01:50.840> next<00:01:51.289> two<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:51.979> identify

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
across these next two that you identify

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.450 
across these next two that you identify
here<00:01:53.649> go<00:01:54.649> across<00:01:54.950> them

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.450 

and<00:02:01.460> then<00:02:02.299> when<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.929> come<00:02:03.109> back<00:02:03.289> under<00:02:03.619> you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
and then when you come back under you

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.789 
and then when you come back under you
come<00:02:04.670> under<00:02:05.030> only<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.869> last<00:02:06.079> one<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.619> then

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
come under only the last one and then

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.470 
come under only the last one and then
over<00:02:07.789> again<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.569> over<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.200> going<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.039> way

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
over again so over to going that way

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.440 
over again so over to going that way
under<00:02:11.480> one<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.440> then<00:02:12.830> over<00:02:13.250> one<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:14.150> then

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
under one and then over one and then

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:27.880 
under one and then over one and then
pull<00:02:14.599> it<00:02:14.720> through<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:24.230> see<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.790> now<00:02:26.890> to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
pull it through you see that now to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.780 
pull it through you see that now to
finish<00:02:28.280> we<00:02:29.209> just<00:02:29.450> need<00:02:29.629> to<00:02:29.750> go<00:02:29.870> under<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:31.519> same

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
finish we just need to go under the same

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:43.059 
finish we just need to go under the same
two<00:02:32.060> again<00:02:32.390> going<00:02:32.840> forward<00:02:33.200> over<00:02:41.049> two<00:02:42.069> back

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
two again going forward over two back

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.449 
two again going forward over two back
under<00:02:43.819> one<00:02:44.090> over<00:02:44.510> one<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.989> then<00:02:45.769> back<00:02:46.040> forward

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
under one over one and then back forward

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.920 
under one over one and then back forward
again<00:02:47.170> under<00:02:48.170> two<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:52.760> we're<00:02:53.359> ready<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.660> pull

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
again under two and we're ready to pull

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.089 
again under two and we're ready to pull
it<00:02:54.049> tight<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:58.180> now<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.239> want<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.540> keep

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
it tight for that now you want to keep

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.430 
it tight for that now you want to keep
keep<00:03:01.099> it<00:03:01.250> snug<00:03:02.000> down<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.660> last<00:03:02.870> row<00:03:03.230> as

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
keep it snug down to the last row as

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.110 
keep it snug down to the last row as
much<00:03:03.650> as<00:03:03.799> possible<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.489> can<00:03:04.609> have<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.819> kind

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
much as possible so you can have to kind

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.780 
much as possible so you can have to kind
of<00:03:05.150> pull<00:03:05.359> that<00:03:06.290> direction<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:07.040> down<00:03:07.459> at<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
of pull that direction and down at the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.289 
of pull that direction and down at the
same<00:03:08.000> time<00:03:08.269> with<00:03:09.049> you're<00:03:09.170> pulling<00:03:09.560> tension

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
same time with you're pulling tension

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.370 
same time with you're pulling tension
now<00:03:11.299> I'll<00:03:11.450> show<00:03:11.599> you<00:03:11.630> how<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.840> wrap<00:03:12.109> that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
now I'll show you how to wrap that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.339 
now I'll show you how to wrap that
string<00:03:13.310> around<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.940> stick<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.079> even<00:03:15.200> be

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
string around a stick and it can even be

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.949 
string around a stick and it can even be
a<00:03:15.470> simple<00:03:16.060> drum<00:03:17.060> stick<00:03:18.940> like<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.209> not<00:03:20.720> very

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
a simple drum stick like so not very

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.349 
a simple drum stick like so not very
thick<00:03:21.200> but<00:03:21.700> when<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.819> wrap<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.030> you'll<00:03:23.329> want

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
thick but when you wrap it you'll want

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.839 
thick but when you wrap it you'll want
to<00:03:23.540> hold<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:23.989> both<00:03:24.370> both<00:03:25.370> sides<00:03:25.669> around

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
to hold it on both both sides around

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.370 
to hold it on both both sides around
where<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.299> cord<00:03:26.540> wraps<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.049> that<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.260> can

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
where the cord wraps so that you can

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.720 
where the cord wraps so that you can
give<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.680> good<00:03:27.799> pull<00:03:28.040> without<00:03:28.160> breaking<00:03:28.639> the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
give it a good pull without breaking the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.349 
give it a good pull without breaking the
stick<00:03:29.650> okay<00:03:30.650> we'll<00:03:30.829> cover<00:03:30.980> that<00:03:31.480> right<00:03:32.480> now

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
stick okay we'll cover that right now

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.900 
stick okay we'll cover that right now
okay<00:03:35.359> here<00:03:35.569> we<00:03:35.660> go<00:03:36.130> ready<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.220> wrap<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.669> cord

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
okay here we go ready to wrap the cord

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.879 
okay here we go ready to wrap the cord
around<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.239> stick<00:03:40.060> go<00:03:41.060> like<00:03:41.389> that<00:03:41.859> do<00:03:42.859> a

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
around the stick go like that do a

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.870 
around the stick go like that do a
little<00:03:43.099> twist<00:03:43.370> in<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:43.730> loop<00:03:45.609> same<00:03:46.609> thing

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
little twist in the loop same thing

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.550 
little twist in the loop same thing
again<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.239> little<00:03:47.630> twist<00:03:47.930> in<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.230> loop<00:03:48.410> and

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
again a little twist in the loop and

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.849 
again a little twist in the loop and
you've<00:03:48.709> got<00:03:48.859> a<00:03:48.889> double<00:03:49.130> loop<00:03:50.470> make<00:03:51.470> it<00:03:51.590> snug

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
you've got a double loop make it snug

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.229 
you've got a double loop make it snug
and<00:03:52.130> now<00:03:52.190> you've<00:03:52.400> got<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:52.549> good<00:03:52.790> grip<00:03:53.000> for

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
and now you've got a good grip for

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.240 
and now you've got a good grip for
pulling<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:54.680> then<00:03:56.500> setup<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:57.980> with

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
pulling and then setup like this with

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.759 
pulling and then setup like this with
your<00:03:58.370> feet<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.910> get<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.150> leverage<00:03:59.480> because

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
your feet to get the leverage because

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.460 
your feet to get the leverage because
especially<00:04:00.769> at<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:00.980> top<00:04:01.190> here<00:04:01.720> yes<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.079> it's

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
especially at the top here yes so it's

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.619 
especially at the top here yes so it's
going<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:03.799> tight<00:04:04.129> pull<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:06.129> embrace<00:04:07.129> it

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
going to be a tight pull so embrace it

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:19.379 
going to be a tight pull so embrace it
and<00:04:09.629> then<00:04:09.930> get<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.170> bit<00:04:10.379> pull<00:04:17.239> there

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
and then get a bit pull there

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.100 
and then get a bit pull there
now<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.379> advantage<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:21.569> there's<00:04:22.569> two<00:04:22.750> ways<00:04:22.930> to

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
now the advantage of there's two ways to

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.809 
now the advantage of there's two ways to
do<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.379> Molly<00:04:23.560> we've<00:04:23.830> not<00:04:24.129> there's<00:04:24.460> going

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:24.819 
do the Molly we've not there's going

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.270 
do the Molly we've not there's going
starting<00:04:25.599> by<00:04:25.719> going<00:04:25.930> over<00:04:26.409> these<00:04:26.560> two<00:04:26.979> and

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
starting by going over these two and

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.580 
starting by going over these two and
then<00:04:27.879> weaving<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.509> then<00:04:28.659> finishing<00:04:29.229> under

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
then weaving and then finishing under

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.830 
then weaving and then finishing under
and<00:04:30.460> that's<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.729> way<00:04:30.849> we<00:04:31.030> did<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.300> now<00:04:31.449> and<00:04:31.750> the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
and that's the way we did it now and the

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.730 
and that's the way we did it now and the
result<00:04:32.199> is<00:04:32.460> you<00:04:33.460> get<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.610> self-locking<00:04:34.150> not

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
result is you get a self-locking not

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.249 
result is you get a self-locking not
you're<00:04:35.740> good<00:04:35.889> to<00:04:36.039> go<00:04:36.479> the<00:04:37.479> other<00:04:37.569> way<00:04:37.689> some

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
you're good to go the other way some

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.689 
you're good to go the other way some
people<00:04:38.500> like<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:38.650> do<00:04:38.860> is<00:04:39.039> start<00:04:39.280> they're<00:04:39.460> going

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
people like to do is start they're going

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.110 
people like to do is start they're going
under<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.949> then<00:04:41.949> weave<00:04:42.250> and<00:04:42.580> then<00:04:42.699> end<00:04:42.969> up

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
under and then weave and then end up

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.179 
under and then weave and then end up
going<00:04:43.330> over<00:04:43.479> but<00:04:43.870> that's<00:04:43.990> not<00:04:44.289> as<00:04:44.469> secure<00:04:44.860> so

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:45.189 
going over but that's not as secure so

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.779 
going over but that's not as secure so
do<00:04:46.000> it<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:46.240> way<00:04:46.770> begin<00:04:47.770> by<00:04:48.099> going<00:04:48.219> over<00:04:48.520> the

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
do it this way begin by going over the

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.809 
do it this way begin by going over the
next<00:04:48.969> two<00:04:49.210> weave<00:04:50.199> and<00:04:50.530> finish<00:04:50.919> under<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.639> then

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
next two weave and finish under and then

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.939 
next two weave and finish under and then
pull<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.120> like<00:04:52.240> we've<00:04:52.389> just<00:04:52.599> done<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.830> we're

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
pull it like we've just done and we're

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.069 
pull it like we've just done and we're
done
