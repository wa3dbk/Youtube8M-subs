00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hey guys 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 sorry for the recent absence though 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.150
 I got caught and I'm sick 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.179
 become 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.529
 meanwhile it's a little bit more 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.609
 that's why it just happens in the year 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.970
 this video 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.740
 we start exactly where we last 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 have stopped once with the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.630
 halo escalation comic direct holds 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.859
 john ensign clown is just about to be there 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 crush the skull 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.800
 Of course , he agrees to chat 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.550
 him and john are team blue against 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.020
 threw 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 kelly can get to the side in time 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.079
 jump and hit the director's cut a 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.000
 shot linda just does the same thing 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.340
 seconds later disarmed next to it 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.289
 be and unfortunately noted finally that 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.020
 he is actually totally superior 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 then, however, steadily carolyn emerges 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.190
 this illuminate again on itself 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.039
 indirectly out of action and teleported 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.530
 they go away into the control room 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.619
 Halo what the only option was 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.840
 to safely lock him away, so to speak 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.310
 John noticed that the tanks and the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
 deideck of the attacks with 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.630
 withstand conventional weapons or 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 better fits himself now he has 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 but another plan that just 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 should prevent and that meet the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.880
 Both then in the control room on each other 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.860
 and swap a little trivial 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.570
 chatter out of the situation 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 obviously somehow make epic 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.979
 but well and it definitely works 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.650
 on it from that john activate the ring 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.390
 of course, the direct reacts totally 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.950
 perplexed because it somehow everything and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.530
 everyone in a huge radius 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.869
 wipe out particles in and john 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.090
 but unfortunately have found a solution 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.530
 it consists of two steps, so to speak 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.509
 namely first the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.399
 disable security logs and 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.079
 then the illuminates part of the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.000
 Halo and let him directly into the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.119
 planets race as a small part of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.219
 the ring is split off so to speak the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.229
 said the fragment has rattled on 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.020
 the planet search meets directly in 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.149
 this forge the producer where the six 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.189
 However, other producers were placed 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.840
 many people now assume that because 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.310
 is directly sizzled by it and now 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.229
 is actually dead 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.730
 but what I would be a little weird 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.650
 because she's extra in the comics 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.780
 retrieve and then kill again 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.709
 well, so strange again in 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.800
 quotation marks 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.660
 this looks more to me than his 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.310
 generator wave, so to speak, exactly that 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.950
 what about the researchers on the over yet 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.180
 station happened in halo 4 but we 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.569
 know that the way actually 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.360
 but he can not be affected 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.790
 Never has anything like I am immune to 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.410
 used the producer but somehow 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.849
 only it does not work in my current one 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.280
 form or something 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.680
 he then direct the other way from the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.600
 sonja also has a librarian 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.900
 something like that and that is a certain 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.080
 immunity she actually has immune 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.209
 but said john wo who still of it 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.819
 affected 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.410
 So he considered but it was well 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.880
 his tracks on him, so to speak 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 is left and probably 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.860
 right now with the direct happened 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.840
 he is actually in promethean now 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.430
 so to speak has been converted into 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.840
 I can not help you with his robot form 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.000
 say because it did not actually stay 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.070
 it is possible 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.760
 Well, some people claim as I said 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.220
 he is dead 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.720
 I'm not sure seti caroline 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.760
 Anyway, John could do it again 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.220
 in time out of the control room 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.590
 teleport before this all up well 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.569
 has gone to ground and he says that 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.810
 Now with the repair work on the ring 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.140
 I wanna hear something like that 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.640
 ark no matter 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.440
 At least 72 hours later at the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.480
 Final discussion then with loud ford 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.970
 get jon m command worth 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.620
 relax so to speak he ignores him 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.209
 but completely and as his team after 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.470
 asks where is the next time? 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.019
 he goes, he says 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.519
 wherever we are needed 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.560
 comic ends with a conversation 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.060
 agent between two unknown mnd 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.250
 and the sentences 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.709
 he can not do that forever 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.630
 yes, but if he destroys himself 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.310
 we who will stop him 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.870
 So there is obviously no bock 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.180
 on vacation and somehow wants to continue 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.459
 we do not stop fighting 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.190
 if that is now used as a reason to 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.710
 then agent login halo five introduce 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.940
 or him a little before that 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.860
 I can not tell you exactly 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.260
 maybe somehow kick deeper 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.170
 and does not want retirement 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.790
 accept what do you keep from that 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.680
 Let's have your opinions and theories in 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.190
 the comments there and see you in the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.190
 next video
