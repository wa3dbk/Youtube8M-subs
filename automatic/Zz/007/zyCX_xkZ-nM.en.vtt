 Hi friends, how else are they once? 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.590
 more to the channel where we all learn to 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.390
 transform our dream soccer and xxi and 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.990
 well I bring you an excellent and where 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.490
 let's do a spectacular series of 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.410
 flat chest and what we're going to do is 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.030
 what are we going to do, let's start 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.500
 work in pyramidal form and then what 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.420
 what are we going to do is a track set or 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.369
 let's do a download first let's go 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.230
 to start with 50 pounds obviously already 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.060
 I have all the hot chest we must 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.060
 warm up the chest let's do 10 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.220
 repetitions with 50 pounds today I from 6 to 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.109
 8 reps with 75 pounds and 2 to 4 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.659
 repetitions with 100 pounds and after 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.649
 let's make a progressive download and 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.600
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.760
 finish with the maximum repetitions 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.199
 that we can this exercise and this routine 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.030
 I did it with my friend Freddy Mendoza 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.039
 obviously a person who intermediates 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.179
 still has not advanced and they will see that 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.249
 this routine costs a lot 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.019
 obviously the same as me but 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.459
 obviously if they see that suddenly he does not 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.199
 achieves to do all the repetitions and 

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:56.539
 reaches to lift the same one weight that 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.519
 they are because obviously project 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.129
 it still needs much more to improve and 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.600
 much more to get an advanced level 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.610
 Well what I want to tell you is that this 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.110
 exercise is spectacular what we are going to 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.820
 to do is that we are going to pump the biggest 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 amount of muscle blood and oxygen 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.600
 to make it grow in a way 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.030
 efficient what we are going to do is that 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 It shows limiting our body to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.260
 have better results and we are going to 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.150
 enter very strong as I am 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.010
 saying I'm training too much 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.600
 I'm training with a strong 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.070
 combination of exercises that you 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.450
 they will have to hand in all 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.520
 series build your chest 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.080

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.790

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.290

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.510

 December, I always give my best and 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.400
 you can already tell in the weight if they see that I can 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.690
 doing 100 pounds before was a weight that 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.970
 can not dominate was always 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.940

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.980
 I can already do up to 115 pounds is 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.830
 say with two cakes of 45 on each side 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.330
 and with a 25 and I feel very comfortable and I 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.950
