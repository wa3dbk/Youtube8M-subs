skills now it does look like from time
to<00:00:16.379> time<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.680> skills<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.130> will<00:00:17.580> jump<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.150> size

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
to time the skills we will jump in size

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.779 
to time the skills we will jump in size
i'm<00:00:18.930> not<00:00:19.109> sure<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.160> idea<00:00:20.400> behind<00:00:20.580> this

right here the new wormhole effect look
that<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.099> definitely<00:00:26.849> pretty<00:00:27.150> cool<00:00:27.740> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
dangerous this obviously ac3 wormhole it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.990 
dangerous this obviously ac3 wormhole it
is<00:00:34.860> very<00:00:35.480> whitish<00:00:36.480> background<00:00:37.290> glow<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.000> that

show this this new wormhole effect to
you<00:00:49.649> guys<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.489> also<00:00:50.789> quickly<00:00:51.300> go<00:00:51.600> over<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
hear about the server feedback and then

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
hear about the server feedback and then
we<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.559> Oceanus<00:00:59.190> graphics<00:00:59.940> feedback<00:01:01.879> so

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
we have Oceanus graphics feedback so

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
we have Oceanus graphics feedback so
here<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.570> pretty<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.080> same<00:01:04.260> thing

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
here we see pretty much the same thing

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.000 
here we see pretty much the same thing
except<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.390> probably<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.689> c-54s<00:01:07.380> c6

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
except this is probably like I c-54s c6

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.730 
except this is probably like I c-54s c6
but<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.880> seem<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.450> similar<00:01:09.780> swirls<00:01:10.439> here

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
but you seem to get similar swirls here

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.450 
but you seem to get similar swirls here
very<00:01:10.979> very<00:01:11.310> light<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.270> whitish<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:14.100> hope

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
very very light and whitish so I do hope

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.070 
very very light and whitish so I do hope
that<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.909> will<00:01:15.060> actually<00:01:15.240> change<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.960> little

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
that this will actually change a little

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.240 
that this will actually change a little
bit<00:01:16.229> depending<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:18.390> type<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> wormhole

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
bit depending on the type of wormhole

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.120 
bit depending on the type of wormhole
but<00:01:20.250> underneath<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
but underneath here we have a bit of

people might like a more smooth affect
the<00:01:43.020> new<00:01:43.170> wormhole<00:01:43.439> effects<00:01:43.890> obviously

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the new wormhole effects obviously

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.219 
the new wormhole effects obviously
you're<00:01:44.820> seeing<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:45.990> oh<00:01:46.020> it

you're seeing that right here oh it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.990 
you're seeing that right here oh it
looks<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.710> impressive<00:01:47.340> even<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.970> far

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
looks pretty impressive even from far

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.380 
looks pretty impressive even from far
away<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:49.320> does<00:01:49.590> give<00:01:49.860> almost<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.000> more<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
away and does give almost a bit more of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.510 
away and does give almost a bit more of
a<00:01:51.780> massive<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.829> ominous<00:01:53.490> look<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:55.020> opinion

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
a massive and ominous look in my opinion

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.980 
a massive and ominous look in my opinion
but<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.360> more<00:01:57.390> interesting

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
but here we go the more interesting

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.440 
but here we go the more interesting
stuff<00:01:58.200> should<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.590> new<00:01:58.979> Elodie<00:01:59.820> system

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
stuff should be a new Elodie system

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.780 
stuff should be a new Elodie system
instead<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.140> seeing<00:02:01.380> ships<00:02:01.710> pop<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
instead of seeing ships pop in at the

we've<00:02:34.420> had<00:02:34.629> to<00:02:34.989> do<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.140> few<00:02:35.440> minor<00:02:35.709> updates<00:02:36.549> to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
we've had to do a few minor updates to

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.160 
we've had to do a few minor updates to
certain<00:02:37.090> ships<00:02:37.299> but<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.690> system<00:02:38.019> will

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
certain ships but this system will

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.559 
certain ships but this system will
create<00:02:38.620> uniformity<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.610> general<00:02:40.060> across

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
create uniformity in general across

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.199 
create uniformity in general across
factions<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.730> significantly<00:02:42.730> increase

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
factions and significantly increase

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.930 
factions and significantly increase
flexibility<00:02:44.079> for<00:02:44.769> adding<00:02:45.190> anything<00:02:45.489> that

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
flexibility for adding anything that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.470 
flexibility for adding anything that
affects<00:02:46.209> ship<00:02:46.690> aesthetically<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:47.950> that's

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
affects ship aesthetically so that's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.920 
affects ship aesthetically so that's
obviously<00:02:49.480> like<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.140> groundwork<00:02:50.799> for

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
obviously like the groundwork for

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.589 
obviously like the groundwork for
different<00:02:52.930> types<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.440> skins<00:02:53.859> that<00:02:54.579> will<00:02:54.910> not

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
different types of skins that will not

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.399 
different types of skins that will not
necessarily<00:02:55.840> need<00:02:56.970> an<00:02:57.970> entire<00:02:58.569> new<00:02:58.870> entry<00:02:59.379> a

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
necessarily need an entire new entry a

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.849 
necessarily need an entire new entry a
new<00:02:59.739> class<00:03:00.159> basically<00:03:00.879> of<00:03:01.180> ships<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.780> new<00:03:02.530> type

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
new class basically of ships a new type

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.940 
new class basically of ships a new type
of<00:03:03.069> ship<00:03:03.400> right<00:03:03.760> there<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.269> market<00:03:04.950> if

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
of ship right there in the market if

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.289 
of ship right there in the market if
this<00:03:06.730> does<00:03:07.000> indeed<00:03:07.299> allow<00:03:07.750> for<00:03:08.409> more

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
this does indeed allow for more

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.699 
this does indeed allow for more
graphical<00:03:10.299> options<00:03:10.510> when<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.019> comes<00:03:11.170> to

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
graphical options when it comes to

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.789 
graphical options when it comes to
displaying<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.819> certain<00:03:13.359> type<00:03:13.629> of<00:03:13.659> ship<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:14.290> can

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
displaying a certain type of ship I can

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.159 
displaying a certain type of ship I can
imagine<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.280> they<00:03:15.640> could<00:03:16.000> actually<00:03:16.329> with

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
imagine that they could actually with

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.650 
imagine that they could actually with
the<00:03:17.260> system<00:03:17.650> like<00:03:17.889> that<00:03:18.269> go<00:03:19.269> for<00:03:19.510> like

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
the system like that go for like

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.110 
the system like that go for like
something<00:03:20.530> called<00:03:20.680> an<00:03:20.859> alliance<00:03:21.160> skin<00:03:21.669> which

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
something called an alliance skin which

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.949 
something called an alliance skin which
can<00:03:22.359> be<00:03:22.840> customized<00:03:23.620> by<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:25.150> Alliance<00:03:25.419> holder

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
can be customized by the Alliance holder

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.470 
can be customized by the Alliance holder
themselves<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:27.430> thus<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.910> can<00:03:27.940> get

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
themselves and thus you can get

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.170 
themselves and thus you can get
different<00:03:29.109> types<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:31.450> ships<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:33.400> on<00:03:34.000> the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
different types of of ships just on the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.349 
different types of of ships just on the
skin<00:03:34.540> type<00:03:34.980> but<00:03:35.980> just<00:03:36.250> without<00:03:36.730> needing<00:03:37.239> to

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
skin type but just without needing to

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.150 
skin type but just without needing to
have<00:03:37.480> all<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.840> these<00:03:38.319> different<00:03:38.530> types<00:03:38.950> in

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
have all of these different types in

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.240 
have all of these different types in
individual<00:03:39.989> names<00:03:40.989> like<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.590> alley<00:03:41.769> Astra

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
individual names like the alley Astra

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.280 
individual names like the alley Astra
addition<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:42.879> khador<00:03:43.329> addition<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.019> all<00:03:44.139> of

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
addition the khador addition and all of

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.319 
addition the khador addition and all of
that<00:03:44.639> instead<00:03:45.639> you<00:03:45.760> could<00:03:45.970> have<00:03:46.120> something

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
that instead you could have something

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.390 
that instead you could have something
like<00:03:46.449> an<00:03:46.720> alliance<00:03:47.019> edition<00:03:47.680> which<00:03:48.160> could

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
like an alliance edition which could

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.460 
like an alliance edition which could
then<00:03:48.430> be<00:03:48.609> anything<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:49.480> an<00:03:49.780> alliance<00:03:50.079> can

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
then be anything that an alliance can

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.289 
then be anything that an alliance can
come<00:03:50.949> up<00:03:51.099> with<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.669> system<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.150> we've

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
come up with in the system that we've

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.650 
come up with in the system that we've
seen<00:03:52.569> in<00:03:53.410> faction<00:03:53.799> warfare<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.340> it's<00:03:54.459> actually

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
seen in faction warfare so it's actually

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.059 
seen in faction warfare so it's actually
looking<00:03:55.660> like<00:03:55.690> oceanis<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.590> going<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:56.949> be

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
looking like oceanis is going to be

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.330 
looking like oceanis is going to be
quite<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:57.970> nice<00:03:58.180> graphical<00:03:58.810> upgrade<00:03:59.160> but<00:04:00.160> not

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
quite a nice graphical upgrade but not

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.210 
quite a nice graphical upgrade but not
only<00:04:00.669> will<00:04:00.940> we<00:04:00.970> get<00:04:01.299> this<00:04:02.109> awesome<00:04:02.349> wormhole

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
only will we get this awesome wormhole

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.789 
only will we get this awesome wormhole
effects<00:04:03.879> and<00:04:04.030> cloaking<00:04:04.690> effects<00:04:05.199> it<00:04:05.440> also

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
effects and cloaking effects it also

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.099 
effects and cloaking effects it also
looks<00:04:06.099> like<00:04:06.250> they're<00:04:06.549> really<00:04:06.730> working<00:04:07.060> on<00:04:07.359> on

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
looks like they're really working on on

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.319 
looks like they're really working on on
laying<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.650> groundwork<00:04:09.099> for<00:04:09.489> further

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
laying the groundwork for further

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.920 
laying the groundwork for further
innovations<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.639> if<00:04:12.639> we<00:04:13.180> have<00:04:13.389> to<00:04:13.569> guess<00:04:13.750> of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
innovations and if we have to guess of

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.710 
innovations and if we have to guess of
course<00:04:14.199> i'd<00:04:14.410> say<00:04:14.680> it's<00:04:14.859> probably<00:04:15.010> about<00:04:15.720> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
course i'd say it's probably about the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.229 
course i'd say it's probably about the
ship<00:04:16.930> skins<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:18.099> that<00:04:18.250> people<00:04:18.579> can<00:04:18.789> actually

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
ship skins so that people can actually

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.440 
ship skins so that people can actually
create<00:04:19.720> their<00:04:20.380> own<00:04:20.409> alliance<00:04:21.280> skins<00:04:21.969> and<00:04:22.270> then

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
create their own alliance skins and then

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.480 
create their own alliance skins and then
fly<00:04:22.930> their<00:04:23.169> colors<00:04:23.590> with<00:04:23.830> bright<00:04:24.099> i<00:04:24.130> think

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
fly their colors with bright i think

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.920 
fly their colors with bright i think
that's<00:04:24.640> pretty<00:04:24.880> awesome

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
that's pretty awesome

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.629 
that's pretty awesome
and<00:04:26.050> yeah<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.919> another<00:04:27.190> step<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.580> the

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
and yeah it's a another step in the

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.999 
and yeah it's a another step in the
right<00:04:27.850> direction<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:28.479> my<00:04:28.570> opinion<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.229> just

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
right direction in my opinion I just

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.529 
right direction in my opinion I just
show<00:04:30.190> how<00:04:30.400> CCP<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:31.090> constantly<00:04:31.780> trying<00:04:32.770> to

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
show how CCP is constantly trying to

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.210 
show how CCP is constantly trying to
upgrade<00:04:34.539> the<00:04:35.229> engine<00:04:35.620> upgrade<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.190> graphics

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
upgrade the engine upgrade the graphics

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.350 
upgrade the engine upgrade the graphics
and<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:37.360> keep<00:04:37.720> eve<00:04:37.960> online<00:04:38.139> at<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.620> forefront

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
and and keep eve online at the forefront

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.150 
and and keep eve online at the forefront
at<00:04:40.360> least<00:04:40.630> graphics<00:04:41.350> wise<00:04:41.530> i<00:04:41.560> think<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.009> game

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
at least graphics wise i think the game

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.670 
at least graphics wise i think the game
still<00:04:42.400> looks<00:04:42.460> gorgeous<00:04:43.139> especially<00:04:44.139> if<00:04:44.500> you

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
still looks gorgeous especially if you

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.260 
still looks gorgeous especially if you
think<00:04:45.039> about<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.340> fact<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.550> they<00:04:45.850> existed

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
think about the fact that they existed

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.659 
think about the fact that they existed
for<00:04:46.539> 10<00:04:46.840> years<00:04:47.199> and<00:04:47.380> with<00:04:48.009> these<00:04:48.160> constant

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
for 10 years and with these constant

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.340 
for 10 years and with these constant
upgrades<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.360> their<00:04:49.630> work<00:04:49.870> towards

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
upgrades and their work towards

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.830 
upgrades and their work towards
flexibility<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.370> think<00:04:52.120> it's<00:04:52.240> heading<00:04:52.479> in<00:04:52.690> the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
flexibility I think it's heading in the

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.570 
flexibility I think it's heading in the
right<00:04:52.990> direction<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.770> yeah<00:04:53.919> that's<00:04:54.430> what<00:04:54.550> I

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
right direction so yeah that's what I

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
right direction so yeah that's what I
wanted<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:54.910> share<00:04:55.060> with<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.360> guys<00:04:55.389> the
