00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
vintage sound it is a bright sound but

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.219 
vintage sound it is a bright sound but
the<00:05:04.080> neck<00:05:04.260> just<00:05:04.770> feels<00:05:05.190> fantastic<00:05:06.180> it's<00:05:07.080> just

I think then the fender jazz basses and

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.530 
I think then the fender jazz basses and
it's<00:05:16.980> a<00:05:17.040> little<00:05:17.250> bit<00:05:17.370> heavier<00:05:17.670> but<00:05:18.300> it's<00:05:18.420> not
