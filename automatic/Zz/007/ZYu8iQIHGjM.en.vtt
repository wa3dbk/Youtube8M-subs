00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.379
 we're going to need pins to 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.380
 I would enjoy plastic hooks stories 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:15.379
 drop shape a loom a hook 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.390
 tweezers and colored gauze first 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.690
 we will place a pink ribbon in the shape of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.910
 infinite 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.840
 and then we will place a green league 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.180
 crusade with infinity shape 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.070
 now we will put a pink garter and then 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.980
 a green on top of the first leagues 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.050
 what we put 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.610
 with the hook we will remove the first 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.440
 league a rose that we put of the two 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.570
 sides 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.739
 and then we will remove the first league to 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.739
 green on both sides 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.500
 we will place another pink league and then a 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.050
 green 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.010
 so we will be placing leagues and removing 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.010
 the two previous leagues 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.620
 little by little it will take shape when 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.540
 we already have the length that we need 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.080
 let's place one of the hooks with 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.390
 letter form s at the beginning of the necklace 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.430
 on the other side we're going to remove from the loom 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.750
 the leagues carefully and we will place the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.750
 hook to close the necklace 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.830
 now we will pass one of the accounts with 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.810
 drop shape by the pin 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.700
 We will take the tip of the pin with the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.540
 tongs and we will fold it forming a 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.540
 kind of letter 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.860
 it will be like this 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.900
 we will continue making more pieces like this 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.640
 then we will look for the center of our 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.520
 necklace and there we will place the first 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.890
 piece in one of the leagues 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.619
 to fix it let's close the letter u 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.420
 that we form with the tweezers so we will go 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.350
 adding accounts until it is so 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.350
 full as you want 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.520
 and it will be ready our silence uses the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.050
 leagues colors that you like the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.810
 You can also find accounts in 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.250
 different sizes and combine them 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.110
