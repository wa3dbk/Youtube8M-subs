00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.880 
there another change they made that I
really<00:01:43.829> liked<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> settings<00:01:45.720> menu<00:01:45.890> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
really liked is in the settings menu it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.399 
really liked is in the settings menu it
seems<00:01:47.250> simple<00:01:47.640> enough<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.899> settings<00:01:49.259> on

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
seems simple enough but the settings on

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.460 
seems simple enough but the settings on
most<00:01:49.649> Android<00:01:50.159> phones<00:01:50.520> are<00:01:50.909> black<00:01:51.869> background

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
most Android phones are black background

white<00:01:52.799> texts<00:01:53.399> Huawei<00:01:54.119> has<00:01:54.149> reversed<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
white texts Huawei has reversed that and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.830 
white texts Huawei has reversed that and
I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.579> looks<00:01:56.729> much<00:01:56.880> better<00:01:57.090> i<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
I think it looks much better i like the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
I think it looks much better i like the
little<00:01:58.049> green<00:01:58.290> accents<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.009> they've<00:01:59.219> added

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
little green accents that they've added

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.639 
little green accents that they've added
and<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.689> much<00:02:00.869> easier<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.409> see

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
and this is just much easier to see

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.109 
and this is just much easier to see
especially<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.280> you're<00:02:02.430> outdoors<00:02:02.579> under

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
especially if you're outdoors under

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.100 
especially if you're outdoors under
bright<00:02:03.450> lights<00:02:03.829> it's<00:02:04.829> very<00:02:05.189> easy<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:06.110> flick

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
bright lights it's very easy to flick

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
bright lights it's very easy to flick
through<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.649> find<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.190> settings<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
through and find the settings that you

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.350 
through and find the settings that you
need

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.080 

so<00:02:12.360> all<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.900> all<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.620> Ascend<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.490> it's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so all in all I think the Ascend is it's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.730 
so all in all I think the Ascend is it's
not<00:02:15.209> a<00:02:15.270> great<00:02:15.569> phone<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.319> phone<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
not a great phone but it's a phone that

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.309 
not a great phone but it's a phone that
is<00:02:16.860> definitely<00:02:17.400> good<00:02:18.150> enough<00:02:18.390> there<00:02:19.050> weren't

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
is definitely good enough there weren't

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.910 
is definitely good enough there weren't
many<00:02:19.530> disappointments<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.760> device<00:02:21.090> I

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
many disappointments on this device I

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.500 
many disappointments on this device I
certainly<00:02:22.920> hated<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> camera<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.270> one

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.390 
certainly hated the camera this is one
of<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.660> worst<00:02:24.840> cameras<00:02:25.350> I've<00:02:25.530> seen<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
of the worst cameras I've seen on a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.479 
of the worst cameras I've seen on a
smartphone<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:28.020> uses<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.470> very<00:02:28.860> basic
