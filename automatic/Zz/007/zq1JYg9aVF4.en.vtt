00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.040 
he's a legend from a AC Milan and Roma
and<00:02:11.220> he<00:02:12.209> would<00:02:12.360> have

88<00:02:13.500> rating<00:02:14.130> maybe<00:02:14.370> even<00:02:14.610> more<00:02:14.820> about<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.570> is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
88 rating maybe even more about this is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.100 
88 rating maybe even more about this is
writing<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.410> think<00:02:16.650> he<00:02:16.830> should<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.160> getting<00:02:17.460> and
