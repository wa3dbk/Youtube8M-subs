with the modeling and acting all right

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.109 
with the modeling and acting all right
well<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.680> downtime<00:01:26.130> from<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> surgery<00:01:26.880> in

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
well the downtime from the surgery in

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.700 
well the downtime from the surgery in
terms<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.750> getting<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.409> looking

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
terms of just getting back to looking

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
terms of just getting back to looking
reasonably<00:01:29.400> presentable<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.119> probably<00:01:30.479> about

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
reasonably presentable is probably about

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.050 
reasonably presentable is probably about
two<00:01:31.020> weeks<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.950> takes<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.490> many<00:01:32.759> many

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
two weeks but it takes really many many

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.760 
two weeks but it takes really many many
