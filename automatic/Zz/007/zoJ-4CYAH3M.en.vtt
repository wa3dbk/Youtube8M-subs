to<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.050> mission<00:04:34.470> and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.610 

crews<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.670> I<00:04:38.930> had<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:39.960> do<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.230> whole<00:04:40.380> mission

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
crews so I had to do the whole mission

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.110 
crews so I had to do the whole mission
for<00:04:40.950> again<00:04:42.320> just<00:04:43.320> kind<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.530> sucks

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.839 

that's<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.360> ticket

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.749 

so<00:04:51.539> I'm<00:04:51.659> so<00:04:51.929> questioning<00:04:52.529> that<00:04:52.679> game<00:04:52.979> I<00:04:55.699> may<00:04:56.699> do

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
so I'm so questioning that game I may do

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.350 
so I'm so questioning that game I may do
it<00:04:57.119> but<00:04:57.779> a<00:04:57.809> later<00:04:58.169> point<00:04:58.699> just<00:04:59.699> record<00:05:00.149> all<00:05:00.240> the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
it but a later point just record all the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.350 
it but a later point just record all the
missions<00:05:00.689> at<00:05:00.899> different<00:05:01.289> times<00:05:01.529> and<00:05:05.270> once<00:05:06.270> I

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
missions at different times and once I

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.409 
missions at different times and once I
get<00:05:06.509> them<00:05:06.629> all<00:05:06.749> done<00:05:06.929> I'll<00:05:07.169> slap<00:05:07.740> him<00:05:07.889> up<00:05:11.419> you

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
get them all done I'll slap him up you

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:20.640 
get them all done I'll slap him up you
just<00:05:12.689> told<00:05:12.899> them<00:05:13.050> all<00:05:13.229> those<00:05:13.379> up<00:05:13.649> though

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.070 

I<00:05:20.740> know<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.550> last<00:05:21.759> machine<00:05:22.509> and<00:05:22.750> all<00:05:22.870> but

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
I know it's the last machine and all but

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.749 
I know it's the last machine and all but
I'm<00:05:23.259> not<00:05:23.530> exactly<00:05:23.889> sure<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.400> death<00:05:24.580> card<00:05:24.880> is<00:05:25.060> I

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
I'm not exactly sure the death card is I

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.029 
I'm not exactly sure the death card is I
think<00:05:27.759> it's<00:05:28.030> in<00:05:28.150> here<00:05:28.300> it<00:05:28.479> is<00:05:28.600> in<00:05:28.750> here<00:05:29.039> it's

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
think it's in here it is in here it's

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.350 
think it's in here it is in here it's
right<00:05:30.340> in<00:05:30.550> here<00:05:30.610> actually<00:05:31.889> I'm<00:05:32.889> like<00:05:33.360> I'm

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
right in here actually I'm like I'm

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.830 
right in here actually I'm like I'm
pretty<00:05:34.990> sure<00:05:35.199> it<00:05:35.320> is<00:05:35.440> action
