00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
but I see the clock also I do have an

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.749 
but I see the clock also I do have an
angle<00:05:36.690> kind<00:05:37.620> of<00:05:37.710> an<00:05:37.800> idea<00:05:38.099> what's<00:05:38.310> going<00:05:38.610> on

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
but it's just kind of the way the

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.439 
but it's just kind of the way the
offense<00:05:41.220> is<00:05:41.340> when<00:05:41.490> we<00:05:41.580> change<00:05:41.849> a<00:05:42.000> lot<00:05:42.090> of<00:05:42.240> plays

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
offense is when we change a lot of plays

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.779 
offense is when we change a lot of plays
and<00:05:42.479> I'll<00:05:43.110> change<00:05:43.530> plays<00:05:43.830> at<00:05:44.130> the<00:05:44.219> last<00:05:44.430> minute

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789
