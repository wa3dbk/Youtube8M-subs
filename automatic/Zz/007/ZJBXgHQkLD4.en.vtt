00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
yourself and in that way you're showing

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.349 
yourself and in that way you're showing
yourself<00:00:15.070> you<00:00:16.070> know<00:00:16.189> you're<00:00:16.340> giving<00:00:17.119> the

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
yourself you know you're giving the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.109 
yourself you know you're giving the
vision<00:00:17.689> of<00:00:17.779> what<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.140> wanted<00:00:18.439> to<00:00:18.590> be<00:00:18.740> seen<00:00:19.119> yes

vision of what you wanted to be seen yes

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.029 
vision of what you wanted to be seen yes
I<00:00:20.419> think<00:00:20.480> that's<00:00:20.749> really<00:00:21.199> a<00:00:21.349> good<00:00:21.619> way<00:00:21.769> of

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039 
I think that's really a good way of

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.609 
I think that's really a good way of
expressing<00:00:22.490> it<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:23.239> is<00:00:23.419> a<00:00:23.449> taking<00:00:24.019> back<00:00:24.259> in

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
expressing it it is a taking back in

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.999 
expressing it it is a taking back in
that<00:00:25.249> vulnerability<00:00:26.029> that<00:00:26.599> I<00:00:26.630> felt<00:00:27.050> 15<00:00:27.739> years

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
that vulnerability that I felt 15 years

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.929 
that vulnerability that I felt 15 years
ago<00:00:28.509> and<00:00:29.509> probably<00:00:30.079> not<00:00:30.919> really<00:00:31.460> being<00:00:31.699> able

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
ago and probably not really being able

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.780 
ago and probably not really being able
to<00:00:32.450> process<00:00:32.750> it<00:00:33.200> because<00:00:33.470> ultimately<00:00:34.280> in<00:00:34.700> the

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
to process it because ultimately in the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.150 
to process it because ultimately in the

foundation into the endowment and I

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.680 
foundation into the endowment and I
thought<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.479> appropriate<00:01:32.090> thing<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.420> with

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
thought the appropriate thing to do with

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.320 
thought the appropriate thing to do with
this<00:01:34.070> exhibition<00:01:35.070> since<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.940> directly

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
this exhibition since it was directly

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.570 
this exhibition since it was directly
related<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.080> experience<00:01:37.200> 15<00:01:38.039> years<00:01:38.399> ago

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
related to my experience 15 years ago

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.490 
related to my experience 15 years ago
when<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.090> went<00:01:39.300> public<00:01:39.420> actually<00:01:39.929> it<00:01:39.990> was<00:01:40.110> 16

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
when we went public actually it was 16

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
when we went public actually it was 16
years<00:01:40.710> ago<00:01:40.830> 15<00:01:41.310> years<00:01:41.340> ago<00:01:41.520> since<00:01:41.850> he<00:01:41.940> passed

years ago 15 years ago since he passed
away<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:43.250> felt<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> appropriate

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
away I felt that was the appropriate

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.460

vote<00:02:10.229> enough<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.680> support<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.400> she's<00:02:11.610> fine
