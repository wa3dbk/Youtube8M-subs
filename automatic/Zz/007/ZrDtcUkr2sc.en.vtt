 as last year with 11 8 billion 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.590
 Microsoft has in cooperation with 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.570
 Machine ma paid for surreptitious advertising 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.909
 Machine ma partner could get a video 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.189
 make the xbox by name 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.100

 Quite a lot there, yes, too, walk 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.460
 with adblock to be counted 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.990
 the second scandal was also 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.920
 surreptitious advertising and this time with 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.920
 battlefield 4 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.819

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.620

 for the only good about videos 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.120
 Battlefield 4 is said to have a list of 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.430
 ea what must be included in the video 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.760
 there are also still some are great 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.849
 youtuber like levelcap frankie on pc 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.340

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.170
 1000 click whole 10 dollars and was 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.719
 limited to a maximum of 20 million 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.159
 Apparently it could be steam 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.250
 soon a money back guarantee 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.349
 There are citizens at the new title 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.030
 a rebound button works though 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.219
 the soldiers are not yet 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.590
 until at least since what a clear indiz 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:49.349
 that's why threw something like that 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.449
 would like the federal office for security in 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.699
 the information technology has at the 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:55.349
 Examining a botnet 16 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.609
 million e mails with associated 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.500
 password found 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.150
 if the e mail addresses of one yourself 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.180
 You can easily get affected 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.310
 check with the security test punkt.de 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.469
 There simply have his e-mail addresses 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.449
 Enter if you get affected 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.370
 You send an e-mail when you are 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.629
 one is necessarily affected 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.790
 change the passwords 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.889
 Although it is only a rumor 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.720
 but apparently the data of the 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.709
 next nintendo console known 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.049
 become 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.849
 they are to be called in tent o fusion and 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.949
 there is once again in the ds version 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.729
 nintendo ds and once as normal 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.400
 console 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:32.909
 the console is supposed to be a ibm processor 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.819
 64 bit power pc processor have eight 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:40.169
 2 2 gigahertz per core 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:45.569
 ibm power pc co processor with 3 x 1 2 4 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:48.720
 4 GHz GB DDR2 ram and 2 GB DDR3 ram and 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:54.569
 as a graphics unit a box raiden hdr 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.239
 x200 with 2816 shaders 960 megahertz was 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.549
 4.6 teraflops gives you two and a half 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.769
 times as strong as the playstation 4 is 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.919
 Therefore, you can already imagine that the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.290
 eight cores and 4 gb ddr four ram for the 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:10.169
 these are the games and the three cores and 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:15.030
 the 2 gb ddr3 ram for the operating system 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:18.269
 The fusion ds should be called cdu a v8 cortex 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.380
 have a 53 and as gpu a box 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.760
 adreno 420 based by amd he should too 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.470
 again have two monitors with that 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:32.950
 160 x 640 touch screen and a maximum of 1 32 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.770
 gb large internal memory and 1 3300 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.020
 milliampere q2 10 is only dishes without 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.750
 any evidence but it could be something 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.310
 Thank you then thank me for it 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.000
 I hope that she has 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.830
 failed 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.620
 if yes gives the video a thumbs up 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.490
 if you want to load it up then 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.490
 to the next video
