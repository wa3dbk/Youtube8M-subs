00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
hi guys its me criticalcubing and today

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580 
hi guys its me criticalcubing and today
I<00:00:09.179> am<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.719> tell<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:09.900> how<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.380> become

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
I am going to tell you how to become

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.620 
I am going to tell you how to become
neutral<00:00:11.190> before<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.000> watch<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.420> video

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
neutral before you watch this video

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.990 
neutral before you watch this video
watch<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.440> previous<00:00:13.679> video<00:00:14.009> where<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.549> talk

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
watch my previous video where I talk

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.420 
watch my previous video where I talk
about<00:00:15.030> color<00:00:15.540> neutrality<00:00:16.230> its<00:00:16.470> advantages

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
about color neutrality its advantages

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.000 
about color neutrality its advantages
and<00:00:17.460> disadvantages<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.750> lots<00:00:19.020> more<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.830> link

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
and disadvantages and lots more the link

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.410 
and disadvantages and lots more the link
would<00:00:20.220> be<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> description<00:00:21.210> so

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
would be in the description so

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.900 
would be in the description so
neutrality<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.650> rocket<00:00:23.310> science<00:00:23.699> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
neutrality is not rocket science and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.089 
neutrality is not rocket science and
comes<00:00:24.180> naturally<00:00:24.810> with<00:00:24.930> practice<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.070> you

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
comes naturally with practice so you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.980 
comes naturally with practice so you
have<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.550> practice<00:00:26.820> four<00:00:27.300> different<00:00:27.660> colors

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
have to practice four different colors

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.710 
have to practice four different colors
and<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.710> used<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.359> simple

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and get used to them there is a simple

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.690 
and get used to them there is a simple
way<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.900> doing<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.560> very<00:00:31.980> easy<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.550> get

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
way of doing it and very easy to get

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.510 
way of doing it and very easy to get
used<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> disclaimer<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:35.219> because

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
used to and a disclaimer you can because

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520 
used to and a disclaimer you can because
only<00:00:35.640> true<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.180> less<00:00:36.420> than<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.870> month<00:00:37.170> but

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
only true in less than a month but

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
only true in less than a month but
getting<00:00:37.860> used<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.610> getting<00:00:39.149> good

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
getting used to it and getting good

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.350 
getting used to it and getting good
averages<00:00:40.050> takes<00:00:40.440> time<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.670> we<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
averages takes time so we are going to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.569 
averages takes time so we are going to
break<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.899> practice<00:00:43.379> session<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.860> two<00:00:43.980> days<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
break a practice session in two days and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.060 
break a practice session in two days and
we<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:45.149> follow<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.840> schedule<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.680> three

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
we will follow the schedule for three

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.569 
we will follow the schedule for three
weeks<00:00:47.489> at<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.750> end<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:50.070> will<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
weeks at the end of this you will get a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.360 
weeks at the end of this you will get a
grip<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.090> different<00:00:51.660> colors<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:53.039> just

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
grip of different colors and then just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
grip of different colors and then just
practice<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> perfect<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:54.899> color

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
practice and perfect your color

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.459 
practice and perfect your color
neutrality<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.340> am<00:00:57.149> assuming<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:58.079> current

cross<00:00:58.829> color<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> white<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.530> how<00:01:02.010> our

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
cross color is white so this is how our

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.170
