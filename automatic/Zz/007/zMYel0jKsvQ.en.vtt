00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.680
 Good day, skoyat ariston 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.139
 Today will tell you how to leave this scooter 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.610
 Chinese and Japanese 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.289
 dog, respectively , where do we begin 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.100
 blunt xenon connecting it to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.560
 the battery does not work as we 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.400
 just enough light for 40 minutes 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.189
 then we have a regular relay 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.390
 adjusting means what we do 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.570
 disassemble the engine from the side 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.660
 generator remove the rotor remove itself 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.110
 the generator on it comes three wires 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.110
 I will help 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 we connect accordingly regulating 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.649
 winding 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:58.699
 and that went to the light together there still 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.500
 there is such a nuance otpaivaem mass of 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.680
 the coil that went to the light and output 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.979
 a separate wire 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.439
 the yellow wire we remove quite well in 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.299
 Internet a lot of articles who are interested 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.110
 look read output wire 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.390
 separate from coil 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.750
 we go science around the scooter with this 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.590
 generator alteration is over 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 I put the next step of the relay controller 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.950
 Chinese roles of such a plan from 150 cubes 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.670
 pita ten 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.970
 put on a regular place under the oil yes 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.970
 as 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.509
 what was the result of the relay is insane 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.500
 heats up I do not know why because we 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.710
 Chinese bullshit plus heats up 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.960
 engine and exhaust pipe as a result of the relay 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:05.220
 just burn stayed sometime at night 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.099
 without light acquired 2 relays brought it under 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.120
 scooter key 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:15.470
 the effect is the same she also burned after 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.420
 all this decided to make a relay myself 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:24.120
 went to the radio parts store purchased 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:27.120
 parts came rubles 400 + back and forth 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.599
 on wires everything is generally like 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.130
 made here our relay 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:39.959
 radiator took from the system unit with 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.569
 CPU found a circuit on the Internet 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.530
 accordingly soldered but base 2 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.019
 odious bridge good 27 Mr 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.430
 which limit the output voltage 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:56.730
 from generator as voltage from 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.510
 generator so jumps from 6 to 80 volts 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.100
 at different engine speeds our relay 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.100
 it limits to 13 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:16.560
 means the following that I did here is our 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:19.090
 xenon ordinary car light 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.010
 Farid was using 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:30.800
 Already 7 cut edge 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:34.450
 put on four 300 kelvin mean so 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.580
 the whole wiring has been redone 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.840
 since pharo and I were fed by 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.150
 alternating current 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.640
 we turned it off and powered it off 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.050
 constant now what we get 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.209
 when turning the ignition key 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.010
 light up the size + starting 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.709
 the dresser is electrically which on 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.580
 the battery costs it all turns on 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.580
 now we will turn off 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:07.450
 The following used VAZ relay 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.450
 here we are 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.680
 so that the ignition unit does not burn our button 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.459
 since the voltage is a big button can 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.709
 can't stand 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.799
 everything is connected through the wheel and everything 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.000
 stands the button no punched 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.460
 left full-time 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.419
 in one position included any 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.419
 position off 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:37.330
 step well, actually all 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.330
 Testing our layout at the factory 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.869
 look at the output voltage 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.370
 rainbow 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.980
 manana showing 13 shaders 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.930
 one shilling we have a clean battery 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:23.110
 Now the 12 part is generally battery 12 and 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:25.600
 4 he has a constant voltage like this 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.120
 Here is our relay controller which works 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.880
 river battery yes you at night us not 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.880
 somewhere I lost one scooter 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.639
 turn on all but 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.820
 it not important light 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:07.200
 gathered at 43 sapper 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.200
 click to look at the testimony 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:14.470
 Well, that's all 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:14.470
 set up all the instructions good luck
