00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
not for everybody I'm assuming that the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.400 
not for everybody I'm assuming that the
first<00:03:11.670> benefit<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.820> this<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.270> that<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:14.290> know

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
first benefit of this is that you know

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.220 
first benefit of this is that you know
