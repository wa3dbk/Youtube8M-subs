 where I bet the polygon 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.139
 because there is a hole then 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.550

 mid-size prade show 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.639
 that the material is 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.240
 of the size yet the result is not 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.680
 satisfactory 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.759
 a CA 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.689
 it looks like its over 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.319
 so I will have to hit target center apply the material have to map 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.870
 map counter analysts 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.189
 good option option 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.189

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.360
 It's interesting but it can be better. 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.369
 It may be better I can fill myself 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.749
 no qg 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.330
 what stimulates this little square here 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.800
 It's a real picture to the mondo watched 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.039
 from the well 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.210
 modified 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.879
 this highway 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.349
 promise a more interesting state 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.830
 I left in length 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.830
 and the width of it 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.389
 these are the first procedures 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.039
 we will continue to remain so 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.150
 for now this
