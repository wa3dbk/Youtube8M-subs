00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
from a visual perspective I think there

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.560 
from a visual perspective I think there
were<00:00:11.130> things<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.550> people<00:00:12.120> didn't<00:00:12.360> even<00:00:12.420> know

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
were things that people didn't even know

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.749 
were things that people didn't even know
could<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.170> better<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> field<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
could be better like the field and the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.460 
could be better like the field and the
lighting<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> player<00:00:15.570> models<00:00:15.960> already

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
lighting and the player models already

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.070

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so we really focused on starting with

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.720 
so we really focused on starting with
just<00:00:29.880> real<00:00:30.269> grass<00:00:30.630> real<00:00:31.590> photos<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> grass<00:00:32.340> is

setting in and actually making the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.530 
setting in and actually making the
textures<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> real<00:00:35.489> grass<00:00:35.760> itself<00:00:36.270> and
