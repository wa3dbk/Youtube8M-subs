lay down 4 to 5 turns to finish I simply

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.770 
lay down 4 to 5 turns to finish I simply
push<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.250> tool<00:03:05.459> off<00:03:05.640> allowing<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.269> thread<00:03:06.570> to

before<00:03:36.040> flipping<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.520> tool<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:37.330> make<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
before flipping the tool to make a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.830 
before flipping the tool to make a
triangle<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:42.670> can<00:03:42.880> wrap<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.420> release

again

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.510 

because<00:03:55.690> time<00:03:56.020> with<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.380> tool<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.800> so<00:03:56.980> quick<00:03:57.310> I

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
because time with the tool is so quick I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.150 
because time with the tool is so quick I
generally<00:03:58.240> make<00:03:58.270> a<00:03:58.450> couple<00:03:58.960> of<00:03:59.050> knot<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.860> then

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
generally make a couple of knot and then

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.500 
generally make a couple of knot and then
finish<00:04:00.550> with<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.850> firm<00:04:01.180> tool<00:04:03.210> using<00:04:04.210> a<00:04:04.270> pair<00:04:04.480> of
