00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello, how are you? we're back with more 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.019
 a video lesson 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.840
 today we are going to learn how to transform 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.020
 a colored photo on a black and white photo 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.140
 white on adobe photoshop 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.689
 Let's get a photo here. 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:29.449
 photo exceeds my friend's we 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:35.640
 cassiane here in photoshop ready from here 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:41.460
 and let's duplicate the layer work with 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.480
 this first one the first time in the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.539
 photoshop 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.270
 We have a price that when we click on it 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.449
 already turns black and white photo 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:01.530
 he comes here image fit mendes black 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.239
 has a magic step your photo already 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.299
 it's done and white 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.100
 Okay, we just have a big problem. 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.409
 that because in fact she is gray she 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.740
 do not have a legal agreement right're very 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.229
 Gray I want to show you 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.320
 this video lesson is that we can 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.990
 make a black and white photo with a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.020
 level of contrast a photo with 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:34.200
 more quality than this 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:36.659
 the web is also good to make it clear that it is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.049
 This is the way I'm going to teach you 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.030
 it 's not the only way it's the way I use it 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.220
 which I like to use but there are 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.950
 different ways of transforming the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.750
 photo in black and white with a contrast 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.320
 The better you have more autonomy 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.250
 for you to touch 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.610
 is in the color tones of the middle 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.440
 pictures are darker but that's what I 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.100
 I'll teach you now is what I use the most 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.570
 It's what I like most to use pay-per-view 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.869
 on here 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.759
 this law is this 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.730
 Now let's work on this second 1 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.860
 we will not leave this here for us is 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:23.390
 See the difference later how good it was 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:27.709
 The one I use is down here you come. 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:32.590
 here on that button, very read on you 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.590
 search here gradient nÃ© 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.209
 do not be scared the photo will not stay 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.420
 like this 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.420
 click here 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.100
 Look for this box here the black white 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:51.800
 to click it good just click on it 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.440
 We already feel a difference, right? 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.030
 left her already brings us a contrast 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.720
 cool image 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:04.720
 Only we can do more of the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:09.769
 that click anywhere 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.700
 played that 50 to stay here in the middle 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.900
 between the darkest tone and the clearest I 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:22.420
 I come here 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:28.000
 Collor I will choose then medium now 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:35.260
 here in black I'm going to put 50 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:41.360
 the remainder that will identify 128 rgb ok 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:43.840
 Good now, here I can adjust the way 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.840
 that I want 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.700
 the contrast way I prefer it 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:56.940
 This is very personal, right? I like 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.660
 well contrasted photos 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.660
 very high contrast 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.360
 so you like it 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.670
 What I want to say is that here we 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.540
 have the control to leave as we 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.540
 either the image 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.550
 good 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.759
 I think it's already legal here. 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:32.310
 Ok now here, you already feel the difference. 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.490
 you are enabling this layer that 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.849
 people see the first one we did 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:47.360
 to fulfill seven of photoshop and then to 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:52.740
 Intimate grid let me search here 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.610
 picture here I put one next to the other 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:59.280
 to see the difference 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:03.419
 Good, that's what I wanted to show you. 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.849
 this is that there are several ways to 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:10.310
 People make a photo is black and 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:18.949
 a very nice contrast level 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:21.960
 a photo of a very high quality and 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.000
 mep gradient was the medium to teach 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.090
 You 're mine that I use the most. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.800
 Good, I hope you liked it, this is it. 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.800
