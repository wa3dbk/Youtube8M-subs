00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
for us we will have but I don't think so

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.750 
for us we will have but I don't think so
I<00:04:48.720> see<00:04:49.720> how<00:04:50.680> do<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.860> feel<00:04:51.070> it's<00:04:51.220> your<00:04:51.430> strength

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
compared to the Chinese are the Chinese

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.200 
compared to the Chinese are the Chinese
still<00:04:54.490> better<00:04:54.700> than<00:04:54.850> you<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.270> think<00:04:55.840> they<00:04:56.320> are

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
still better than you I think they are

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.550 
still better than you I think they are
with<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.840> team<00:04:59.110> with<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.410> WCG<00:04:59.800> team<00:05:00.040> no<00:05:00.669> no

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
with this team with the WCG team no no

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.670 
with this team with the WCG team no no
you<00:05:02.560> think<00:05:02.800> there's<00:05:03.150> worse<00:05:04.150> strangeness<00:05:04.960> a

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
you think there's worse strangeness a

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.390 
you think there's worse strangeness a
bit<00:05:05.980> yeah<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:06.490> don't<00:05:07.419> think<00:05:07.630> so<00:05:07.840> good<00:05:08.200> but<00:05:08.890> they

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
bit yeah I don't think so good but they

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.280 
bit yeah I don't think so good but they
train<00:05:09.700> against<00:05:10.150> each<00:05:10.300> other<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:10.810> we<00:05:11.080> play

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
train against each other and we play

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.190 
train against each other and we play
versus<00:05:11.740> some<00:05:11.980> guys<00:05:12.160> like<00:05:12.400> this<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:13.360> we<00:05:13.660> don't

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
versus some guys like this so we don't

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.860 
versus some guys like this so we don't
progress<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:15.070> they<00:05:15.430> are<00:05:15.640> so<00:05:16.300> probably<00:05:16.660> we

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
progress and they are so probably we
