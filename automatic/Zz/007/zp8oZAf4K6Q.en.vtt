00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
years ago called the Silk Road
tell<00:04:27.290> us<00:04:27.410> about<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.830> well<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.280> think<00:04:28.419> it's<00:04:29.830> it's

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
tell us about it well I think it's it's

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.780 
tell us about it well I think it's it's
a<00:04:30.980> group<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.460> people<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.180> thought<00:04:33.790> since

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
a group of people that I thought since

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.010 
a group of people that I thought since
I'm<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.419> musician<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:37.330> reflects<00:04:38.330> something

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
I'm a musician that reflects something

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.370 
I'm a musician that reflects something
that<00:04:39.620> might<00:04:39.889> be<00:04:40.100> needed<00:04:40.340> in<00:04:41.060> this<00:04:41.630> world<00:04:41.960> at<00:04:42.320> a

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
that might be needed in this world at a

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.159 
that might be needed in this world at a
particular<00:04:43.010> time<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:44.300> think<00:04:44.570> with<00:04:44.990> the

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
particular time and I think with the

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.870 
particular time and I think with the
onset<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.740> internet<00:04:47.080> many<00:04:48.080> people<00:04:48.500> are

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
onset of the internet many people are

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.909 
onset of the internet many people are
more<00:04:49.880> immediately<00:04:50.660> connected<00:04:51.290> but<00:04:51.770> then

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
more immediately connected but then

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.090 
more immediately connected but then
there<00:04:52.130> are<00:04:52.190> other<00:04:52.450> parts<00:04:53.450> of<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.320> world<00:04:54.470> but

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
there are other parts of the world but

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.150 
there are other parts of the world but
also<00:04:55.340> people<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.570> are<00:04:56.720> less<00:04:57.050> connected<00:04:57.770> so

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
also people that are less connected so

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.129 
also people that are less connected so
certain<00:04:58.520> industries<00:04:59.060> are<00:04:59.300> really<00:04:59.630> connected

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
certain industries are really connected

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.100 
certain industries are really connected
and<00:05:00.380> I<00:05:00.860> think<00:05:01.130> one<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.400> the<00:05:01.870> things<00:05:02.870> that's

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
and I think one of the things that's

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.140 
and I think one of the things that's
hardest<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.780> actually<00:05:06.460> communicate<00:05:07.460> or

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
hardest to to to actually communicate or

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.490 
hardest to to to actually communicate or
to<00:05:08.360> feel<00:05:08.870> or<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.410> be<00:05:09.620> empathetic<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.400> is

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
to feel or to be empathetic to is

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.980 
to feel or to be empathetic to is
cultural<00:05:12.500> differences<00:05:12.979> and<00:05:13.190> I<00:05:14.120> think<00:05:14.630> there's

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
cultural differences and I think there's

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.870 
cultural differences and I think there's
a<00:05:15.080> lot<00:05:15.320> of<00:05:15.350> fear<00:05:15.860> when<00:05:16.490> of<00:05:16.700> not<00:05:17.150> knowing<00:05:17.830> and

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
a lot of fear when of not knowing and

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.700 
a lot of fear when of not knowing and
and<00:05:19.880> since<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.540> lot<00:05:20.750> of<00:05:20.780> our<00:05:20.960> culture<00:05:21.260> is<00:05:21.500> based

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
and since a lot of our culture is based

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.980 
and since a lot of our culture is based
on<00:05:21.979> both<00:05:22.310> unprecedent<00:05:23.240> what's<00:05:23.600> happened

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
on both unprecedent what's happened

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.340 
on both unprecedent what's happened
before<00:05:24.169> and<00:05:24.710> also<00:05:25.460> on<00:05:25.610> invention<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:26.870> the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
before and also on invention so the

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.670 
before and also on invention so the
thought<00:05:27.590> is<00:05:27.620> how<00:05:28.580> do<00:05:28.639> we<00:05:28.940> actually<00:05:29.180> take<00:05:29.680> in

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
thought is how do we actually take in

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.100 
thought is how do we actually take in
precedents<00:05:31.750> history<00:05:32.919> and<00:05:34.030> actually<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.240> move

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
precedents history and actually and move

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.180 
precedents history and actually and move
ourselves<00:05:36.440> forward<00:05:37.690> to<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:39.050> world<00:05:39.800> that<00:05:39.950> we

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
ourselves forward to a world that we

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.760 
ourselves forward to a world that we
know<00:05:40.430> is<00:05:40.669> going<00:05:40.850> to<00:05:40.940> exist<00:05:41.419> like<00:05:41.750> for<00:05:42.350> example

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
know is going to exist like for example

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.670 
know is going to exist like for example
in<00:05:43.580> in<00:05:43.910> 20<00:05:44.270> years<00:05:44.419> 30<00:05:44.810> years<00:05:44.900> whether<00:05:45.169> it<00:05:45.440> with

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
in in 20 years 30 years whether it with

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.370 
in in 20 years 30 years whether it with
its<00:05:45.950> immigration<00:05:46.370> or<00:05:46.820> whether<00:05:47.419> it's<00:05:47.750> it's

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
its immigration or whether it's it's

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.210 
its immigration or whether it's it's
certain<00:05:48.830> changes<00:05:49.370> in<00:05:49.430> in<00:05:50.320> nature<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:52.010> will

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
certain changes in in nature that will

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.990 
certain changes in in nature that will
occur<00:05:53.740> how<00:05:54.740> do<00:05:54.800> we<00:05:55.070> do<00:05:55.220> that<00:05:55.400> culturally

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
occur how do we do that culturally

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.409 
occur how do we do that culturally
because<00:05:56.660> if<00:05:56.870> we<00:05:57.080> can't<00:05:57.380> think<00:05:57.650> that<00:05:58.250> way

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
because if we can't think that way

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.870 
because if we can't think that way
everything<00:05:59.419> that<00:05:59.810> we<00:05:59.930> do<00:06:00.139> in<00:06:00.440> government<00:06:00.880> and

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
everything that we do in government and

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.240 
everything that we do in government and
politics<00:06:02.300> is<00:06:02.479> going<00:06:02.539> to<00:06:02.720> be<00:06:02.810> ketchup<00:06:03.229> you<00:06:04.130> know

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
politics is going to be ketchup you know

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.219 
politics is going to be ketchup you know
we'll<00:06:04.669> have<00:06:04.700> to<00:06:04.880> wait<00:06:05.210> for<00:06:05.419> something<00:06:05.630> bad<00:06:05.780> to

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
we'll have to wait for something bad to

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.740 
we'll have to wait for something bad to
happen<00:06:06.380> and<00:06:06.740> then<00:06:07.340> we<00:06:07.430> try<00:06:07.669> and<00:06:07.789> fix<00:06:08.000> it<00:06:08.240> rather

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
happen and then we try and fix it rather

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.080 
happen and then we try and fix it rather
than<00:06:09.050> anticipate<00:06:09.889> what<00:06:10.430> actually<00:06:10.789> needs<00:06:11.000> to

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
than anticipate what actually needs to

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.600 
than anticipate what actually needs to
happen<00:06:11.389> so<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:11.930> idea<00:06:12.260> of<00:06:12.350> this<00:06:12.710> project<00:06:13.220> is<00:06:13.370> to

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
happen so the idea of this project is to

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.580 
happen so the idea of this project is to
actually<00:06:13.760> take<00:06:14.120> all<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:15.139> knowledge<00:06:15.320> that<00:06:15.500> we

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
actually take all the knowledge that we

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.960 
actually take all the knowledge that we
know<00:06:16.419> everywhere<00:06:17.770> collected<00:06:18.770> respected<00:06:19.760> and

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
know everywhere collected respected and

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.570 
know everywhere collected respected and
then<00:06:20.630> try<00:06:20.960> and<00:06:20.990> use<00:06:21.620> that<00:06:21.889> knowledge<00:06:21.950> as

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
then try and use that knowledge as

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.900 
then try and use that knowledge as
almost<00:06:23.060> at<00:06:23.150> a<00:06:23.240> slingshot<00:06:23.860> to<00:06:24.860> kind<00:06:25.130> of<00:06:25.220> launch

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
almost at a slingshot to kind of launch

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.510 
almost at a slingshot to kind of launch
us<00:06:26.270> forward<00:06:27.850> imaginatively<00:06:29.380> into<00:06:30.380> a<00:06:30.560> future

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
us forward imaginatively into a future

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.240 
us forward imaginatively into a future
far<00:06:31.789> away<00:06:32.000> and<00:06:32.240> then<00:06:32.450> backtrack<00:06:33.110> and<00:06:33.440> say<00:06:33.919> okay

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
far away and then backtrack and say okay

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.050 
far away and then backtrack and say okay
so<00:06:34.669> now<00:06:34.849> we're<00:06:35.090> in<00:06:35.240> the<00:06:35.360> year<00:06:36.159> 2013<00:06:37.159> what<00:06:37.880> can

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
so now we're in the year 2013 what can

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.190 
so now we're in the year 2013 what can
we<00:06:38.180> do<00:06:38.360> over<00:06:38.720> the<00:06:38.840> next
