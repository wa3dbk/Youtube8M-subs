00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
ok so now you're gonna take those two

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.790 
ok so now you're gonna take those two
cups<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.760> they<00:04:01.240> should<00:04:01.480> be<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.870> act<00:04:02.650> like

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
cups and they should be like act like

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.430 
cups and they should be like act like
this<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.550> you're<00:04:04.420> going<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.660> put<00:04:04.870> one<00:04:05.140> of<00:04:05.320> them

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
this and you're going to put one of them

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.310 
this and you're going to put one of them
on<00:04:05.680> top<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.460> other<00:04:06.670> one<00:04:06.970> so<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.780> gets<00:04:07.930> that

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
on top of the other one so it gets that

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.700 
on top of the other one so it gets that
type<00:04:08.680> of<00:04:08.710> shape<00:04:09.130> like<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.610> lava<00:04:09.970> lamp<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:11.620> it

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
type of shape like a lava lamp and so it

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.490 
type of shape like a lava lamp and so it
looks<00:04:11.860> like<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:13.090> when<00:04:13.330> I<00:04:13.630> guess<00:04:14.260> you

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
looks like that and when I guess you

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.640 
looks like that and when I guess you
could<00:04:14.530> glue<00:04:15.070> these<00:04:15.310> together<00:04:15.580> but<00:04:16.330> I<00:04:16.660> think

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
could glue these together but I think

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.840 
could glue these together but I think
it's<00:04:17.860> easy<00:04:18.300> so<00:04:19.500> nice<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.530> each<00:04:20.890> other<00:04:21.040> so

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
it's easy so nice to each other so

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.360 
it's easy so nice to each other so
you're<00:04:21.970> going<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.180> take<00:04:22.240> your<00:04:22.420> tape<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.620> get

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
you're going to take your tape and get

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.570 
you're going to take your tape and get
out<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> fairly<00:04:25.240> long<00:04:25.540> piece<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:27.220> get<00:04:27.400> your

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
out a fairly long piece and get your

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:39.420 
out a fairly long piece and get your
scissors<00:04:35.970> just<00:04:36.970> wrap<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.810> around<00:04:38.320> where<00:04:39.220> they

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
scissors just wrap it around where they

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.940 
scissors just wrap it around where they
eat<00:04:40.500> so<00:04:41.500> it's<00:04:43.830> secure<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:46.840> could<00:04:47.620> use

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
eat so it's secure and you could use

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.190 
eat so it's secure and you could use
like<00:04:48.130> maybe<00:04:48.730> duct<00:04:49.150> tape<00:04:49.240> or<00:04:49.570> something<00:04:49.720> if<00:04:50.080> you

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
like maybe duct tape or something if you

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.590 
like maybe duct tape or something if you
want<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.590> be<00:04:50.710> colored<00:04:51.100> but<00:04:52.440> just<00:04:54.600> choosing

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
want to be colored but just choosing

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.360 
want to be colored but just choosing
this<00:04:57.120> it's<00:04:58.120> ok<00:04:58.660> if<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:59.050> gets<00:04:59.260> a<00:04:59.620> little<00:05:00.100> bit

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
this it's ok if it gets a little bit

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.740 
this it's ok if it gets a little bit
wrinkled<00:05:00.910> I<00:05:01.240> know<00:05:01.720> mine<00:05:01.960> does<00:05:03.000> yeah<00:05:04.000> take<00:05:04.450> part

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
wrinkled I know mine does yeah take part

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.740 
wrinkled I know mine does yeah take part
but<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:05.500> can<00:05:05.710> just<00:05:05.740> smooth<00:05:06.340> that<00:05:06.880> out<00:05:06.910> and<00:05:07.480> it

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
but you can just smooth that out and it

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.100 
but you can just smooth that out and it
should<00:05:08.250> sort<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.400> blend<00:05:09.820> in<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.120> bit<00:05:10.480> to<00:05:10.960> the

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
should sort of blend in a bit to the

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.730 
should sort of blend in a bit to the
class<00:05:11.320> of<00:05:11.740> show<00:05:12.280> up<00:05:12.490> a<00:05:12.730> wall<00:05:14.460> so<00:05:16.170> then<00:05:17.170> you<00:05:17.410> tank

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
class of show up a wall so then you tank

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.140 
class of show up a wall so then you tank
this<00:05:18.240> so<00:05:19.240> it<00:05:19.510> looks<00:05:19.780> super<00:05:20.080> view<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.770> now<00:05:21.670> is

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
this so it looks super view and now is

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.820 
this so it looks super view and now is
your<00:05:22.870> choice<00:05:23.200> of<00:05:23.560> either<00:05:24.070> getting<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.830> cat

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
your choice of either getting a cat

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.480 
your choice of either getting a cat
click<00:05:27.340> this<00:05:27.580> one<00:05:27.640> from<00:05:28.120> something<00:05:28.660> or<00:05:29.530> you

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
click this one from something or you

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:38.390 
click this one from something or you
could<00:05:30.880> just<00:05:31.840> get<00:05:32.830> another<00:05:35.670> last<00:05:36.670> thing<00:05:37.150> and

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
could just get another last thing and

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.650 
could just get another last thing and
tape<00:05:39.400> that<00:05:39.730> around<00:05:40.120> I<00:05:41.550> personally<00:05:42.550> think<00:05:43.330> this

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
tape that around I personally think this

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.190 
tape that around I personally think this
would<00:05:43.900> look<00:05:43.930> more<00:05:44.350> like<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.590> lava<00:05:44.860> lip<00:05:45.990> you<00:05:46.990> guys

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
would look more like a lava lip you guys

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.590 
would look more like a lava lip you guys
can<00:05:47.470> see<00:05:47.620> anyway<00:05:48.070> but<00:05:48.520> i<00:05:48.700> personally<00:05:49.150> think<00:05:49.450> it

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
can see anyway but i personally think it

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.430 
can see anyway but i personally think it
acts<00:05:49.840> more<00:05:50.020> like<00:05:50.290> a<00:05:50.590> lava<00:05:50.770> lamp<00:05:50.980> but<00:05:51.580> I<00:05:52.440> don't

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
acts more like a lava lamp but I don't

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.670 
acts more like a lava lamp but I don't
have<00:05:53.530> any<00:05:53.590> paint<00:05:54.160> on<00:05:54.400> me<00:05:54.670> right<00:05:54.880> now<00:05:54.910> so<00:05:55.680> I'm

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
have any paint on me right now so I'm

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.359 
have any paint on me right now so I'm
just<00:05:56.950> going<00:05:57.190> to<00:05:57.250> choose<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.820> put<00:05:58.000> it<00:05:58.180> out<00:05:58.360> this

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:02.369 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:08.189 

or<00:06:03.369> I<00:06:03.399> guess<00:06:03.609> you<00:06:04.029> could<00:06:04.059> take<00:06:04.509> it<00:06:06.029> too<00:06:07.029> but<00:06:07.569> you

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:08.199 
or I guess you could take it too but you

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.909 
or I guess you could take it too but you
know<00:06:08.229> it's<00:06:08.559> totally<00:06:09.039> up<00:06:09.129> to<00:06:09.369> you<00:06:09.459> and<00:06:10.709> you<00:06:11.709> can

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
know it's totally up to you and you can

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.709 
know it's totally up to you and you can
tape<00:06:12.219> this<00:06:12.369> on<00:06:12.609> glue<00:06:12.909> it<00:06:13.059> on<00:06:13.179> whatever<00:06:13.479> you

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
tape this on glue it on whatever you
