00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.190 

my<00:01:59.210> god<00:01:59.420> make<00:02:00.200> great<00:02:00.500> smooth<00:02:01.660> mine<00:02:02.660> can<00:02:03.020> even

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
my god make great smooth mine can even

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.380 
my god make great smooth mine can even
taste<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.650> brain<00:02:03.920> that's<00:02:04.910> one<00:02:05.090> thing<00:02:05.240> that's

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
taste the brain that's one thing that's

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.410 
taste the brain that's one thing that's
cool<00:02:05.660> about<00:02:05.720> using<00:02:06.910> grains<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.000> are<00:02:08.119> more

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
cool about using grains that are more

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.290 
cool about using grains that are more
stringent<00:02:08.899> as<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.410> they<00:02:09.530> go<00:02:09.740> with<00:02:10.009> very<00:02:10.700> so

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
stringent as that they go with very so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.230 
stringent as that they go with very so
well<00:02:11.660> then<00:02:12.350> I<00:02:12.380> guess<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.370> actually<00:02:13.580> add<00:02:13.940> I

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
well then I guess you can actually add I

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.020 
well then I guess you can actually add I
can<00:02:14.390> probably<00:02:14.570> add<00:02:15.130> another<00:02:16.130> cup<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> half

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
can probably add another cup and a half

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.180 
can probably add another cup and a half
of<00:02:17.330> these<00:02:17.420> grains<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.709> can<00:02:18.860> probably

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
of these grains and you can probably

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.699 
of these grains and you can probably
barely<00:02:19.370> taste<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.150> if<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.230> really<00:02:21.500> want<00:02:21.650> to

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
barely taste it so if you really want to

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.890 
barely taste it so if you really want to
go<00:02:21.830> deeper<00:02:22.489> in<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:22.700> they<00:02:23.360> might<00:02:23.540> have<00:02:23.630> put<00:02:23.810> in

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
go deeper in this they might have put in

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.350 
go deeper in this they might have put in
there<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.200> mean<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:25.489> give<00:02:25.610> anybody

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
there I mean this is I can give anybody

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.140 
there I mean this is I can give anybody
and<00:02:26.660> they<00:02:26.810> would<00:02:26.959> like<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.730> activist<00:02:28.730> more

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150
