00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.170
 and at the request of some friends is 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.530
 who asked me to make a video of 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.009
 how do i make my strawberry jam 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.990
 so friends here in my pan 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.529
 You can see it 's a pan. 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.999
 space I'm using 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.249
 because this candy he has the habit of 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.899
 ride up 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:29.189
 so here in my pan I put 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:32.099
 one and a half pound of strawberry and 750 grams 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.280
 sugar and here I will be using 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.800
 half a lemon only the German I 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.109
 I'm going to get well almost last, I'm not going 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.969
 lay now so now i'm 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:49.410
 waiting to open boil because he 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.449
 will start to make more foam and have 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.839
 than to remove that foam so that later 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:59.519
 the jam would not be over and 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:03.829
 For you to understand, you do not doubt 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:07.590
 for example is is always using 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:12.000
 half strawberry alias half strawberry 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.439
 in sugar for example 500 grams of 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.780
 strawberry 250 grams of sugar and some 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:24.869
 Lemon droplets do not put 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:28.890
 so not to stay too early a pound 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.680
 strawberry half a kilo of sugar 500 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.299
 grams of sugar 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.299
 so there is no mistake 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.299
 here you are starting to get cuteness 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.450
 I'm also doing a pan yes 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.450
 thick right 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.640
 has plenty of room so that when he 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.600
 start to boil 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.789
 he will start to climb can see that the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:06.329
 strawberry has released enough water for 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:08.280
 while he is quite mature and 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.900
 now strawberry season can do 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.910
 enough jelly 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.030
 only soy elek 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.630
 and I usually do this to pass on 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.160
 bread toast on a regular basis 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.160

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:39.990
