00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.879
 arrocito and this one with cuitlacoche and what 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.620
 let's do we're going to put the 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.530
 crazy and will be 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.960
 delicious we're going to need a little bit of 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.660
 oil to sauté our rice 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.690
 rice a cup more or less we are going to 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.550
 be some little grain zealots these 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.530
 they can also get already canned 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.329
 there are also whites or otherwise of their 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.009
 cob nothing else you have to get them out of the 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.270
 cob with a little knife and they are already 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:12.579
 we are also going to use cuitlacoche 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.119
 let's use onion garlic a little bit 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.119
 coriander 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.160
 salt and pepper there is no more thanks these 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.480
 I gave it to Max and I have to 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.140
 show off because it's my salt shaker my 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.610
 Pepper and are my magic towns 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.650
 well I'm going to put a little heat 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.900
 Oil for browning around our our 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.880
 rice remember that rice has to 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.060
 I look good gold to look good 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.230
 cooked because then it happens that you beat 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.730
 then to not abate rice 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.830
 What I do recommend is that 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.380
 when they brown the rice they brown it very well 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.150
 to take a well-toasted color and tone 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.650
 then let's put it to brown and 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.840
 while browning rice like me 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:02.780
 like I'm going to liquefy penicaut your movie 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.200
 and I'm going I'll liquefy 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.689
 the cuitlacoche 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.879
 the car is a delicious mushroom that comes 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.920
 of corn besides it is extremely 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.830
 nutritious everything that something has 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.739
 lots of proteins then this is going 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.220
 to add a porsche to your your recipe 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.200
 he explains that it is cooked is already 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.300
 boiled with a little bit of pasotas if 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.400
 you want to put him in the house I'm going 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.349
 to put the tooth a clove of garlic that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.900
 It's going to be raw and I'm also going to 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.970
 put a bit of onion as a party 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.890
 of a small onion but that is not 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.770
 wants to put my son but with a 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.540
 onion room this one 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.160
 2 onions Chiquita also will 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.650
 we are going to add and we are also going to 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.020
 put water here we will put the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.569
 waters that we're going to add the amount of 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.390
 water that we are going to add to the rice 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.849
 not then for a cup of rice are 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.849
 two of water there are people who do 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.350
 one of cold water and one of water 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.630
 hot 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.270
 this is possible because it helps stop a 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.280
 little rice cooking 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.890
 helps to stop cooking a little bit 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.440
 rice and then by throwing the cold half 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.420
 and half as warm as this one 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.130
 makes our crunchier 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.840
 rice here the rice is already taking 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.720
 way so it's no longer necessary to stop 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.450
 move so that it is roasted and how delicious it is 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.850
 the smell of it would be the toast of what 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.140
 put toast smells delicious rice 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.940
 it is not the exception 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.080
 then we're going to go to bed 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.150
 grab a color like the one that is 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.590
 grabbing inhabitants and systematizing already 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.270
 onscreen 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.250
 this is the color we want to take in 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.730
 a rice now if it's once what 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.370
 can touch a little more 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.450
 There are as you like order order in 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:55.290
 times and send good at this time I 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.099
 I'm going to add our huitlacoche 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.099
 and liquefied 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.340
 terry power 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.579
 so that the broth is absorbed little by little 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.810
 ah 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.329
 now then it is debated when you 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.169
 move much rice ok then I 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.259
 recommendations 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.210
 let's give it a little spin in this 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.639
 moment that I cool down a bit 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.470
 the pan so that afterwards no more 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.600
 let the rice sit on its own 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.910
 is going to sit and alone is going to start 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.039
 take and absorb the juices of the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.260
 cuitlacoche and this what we are going to 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:43.010
 adding is a little sorry 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.010
 of salt 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.870
 because you know what else I need 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.290
 OK 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.800
 and we're going to put some pepper 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.430
 today how nice I loved this I 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.650
 loved it well I'm also going to add the 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.509
 because I want that is now too 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.800
 some of the huitlacoche juice then 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.960
 this what he is going to do is that the other 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.789
 It should be as clear and it's going to 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.830
 help give this floating and rich flavor 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.300
 and delicious with a bit of the aroma of 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.490
 pick skinny and then I'll add it 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.470
 of one of a good time so this 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.410
 Well, it's already cooked and if you add it 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.240
 raw then do the same and some little crops 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.340
 let's put a little parsley 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.169
 so that I can get a taste, I recommend them 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.840
 Do not cover the rice that they leave 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.300
 uncovered to absorb the juice 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.759
 correctly people who cover it up to 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.169
 I absorbed the broth more I liked it 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.599
 when it happens for a little bit more but 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.930
 well you know that tastes are broken 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.400
 true genres but it's a recipe very 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.710
 easy to do 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.229
 the circuit of the car is a beauty 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.020
 it is the delicacy of the delicacies of 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.970
 mexican this ate it moctezuma was 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.900
 one of the most exquisite dishes that 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.150
 had was how they put him in his 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.910
 banquets were minimum 300 that useful 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.330
 bajita hand and including that ande 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.800
 human flesh quesadillas had imagine 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.770
 so that I get 300 diary dishes 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.960
 and if it is required that because to get 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.270
 to sit down and say, I want this 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.599
 You are choosing from 300 dishes as you hear 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.610
 you have a restaurant walking 24 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.560
 This is great but with the 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.900
 cuitlacoche has great properties is 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.340
 an incredible source of incredible fiber 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.500
 of proteins has iron they have phosphorus 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.379
 It has potassium and we will add it 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.509
 some complex carbohydrates that goes 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.460
 to be in this case the corn the corn has 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:39.650
 a lot of phosphorus and then the phosphorus 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.030
 what help is to fix the calcium that is 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.090
 if you want to add a little bit of 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.680
 cream to your rice at lunchtime 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.930
 It's going to be great because then 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.879
 You will also ingest the calcium that you are going 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.719
 to need with this match and you're already 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:55.310
 with the athlete and a little bit of search for yourself 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:56.870
 a sliced ​​avocado is 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.250
 great to hear then what is 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.990
 cook now I do know what it is 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:04.810
 cook the rice 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.810
 let's go to a cut we want us to be 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.960
 Y
