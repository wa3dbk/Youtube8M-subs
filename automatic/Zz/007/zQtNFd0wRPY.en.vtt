hi<00:00:01.770> everybody<00:00:02.250> this<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.580> my<00:00:02.850> RC<00:00:03.030> car<00:00:03.449> which<00:00:03.840> I

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
hi everybody this is my RC car which I

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.380 
hi everybody this is my RC car which I
have<00:00:04.080> designed<00:00:04.380> only<00:00:04.620> using<00:00:05.100> motors<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.730> a

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
have designed only using motors and a

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.750 
have designed only using motors and a
pair<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.629> dp/dt<00:00:07.170> switches<00:00:07.680> as<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.429> can<00:00:08.580> see

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
pair of dp/dt switches as you can see

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.120 
pair of dp/dt switches as you can see
this<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.090> my<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.990> my<00:00:10.139> pair<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.500> switch<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.950> this

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
this is my is my pair of switch and this

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.060 
this is my is my pair of switch and this
is<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> RC<00:00:11.910> bot<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:13.200> can<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.559> controlled<00:00:13.860> by

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
is the RC bot it can be controlled by

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.160 
is the RC bot it can be controlled by
remote<00:00:14.190> control

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
remote control

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.370 
remote control
we<00:00:16.170> need<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.529> guy<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:17.100> used<00:00:17.250> four<00:00:17.640> motors

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
we need this guy have used four motors

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.310 
we need this guy have used four motors
you<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.410> see<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> configuration<00:00:20.010> here<00:00:21.320> these

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
you can see the configuration here these

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.040 
you can see the configuration here these
two<00:00:22.730> inlets<00:00:23.730> later<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.580> have<00:00:26.580> used<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
two inlets later I have used the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.200 
two inlets later I have used the
convention<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> pair<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.580> power<00:00:29.880> supply

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
convention for a pair of power supply

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.030 
convention for a pair of power supply
which<00:00:30.449> will<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:31.140> cable<00:00:31.500> go<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.859> power

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
which will this cable go in the power

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.049 
which will this cable go in the power
supply<00:00:32.250> switch<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> wires

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
supply switch and these are the wires

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.760 
supply switch and these are the wires
which<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.270> am<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.780> control<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> port<00:00:37.440> by

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
which I am going to control the port by

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.900 
which I am going to control the port by
using<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.219> switches<00:00:39.020> so<00:00:40.020> basically<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.920> have

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
using these switches so basically I have

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.779 
using these switches so basically I have
explained<00:00:42.270> all<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> construction<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
explained all the construction in the

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.020 
explained all the construction in the
blog<00:00:44.789> which<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.660> posted<00:00:46.760> retro<00:00:47.760> let<00:00:47.910> me

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
blog which I have posted retro let me

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.630 
blog which I have posted retro let me
explain<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.450> working<00:00:49.100> these<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> pair<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
explain it working these are the pair of

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.850 
explain it working these are the pair of
dp/dt<00:00:51.000> switches<00:00:51.510> these<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.140> move<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.620> both

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
dp/dt switches these can move in both

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.780 
dp/dt switches these can move in both
the<00:00:53.039> directions<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.940> way

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.650 

so<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.860> type<00:01:00.860> of<00:01:00.890> work<00:01:01.280> driving<00:01:02.180> habits<00:01:02.540> how

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
so the type of work driving habits how

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.200 
so the type of work driving habits how
capable<00:01:02.900> easy<00:01:03.140> when<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:03.920> move<00:01:04.309> this<00:01:04.519> switch<00:01:04.640> in

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
capable easy when I move this switch in

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.930 
capable easy when I move this switch in
forward<00:01:05.600> position<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:07.070> bot<00:01:07.280> will<00:01:07.490> move<00:01:07.700> in

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
forward position the bot will move in

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.560 
forward position the bot will move in
this<00:01:08.240> way<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:08.869> in<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.650> red<00:01:09.770> side<00:01:10.390> that<00:01:11.390> is

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
this way that is in the red side that is

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.940 
this way that is in the red side that is
I<00:01:11.600> have<00:01:11.840> taught<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.110> convention<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.650> while

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
I have taught the convention of while

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.790 
I have taught the convention of while
driving<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.400> car<00:01:13.750> while<00:01:14.750> tying<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.140> car<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:15.560> see

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
driving a car while tying a car we see

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.880 
driving a car while tying a car we see
that<00:01:15.979> when<00:01:16.400> we<00:01:16.580> move<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.820> steering<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.330> right

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
that when we move the steering to right

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.469 
that when we move the steering to right
when<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.009> whole<00:01:19.160> clockwise<00:01:19.940> when<00:01:20.240> we<00:01:20.330> move

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
when the whole clockwise when we move

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.080 
when the whole clockwise when we move
the<00:01:20.540> steering<00:01:20.720> clockwise<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:22.400> bot<00:01:22.610> will<00:01:22.820> move

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
the steering clockwise the bot will move

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.270 
the steering clockwise the bot will move
to<00:01:23.660> right<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.110> we<00:01:24.290> move<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:24.860> we<00:01:25.009> move<00:01:25.190> the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
to right and we move and we move the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.740 
to right and we move and we move the
steering<00:01:25.430> anti-clockwise<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.360> bot<00:01:26.570> will

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
steering anti-clockwise the bot will

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.560 
steering anti-clockwise the bot will
move<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.250> left<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:28.820> here<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.210> have<00:01:29.300> used

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
move to the left so here I have used

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.740 
move to the left so here I have used
this<00:01:29.840> convention<00:01:30.409> for<00:01:30.770> my<00:01:30.979> driving<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:32.600> is

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
this convention for my driving it is

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.889 
this convention for my driving it is
when<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:32.990> press<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.800> left<00:01:34.220> left<00:01:34.759> button<00:01:35.180> in<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
when I press the left left button in the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.450 
when I press the left left button in the
forward<00:01:36.229> position<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.860> bot<00:01:37.070> will<00:01:37.250> move<00:01:37.430> right

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
forward position the bot will move right

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.710 
forward position the bot will move right
and<00:01:38.149> when<00:01:38.840> I<00:01:38.869> press<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.590> right<00:01:39.860> button<00:01:40.789> in<00:01:41.600> the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
and when I press the right button in the

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.680 
and when I press the right button in the
form<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.020> position<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.680> god<00:01:43.070> will<00:01:43.250> move<00:01:43.430> left

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
form of position the god will move left

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.139 
form of position the god will move left
this<00:01:44.690> is<00:01:44.810> my<00:01:44.869> basic<00:01:45.140> construction<00:01:45.770> as<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.970> can

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
this is my basic construction as you can

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.690 
this is my basic construction as you can
see<00:01:47.330> forward<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.860> have<00:01:49.009> explained<00:01:49.340> all<00:01:49.520> the
