little bit of fun doing first you take

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.370 
little bit of fun doing first you take
off<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.430> cover<00:00:25.119> which<00:00:25.510> covers<00:00:25.869> that<00:00:25.960> engine

off the cover which covers that engine
and<00:00:28.019> then<00:00:29.019> your<00:00:29.230> battery<00:00:29.619> connector<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.359> need

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
and then your battery connector you need

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.530 
and then your battery connector you need
to<00:00:31.599> take<00:00:31.779> a<00:00:31.810> little<00:00:32.050> star<00:00:32.380> tool<00:00:32.650> and<00:00:33.640> remove

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
that so you can get up under there and

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.870 
that so you can get up under there and
also<00:00:41.200> remove<00:00:41.560> this<00:00:41.680> little<00:00:41.950> sticker<00:00:42.190> in<00:00:42.550> this

also remove this little sticker in this

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.040 
also remove this little sticker in this
case<00:00:43.120> I<00:00:43.900> chose<00:00:44.590> later<00:00:44.890> on<00:00:45.130> to<00:00:45.430> go<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.240> BMW<00:00:46.630> and

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
case I chose later on to go to BMW and

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.990 
case I chose later on to go to BMW and
replace<00:00:47.410> this<00:00:47.650> because<00:00:48.490> it<00:00:48.610> looks<00:00:48.820> a<00:00:48.880> lot

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
replace this because it looks a lot

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.630 
replace this because it looks a lot
cleaner<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:50.410> your<00:00:50.620> kit<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.280> you'll<00:00:51.460> receive

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
cleaner in your kit that you'll receive

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.730 
cleaner in your kit that you'll receive
is<00:00:52.150> a<00:00:52.440> remover<00:00:53.440> and<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:56.050> these<00:00:56.260> surfaces

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
is a remover and on these surfaces

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.800 
is a remover and on these surfaces
you'll<00:00:56.890> see<00:00:57.040> that<00:00:57.190> some<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.490> the<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:57.970> coating

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
you'll see that some of the the coating

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.530 
you'll see that some of the the coating
has<00:00:59.020> been<00:00:59.290> come<00:01:00.100> off<00:01:00.250> naturally<00:01:00.520> but<00:01:01.390> what

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
has been come off naturally but what

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.930 
has been come off naturally but what
we're<00:01:01.660> going<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:01.810> do<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:02.080> remove<00:01:02.260> all<00:01:02.740> of<00:01:02.950> it

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.330 

what<00:01:06.940> remains<00:01:07.300> is<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.630> real<00:01:07.900> textured<00:01:08.890> almost

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
what remains is a real textured almost

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.540 
what remains is a real textured almost
feels<00:01:09.730> like<00:01:09.820> an<00:01:10.000> aluminum<00:01:10.710> metal<00:01:11.710> there<00:01:12.130> which

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
feels like an aluminum metal there which

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.030 
feels like an aluminum metal there which
really<00:01:13.000> is<00:01:13.480> in<00:01:13.810> our<00:01:13.960> favor<00:01:14.260> because<00:01:14.710> we'll<00:01:14.920> be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
really is in our favor because we'll be

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.130 
really is in our favor because we'll be
able<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.280> put<00:01:16.060> our<00:01:16.150> coating<00:01:16.450> on<00:01:16.690> there<00:01:16.930> and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
able to put our coating on there and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.680 
able to put our coating on there and
allow<00:01:17.410> it<00:01:17.590> to<00:01:17.680> stick<00:01:17.950> very<00:01:18.220> well<00:01:18.460> this<00:01:19.390> coating

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
allow it to stick very well this coating

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.490 
allow it to stick very well this coating
by<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:19.960> way<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.200> water-based<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.290> gets

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
by the way is water-based and as it gets

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.010 
by the way is water-based and as it gets
hotter<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:24.070> gets<00:01:24.280> more<00:01:24.430> durable<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.510> stays<00:01:25.810> on

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
hotter it gets more durable it stays on

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.930 
hotter it gets more durable it stays on
this<00:01:26.290> even<00:01:26.740> though<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:27.040> engine<00:01:27.340> heat<00:01:27.550> gets<00:01:27.790> up

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
this even though the engine heat gets up

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.890 
this even though the engine heat gets up
pretty<00:01:28.240> high<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.500> coating<00:01:29.830> stays<00:01:30.100> intact<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
pretty high the coating stays intact so

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.620 
pretty high the coating stays intact so
now<00:01:32.050> we've<00:01:32.320> allowed<00:01:33.130> this<00:01:33.370> remover<00:01:34.270> to<00:01:34.390> stay

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
now we've allowed this remover to stay

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.390 
now we've allowed this remover to stay
on<00:01:34.810> probably<00:01:35.200> ten<00:01:35.409> or<00:01:35.440> fifteen<00:01:35.860> minutes<00:01:35.890> and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
on probably ten or fifteen minutes and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.270 
on probably ten or fifteen minutes and
then<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:37.210> use<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.600> glove<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.800> better<00:01:38.980> to<00:01:39.130> do

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
then I use a glove it's better to do

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.510 
then I use a glove it's better to do
that<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.760> just<00:01:40.740> carefully<00:01:41.740> wipe<00:01:41.980> all<00:01:42.220> around

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
that and just carefully wipe all around

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.070 
that and just carefully wipe all around
now<00:01:42.730> as<00:01:42.909> I<00:01:42.970> said<00:01:43.030> before<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:43.690> can<00:01:43.840> probably

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
now as I said before you can probably

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.469 
now as I said before you can probably
there's<00:01:44.860> that<00:01:45.040> textured<00:01:45.520> metal<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:46.330> can

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
there's that textured metal you can

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.600 
there's that textured metal you can
probably<00:01:46.659> tape<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.800> protect<00:01:47.979> some<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.550> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
probably tape to protect some of the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.670 
probably tape to protect some of the
services<00:01:49.090> around<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:50.200> metal<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.590> we're

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
services around the metal that we're

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.160 
services around the metal that we're
going<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.830> coat<00:01:51.120> and<00:01:52.120> your<00:01:52.300> kit<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.600> also<00:01:52.960> a

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
going to coat and your kit is also a

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.410 
going to coat and your kit is also a
little<00:01:53.470> brush<00:01:53.800> little<00:01:54.310> wire<00:01:54.460> brush<00:01:54.490> or<00:01:55.090> a

little brush little wire brush or a

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.450 
little brush little wire brush or a
fiber<00:01:55.720> brush<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.530> also<00:01:56.890> I'm<00:01:56.950> squeezing<00:01:57.310> a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
fiber brush and also I'm squeezing a

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.120 
fiber brush and also I'm squeezing a
little<00:01:57.549> bit<00:01:57.760> of<00:01:57.820> lacquer<00:01:58.030> thinner<00:01:58.979> into<00:01:59.979> that

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
little bit of lacquer thinner into that

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.399 
little bit of lacquer thinner into that
before<00:02:00.490> we<00:02:00.640> brush<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.150> out<00:02:01.330> we<00:02:01.930> don't<00:02:02.110> supply

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
before we brush that out we don't supply

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.020 
before we brush that out we don't supply
that<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.950> kit<00:02:03.220> for<00:02:03.400> liability<00:02:04.000> reasons
