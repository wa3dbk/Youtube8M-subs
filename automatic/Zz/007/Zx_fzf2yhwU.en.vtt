 the euro wins lucky because they confirm in their area please 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.080
 Bella's station Mayer was left by a longer woman 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.159
 Winter games an end 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.489
 the citizen becomes a native of Bremen the citizen of the European Union 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.070
 check 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.890
 heaven is station 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.060
 I will do a treatment 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.460
 July Red Backs in their area are getting ready for about 100 trees 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.619
 more the stations of the world 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.990
 Unfortunately, I do not know Sony Entertainment strong other 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.420
 Activities are extremely difficult we may have a little 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.120
 defensive problems 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.660
 Here I would liberals to my mother 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.390
 here was the noise level 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 H 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.620
 who owns a small area of ​​small businesses 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.500
 he is now the sensible first battalion summer storm bring her 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.639
 have proven more times was one here 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:58.840
 Birgit Baumann 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.000
 at all stations Harburg 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.820
 Bertling monitoring was next to the line 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.820
 I 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.690
 that's something new 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 In future, Americans do not have to travel somewhere but 5 5 at home 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.470
 stay 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.890
 start eleven riders 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.900
 Joking aside in Modern Warfare 2 must see adds matters 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.950
 of course, in turn 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.560
 they start in Afghanistan in every shooter and not in the US where themselves 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.060
 Russian forces with a supposedly good reason quite nicely 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 to spread 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.760
 Right in the first real mission goes in Modern Warfare 2 in the truest 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.300
 To live in the sense of the word 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.970
 now the government is spinning in a circle then turning 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.890
 in fact then we offered the ones of a rocket from the wheels 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.890
 becomes 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.890
 they already notice Modern Warfare 2 does not hesitate long and sends them 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.109
 almost without delay right in the middle of sweaty action 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.619
 with almost no delay because just like in the first part of the series they have to 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.400
 first complete a training 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.210
 we race them against time over a parcour of cardboard mates ever after 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.149
 Result then suggests a difficulty level in the game 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.289
 because here, as we have already noticed, we have already noticed with the help of the mouse and keyboard 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.809
 Heroes unfamiliar ex-boxer they play around us much earlier than 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.719
 the pc version was available 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.349
 our result is correspondingly low 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.010
 but the money the Shift Frost im does not mean that we 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.709
 For example, in street fighting in Rio de Janeiro we play the role of 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.799
 Terry Sanderson called distress are in trouble 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.579
 After all, we have pot support in that, among other things, our age 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.310
 Ego from the first Modern Warfare 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.509
 pulled MacTavish 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.779
 along with husband and another soldier of cargo before so were on site 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:49.329
 were 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.859
 a special group headed by the us military 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.049
 Let's sleep two arms dealers here and they over the terrorists 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.049
 Doctors on squeeze 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.200
 the first car derailed, the second one makes life difficult for us 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.900
 the Bouchard with the support 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.040
 but as I said, we also have money 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.930
 Appearance pulled MacTavish of its character 1a window crashes 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.229
 again blow 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:14.170
 b 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.760
 It should be considered by the lower court that the owners must be in it 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.030
 Modern Warfare 2 in a current life without that arise 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.280
 wear 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.290
 When the game understands it perfectly between furious spectacle and quiet 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.229
 Switch passages back and forth 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.940
 Here it is comparatively calm to the point 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.870
 with MacTavish and other countries to conquer like a rig and 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.069
 free the hostages on it 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.489
 Under water, we approach the not keep years switch then 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.219
 secretly silent 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.219
 they wake up on the lowest platform 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.809
 but you have to really class 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.970
 relatively soon after, the situation looks quite different again 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.970
 sitting on the desks of a set of rules they fly a miller somewhere in 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.740
 Russia to rescue a super important prisoner there 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.659
 In second place you often can not get more 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.260
 who the winner is caught right does not even reveal what he can not 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.969
 that they already think 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.419
 However, the man is certainly exempt from them from the depths of the institution 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.779
 deserved to win 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.099
 by rarely letting go of the trigger finger 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.000
 Modern Warfare 2 for train at many places its predecessor does not cite 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.559
 mind you 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.719
 In the paper, for example, they have to fly under time pressure and then 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.610
 honest as the protect is now in the first game 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.210
 reach with a daredevil jump a helicopter or the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.639
 Rope ladder which will have majority of the substructure 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:52.139
 to the Panther Mission from the first part reminds their use in the 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.340
 Washington suburbs in the role of COO of the manager of Insignia 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.270
 There they draw with Skype's comrades overcrowded by enemies 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.979
 streets 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.930
 With a laser pointer, they then set a second goal before the thought 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.930
 though under attack 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.399
 and the occasional use of an improved probably more reminds one 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:16.650
 Flight in action when I'm pretty 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.650
 in the infamous mission Death from Above 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.659
 But enough of the quotes back to what they really are flaming new in modern 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.460
 Warfare 2 is for me that the war has found its way in the US 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.460
 For the first time, they fight in the series on American soil 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.819
 and how are things like that 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.819
 not very good 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.459
 Modern Warfare 2 is an action fireworks that you would otherwise only in the 

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.300
 Cinema experiences this "consequences" 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.220
 With a lot of variety and a very small playground I adorn the belief 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.410
 Act has gotten me the best Franconia cost Lake Fine untouchable yes I want 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.150
 it does not reveal too much 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.210
 but one thing I still have to get rid of, after all, is therefore from 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.600
 Modern Warfare 2 may be responsible for putting in bathroom food 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.150
 vhs-course history write for us probably still something learned 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.849
 So first
