major<00:00:20.369> here<00:00:21.029> mainly<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.529> changes<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:22.980> been

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
major here mainly the changes have been

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.269

well<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.519> changes<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.029> been<00:00:25.039> bone<00:00:26.039> tooth

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
well the changes have been bone tooth

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.060 
well the changes have been bone tooth
necklace<00:00:26.789> got<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> slight<00:00:27.630> buff<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.830> gains

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
necklace got a slight buff so it gains

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.130 
necklace got a slight buff so it gains
plus<00:00:29.429> five<00:00:29.699> attack<00:00:30.240> damage<00:00:30.420> right<00:00:30.840> off<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
plus five attack damage right off the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.870 
plus five attack damage right off the
bat<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.500> again<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.040> gets<00:00:32.309> something<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.790> know

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
bat so again it gets something you know

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.770 
bat so again it gets something you know
immediately<00:00:33.239> upon<00:00:33.870> purchase<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> i<00:00:36.540> guess

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
immediately upon purchase so i guess

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.290 
immediately upon purchase so i guess
there's<00:00:36.960> less<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:37.969> immediate<00:00:38.969> sort<00:00:39.149> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
there's less you know immediate sort of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
there's less you know immediate sort of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
a power sink when you spend eight

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.260 
a power sink when you spend eight
hundred<00:00:41.280> gold<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> her

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
hundred gold on it you get a bit of her

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.200 
hundred gold on it you get a bit of her
turn<00:00:42.480> right<00:00:42.750> away<00:00:43.399> still<00:00:44.399> not<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.120> know

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
turn right away still not you know

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
turn right away still not you know
obviously<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.750> worth<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> put<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> gold<00:00:46.680> but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
obviously not worth it to put a gold but

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
obviously not worth it to put a gold but
it<00:00:47.250> builds<00:00:47.430> into<00:00:47.670> things<00:00:47.969> eventually<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
it builds into things eventually so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.380 
it builds into things eventually so
presumably<00:00:49.440> also<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.250> Kazakhs<00:00:50.820> head<00:00:51.090> thing

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
presumably also that Kazakhs head thing

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.639 
presumably also that Kazakhs head thing
or<00:00:51.570> whatever<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> when<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.410> kill

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
or whatever that is when you kill

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.990 
or whatever that is when you kill
Kazakhs<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.340> thing<00:00:53.489> upgrades<00:00:53.820> into

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
Kazakhs that this thing upgrades into

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.549 
Kazakhs that this thing upgrades into
that<00:00:54.149> also<00:00:54.420> will<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.020> basic<00:00:55.379> five

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
that also will have the basic five

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
that also will have the basic five
attack<00:00:55.920> damage<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.699> don't<00:00:56.969> know<00:00:57.090> because

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
attack damage on it I don't know because

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.540 
attack damage on it I don't know because
I<00:00:57.390> haven't<00:00:57.510> confirmed<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.430> assuming<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
I haven't confirmed it but assuming it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.369 
I haven't confirmed it but assuming it
does<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:02.550> other<00:01:02.760> item<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.449> changed<00:01:03.989> was

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
does the other item that was changed was

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.310 
does the other item that was changed was
ice<00:01:04.860> born<00:01:05.369> gauntlet<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.210> frozen<00:01:06.659> gauntlet<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
ice born gauntlet or frozen gauntlet I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.899 
ice born gauntlet or frozen gauntlet I
keep<00:01:07.530> calling<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:08.790> what

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
keep calling because I think that's what

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
keep calling because I think that's what
was<00:01:09.030> originally<00:01:09.210> called<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.320> at<00:01:10.409> any<00:01:10.500> rate

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
was originally called but at any rate

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.240 
was originally called but at any rate
that<00:01:11.460> how<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.119> was<00:01:12.240> changed<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
that how it was changed was the the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
that how it was changed was the the
slope<00:01:14.610> rock<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:15.720> field<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.200> put<00:01:16.380> on

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
slope rock that I see field you put on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.170 
slope rock that I see field you put on
the<00:01:16.560> ground<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.860> hit<00:01:17.220> something<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the ground we hit something with it that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.780 
the ground we hit something with it that
has<00:01:18.479> its<00:01:18.780> duration<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.650> two<00:01:19.710> seconds<00:01:20.640> as

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
has its duration is now two seconds as

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.060 
has its duration is now two seconds as
opposed<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.450> three<00:01:22.140> seconds<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.860> was

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
opposed to three seconds so that was

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
opposed to three seconds so that was
nerfed<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.490> terms<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> duration<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.600> now

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
nerfed in terms of the duration and now

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.109 
nerfed in terms of the duration and now
when<00:01:25.259> range<00:01:25.590> characters<00:01:26.159> use<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.790> only

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
when range characters use it it's only

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.780 
when range characters use it it's only
twenty<00:01:27.479> percent<00:01:27.780> slow<00:01:28.770> before<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.520> used<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.700> be

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
twenty percent slow before it used to be

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.980 
twenty percent slow before it used to be
thirty-five<00:01:30.180> percent<00:01:30.270> whether<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.659> arrange

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
thirty-five percent whether you arrange

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
thirty-five percent whether you arrange
or<00:01:31.320> melee<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.460> that's<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.939> bit<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
or melee or not so that's a bit of a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
or melee or not so that's a bit of a
nerve<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.540> range<00:01:33.780> characters<00:01:34.290> for<00:01:34.890> me

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
nerve for range characters for me

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800 
nerve for range characters for me
personally<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.460> example<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.119> nidalee<00:01:36.659> when

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
personally for example like nidalee when

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
personally for example like nidalee when
she's<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.290> normal<00:01:37.530> spear<00:01:37.920> chucking<00:01:38.159> form<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
she's in a normal spear chucking form I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.819 
she's in a normal spear chucking form I
used<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.110> taken<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> bit

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
used to have that and that's taken a bit

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.380 
used to have that and that's taken a bit
of<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.979> nerf<00:01:41.159> button<00:01:41.490> whatever<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.000> spawn

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
of a nerf button whatever I spawn

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.060 
of a nerf button whatever I spawn
comments<00:01:42.780> still<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> stupid<00:01:43.470> good<00:01:43.799> item

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070

so<00:01:44.520> I'll<00:01:45.360> live<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:47.280> other<00:01:47.490> change<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so I'll live the other change is to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.569 
so I'll live the other change is to
black<00:01:49.229> cleaver<00:01:49.680> which<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.340> kind<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
black cleaver which is kind of

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.830 
black cleaver which is kind of
interesting<00:01:50.790> because<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.540> change

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
interesting because they just change

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.289 
interesting because they just change
this<00:01:51.990> last<00:01:52.259> patch<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.850> sure<00:01:53.880> you're<00:01:54.119> all

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
this last patch as I'm sure you're all

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.740 
this last patch as I'm sure you're all
aware<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.930> took<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.890> nerf<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> flat<00:01:57.329> armor

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
aware it took up nerf to the flat armor

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.350 
aware it took up nerf to the flat armor
penetration<00:01:58.130> by<00:01:59.130> five<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> was<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.329> also

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
penetration by five and it was they also

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
penetration by five and it was they also
made<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.719> unique<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.920> passive<00:02:02.340> was

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
made it unique and the passive was

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.039 
made it unique and the passive was
reduced<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> 6.25<00:02:03.840> per<00:02:04.530> stack<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
reduced to 6.25 per stack so that it

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.180 
reduced to 6.25 per stack so that it
would<00:02:07.170> only<00:02:07.259> stack<00:02:07.560> up<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.710> twenty-five

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
would only stack up to twenty-five

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.750 
would only stack up to twenty-five
percent<00:02:08.459> armor<00:02:09.360> redux<00:02:10.069> now<00:02:11.069> actually<00:02:11.640> they

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
percent armor redux now actually they

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.080 
percent armor redux now actually they
put<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.060> back<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.569> old

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
put it back to the old

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.640 
put it back to the old
not<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> flat<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.050> flat<00:02:14.260> pan<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.560> still

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
not the flat and the flat pan is still

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.619 
not the flat and the flat pan is still
nerved<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.849> they're<00:02:16.150> back<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> old

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
nerved but the they're back to the old

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.130 
nerved but the they're back to the old
figure<00:02:16.980> 7.5<00:02:17.980> percent<00:02:18.670> per<00:02:18.879> stack<00:02:19.269> stacks<00:02:19.959> up

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
figure 7.5 percent per stack stacks up

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.979 
figure 7.5 percent per stack stacks up
before<00:02:20.410> x<00:02:20.650> 2<00:02:20.890> still<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.000> now<00:02:22.209> it's<00:02:22.569> back<00:02:22.750> up<00:02:22.780> to

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
before x 2 still so now it's back up to

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.070 
before x 2 still so now it's back up to
thirty<00:02:23.290> percent<00:02:23.650> armor<00:02:24.069> redox<00:02:24.849> red<00:02:25.239> thing<00:02:25.540> so

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
thirty percent armor redox red thing so

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.180 
thirty percent armor redox red thing so
that's<00:02:26.230> kind<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.500> interesting<00:02:26.650> that's<00:02:26.980> sort

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
that's kind of interesting that's sort

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.420 
that's kind of interesting that's sort
of<00:02:27.220> falling<00:02:27.550> around<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.030> item<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:29.430> guess

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
of falling around to the item I guess

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.789 
of falling around to the item I guess
they<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.629> numbers<00:02:31.959> people<00:02:32.260> declared<00:02:32.620> they

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
they the numbers people declared they

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.619 
they the numbers people declared they
over<00:02:33.099> nerfed<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.549> or<00:02:33.670> something<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.360> that's

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
over nerfed it or something so that's

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.080 
over nerfed it or something so that's
nice<00:02:34.840> because<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.349> abuse<00:02:36.099> black<00:02:36.400> flavor<00:02:36.700> log<00:02:36.940> as

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
nice because I abuse black flavor log as

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.740 
nice because I abuse black flavor log as
a<00:02:37.120> top<00:02:37.390> liner<00:02:37.690> but<00:02:38.760> yeah<00:02:39.760> that's<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.360> item

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
a top liner but yeah that's it for item

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.220
