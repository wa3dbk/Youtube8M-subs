00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.379
 real plane do it yourself 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:04.210
 prove that this is only possible 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.370
 pensioner from the village of Vasilyevka 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.910
 Dnepropetrovsk region flying 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.870
 the apparatus he played for many years uses 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.720
 all so that the shop in-law does not meet 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.849
 happened 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.539
 giddy airplane turn 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.630
 of course can not but able to 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.460
 gain height to speed up 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.409
 180 kilometers an hour 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.720
 Natalia Gryshchenko was convinced of this 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.029
 as far as i'm gigging in the world plane 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.199
 we choose 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.359
 he has 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.419
 and so wants to be held he can not 63 almost 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.670
 as much of his dream after school, Nikolai 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.699
 Larin entered the flight school but 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.320
 the disease prevented him from finishing 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.440
 already working Geneva on the farm man decided 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 try a new few years 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.850
 studied the literature on 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.760
 design reaction so born 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.230
 first drawings need airplane master 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.520
 self-taught built five years on his own 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.190
 the project 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.739
 analogues of this aircraft 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.300
 it doesn't even have a name 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.700
 typical of toronto aircraft 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.110
 in the cockpit 2 place for pilots and passengers 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.930
 fold control panel brake 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.340
 the system is all in place the man speaks 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.940
 it regularly spent all his retirement 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.320
 and that was cheaper stuffing for the aircraft 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.850
 collected on the car market 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.990
 wheels there 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.620
 brake system this motorcycle 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.800
 From the car this is the honda Lada devices 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.850
 we adapted 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.740
 automotive sensors all 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.390
 car rest of course 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.950
 this material is denmark 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.040
 Lenin is all veterans 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.110
 the truth is already in the process of flying into the structure 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.390
 had to redo 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.210
 after one not very good delivery 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.000
 Mechanical KAMAZ creators replaced 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.340
 among debtors and other flights in 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.440
 space 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.150
 now says clicks on the plane 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
 perfectly safe 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.510
 this is a miracle of technology villagers at first 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.710
 scared but now the plane is local 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.830
 Sight 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.850
 Nikolai Lapin changed 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.740
 official powers he 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 so people are used to but 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.010
 further 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.890
 if this is not surprising 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.090
 however, and now the aircraft is almost as strong 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.729
 not waving pensioner found out 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.050
 the aircraft must pass 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.659
 technical expertise and 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.420
 registration 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.099
 the remains you get currency 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.860
 evidence 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.600
 it is expensive but we guarantee 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.670
 safety of the pilot and people around 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.380
 say experienced instructors and here 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.110
 should clearly understand why 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.459
 when automatism 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.590
 against actions that can 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.389
 produce when the engine fails 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.060
 fuel system failure and beyond 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.299
 further further further 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.180
 ready for this 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.229
 your inventor 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.489
 I can not say 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.529
 now nikolaev they pay money on 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.279
 paperwork after all 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:38.839
 he has plans to build 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.109
 new aircraft on a separate long 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.209
 asked to take home on which she will 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.019
 would process the fields 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.209
