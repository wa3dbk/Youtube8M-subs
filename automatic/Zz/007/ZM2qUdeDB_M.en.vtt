00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
when you open the egg I'm assuming

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.560 
when you open the egg I'm assuming
you'll<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> checklist<00:00:45.059> first<00:00:47.570> oh

inside<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:52.010> think<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.820> will

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
inside I think this is so that it will

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.670 
inside I think this is so that it will
prevent<00:00:54.300> people<00:00:54.690> from<00:00:54.899> looking<00:00:55.410> through<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
prevent people from looking through the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.130 
prevent people from looking through the
hole<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.219> these<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.239> cells<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
