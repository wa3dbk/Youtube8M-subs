hi this is Shana a third foundation and

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.659 
hi this is Shana a third foundation and
we<00:00:03.810> are<00:00:04.080> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.499> do<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.649> quick<00:00:04.859> tutorial<00:00:05.069> here

00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:05.669 
we are going to do a quick tutorial here

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.300 
we are going to do a quick tutorial here
of<00:00:05.970> how<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.240> build<00:00:06.959> a<00:00:07.169> building<00:00:07.470> in<00:00:07.859> blender

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.310 
of how to build a building in blender

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.510 
of how to build a building in blender
and<00:00:08.520> get<00:00:09.060> it<00:00:09.180> into<00:00:09.450> UDK<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.950> we're<00:00:11.370> going<00:00:11.490> to

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
and get it into UDK and we're going to

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.370 
and get it into UDK and we're going to
start<00:00:11.730> all<00:00:11.970> the<00:00:12.090> way<00:00:12.120> from<00:00:12.290> creating<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
start all the way from creating the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.050 
start all the way from creating the
texture<00:00:13.770> all<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.190> way<00:00:14.310> into<00:00:14.520> the<00:00:14.670> UDK

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:15.060 
texture all the way into the UDK

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.880 
texture all the way into the UDK
including<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.810> clipping<00:00:16.379> mask<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.740> that<00:00:16.770> you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
including a clipping mask so that you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.650 
including a clipping mask so that you
can<00:00:17.010> see<00:00:17.190> through<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.550> building<00:00:17.850> let's<00:00:18.450> get

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
can see through the building let's get

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
can see through the building let's get
started<00:00:19.050> here<00:00:19.260> we're<00:00:19.770> going<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.980> go<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.100> CD

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
started here we're going to go to CD

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.700 
started here we're going to go to CD
textures<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.030> find<00:00:21.450> this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> best<00:00:22.350> place

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
textures to find this is the best place

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.560 
textures to find this is the best place
i<00:00:22.860> think<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.280> to<00:00:23.430> find<00:00:23.670> textures<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.119> are<00:00:24.270> for

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
i think is to find textures that are for

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.080 
i think is to find textures that are for
free<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.710> i'm<00:00:25.890> looking<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.490> building<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
free and i'm looking for a building that

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.720 
free and i'm looking for a building that
gives<00:00:27.510> me<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:27.930> form<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.529> top<00:00:28.920> middle<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
gives me some form of a top middle and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.310 
gives me some form of a top middle and
bottom<00:00:29.850> it<00:00:30.270> took<00:00:30.449> me<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.690> get<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.930> all<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.109> way

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
bottom it took me to get to all the way

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.110 
bottom it took me to get to all the way
to<00:00:31.380> ninth<00:00:31.740> page<00:00:32.129> here<00:00:32.489> until<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.730> finally<00:00:32.970> found

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
to ninth page here until I finally found

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.810 
to ninth page here until I finally found
a<00:00:33.540> building<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.050> fit<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.470> criteria<00:00:34.820> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
a building that fit that criteria so

we're going to open up that building

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
we're going to open up that building
we're<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> save<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:39.180> building<00:00:39.720> I've

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
textures I'm going to go into buildings

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.390 
textures I'm going to go into buildings
and<00:01:09.690> then<00:01:10.229> we're<00:01:10.409> looking<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> one<00:01:11.159> for

ok again we've got a bottom in middle
and<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> top<00:01:15.900> i<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:17.070> want<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.549> roof<00:01:17.729> texture

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and a top i also want that roof texture

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.230 
and a top i also want that roof texture
so<00:01:18.390> let's<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.689> ahead<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> open<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:20.240> 3d

so let's go ahead and open that up 3d

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.190 
so let's go ahead and open that up 3d
textures<00:01:21.659> go<00:01:22.590> down<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.130> roof<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.960> there<00:01:24.960> is

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
textures go down to roof and there is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
textures go down to roof and there is
our<00:01:25.470> roof<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> demo<00:01:26.189> ok<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:26.670> i<00:01:26.700> got<00:01:26.909> our

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.550 
our roof for the demo ok now i got our
two<00:01:27.119> textures<00:01:27.390> let's<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.140> ahead<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.380> get

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
two textures let's go ahead and get

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.679 
two textures let's go ahead and get
started<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:28.979> i'm<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.610> ctrl<00:01:30.000> +<00:01:30.299> to

the tree looks like I got a little bit

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.870 
the tree looks like I got a little bit
out<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.080> control<00:03:11.440> there<00:03:11.709> on<00:03:11.920> my<00:03:12.069> flume<00:03:12.340> that's

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
out of control there on my flume that's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.860 
out of control there on my flume that's
fine<00:03:13.350> let's<00:03:14.350> bring<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.400> back<00:03:15.790> over<00:03:16.060> here<00:03:18.870> and

fine let's bring this back over here and
actually<00:03:20.350> let's<00:03:20.620> start<00:03:20.859> over<00:03:20.920> here<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.370> we

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
actually let's start over here so we

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.310 
actually let's start over here so we
have<00:03:21.549> an<00:03:21.640> anchor<00:03:21.790> bring<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.840> guy<00:03:23.049> like<00:03:23.290> that

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
have an anchor bring this guy like that

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.770 
have an anchor bring this guy like that
and<00:03:23.799> let's<00:03:24.430> bring<00:03:24.609> this<00:03:24.790> back<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.239> life<00:03:25.420> over

and let's bring this back to life over
here<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:29.070> we'll<00:03:30.070> just<00:03:30.310> make<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.579> window

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
here and we'll just make that window

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.759 
here and we'll just make that window
look<00:03:31.000> good<00:03:31.180> ok<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.600> think<00:03:31.810> that's<00:03:32.079> fine<00:03:32.380> not

going<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.150> ignore<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:10.660> one<00:05:10.840> imap<00:05:11.200> the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
going to ignore that one imap the

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.820 
going to ignore that one imap the
texture<00:05:11.740> onto<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.130> object<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.820> tool<00:05:13.120> and

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
texture onto the object in the tool and

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.680 
texture onto the object in the tool and
then<00:05:14.830> we<00:05:15.160> are<00:05:15.370> good<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:15.790> we've<00:05:15.940> got<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.330> bottle

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
then we are good so we've got a bottle

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.390 
then we are good so we've got a bottle
we<00:05:16.990> got<00:05:17.140> a<00:05:17.169> middle<00:05:17.470> we<00:05:17.680> have<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.800> top<00:05:18.070> now<00:05:18.340> we

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
we got a middle we have a top now we

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.840 
we got a middle we have a top now we
need<00:05:18.610> our<00:05:18.790> roof<00:05:19.030> texture<00:05:19.450> i'm<00:05:20.320> going<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.860> copy

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
quality of this to be quite honest so it

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.390 
quality of this to be quite honest so it
can<00:05:31.750> be<00:05:31.810> quite<00:05:32.080> low<00:05:32.260> I<00:05:32.500> will<00:05:32.979> put<00:05:33.160> this<00:05:33.250> over

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
can be quite low I will put this over

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.580 
can be quite low I will put this over
here<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.910> will<00:05:34.240> rotate<00:05:34.690> it<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:34.960> little<00:05:35.110> bit<00:05:35.320> using

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
here I will rotate it a little bit using

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.409 
here I will rotate it a little bit using
the<00:05:35.770> shift<00:05:35.979> key<00:05:36.160> to<00:05:36.280> get<00:05:36.430> sort<00:05:37.090> of<00:05:37.180> I<00:05:37.360> don't

know 45 degree increments or whatever I

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.050

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
get this image a little bit honed in so

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.600 
get this image a little bit honed in so
i'm<00:05:47.560> going<00:05:47.650> to<00:05:47.740> hold<00:05:47.830> down<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.100> shift<00:05:48.130> key<00:05:48.370> i'm

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
i'm going to hold down the shift key i'm

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.830 
i'm going to hold down the shift key i'm
going<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:48.850> select<00:05:49.030> i'm<00:05:49.360> trying<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:49.690> make<00:05:49.750> a

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
going to select i'm trying to make a

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.890 
going to select i'm trying to make a
square<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.860> fits<00:05:51.370> this<00:05:51.669> just<00:05:52.120> right<00:05:52.690> like

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
square that fits this just right like

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.740 
square that fits this just right like
that<00:05:53.430> we're<00:05:54.430> going<00:05:54.550> to<00:05:54.640> do<00:05:54.789> image<00:05:55.240> we're<00:05:55.600> going

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
that we're going to do image we're going

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.930 
that we're going to do image we're going
to<00:05:55.870> do<00:05:55.960> crop<00:05:56.440> now<00:05:57.130> we<00:05:57.190> need<00:05:57.280> to<00:05:57.400> get<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.700> back

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
to do crop now we need to get it back

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.870 
to do crop now we need to get it back
into<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.390> factor<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:59.080> 10<00:05:59.800> 24<00:06:00.310> so<00:06:00.550> we're<00:06:00.669> gonna<00:06:00.760> do

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
into a factor of 10 24 so we're gonna do

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.060 
into a factor of 10 24 so we're gonna do
image<00:06:01.210> size<00:06:01.440> we're<00:06:02.440> gonna<00:06:02.530> bring<00:06:02.680> this<00:06:02.740> back

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
image size we're gonna bring this back

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.250 
image size we're gonna bring this back
to<00:06:03.240> 1024<00:06:05.789> it<00:06:06.789> is<00:06:06.970> proportional<00:06:07.660> so<00:06:07.960> it<00:06:08.140> will

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
to 1024 it is proportional so it will

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.790 
to 1024 it is proportional so it will
make<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.620> height<00:06:08.890> 1024<00:06:09.669> as<00:06:09.820> well<00:06:10.030> and<00:06:10.800> one

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
make the height 1024 as well and one

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.290 
make the height 1024 as well and one

last thing here let's polish the image

here<00:06:53.810> now<00:06:54.260> what<00:06:54.410> we<00:06:54.500> need<00:06:54.530> to<00:06:54.650> do<00:06:54.890> is<00:06:54.950> create<00:06:55.160> a

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
here now what we need to do is create a

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.350 
here now what we need to do is create a
clipping<00:06:55.430> mask<00:06:55.610> want<00:06:55.970> to<00:06:56.030> hold<00:06:56.150> down<00:06:56.270> the

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
clipping mask want to hold down the

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.390 
clipping mask want to hold down the
control<00:06:56.750> key<00:06:56.780> I'm<00:06:57.200> going<00:06:57.560> to<00:06:57.680> click<00:06:57.920> on<00:06:58.130> the

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
control key I'm going to click on the

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.310 
control key I'm going to click on the
image<00:06:58.700> over<00:06:58.910> here<00:06:58.940> in<00:06:59.120> the<00:06:59.210> layers<00:06:59.420> thing<00:06:59.720> now

image over here in the layers thing now

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.810 
image over here in the layers thing now
you'll<00:07:00.560> see<00:07:00.620> it's<00:07:00.830> selected<00:07:01.280> everything<00:07:01.670> that

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
you'll see it's selected everything that

you'll see it's selected everything that
is<00:07:01.940> the<00:07:02.570> image<00:07:03.200> now<00:07:03.530> i'm<00:07:03.620> going<00:07:03.800> to<00:07:03.890> create<00:07:04.160> a

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
is the image now i'm going to create a

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.100 
is the image now i'm going to create a
clipping<00:07:04.730> mask<00:07:04.910> by<00:07:05.270> going<00:07:05.540> with<00:07:05.690> channels

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
clipping mask by going with channels

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.930 
clipping mask by going with channels
clicking<00:07:06.920> this<00:07:07.070> little<00:07:07.400> button<00:07:07.700> over<00:07:07.910> here

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
and now I've got an alpha channel okay

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.640 
and now I've got an alpha channel okay
so<00:07:10.940> we're<00:07:11.120> done<00:07:11.150> with<00:07:11.390> our<00:07:11.540> texture<00:07:11.990> we're

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
so we're done with our texture we're

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.170 
so we're done with our texture we're
going<00:07:12.740> to<00:07:12.830> save<00:07:13.130> we<00:07:13.550> have<00:07:13.640> to<00:07:13.730> save<00:07:13.880> two
