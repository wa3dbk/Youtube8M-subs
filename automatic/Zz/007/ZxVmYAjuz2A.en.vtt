00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
great setting to start off with so let's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.260 
great setting to start off with so let's
go<00:00:54.780> ahead<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.860> quickly<00:00:56.129> jump<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
go ahead and just quickly jump down to

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
go ahead and just quickly jump down to
this<00:00:57.390> bottom<00:00:57.870> row<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.590> are<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:59.010> techniques

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this bottom row these are the techniques

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.670 
this bottom row these are the techniques
so<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.449> pick<00:01:00.660> stitch<00:01:01.050> number<00:01:01.289> or

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
so as you pick stitch number or

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.950 
so as you pick stitch number or
technique<00:01:02.190> number<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.239> gonna<00:01:03.420> say<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
technique number one it's gonna say a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.459 
technique number one it's gonna say a
seam<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.039> seam<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.209> to<00:01:06.539> be<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.259> this

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
seam so a seam is going to be on this

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.649 
seam so a seam is going to be on this
heavier<00:01:08.009> fabric<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.759> gonna<00:01:08.939> show<00:01:09.389> you<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
heavier fabric it's gonna show you a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.039 
heavier fabric it's gonna show you a
longer<00:01:10.319> stitch<00:01:11.159> length<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:11.999> a

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
longer stitch length if we do a

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.599 
longer stitch length if we do a
lightweight<00:01:13.049> fabric<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.889> look<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> stitch

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
lightweight fabric well look the stitch

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.849 
lightweight fabric well look the stitch
length<00:01:14.789> changes<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.420> two<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.109> knows<00:01:16.529> that

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:16.859 
length changes to two it knows that

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.649 
length changes to two it knows that
those<00:01:17.039> are<00:01:17.279> their<00:01:17.399> correct<00:01:17.819> settings<00:01:18.420> for

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
those are their correct settings for

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.959 
those are their correct settings for
that<00:01:18.689> fabric<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:20.159> other<00:01:20.369> thing<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.700> it's

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
that fabric one other thing that it's

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.120 
that fabric one other thing that it's
going<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.209> also<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.079> adjust<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.709> pressure

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
going to also do is adjust the pressure

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.399 
going to also do is adjust the pressure
of<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.639> foot<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.149> makes<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> more<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.139> less

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
of the foot and makes it more or less

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
of the foot and makes it more or less
depending<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.069> your<00:01:26.279> fabric<00:01:26.789> that<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> choose

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
so let's go on de and F are gonna be for

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.879 
so let's go on de and F are gonna be for
stretch<00:01:32.819> fabrics<00:01:33.359> we<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.689> stretch<00:01:34.109> lite<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:34.889

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the needle position to be in a different

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.639 
the needle position to be in a different
location<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:42.329> nice<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.469> you're<00:01:43.619> a
