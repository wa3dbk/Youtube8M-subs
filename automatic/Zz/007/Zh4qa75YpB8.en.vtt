00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.580
 and now from me and to all of you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.490
 again the players today will tell you how 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.389
 make an animated header for the channel 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.000
 youtube 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.789
 and if you still don't know now 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.689
 youtube could be made animated 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.099
 hats it seemed to me very cool you 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.470
 can go to the dog station and somehow 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.449
 Looks at all and today I will tell you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.239
 how to do it but found it at all like this 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.040
 do it on Americans but he did by 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.290
 his team play that is the case on its 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.270
 in its own way photoshop source but you can 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.940
 make a completely different way and easier not 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.190
 download it to any source and there 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 You can do the same in Photoshop through 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.460
 the usual template is sharp and that looks like 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.760
 so here we open it with photoshop 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 here it opens like this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 so it opens further we 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.760
 we take we need wallpaper that is the background i 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.790
 chose such matter author wallpaper 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.159
 transfer them to photoshop so here 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.170
 stretch to the size we need but me 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.330
 seems to start stretching better for the whole 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.450
 screen 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 so then we will just have to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.820
 overlay text 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.030
 let's say i use a font with the same bodice 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:35.909
 plums anger somehow so he pronounced 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:40.250
 write your text so do I have that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.570
 such a goal flanger 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.930
 write us the right text from me and so 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.920
 validation on the name of the channel 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.920
 and basically like this we can do it in 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.960
 two appearances but it will take in my 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.049
 more space and not always succeed 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.180
 can do it because yu tuba 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.770
 only allowed no more than two megabytes 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.530
 do 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.070
 with two texts over there 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.580
 somehow 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.739
 it is very difficult because it takes 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.830
 too much space and a cap a cap may 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.900
 do not boot so choose we wrote 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.900
 text choose the style I choose 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.340
 any 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:29.269
 something like that now so 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.750
 so you can basically now in general 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.640
 choose a lot of styles but 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.579
 throw them to you as if they were mini 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.340
 too much but let's say this 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.989
 croquettes cues tire eyes beautiful style 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.150
 so further open here the scale 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.329
 timeline or timeline right here 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.920
 she will press her like that once 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:56.780
 it will open here like this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.120
 but we can also remove this one now. 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.480
 layer we don't need we can change you 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.030
 such a view by pressing this button and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.470
 next we can do it turns out well 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.180
 the appearance of the text for example as you can see here 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.359
 so new layer several new layers 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.139
 do on the first with us he will 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:19.489
 opacity on the day itself here and so 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:22.630
 so here it is, it will be 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.970
 opacity for example like this 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.850
 farther here so here as a thread here so here 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:33.440
 further will be the opacity even more 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.620
 it's like this here, and then we will 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.670
 one hundred percent opacity 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.420
 now we ourselves what it looks like 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.540
 so the appearance here needs to be changed 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.430
 than a little here about 02 so he doesn't 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.489
 lingered for 5 seconds it's too 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.900
 much the latter can also be two 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.650
 seconds let's say it will be 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.970
 look more beautiful well, as both a 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:04.849
 something like this 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.549
 you so so so the appearance of the appearance 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.470
 you can now see how much it will be 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:14.120
 weigh so press file save for 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.760
 web choose oh damn it weighs more 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.989
 so 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.440
 need to change something so constantly 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.460
 cancellation so cancel try if we have 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.729
 change style 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.639
 it's anything at all like something will change 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:33.300
 can such a teacher be put like this 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.350
 save for the web and there still on 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.699
 to my i'm not sure help also 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:44.460
 check everything so dip yes without any 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:48.169
 style save for web well a little 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.110
 changing but still too much 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.940
 she is here because we have here like this 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:05:00.360
 try to change the style here too 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:02.039
 all so we choose the style of the player from him 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.639
 so ordinary 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:11.010
 both pictures are style mark he looks at all 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:11.550
 so here this one but in principle in my 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.520
 not bad 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:20.160
 I do not know how to do it at all but in my opinion 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.139
 so nice now and on this 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.289
 where is the last opacity here 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.550
 also put this style all in principle 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.550

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.110
