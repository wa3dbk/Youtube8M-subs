badass<00:01:49.979> um<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.079> wasn't<00:01:52.649> too<00:01:52.829> thrilled

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
badass um you know I wasn't too thrilled

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.060 
badass um you know I wasn't too thrilled
about<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.540> first<00:01:54.570> but<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.439> graphics<00:01:55.680> are

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
about it at first but the graphics are

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
about it at first but the graphics are
beautiful<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.790> look<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.360> won't<00:01:57.570> age

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
beautiful they look like they won't age

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.649 
beautiful they look like they won't age
as<00:01:58.079> fast<00:01:58.460> because<00:01:59.460> cartooning<00:01:59.969> graphics<00:02:00.360> tend

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
as fast because cartooning graphics tend

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.620 
as fast because cartooning graphics tend
to<00:02:00.810> last<00:02:01.079> longer<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.180> looking

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to last longer and you know just looking

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.200 
to last longer and you know just looking
at<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> maps<00:02:04.310> they<00:02:05.310> look<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.880> could<00:02:05.939> be

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
at the maps they look like they could be

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.980 
at the maps they look like they could be
huge

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
huge

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.880 
huge
it<00:02:07.990> does<00:02:08.170> look<00:02:08.289> like<00:02:08.380> you're<00:02:08.560> going<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.830> get

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
it does look like you're going to get

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.410 
it does look like you're going to get
different<00:02:09.130> mounts<00:02:09.580> as<00:02:09.670> well<00:02:09.849> we<00:02:10.060> saw<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.239> few

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
different mounts as well we saw a few

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.500 
different mounts as well we saw a few
people<00:02:10.720> writing<00:02:11.050> mounts<00:02:11.380> such<00:02:11.860> as<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.130> sheep

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
people writing mounts such as the sheep

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.640 
people writing mounts such as the sheep
it<00:02:13.510> looks<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:13.780> there<00:02:13.900> will<00:02:13.959> be<00:02:14.080> minigame

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
it looks like there will be minigame

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.949 
it looks like there will be minigame
stuff<00:02:15.010> which<00:02:15.730> we<00:02:16.000> saw<00:02:16.209> like<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.510> falling

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
stuff which we saw like the falling

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.479 
stuff which we saw like the falling
blocks<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.440> platform<00:02:17.860> everyone<00:02:18.250> trying

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
blocks in the platform everyone trying

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.880 
blocks in the platform everyone trying
to<00:02:18.550> stay<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.849> middle<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.500> geek<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.620> climb

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
to stay in the middle and geek a climb

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.360 
to stay in the middle and geek a climb
which<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.400> pretty<00:02:22.000> cool<00:02:22.349> but<00:02:23.349> my<00:02:24.130> main

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
which is pretty cool but my main

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.820 
which is pretty cool but my main
question<00:02:24.610> right<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.440> what's<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.590> max

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
question right now is what's the max

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.240 
question right now is what's the max
level<00:02:27.069> how<00:02:27.910> does<00:02:28.180> each<00:02:28.450> class<00:02:28.780> play<00:02:29.680> because

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
level how does each class play because

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.470 
level how does each class play because
we<00:02:30.370> pretty<00:02:30.550> much<00:02:30.610> only<00:02:30.819> really<00:02:31.209> saw<00:02:31.420> a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480

we pretty much only really saw a
swordsman<00:02:32.200> I'm<00:02:32.709> pretty<00:02:33.010> sure<00:02:33.099> that<00:02:33.220> was<00:02:33.340> a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
swordsman I'm pretty sure that was a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.089 
swordsman I'm pretty sure that was a
berserker<00:02:33.910> or<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.959> night<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:35.769> more<00:02:35.950> like
