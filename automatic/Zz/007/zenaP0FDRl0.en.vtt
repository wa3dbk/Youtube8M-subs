00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.120
 all good guys here came in 60 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.459
 minutes my channel how to see we are 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.170
 up to 14 as you can read from 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.599
 title we are here to see mine 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.029
 training on the fifa ultimate team e 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.250
 therefore also to advise me some 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.680
 player to buy for those who want 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.910
 to become the Italian team 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.490
 before starting to see in detail 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.210
 every player wanted to talk to you for a moment 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.580
 of the form 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.010
 I wanted to tell you that the form I use is 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:40.120
 a 3 4 2 1 and I'm really enjoying it 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.280
 because more or less it is very clear and very 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.420
 offensive is played very well indeed 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.120
 I really find myself with this module 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.030
 very well so I wanted to advise you 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 also this time we start from the goalkeeper 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.129
 that as you can see from the photo and reina 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.590
 rain is a goalkeeper I like 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.660
 really so much I had already heard 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.390
 speak very well of him but I had it 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.910
 I also tried in fifa 13 is 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.910
 really very strong and it costs very little 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.060
 because it costs 900 and is very strong 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.280
 therefore as a goalkeeper of reina council 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.789
 as for the defense we have 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.110
 campagnaro benatia and jokes 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.759
 of course these are not i 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.209
 strongest defenders of the series but who 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.060
 there will also be missing chiellini e 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:31.750
 several others, however, are the ones that cost 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.429
 a little less and they are also strong 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.770
 so this one here 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.450
 these here are players for whom to 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.520
 who wanted to make the team I was or not 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.590
 wants to spend a lot 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.380
 therefore for the defense we campagnaro 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.909
 which cost 750 3d so here I was 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.079
 very little 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.179
 he is a good defender and so there he is 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:56.740
 advice for the other two we have 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:59.020
 I found jokes in the package 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.049
 gold, however, I would have bought it 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.899
 himself or he or o bonucci, however, the real one 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.959
 bought one of the two because I like it 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.509
 a lot as a player and cost around 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.040
 1000 1200 if I 'm not mistaken or you can 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.660
 find even less but I have been 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.400
 lucky I found it in the packages e 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.560
 so i keep it 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.510
 instead at the center of the defense we have 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.440
 well know who knows that I bought it too 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.860
 with the understanding the guard does not exempt and has 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.989
 improved dribbling and defense 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.780
 tip and let's go and see for a moment the 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.519
 I paid as you can see 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.440
 1500 credits so a little more 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.260
 compared to the other defenders however it is 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.760
 very strong and I need to be really 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.879
 much and as you can see from the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.359
 statistics at 73 speed which is a lot 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.609
 for a defender cia 84 of defense e 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.220
 the other statistics are also 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.049
 quite good so let's move on to 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.130
 midfield the two midfielders are 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:03:00.730
 guarin and marchisio pass we begin by 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.769
 the guarin I paid 1400 so also 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.400
 this I paid very little and a lot 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.560
 as strong as you can see from the statistics at 82 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.200
 shooting from two passing and I 'm at 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.540
 training dribbling defense good speed 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.870
 good so it's a very very player 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.060
 strong in all departments let's say it 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.730
 bought dante with the understanding director and the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.799
 seed is really a lot and so there it is 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.859
 I recommend the second midfielder e 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.459
 marchisio that I paid 1400 so a 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.139
 little less 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:36.160
 it seems to me it is almost equal to guarin e 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.780
 you're doing me a lot too maybe me 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.810
 is also doing a little more guarin 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.349
 because it 's also making me many goals 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.840
 of the shot is very good when pulling puts 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.440
 the goalkeeper is always in trouble or 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.230
 makes goals 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.970
 so i'm really enjoying it and it costs 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.640
 little 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.800
 now let's move on to outsiders 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.830
 here you see that square now 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.890
 injured, however, is the owner of mine 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.569
 team and I paid 1300 and in my opinion 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.580
 it is very little for a player of 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.620
 square of the caliber of square because 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.140
 if we look at the statistics cia 93 di 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.350
 speed at 87 dribbling then 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.269
 on the band runs a lot and on 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.859
 band speed and dribbling are 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.880
 fundamental so I would buy it 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.800
 immediately and 1300 are also few for one 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.230
 player as square instead 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.250
 on the other hand we have and will be this 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.940
 dear el shaarawy 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.430
 I paid 4,300 credits perhaps the 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.610
 a little too little though not less 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.150
 it was or rather not made reality for me 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.730
 it seems I bought it right away and spent it 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.830
 really a lot for el sharaawy and seeing 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.290
 the statistics are pretty good 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.790
 speed trivini shooting are very good 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.919
 the statistics, however, I bought it 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.290
 as a left external however 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.300
 looking back, I could have bought it 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.100
 as a left striker to put on 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.150
 mertens place but now I have it 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.310
 bought spent 4,300 and credits and is 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.960
 also engine 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.590
 so he increased the speed on 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.120
 dribbling and passing therefore for 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.039
 now I don't keep it here then maybe it 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.909
 I will move forward 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.610
 now let's move on to the 3 d attacks I vi 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:22.189
 I recommend mertens on the left because 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.490
 it costs as little as all the players 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:27.680
 that we have seen 953 of and it is a lot 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.050
 fast has a good shot a good dribbling 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.879
 so it's essential for an attacker 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.830
 it is fine 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.139
 I paid very little and I don't keep it that way 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.300
 then when I have more credits 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.069
 I'll replace it anyway I'll always keep it 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.050
 as a reserve as an excellent reserve 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:47.319
 because I 'm really playing a lot 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:52.669
 well instead at the center we have higuain 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:55.310
 rewind I paid in 1300 and I think it 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.710
 little for a player like higuain then 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.120
 turning ta turning a little between the rods ho 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.370
 since you can find even less 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.249
 I saw an auction that even expired 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.199
 600 for someone like a higuain that I have him 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:09.830
 paid 1300 but that's okay 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:13.789
 he is a strong striker is certainly not a 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:17.810
 strong striker we say because at 1 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:20.509
 84 But in my opinion there before it takes 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.189
 a much stronger player however in 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.889
 Italy if we see few we could 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:27.259
 take one as i know balotelli that is 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.569
 a pontine can not speed then the 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.379
 it costs a lot and therefore for the 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.279
 moment is fine 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:36.379
 higuain is fine higuain and instead 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.229
 now let's move on to the last one 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:42.399
 the last player and look for me I have it 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:46.310
 paid 1800 mah in my opinion 

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:49.819
 cerci is a player who is worth a lot 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:53.149
 it is worth not know but the ten thousand you believe of 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:56.689
 sure because it is very strong but it is 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:59.689
 fast he has a good dribbling shot it is 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.230
 very strong so I recommend it 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.580
 certainly 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.980
 a player I recommend will resume 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.500
 absolutely any information 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.970
 you have any module you use 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:15.060
 you are looking for because cerci is very strong and therefore 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.860
 we're done with mine mine 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.860
 training I hope this video that is 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.750
 was useful for and gave you gods 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.680
 tips to form your 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.960
 team 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.780
 so now as you can see gods 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.660
 off the bench is not yet done 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.090
 let's say because I'm just playing on 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.220
 but the ultimate team will soon be buying 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:38.310
 also some slightly substitutes 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.920
 name as a property 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.610
 as for the door I wanted to press rafael 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.690
 de napoli 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:47.310
 so now let's see some and I wanted to 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.040
 also take iturbe because I saw 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.930
 that tube really fast and therefore 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.520
 just buy the other players e 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.990
 will put the team in place a little 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.580
 I'll take someone off somebody 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.260
 even stronger then when I have 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.150
 still other credits 

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.130
 I will make another video where he lives I will do 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.830
 so see these are the ones here 

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.900
 my tips for last cool teams 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.010
 I hope the video was useful we 

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.350
 let's see with an upcoming video 

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:12.180
