going<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> little<00:01:01.109> bit<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> direction

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
going to be a little bit of a direction

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.350 
going to be a little bit of a direction
I<00:01:02.309> think<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.850> far<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.899> linear<00:01:04.280> I

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
I think as far as like a more linear I

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.560 
I think as far as like a more linear I
maybe<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.570> hand-holding<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.229> more<00:01:07.920> linear

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.310 

gameplay<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.580> they<00:01:12.760> do<00:01:12.820> say<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.720> even<00:01:14.200> with

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
gameplay and they do say that even with

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.210 
gameplay and they do say that even with
those<00:01:14.530> influences<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.910> obvious

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
those influences and the obvious

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390 
those influences and the obvious
remnants<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.370> look<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:19.000> Minecraft<00:01:19.870> that<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
remnants and look to Minecraft that it

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.270 
remnants and look to Minecraft that it
is<00:01:21.700> going<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.120> have<00:01:22.900> featured<00:01:23.710> some<00:01:23.950> unique

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
is going to have featured some unique

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.610 
is going to have featured some unique
depth<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.030> sophistication<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
depth and sophistication and the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.890 
depth and sophistication and the
graphics<00:01:27.010> do<00:01:27.160> look<00:01:27.370> pretty<00:01:28.300> interesting

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
graphics do look pretty interesting

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.050 
graphics do look pretty interesting
let's<00:01:29.170> get<00:01:29.350> started<00:01:29.800> here<00:01:30.190> we<00:01:30.370> recurring<00:01:30.970> the

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
let's get started here we recurring the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.930 
let's get started here we recurring the
world<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.540> can<00:01:31.720> see<00:01:31.750> all<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.440> maps<00:01:32.710> are<00:01:33.100> all

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
world you can see all the maps are all

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.020 
world you can see all the maps are all
the<00:01:34.150> menu<00:01:34.540> items<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.260> far<00:01:35.290> very<00:01:36.280> much<00:01:36.550> resemble

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
the menu items so far very much resemble

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.000 
the menu items so far very much resemble
minecraft<00:01:37.540> we're<00:01:38.229> going<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.440> go<00:01:38.620> ahead<00:01:38.770> and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
minecraft we're going to go ahead and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.670 
minecraft we're going to go ahead and
switch<00:01:39.160> this<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.870> freestyle<00:01:40.870> this<00:01:41.260> is<00:01:41.410> sort<00:01:41.620> of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
switch this to freestyle this is sort of

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.430 
switch this to freestyle this is sort of
like<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.010> creative<00:01:42.490> version<00:01:43.150> that<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:44.290> were

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
like the creative version that we were

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.100 
like the creative version that we were
playing<00:01:44.710> Minecraft<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.450> we'll<00:01:46.630> go<00:01:46.780> ahead<00:01:46.810> and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
playing Minecraft so we'll go ahead and

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.570 
playing Minecraft so we'll go ahead and
just<00:01:47.259> create<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.619> new<00:01:47.770> world<00:01:47.979> even<00:01:48.430> though<00:01:48.550> I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
just create a new world even though I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.320 
just create a new world even though I
have<00:01:48.759> some<00:01:48.970> start<00:01:49.300> there<00:01:50.910> this<00:01:51.910> has<00:01:52.119> been

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
have some start there this has been

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.900 
have some start there this has been
sucking<00:01:52.720> down<00:01:52.900> my<00:01:53.229> frames<00:01:53.979> per<00:01:54.250> second<00:01:54.729> I

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
sucking down my frames per second I

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.450 
sucking down my frames per second I
turned<00:01:55.630> up<00:01:55.869> all<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.410> graphical<00:01:56.890> settings<00:01:57.130> as

high as I possibly could and it just

sure<00:02:09.369> why<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.840> actually<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.620> started<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.340> so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
sure why it actually just started to so

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.039 
sure why it actually just started to so
it<00:02:13.810> could<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.170> independent<00:02:14.500> or<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.310> could<00:02:15.519> be

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
it could be independent or it could be

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.420 
it could be independent or it could be
you<00:02:17.049> know<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.620> something<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.040> just

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
you know just something that just

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.030 
you know just something that just
started<00:02:18.910> now<00:02:19.480> as<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.140> right<00:02:20.920> away

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
started now as you can see right away

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.070 
started now as you can see right away
that<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.790> definitely<00:02:23.910> back<00:02:25.080> sophistication

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
that is definitely back sophistication

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.810 
that is definitely back sophistication
we're<00:02:26.350> talking<00:02:26.769> about<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:29.370> we're<00:02:30.370> losing

we're talking about and we're losing

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.210 
we're talking about and we're losing
framerate<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:32.140> crazy<00:02:32.590> here<00:02:33.010> but<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:36.010> water

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
framerate like crazy here but the water

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.880 
framerate like crazy here but the water
you<00:02:36.580> can<00:02:36.760> see<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.060> definitely<00:02:40.049> on<00:02:41.049> the

you can see is definitely on the
realistic<00:02:42.489> side<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.299> way<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.540> kind<00:02:43.750> of

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
realistic side in a way it kind of

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.550 
realistic side in a way it kind of
reminds<00:02:44.260> me<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:45.269> what<00:02:46.269> would<00:02:46.420> happen<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:46.930> you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
reminds me of what would happen if you

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.310 
reminds me of what would happen if you
took<00:02:47.830> minecraft<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.940> then<00:02:49.600> just<00:02:50.080> start

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
took minecraft and then just start

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.860 
took minecraft and then just start
plugging<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.920> tons<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.549> textures<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.209> and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
plugging in tons of textures and and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.190 
plugging in tons of textures and and
some<00:02:53.440> kind<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.769> filters<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.510> know<00:02:55.660> coding

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
some kind of filters and you know coding

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.490 
some kind of filters and you know coding
packs<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:56.860> something<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.930> change<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
packs or something to change the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.789 
packs or something to change the
aesthetics<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.230> first<00:03:02.500> look

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
go back out towards the water and maybe

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.969 
go back out towards the water and maybe
try<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:16.900> go<00:04:17.109> around<00:04:17.290> this<00:04:17.440> way<00:04:17.500> a<00:04:18.010> little<00:04:18.250> bit

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.520 

water<00:04:23.979> you<00:04:24.580> can't<00:04:24.850> do<00:04:25.390> this<00:04:25.570> kind<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.930> bogging

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
water you can't do this kind of bogging

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.810 
water you can't do this kind of bogging
up<00:04:26.650> or<00:04:26.800> down<00:04:26.979> in<00:04:27.280> water<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:30.160> never<00:04:30.400> stay

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
up or down in water you never stay

our breath for a pre-alpha

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.760 
our breath for a pre-alpha
it's<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:48.940> very<00:04:49.180> solid<00:04:49.780> seems<00:04:50.320> like<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> solid

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
it's a very solid seems like a solid

it's a very solid seems like a solid
billet<00:04:53.700> there's<00:04:54.700> probably<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.120> lot<00:04:55.300> of<00:04:55.740> coding

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
billet there's probably a lot of coding

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.920 
billet there's probably a lot of coding
issues<00:04:57.130> being<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.550> nice<00:04:57.850> little<00:04:58.150> project<00:04:58.450> there

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
issues being a nice little project there

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.290 
issues being a nice little project there
might<00:04:59.110> be<00:04:59.140> a<00:04:59.320> lot<00:04:59.530> of<00:04:59.560> code<00:04:59.800> or<00:05:00.760> there<00:05:01.150> might

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
might be a lot of code or there might

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:10.230 
might be a lot of code or there might
not<00:05:06.240> but<00:05:07.240> either<00:05:07.450> way<00:05:08.190> it's<00:05:09.190> playable<00:05:09.610> this

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
