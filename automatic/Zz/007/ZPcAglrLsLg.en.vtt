I<00:00:54.270> didn't<00:00:54.510> expect<00:00:54.840> him<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:54.989> develop<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
I didn't expect him to develop up to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
I didn't expect him to develop up to
that<00:00:55.920> high<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.309> he<00:00:56.460> does<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.030> becomes<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
that high but he does and becomes a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.200 
that high but he does and becomes a
really<00:00:58.079> solid<00:00:58.530> player<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> team<00:00:59.430> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
really solid player for the team but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.810 
really solid player for the team but

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
also Lukas beers on he's the of course

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.310 
also Lukas beers on he's the of course
the<00:01:02.940> young<00:01:03.239> Brazilian<00:01:03.719> attacking<00:01:04.140> player

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
goes up to 86 overall so he develops

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300 
goes up to 86 overall so he develops
still<00:01:07.110> into<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> good<00:01:07.590> player<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:08.010> last

reason because not being played as much

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.390 
reason because not being played as much
because<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> simulate<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.920> they're

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
because when you simulate that they're

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.770 
because when you simulate that they're
the<00:01:35.610> assistant<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.240> simulate<00:01:36.630> they

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the assistant when they simulate they

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.120 
the assistant when they simulate they
choose<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.170> best<00:01:37.320> starting<00:01:37.619> 11<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.040> they

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
choose the best starting 11 and they

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.429 
choose the best starting 11 and they
don't<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.759> rotate<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.930> judging<00:01:40.170> how

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
don't really rotate just judging how

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.590 
don't really rotate just judging how
much<00:01:40.619> other<00:01:40.829> players<00:01:41.220> play<00:01:41.450> throughout<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
much other players play throughout the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
much other players play throughout the
couple<00:01:43.229> seasons<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> did<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.100> while

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
couple seasons that I did this while

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.850 
couple seasons that I did this while
four<00:01:44.610> seasons<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.240> believe<00:01:45.570> Willian<00:01:46.500> still

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
four seasons I believe Willian still

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.819 
four seasons I believe Willian still
holds<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> level<00:01:47.460> 83<00:01:48.000> Ivanovich<00:01:48.689> at<00:01:48.869> 33<00:01:49.560> still

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
holds a level 83 Ivanovich at 33 still

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.399 
holds a level 83 Ivanovich at 33 still
holds<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> 80<00:01:50.430> overall<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.329> he<00:01:51.479> develops<00:01:51.899> okay

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
holds a 80 overall so he develops okay

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.830 
holds a 80 overall so he develops okay
or<00:01:52.649> not<00:01:52.860> develops<00:01:53.280> he<00:01:53.399> still<00:01:53.640> doesn't<00:01:54.450> decline

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
or not develops he still doesn't decline

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.219 
or not develops he still doesn't decline
too<00:01:55.079> much<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.439> 33<00:01:55.979> Mohamed<00:01:56.909> Salah<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> 82

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
too much at 33 Mohamed Salah up to 82

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.170 
too much at 33 Mohamed Salah up to 82
form<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.740> bad<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.219> he's<00:01:59.340> unhappy<00:01:59.670> probably

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
form is bad and he's unhappy probably

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.670 
form is bad and he's unhappy probably
not<00:02:00.299> played<00:02:00.540> too<00:02:00.750> much<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.409> probably

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
not played too much so that probably

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.789 
not played too much so that probably
leads<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.340> Gary<00:02:02.579> Cahill<00:02:02.960> again<00:02:03.960> still<00:02:04.530> 80

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
leads to that Gary Cahill again still 80

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.399 
leads to that Gary Cahill again still 80
overall<00:02:05.340> surprised<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:06.509> hold<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.899> much<00:02:07.200> to

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
overall surprised he hold that much to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.869 
overall surprised he hold that much to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
current players wouldn't be there and I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.970

honest cuz I'm not making signings
I'm<00:02:24.960> just<00:02:25.470> simulating<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.190> quick<00:02:26.370> as<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.610> can

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
I'm just simulating as quick as I can

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.250 
I'm just simulating as quick as I can
because<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.210> can<00:02:27.240> take<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> long<00:02:28.050> time

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
because it can take a long time

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.360 
because it can take a long time
especially<00:02:28.320> when<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.190> offer

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
especially when you have to offer

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.400 
especially when you have to offer
contracts<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.450> actually<00:02:30.870> takes<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.230> lot<00:02:31.380> of

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
contracts this actually takes a lot of

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.990 
contracts this actually takes a lot of
work<00:02:31.650> people<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.220> think<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.520> simulate<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
work people just think you simulate and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.700 
work people just think you simulate and
it's<00:02:33.120> done<00:02:33.300> but<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.870> does<00:02:34.080> take<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> lot<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.560> work

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
it's done but it does take a lot of work

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.140 
it's done but it does take a lot of work
to<00:02:34.890> make<00:02:35.010> sure<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.460> players<00:02:35.670> are<00:02:35.850> still<00:02:36.000> at

attacking<00:03:34.230> players<00:03:34.440> were<00:03:34.620> good<00:03:34.770> but<00:03:34.980> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
attacking players were good but the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.090 
attacking players were good but the
defense<00:03:35.970> really<00:03:36.540> showed<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.200> take<00:03:37.800> out<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100

Lukaku<00:03:44.400> he<00:03:45.209> saw<00:03:45.390> his<00:03:45.540> overall<00:03:45.870> 85<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.620> said

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
Lukaku he saw his overall 85 and I said

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.820 
Lukaku he saw his overall 85 and I said
he<00:03:46.860> gets<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.130> 88<00:03:47.810> even<00:03:48.810> more<00:03:49.020> like<00:03:49.530> after<00:03:49.800> a

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
he gets the 88 even more like after a

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.890 
he gets the 88 even more like after a
couple<00:03:50.010> more<00:03:50.160> seasons<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:51.239> he<00:03:51.720> still

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
couple more seasons but he still

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.320 
couple more seasons but he still
dominates<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.709> terms<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.100> goals<00:03:53.280> at<00:03:53.550> 85<00:03:54.030> so

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
dominates in terms of goals at 85 so

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.670 
dominates in terms of goals at 85 so
he's<00:03:54.480> really<00:03:54.720> really<00:03:54.840> good<00:03:54.930> assists<00:03:55.470> there

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680
