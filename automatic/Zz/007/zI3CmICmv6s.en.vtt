 and today I'm bringing you more 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.180
 a high definition video lesson in that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.550
 viola let's learn how to use the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 red bull chip to improve performance 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.960
 computer on operating systems 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.090
 first let's understand what is the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.640
 red bull x1 is a bush whose technical name

 and windows 7 from microsoft 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
 it causes the computers that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.070
 are running the system uses 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.649
 flash memory on devices such as pen 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.829
 drives memory cards among others 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.670
 in order to improve overall performance 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.199
 of the computer since we already know that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.510
 it's the red bull it's time for us 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.400

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 devices with removable storage 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.799
 in case there is one here that is my pen 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.689
 drive that has four gigs is the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.150
 right click on the device with 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.540

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.759
 property will open a window with 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.070
 several options that we can change 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.579
 including the wedbush option that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.920
 found on the flap at the top 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.770
 clicking on it will open the options for 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.290
 that we can adjust and dedicate 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.930
 this device to red bull then 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.140
 tags the low item dedicate this 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.520
 device to the red bulls and here you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.079
 is to change the placeholder for the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.530
 system acceleration 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.369
 you can leave a smaller space in the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.840
 bigger 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.679
 the case is not using the whole 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.469
 o the whole memory is the capacity of the 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.269
 pendrive for anyone who wants is still 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.300

 the capacity it is going to be 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.709
 reserved for system acceleration 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.690
