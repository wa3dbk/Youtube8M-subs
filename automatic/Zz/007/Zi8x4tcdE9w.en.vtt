00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello humans i am maca the one who is 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.529
 unhappy is in this video let's talk about the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.470
 simpson the best caricature of the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.050
 story over 500 episodes these 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.460
 Damn yellow monkeys and eyes like 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.320
 they have made us laugh through the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.419
 history many say the same as 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.759
 new episodes of the simpsons stink 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.829
 they do not seem so stinky to me 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.560
 good that implanted in topics 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.609
 moment they do apple parodies up 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.890
 salt or lady gaga 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.779
 certainly that episode so shabby but 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.420
 I'm sorry they have to evolve in 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.510
 stores that if you look at the room 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.360
 the simpsons your TV is already a screen 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.830
 flat the square TV that classic and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 they do not have it now they have a screen 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.300
 flat it is obvious that the theme has to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.520
 be modern that things have to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.470
 change we are no longer in the 90s 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.420
 I recognize that the episodes are already very 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.640
 different for example the first 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 nine seasons have nothing to do 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 with the last nine seasons many 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.930
 they get angry and they say that the internees are 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.880
 as before, they are partly right 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.640
 but you also have to consider that 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.670
 you have already grown up, of course you are going to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.770
 like more 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.689
 past seasons of the no-no because 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.850
 when you saw them I was 10 years old and you 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.860
 they loved with those episodes you 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.170
 You fell in love with the simpsons, I'm a fan 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.960
 but true fan of the simpsons I have 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.540
 all my life seeing them actually doing 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.119
 calculations I have dedicated more than a year of 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.610
 my life watching the simpson 12 episodes 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.710
 diaries since I'm 8 years old 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.869
 a few days ago the controversy arose 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.909
 because one of the creators of the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.360
 simpson said that the following season 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.970
 one of the most iconic characters in the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.909
 series will die rumors began to emerge 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.610
 everywhere saying that bad could 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.740
 die as demons vaart will die 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.080
 only simpson can not die any 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.409
 simpsons if he dies some simpson has 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.659
 to be the grandfather abraham simpson to see 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.119
 If a character is going to die, I think that 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:03.560
 will die bo patiño or korosti the clown 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.869
 such a turn maybe grandpa 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.580
 or maybe mou die too 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.920
 pretty long one of them I think it's going to 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.349
 to die I bet for one of those me 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.730
 I would say that he died there was patiño or cross 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.709
 kind that those characters are insa 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.750
 pretty in any case I shit the 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.150
 idea bothered me when they killed the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.670
 wife of ned flanders when you're a fan 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.069
 of a series it is logical that you shit that 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.530
 kill the characters a greeting to the 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.940
 who see game of thrones 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.800
 they say that that fucking series all die 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.910
 the fucking characters in every episode I 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.890
 I'm going to do and I have not seen it because 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.870
 they say you get excited every 20 minutes by 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.910
 that I want to leave the payments for that reason not 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.730
 I see game of thrones me to the simpsons 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.319
 I have a lot of love it 's true the last 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.299
 episodes do not compare to the 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.519
 classics but I still think they are very 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.620
 fun to people who do not 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.720
 like the new episodes I think it's 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
 for nostalgia because the episodes of 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.920
 the simpsons are still very funny 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.299
 - l lady gaga is from the fucking episode of 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.549
 fact is the episode where the lady comes out 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.989
 Gaga was voted the worst episode of 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.880
 the sites of all times the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.310
 introns is a caricature to which he 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.519
 we have to thank very much without the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.260
 Simpson would not have existed to leave 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.849
 phelan the creator of father family has 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.189
 said without the simpsons there would have been no 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.439
 existed this father family therefore 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.200
 neither 'american dad' from cleveland 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.510
 it 's amazing that the creator of father 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.909
 family to cleveland be 'american dad' 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.090
 be the same creator who brought us 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.560
 cosmos one of the series more 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.659
 smart and necessary of the past 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.150
 years like that is smart phelan said 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.620
 charly in coming and to the world with my 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.629
 well irreverent caricatures and 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.849
 stupid I'm going to bring you something 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.829
 intellectual to them to cosmos but that's 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.409
 the gossip you think that bart simpson 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.980
 die, what do you think in the 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.560
 comments 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.090
 That was all my twitter when my monkey 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.769
 facebook page in the description there 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.239
