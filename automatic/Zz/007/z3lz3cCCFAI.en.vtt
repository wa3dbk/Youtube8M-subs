really<00:01:06.150> use<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.810> called<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> gy<00:01:07.830> scale<00:01:08.600> now

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
really use I'm called the gy scale now

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.660 
really use I'm called the gy scale now
this<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.189> um<00:01:12.260> what<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.470> change<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.369> that's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this is um what will change that that's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.410 
this is um what will change that that's
the<00:01:15.060> normal<00:01:15.509> size<00:01:16.220> that's<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.549> large<00:01:17.909> size

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the normal size that's the large size

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
the normal size that's the large size
this<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.049> auto<00:01:19.350> which<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.950> don't<00:01:20.189> really

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
this is the auto which I don't really

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.510 
this is the auto which I don't really
think<00:01:20.640> does<00:01:21.150> anything<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.680> smaller<00:01:23.070> it's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
think does anything and the smaller it's

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.820 
think does anything and the smaller it's
a<00:01:23.640> smaller<00:01:24.030> GOI<00:01:24.390> maybe<00:01:24.780> faster<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.409> guess<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
a smaller GOI maybe faster I guess it

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.510 
a smaller GOI maybe faster I guess it
prevents<00:01:26.220> lag<00:01:26.720> but<00:01:27.720> that's<00:01:27.990> um<00:01:28.409> Stacy<00:01:29.100> says

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
prevents lag but that's um Stacy says

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.560 
prevents lag but that's um Stacy says
