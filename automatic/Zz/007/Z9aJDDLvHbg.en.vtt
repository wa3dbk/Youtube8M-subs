00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.520
 another video so many people 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.010
 have been upset recently about the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.230
 choosing a power adapter in my gaming pc 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.429
 its jelly how can you only and how 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.290
 are you coming up with such a bad one? 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.450
 power supply at all clear 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.640
 just relax it was only one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.890
 Transitional solution the sharkoon bpm 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 Something will now be replaced by that 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.619
 cool master 450 it stands in this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.949
 not for super duper but for 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.199
 semi modular what this v 54 it 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 can and if at all 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.579
 Recommendation worth it that we look 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 so today in the reason so now 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.590
 more exactly 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.590
 Let's go 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.070
 cool master stands and I can do that much 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.080
 already say beyond 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.120
 cooling solutions and great housings 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.980
 for high quality power supplies and now 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.320
 it comes for relatively small money 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.330
 The packing of the 450 is it 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.890
 comparatively quite colorful in the 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.170
 contrast to the others in the market 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.240
 available power supplies and means 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 but not less informative in the reason 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.810
 we will be here with information 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 overwhelmed on the back can be found 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.470
 For example , the connections of the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.510
 Power supply and a diagram of the fans 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.080
 The scope of delivery includes only the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.000
 most necessary 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.430
 this of course includes the power supply 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.040
 even four montage screws a kite 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.810
 devices cables and the modular or 1 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.369
 pluggable peripheral cable 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 nice would be a few black 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.820
 Cable ties have been here so 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.440
 small tip a cool master such 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.030
 Cable ties are always very good 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.770
 for a clean cable management and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 actually belong to the good for me 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 sound with such high-quality power supplies 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.100
 after almost forgetting a user manual 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.869
 Of course there is also the design of the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 power supply is simple but also modern 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.090
 and the cool master logo is for me 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.009
 still like another 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.080
 interesting factor is the cooler 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.729
 Master on inputs grid puts in 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.640
 combination with a silver frame 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.429
 and that looks pretty cool 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.470
 underneath is the 120 mm sleeve 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.929
 mounted fan at a power supply 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.869
 utilization of about 50 percent admitted 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.530
 pound 700 pm at 3 wanted to be work 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.300
 done 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.830
 until the product stickers are all 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.330
 Labels directly on the metal 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.310
 applied something 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.200
 higher quality impression on 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.790
 the back or outside 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.240
 found the kite device connection 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.900
 and a power switch up the top i 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.640
 my clear 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.860
 the technical data on a last 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.810
 in the form of a sticker is commonplace 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.250
 but nonetheless , this sticker is 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.989
 not sooo cool now 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.120
 especially if the power supply is in 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.500
 Housing bottom with the fan down 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.450
 aligned installed 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.980
 ok so what does it bitch on of course 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.480
 highest level but i think so too 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.160
 something like that could be relevant to you 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 unless you opt for this networks 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.200
 decide oh yes a link to the 450 it 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.630
 is of course below in the infobox 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.840
 The maximum power is 450 watts 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.000
 distributed to 100 watts for the 3 3 and 5 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.540
 volt rail with 20 amps each and 4 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.209
 132 watts on the 12 volt rail 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.439
 with 36 amps the net has and here 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.359
 I did not expect anything else 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.120
 over all protection circuits 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.959
 starting with overvoltage protection 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.670
 overcurrent protection up to the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.560
 overheating protection there you could 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.159
 Smooth the power supply is good 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.500
 protected 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.599
 the 450 it belongs to the semi modular 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.849
 constructed power supplies and thus is the 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.439
 kabelbaum right in biel built it 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.260
 connected to the network are under 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.859
 Other of the four plus 20 or 24 pin atx 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.719
 plug 44 or 18 cpu plug and the 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.870
 two to six pci express 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.980
 Plug quality of cable sheathing 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.139
 Known as running is still okay 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.359
 but in a somewhat opaque conversion 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.709
 would of course be even better 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.109
 unlike the tightly connected ones it ran 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.129
 cables on the cool master are the modular ones 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.290
 and lines as black 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.680
 flat ribbon cable executed split up 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.930
 three cables stand so 6 x sata molex and 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.200
 a floppy connection available 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.790
 lanxess 55 it is 58 cm for 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.099
 mainboard and cpu to break the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.430
 length of the pci express cable is for 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.560
 the first plug 56 cm modular cable 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.479
 are up to 72 cm long 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.220
 attentive spectators certainly have 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.870
 notices that the last part is not from 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.940
 was spoken to me but by the 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.040
 guys from pc max just take a look 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.540
 Pass your canal past left to your canal 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.370
 Of course, it's down in the video 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.090
 description below the fan 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.530
 you will find the heart of the 450 slc 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.409
 resonance one likes and two oops i lon 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.000
 Capacitors and the 3d ornamental design 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.970
 Unfortunately, I am missing a professional 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.130
 Nice gauge like the crown at s 8000 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.159
 and therefore there is also in the video 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.199
 description a link to the test of the 450th 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.199
 it related to the test results 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.789
 The 450 completely convinces me that 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.470
 power supply of very good values ​​and 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.419
 must be behind the competition from the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.190
 home be quite absolutely not hide 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.840
 the build quality and the design are 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.280
 excellent as well as the low 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.729
 volume and the long warranty 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.229
 speak for the 450 it's a pity there 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.270
 but also that something too short 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.830
 advised cpu cable and this ran 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.289
 quality of the fixed cable 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.659
 all in all the v 450 it is a very 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.729
 good nets and alternative to be quite 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.320
 and co, thank you, too 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.950
 another cool master that this me 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.320
 netzer kindly as 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.760
 1 copy provided 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.440
 then I thank you for watching 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.820
 if you enjoy the video I am glad 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.740
 me, of course, as always about comments 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.990
 and reviews are more videos 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.170
 now linked below and then up 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.170
 recently
