pretty<00:03:23.150> crazy<00:03:23.630> looking<00:03:24.049> binder<00:03:24.470> I<00:03:24.709> think<00:03:25.100> it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
pretty crazy looking binder I think it

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.690 
pretty crazy looking binder I think it
looks<00:03:25.340> pretty<00:03:25.400> amazing<00:03:26.620> yeah<00:03:27.620> tell<00:03:28.459> me<00:03:28.579> what

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
looks pretty amazing yeah tell me what

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.160 
looks pretty amazing yeah tell me what
you<00:03:28.819> think<00:03:29.030> about<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.359> he<00:03:29.900> was<00:03:29.959> going<00:03:30.139> to

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
you think about it he was going to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.050 
you think about it he was going to
measure<00:03:30.380> on<00:03:30.620> my<00:03:30.769> arm<00:03:31.010> with<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.519> bendable

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
measure on my arm with this bendable

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.340 
measure on my arm with this bendable
thing<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:32.510> guess<00:03:32.780> that's<00:03:32.989> what<00:03:33.139> they're<00:03:33.319> for

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
thing I guess that's what they're for

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.890 
thing I guess that's what they're for
all<00:03:34.250> right<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:35.239> what's<00:03:35.510> what's<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
all right so what's what's the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.900 
all right so what's what's the
measurement

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.780

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
well the last time i use my desktop i

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.650 
well the last time i use my desktop i
remember<00:03:54.170> having<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.650> calculator<00:03:55.310> i<00:03:55.670> remember

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
remember having a calculator i remember

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.030 
remember having a calculator i remember
i<00:03:56.690> didn't<00:03:56.990> really<00:03:57.080> need<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.380> measure<00:03:57.650> anything

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
i didn't really need to measure anything

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.290 
i didn't really need to measure anything
and<00:03:59.260> I<00:04:00.260> didn't<00:04:01.010> need<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.460> pencil<00:04:01.820> holder

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
and I didn't need a pencil holder

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.280 
and I didn't need a pencil holder
because<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.960> is<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.470> desktop<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.990> computer<00:04:05.990> so

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
because it is a desktop a computer so

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.840 
because it is a desktop a computer so
why<00:04:06.590> why<00:04:07.070> would<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.370> need<00:04:07.490> this<00:04:07.700> stuff<00:04:08.200> but<00:04:09.200> I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
why why would you need this stuff but I

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.880 
why why would you need this stuff but I
guess<00:04:10.850> maybe<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:11.510> useful<00:04:11.990> for<00:04:12.170> some<00:04:12.560> people

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
guess maybe it's useful for some people

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.930 
guess maybe it's useful for some people
but<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.810> don't<00:04:14.810> really<00:04:14.990> think<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.440> bunch<00:04:16.310> of<00:04:16.580> big
