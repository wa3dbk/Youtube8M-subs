John<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.560> Richard<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.310> said<00:02:29.670> they<00:02:29.850> can<00:02:30.000> boot

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
John and Richard have said they can boot

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.720 
John and Richard have said they can boot
on<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.600> reconstruction<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.890> sighting<00:02:32.580> of

on the reconstruction of the sighting of
David<00:02:33.180> late<00:02:33.769> Richard<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:35.100> about<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> same

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
David late Richard it's about the same

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.850 
David late Richard it's about the same
distance<00:02:36.030> away<00:02:36.180> beyond<00:02:36.959> those<00:02:37.110> trees<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.739> I

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
distance away beyond those trees that I

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.830 
distance away beyond those trees that I
was<00:02:38.100> for<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.430> pig<00:02:38.610> my<00:02:38.760> eyes<00:02:38.910> or<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
was for the pig my eyes or and in the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.720 
was for the pig my eyes or and in the
second<00:02:40.230> he's<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.830> move<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.280> first<00:02:41.550> if

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
second he's going to move the first if

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.000 
second he's going to move the first if
he<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.060> going<00:02:42.480> from<00:02:42.630> right<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> left<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.830> then

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
he can going from right to left and then

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.860 
he can going from right to left and then
left<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.310> right<00:02:44.519> back<00:02:44.730> again<00:02:45.030> you're<00:02:45.600> making

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
left to right back again you're making

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.780 
left to right back again you're making
the<00:02:45.959> gate<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> thing<00:02:46.739> that<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:46.920> saw<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.640> I

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the gate what the thing that I saw and I

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.710 
the gate what the thing that I saw and I
think<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.239> see<00:02:48.420> something<00:02:48.690> very

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
think of them see something very

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.420 
think of them see something very
interesting

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.810 

when<00:02:56.430> he<00:02:56.490> goes<00:02:56.640> back<00:02:56.880> again

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.670

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
most of which it has ready again I could

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.920 
most of which it has ready again I could
do<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:05.860> yeah<00:03:06.280> even<00:03:07.180> when<00:03:07.390> we<00:03:07.510> did<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.810> at

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
do that yeah even when we did it at

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.040 
do that yeah even when we did it at
night<00:03:08.830> with<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.330> headlight<00:03:10.330> even<00:03:10.810> with<00:03:10.960> it
