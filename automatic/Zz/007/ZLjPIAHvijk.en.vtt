we<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> light<00:01:12.030> sensor<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.720> probably

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
we have a light sensor now you probably

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.660 
we have a light sensor now you probably
won't<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.290> able<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> see<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> go

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
won't be able to see this but if you go

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.090 
won't be able to see this but if you go
outside<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.750> sense<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.590> then

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
outside it will sense that and then

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.789 
outside it will sense that and then
adjust<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> screen<00:01:17.850> brightness<00:01:18.799> depending

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
adjust the screen brightness depending

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.039
