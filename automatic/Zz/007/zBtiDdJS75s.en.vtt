00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.460
 - We are on. - I was just warmed up. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.400
 - I'm Joltter. - And I'm Jacob. 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.840
 And welcome back to "World Cup with Unisport. 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.330
 And we are on the track this time with some challenges. Finally! 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.200
 - It's been some time since and it has been emotional. 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.130
 - Yes and you have been bothering us to make these challenges again - 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.600
 - for the last time we did, you lost! 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.680
 It's "The Crossbar Challenge"! 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.060
 And we have already seen the barge hit a few times at the World Cup - 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.200
 - And although the players are certainly not trying to hit the bar, we will try our best today. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.950
 Yes, and the rules are pretty simple. We get five attempts each and every one that hits the most times wins. 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.750
 And it won't be fun to lose, because we still have our "Challenge Loser" t-shirt. 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.350
 The ugly blue shirt for the loser. 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.970
 Then get ready. 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.570
 Let's get started. 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.950
 In fact, I think I will hit the crossbar on my first attempt. 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.600
 Do it! 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.330
 Yes, it is known some time ago you can see. 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 Well, Brazuca. 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.770
 No, it was just bad. 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.480
 This is definitely embarrassing! 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.660
 Yes it is! 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.460
 No! 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.910
 Not where I'm bad! 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.550
 So far we have been pretty bad. 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.240
 It's time to bring it back. That is it! It's been time! 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.530
 It was SO close! 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.680
 Well, "Crossbar Challenge", Magisa vs. Superfly - 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.110
 - ended 1-0 for Superfly, because yes, I happened to have them. 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.840
 But to be honest, we were miserable. 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.860
 We were extremely poor. It has been a huge disappointment. 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.000
 And I was even the worst, so it was a mess. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.510
 Yes, your rabona was close, but nevertheless I present the "Challenge loser" shirt! 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.570
 Yes, it's back! Back at Joltter, where it belongs! 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.550
 Thank you, I'm honored. 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.110
 And you will carry it to our next challenge. 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.880
 For there will be another challenge and another one after that - 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.020
 - But what should it be? 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.680
 We have a few ideas - 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.680
 - But if you have any specs in mind, let's hear in the comments below. 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.370
 Exactly! But that was all we had time for today. 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.480
 But hang on because we will come back with more challenges and more "World Cup with Unisport". 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.550
 So we'll see you soon. Have a good time until then. 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.550
 Thanks.
