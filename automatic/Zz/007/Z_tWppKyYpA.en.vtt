assemble a crack fighting team of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.749 
assemble a crack fighting team of
dinosaurs<00:01:21.229> after<00:01:21.649> you<00:01:21.770> successfully<00:01:21.979> mined

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
dinosaurs after you successfully mined

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.669 
dinosaurs after you successfully mined
all<00:01:22.940> of<00:01:23.090> their<00:01:23.239> various<00:01:23.450> fossilized<00:01:24.259> body

all of their various fossilized body
parts<00:01:25.099> and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:25.729> you<00:01:25.849> clean<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.209> fossils

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
parts and then you clean the fossils

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.330 
parts and then you clean the fossils
using<00:01:26.899> a<00:01:26.929> little<00:01:27.050> drill<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:27.649> hammer<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.130> then

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
using a little drill and hammer and then

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.680 
using a little drill and hammer and then
you<00:01:28.489> blow<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.819> dust<00:01:28.970> out<00:01:29.209> of<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.420> way<00:01:29.539> by

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
you blow the dust out of the way by

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.600 
you blow the dust out of the way by
blowing<00:01:29.929> into<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.259> Nintendo<00:01:30.800> DS<00:01:31.009> microphone

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
blowing into the Nintendo DS microphone

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.150 
blowing into the Nintendo DS microphone
which<00:01:31.819> works<00:01:32.179> surprisingly<00:01:32.360> well<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.979> better

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
which works surprisingly well the better

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.680 
which works surprisingly well the better
job<00:01:34.489> that<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.759> do<00:01:34.880> cleaning<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.390> better

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
job that you do cleaning the better

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.229 
job that you do cleaning the better
dinosaurs<00:01:36.289> you<00:01:37.039> will<00:01:37.190> have<00:01:37.369> I'm<00:01:37.819> not<00:01:38.060> sure

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:38.239 
dinosaurs you will have I'm not sure

dinosaurs you will have I'm not sure
what<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.509> scientific<00:01:39.110> reasoning<00:01:39.470> behind

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
what the scientific reasoning behind

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.469 
what the scientific reasoning behind
that<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.099> but<00:01:40.399> that's<00:01:40.849> the<00:01:41.090> way<00:01:41.179> the<00:01:41.300> game

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
that is but that's the way the game

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.540 
that is but that's the way the game
works<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:42.289> dinosaurs<00:01:42.830> are<00:01:43.009> held<00:01:43.190> together<00:01:43.340> by

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
works the dinosaurs are held together by

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.690 
works the dinosaurs are held together by
