00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:08.719
 It's very nice for me to sit here 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.150
 quietly to read the newspaper but 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.390
 has been much more profitable about 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:19.850
 everything since I discovered 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.610
 ways to use it 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.740
 in the manufacture of ecological cups and 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.590
 disposable I use for the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.869
 replicated of my plants rolling 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.460
 simply the paper folded into a roll 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.090
 empty toilet paper 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.969
 I get these glasses that will remain 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.969
 buried when planting 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.429
 this system has the advantage that I 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.699
 I can adapt to the type of plant that 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:57.679
 I go to put are very small plants 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.760
 that we used very small glasses are 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:04.189
 normal use longer glasses 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.100
 but if they are very large plants like 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.060
 these cucumbers 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.060
 or pumpkins 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.799
 make a much bigger glasses 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.799
 contacts 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.140
 I like to put one or two seeds 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.090
 in each glass but when they are very 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.240
 small as in the case of lettuce 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.380
 it is very difficult 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 so I've done a few and the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.899
 problem they have is that it does not 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.259
 they were going to develop because they are many 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.399
 for little land then it is done 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.399
 necessary the replicator 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:54.040
 to almost all plants at birth 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.860
 the first two small leaves sprout 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.700
 that they are not real leaves 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.700
 they call cotyledons 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.080
 later the true leaves come out 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.500
 here in this suit we have you both 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.500
 cotyledons 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.720
 the true leaves already completely 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.720
 different 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.210
 the replicate consists of separating 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.550
 all these little plants 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.240
 in individual glasses so that it 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.850
 develop each one by your side 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.550
 The first thing to do is 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.720
 take out the plant that I use 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.550
 tweezers because with them they are introduced 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.730
 very well on earth and it can be done 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.230
 force for the plant to come out then 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.670
 pulling gently 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:52.409
 in it they are removed trying to have the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.409
 as many roots as possible 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.050
 then in a glass 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.950
 full of 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.980
 peat we make a wide hole 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.610
 and we take our plant and we try 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.610
 put it 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.390
 so that we stay 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.130
 it comes out of place 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.990
 if the plants to be chirped are very tall 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.690
 how are you then what you have to do 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.530
 do is 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.530
 great care 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.440
 take it out then make a hole here 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.440
 pretty deep 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.590
 down 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.690
 a very useful tool is also a 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.970
 pencil 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.560
 and in the case of tomatoes for example 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.660
 if I want to replicate 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.920
 a tomato 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.920
 very carefully 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.400
 coat 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.450
 There are also those who say that it is 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.039
 convenient to prune the roots when they are 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.950
 very big because then they come out with more 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.959
 vigor 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.300
 well then 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.830
 in the tomato is also interesting 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.830
 make a deep hole 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.949
 because apparently 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:36.169
 all this area of â€‹â€‹the tomato then it 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.270
 turn into roots and take much more 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.400
 tomato strength 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.760
 I introduce the tomato everything 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.760
 may l 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.210
 and there I have it 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:55.300
 Now I have my four glasses with one 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:58.689
 plant in each one and my tray of 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.499
 lettuce tomatoes 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.499
 and cabbages 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.410
 something that we can not let ourselves be 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.410
 never forget is to name the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.740
 plant that we have replicated there are these 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.990
 indicators that sell I will teach them 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:23.229
 now like some ecological signs 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.229
 with a piece of cardboard better white 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.820
 I cut a small rectangle 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.880
 and later 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:38.170
 I need a toothpick and a bit of zeal 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.070
 I put the toothpick through the back 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.560
 of the little sign 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:48.270
 and then 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:51.870
 hit him here with zeal and I have 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.670
 and I end up teaching the little collection 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.670
 of tomatoes 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.680
 freshly repicated 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.240
 I hope this summer 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.240
 put color in my garden
