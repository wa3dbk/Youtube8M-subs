00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 a greeting to all the friends of the corner 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.660
 IT welcomes you in 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.230
 this new video 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
 so we can start first thing on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 your device 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.510
 you have to enter the settings one 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.449
 time you are in the settings of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.339
 your phone go to info on 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.140
 phone 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.140
 once we get into this 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.780
 menu we will have to go on the number of wilder 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.510
 and tapping seven times for me is not 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.239
 necessary because I have already activated the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.829
 developers options menu then vi 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.569
 just go back and in 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.179
 settings you will find the options 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.519
 developer at the top right 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.100
 you will have to activate them with the on switch 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.470
 once this is done also activated 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.120
 debug usb mode 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.220
 once you have activated this 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.490
 mode just connect your 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.530
 phone on the computer and once that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 you have connected your phone to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 computer in usb debug mode 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.140
 we need to download the zip file that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.090
 then we will go on to install 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.010
 this banal zip file allows us to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.090
 activate the function ok google in 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.250
 Italian on our Nexus 5 then how 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.670
 always the link of the download page 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.170
 I leave it in the video description 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.390
 once you have downloaded the file 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.700
 zip that this will be enough for you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.610
 select it and copy it into the memory 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.430
 internal of your phone once 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.590
 that the file has been copied will suffice 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.110
 disconnect the phone and now there 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.690
 we move to the device to install 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.820
 this package now that we are on 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.490
 our phone we have to restart it in 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.530
 recovery mode and to do this myself 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.470
 I always recommend in rom manager or quick 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.870
 boot which are two applications that you 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.340
 can download for free from the play 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.810
 store 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.700
 in this case I will use quick boot 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.920
 the file we're going to install from 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.620
 consequently we will install the function or 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.980
 that google in Italian will also work 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.650
 offline offline means that the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.890
 command or that google also works 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.170
 without internet connection and without the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.370
 internet connection only allows us 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.880
 to call or dictate a message 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.769
 therefore very limited things 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.170
 now that we're on our recovery 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:45.130
 we just need to install zip 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.959
 the first that this zip from sdcard we go 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.780
 in 0 slash that our internal memory 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.209
 and in the internal memory we go to 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.090
 look for the zip file which is called ok 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.140
 google that this is enough for us to do here 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.590
 yes install will automatically drop in jeans 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.590
 the file 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.920
 once I am done it will be enough 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.220
 do 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.680
 beck and on the boot systems now now that 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.319
 the phone has rebooted you in google 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.800
 now going into the settings you will put 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.950
 on an Italian voice and you will notice that the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.930
 microphone up here is colored 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.600
 all in white so it filled up 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.780
 how can you see the differences in the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.290
 image and now let's try the command 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.880
 vocal 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:37.540
 ok google as you see the command is 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.519
 party if you want to find the writing here 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.280
 ok google you will just have to go to 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.430
 settings go up in 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.620
 applications 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.690
 go on google search and you will be enough 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.310
 to do delete data I have tried to 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.250
 delete the data and restart the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.580
 launcher so you have to put them all back 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.410
 the icons and all your folders though 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.989
 here at the top you will also find the writing 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.390
 ok google so for this video is 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.400
 all if you have any problems commented

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.090
