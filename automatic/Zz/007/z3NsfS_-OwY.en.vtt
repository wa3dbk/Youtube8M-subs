like<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.910> on<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.390> so<00:03:39.840> maybe<00:03:40.140> that's<00:03:40.440> something

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
like it on it so maybe that's something

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.099 
like it on it so maybe that's something
else<00:03:40.889> that<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.459> should<00:03:41.880> think<00:03:42.269> about<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
else that I should think about to the

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.530 
else that I should think about to the
next<00:03:43.410> time<00:03:43.590> i<00:03:43.739> get<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.400> long<00:03:44.700> like<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.120> said<00:03:45.329> so
