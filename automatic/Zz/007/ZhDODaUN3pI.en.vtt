manual<00:00:06.210> mode<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.660> first<00:00:06.990> thing<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.259> you're

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
manual mode the first thing that you're

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.230 
manual mode the first thing that you're
going<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.919> want<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.189> understand<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.760> f<00:00:08.910> stops

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
going to want to understand is f stops

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.200 
going to want to understand is f stops
then<00:00:09.960> f<00:00:10.260> stops<00:00:10.559> are<00:00:10.769> simply<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.460> size<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
then f stops are simply the size of the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.509 
then f stops are simply the size of the
hole<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.620> opening<00:00:14.009> going<00:00:14.190> through<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
hole of the opening going through the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.010 
hole of the opening going through the
lens<00:00:14.730> let<00:00:14.910> me<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.150> basically<00:00:15.570> show<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.839> what

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
lens let me just basically show you what

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.730 
lens let me just basically show you what
I<00:00:16.049> mean<00:00:16.640> when<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.850> like<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:19.439> change

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
I mean when I go like this I can change

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
I mean when I go like this I can change
the<00:00:20.070> size<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> opening<00:00:20.939> now<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the size of the opening now this is a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
the size of the opening now this is a
really<00:00:22.380> tiny<00:00:22.619> opening<00:00:23.160> all<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.730> way<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
really tiny opening all the way to a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.970 
really tiny opening all the way to a
very<00:00:24.300> big<00:00:24.510> opening<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.410> only<00:00:25.619> makes<00:00:25.890> sense

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
very big opening it only makes sense

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.679 
very big opening it only makes sense
that<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> bigger<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> opening<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.480> more

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that the bigger the opening the more

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.040 
that the bigger the opening the more
light<00:00:28.140> comes<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.710> right<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.390> means<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
light comes in right so that means that

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
light comes in right so that means that
if<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.679> shrink<00:00:32.309> down<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.759> opening<00:00:33.270> you're

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
if you shrink down this opening you're

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.030 
if you shrink down this opening you're
going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.320> have<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> slower<00:00:34.950> shutter

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
going to have to have a slower shutter

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.510 
going to have to have a slower shutter
speed<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.880> order<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.210> compensate<00:00:37.190> for<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
speed in order to compensate for the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.190 
speed in order to compensate for the
little<00:00:38.790> light<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.120> goes<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.570> because<00:00:39.930> you're

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
little light that goes in because you're

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.810 
little light that goes in because you're
not<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.710> much<00:00:41.100> light<00:00:41.399> coming<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
not going to have much light coming in

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.369 
not going to have much light coming in
the<00:00:41.850> hole<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> need<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.719> shutter<00:00:42.989> open

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the hole so you need that shutter open

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.369 
the hole so you need that shutter open
longer<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.100> let<00:00:44.460> more<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> light<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.379> on

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
longer to let more of the light in on

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.990 
longer to let more of the light in on
the<00:00:46.500> other<00:00:46.620> hand<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:47.969> open

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the other hand if you have a more open

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.160 
the other hand if you have a more open
hole<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.020> increase<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.440> shutter<00:00:49.980> speed

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
hole you can increase your shutter speed

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.080 
hole you can increase your shutter speed
in<00:00:52.170> proportion<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.980> basically<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.699> happens

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
in proportion so basically what happens

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.470 
in proportion so basically what happens
is<00:00:54.270> I'll<00:00:54.539> show<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> f-22<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:57.030> larger

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
is I'll show you this is f-22 the larger

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.990 
is I'll show you this is f-22 the larger
the<00:00:57.600> number<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> smaller<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.680> hole<00:00:58.859> okay<00:00:59.520> one

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the number the smaller the hole okay one

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.849 
the number the smaller the hole okay one
one-thousandth<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> second<00:01:01.170> F<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.559> point

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
one-thousandth of a second F one point

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.490 
one-thousandth of a second F one point
four<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> background<00:01:04.080> is

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
four and you can see the background is

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260 
four and you can see the background is
extremely<00:01:05.159> blurry<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> take<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
extremely blurry I'm going to take the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740 
extremely blurry I'm going to take the
camera<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.869> put<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> on<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.760> closed

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
camera and put it on very very closed

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
camera and put it on very very closed
aperture<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.159> I'm

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
aperture so you see right here I'm

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
aperture so you see right here I'm
slowing<00:01:12.030> down<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> shutter<00:01:12.659> speed<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.200> it's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
slowing down the shutter speed and it's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.160 
slowing down the shutter speed and it's
getting<00:01:13.619> more<00:01:13.799> overexposed<00:01:15.080> okay<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:17.630> we<00:01:18.630> are

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
getting more overexposed okay so we are

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.170 
getting more overexposed okay so we are
going<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> go<00:01:19.680> over<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> aperture<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
going to go over to the aperture and you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.800 
going to go over to the aperture and you
see<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.540> I'm<00:01:21.659> closing<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:23.759> let's<00:01:24.479> try

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
see now I'm closing it down to let's try

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
see now I'm closing it down to let's try
this<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.400> we'll<00:01:26.400> say<00:01:26.610> something<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.350> F<00:01:29.180> 6.31

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
this one we'll say something like F 6.31

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270 
this one we'll say something like F 6.31
50th<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.079> second<00:01:31.470> I'll<00:01:31.619> take<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> shot<00:01:32.100> like

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
50th of a second I'll take a shot like

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.100 
50th of a second I'll take a shot like
that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
that

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.270 
that
you're<00:01:34.110> starting<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you're starting to see more of the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
you're starting to see more of the
background<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:36.150> let's<00:01:36.450> take<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> way

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
background now let's take it all the way

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.149 
background now let's take it all the way
down<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.950> f-22<00:01:39.439> wheel<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.650> thing<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
down to f-22 wheel this thing all the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.749 
down to f-22 wheel this thing all the
way<00:01:41.460> down<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.820> f-22<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.399> that<00:01:44.399> means<00:01:44.579> our

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
way down to f-22 and that means our

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.010 
way down to f-22 and that means our
shutter<00:01:45.000> speed<00:01:45.090> we're<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.750> adjust

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
shutter speed we're going to adjust

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.740 
shutter speed we're going to adjust
until<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.649> get<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.040> look<00:01:47.220> pretty<00:01:47.610> good<00:01:47.750> now

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
until we get it to look pretty good now

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.179 
until we get it to look pretty good now
watch<00:01:48.960> what<00:01:49.110> happens<00:01:49.439> when<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> take<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> shot

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
watch what happens when I take the shot

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
watch what happens when I take the shot
like<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:52.490> very<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:53.790> clearly<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.509> monitor

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
like this very very clearly the monitor

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.139 
like this very very clearly the monitor
you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.829> actually<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.640> name<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you can actually see my name in the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.830 
you can actually see my name in the
monitor<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.700> everything<00:01:59.700> in<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> room<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
monitor and everything in the room and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.359 
monitor and everything in the room and
when<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> go<00:02:01.920> back<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.119> at<00:02:03.479> f/8<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.920> F<00:02:05.100> six

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
when I go back this is at f/8 now F six

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.119 
when I go back this is at f/8 now F six
point<00:02:05.640> three<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:07.079> right<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.979> F

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
point three and this right here is at F

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.570 
point three and this right here is at F
one<00:02:08.369> point<00:02:08.729> four<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.270> one<00:02:09.509> point<00:02:09.720> four<00:02:10.580> six

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
one point four so one point four six

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.520 
one point four so one point four six
point<00:02:11.910> three<00:02:12.030> which<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.720> actually<00:02:13.140> five<00:02:13.260> six

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
point three which is actually five six

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.030 
point three which is actually five six
and<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.709> half

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and a half

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.890 
and a half
and<00:02:14.599> 22<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:16.260> let's<00:02:16.530> review<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:18.239> aperture<00:02:18.750> is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and 22 so let's review the aperture is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.649 
and 22 so let's review the aperture is
very<00:02:19.290> very<00:02:19.590> small<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.760> pupil<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.390> very

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
very very small here the pupil is very

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.350 
very very small here the pupil is very
constricted<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:23.099> shows<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
constricted and it shows you the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360 
constricted and it shows you the
foreground<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.349> background<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.950> focus

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
foreground and the background and focus

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.479 
foreground and the background and focus
as<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:26.879> open<00:02:27.299> up<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.450> pupil<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.739> aperture<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
as we open up that pupil the aperture to

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.880 
as we open up that pupil the aperture to
a<00:02:30.090> hot<00:02:30.420> us<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:31.530> smaller<00:02:32.340> number<00:02:32.579> of<00:02:33.349> 6.3<00:02:34.349> versus

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
a hot us a smaller number of 6.3 versus

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.729 
a hot us a smaller number of 6.3 versus
f-22<00:02:35.549> I'm<00:02:36.180> starting<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.930> see<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.379> blurry

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
f-22 I'm starting to see a blurry

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.440 
f-22 I'm starting to see a blurry
background<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.549> when<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.730> open<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.209> all<00:02:39.390> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
background and when I open it all the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.410 
background and when I open it all the
way<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.780> F<00:02:40.079> 1.4<00:02:40.890> I'm<00:02:41.220> seeing<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.970> completely

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
way to F 1.4 I'm seeing a completely

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.970 
way to F 1.4 I'm seeing a completely
blurred<00:02:42.750> out<00:02:42.900> background<00:02:43.170> now<00:02:43.530> you'll<00:02:43.709> notice

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
blurred out background now you'll notice

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.490 
blurred out background now you'll notice
that<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.760> exposure<00:02:45.269> on<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.689> camera<00:02:46.140> remains

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
that the exposure on the camera remains

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.740 
that the exposure on the camera remains
the<00:02:46.799> same<00:02:47.040> throughout<00:02:48.030> these<00:02:48.299> three<00:02:48.599> images

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
the same throughout these three images

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.899 
the same throughout these three images
and<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.709> reason<00:02:50.010> why<00:02:50.129> that<00:02:50.340> occurred<00:02:50.670> was

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
and the reason why that occurred was

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.490 
and the reason why that occurred was
because<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.510> changed<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.049> shutter<00:02:52.290> speed

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
because I changed the shutter speed

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.539 
because I changed the shutter speed
therefore<00:02:53.459> one<00:02:54.269> 1000<00:02:54.870> at<00:02:54.989> F<00:02:55.139> 1.4<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.280> same

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
therefore one 1000 at F 1.4 is the same

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.530 
therefore one 1000 at F 1.4 is the same
exposure<00:02:57.120> value<00:02:57.959> as<00:02:58.370> one's<00:02:59.370> fiftieth<00:03:00.060> at<00:03:00.269> F

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
exposure value as one's fiftieth at F

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.619 
exposure value as one's fiftieth at F
6.3<00:03:01.349> or<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:02.489> one<00:03:02.700> quarter<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.120> second<00:03:03.540> at

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
6.3 or like one quarter of second at

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.129 
6.3 or like one quarter of second at
f-22<00:03:04.760> those<00:03:05.760> are<00:03:05.970> all<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.420> same<00:03:06.629> camera

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
f-22 those are all the same camera

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.199 
f-22 those are all the same camera
exposures<00:03:07.769> you'll<00:03:08.459> notice<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.000> shutter

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
exposures you'll notice that the shutter

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.180 
exposures you'll notice that the shutter
speed<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.810> slow<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.400> opening<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.629> small

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
speed is slow and the opening is small

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.649 
speed is slow and the opening is small
shutter<00:03:14.190> speed<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.579> very<00:03:14.670> fast<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.329> the

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
shutter speed is very fast and the

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.509 
shutter speed is very fast and the
opening<00:03:16.019> is<00:03:16.170> large<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.859> those<00:03:17.190> are<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
opening is large and those are the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.650 
opening is large and those are the
things<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.819> you<00:03:18.000> want<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> keep<00:03:18.389> into

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
things that you want to keep into

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.569 
things that you want to keep into
consideration<00:03:18.889> obviously<00:03:19.889> if<00:03:20.310> you're

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
consideration obviously if you're

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.039 
consideration obviously if you're
shooting<00:03:20.760> sports<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.599> want<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.870> have

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
shooting sports and you want to have

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.259 
shooting sports and you want to have
things<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> background<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.819> focus

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
things in the background and focus

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.420 
things in the background and focus
you're<00:03:24.930> going<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.139> want<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.349> close<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.650> iris

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
you're going to want to close that iris

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.030 
you're going to want to close that iris
down<00:03:26.669> to<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.810> very<00:03:28.260> very<00:03:28.349> small<00:03:28.859> opening

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
down to a very very small opening

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.740 
down to a very very small opening
however<00:03:29.699> you're<00:03:30.150> going<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.389> have<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.540> slow

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
however you're going to have a slow

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.390 
however you're going to have a slow
shutter<00:03:31.019> speed<00:03:31.349> which<00:03:31.560> could<00:03:31.799> mean<00:03:31.949> camera

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
shutter speed which could mean camera

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.220 
shutter speed which could mean camera
movement<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:33.569> reason<00:03:33.810> why<00:03:33.959> when

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
movement this is the reason why when

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.990 
movement this is the reason why when
your<00:03:34.349> camera<00:03:34.650> shooting<00:03:34.889> on<00:03:35.099> program<00:03:35.519> mode<00:03:35.730> it

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
your camera shooting on program mode it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000 
your camera shooting on program mode it
typically<00:03:36.419> tends<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.989> pick<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.560> safe<00:03:37.799> range

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
typically tends to pick the safe range

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.640 
typically tends to pick the safe range
something<00:03:38.519> like<00:03:38.669> this<00:03:38.940> one<00:03:39.660> fiftieth<00:03:40.109> at<00:03:40.260> f6

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
something like this one fiftieth at f6

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.500 
something like this one fiftieth at f6
point<00:03:40.919> three<00:03:41.129> this<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.669> reason<00:03:42.030> why<00:03:42.150> you

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
point three this is the reason why you

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.059 
point three this is the reason why you
want<00:03:42.629> to<00:03:42.750> take<00:03:42.900> over<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.260> controls<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.949> your

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
want to take over the controls of your

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.250 
want to take over the controls of your
camera<00:03:44.459> when<00:03:44.940> you're<00:03:45.090> shooting<00:03:45.239> manual<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:46.139> be

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
camera when you're shooting manual to be

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.869 
camera when you're shooting manual to be
able<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.470> give<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:46.980> much<00:03:47.160> more<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.609> an
