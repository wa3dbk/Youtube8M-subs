00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi friends from youtube this is my first 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.560
 video of how to create maps in counter 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.090
 strike with the program valve amer editor 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.120
 I leave you the link with everything 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.620
 we will use to create good maps in 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.929
 the first part I will show you how 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.690
 configure the amer valve editor for 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.699
 to be able to make very good maps 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 first we enter the winrar file 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.160
 that have to be downloaded and what 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.160
 decompress 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.820
 enter the folder you just 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.670
 decompress 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 good they will have all these files that 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.660
 they are all necessary so they 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.309
 I recommend that you make a separate folder 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.800
 where they want and keep everything there 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.290
 we open the application amer valve editor 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.900
 Spanish bar and we do the following 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.410
 we go to tools and click on 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.410
 options 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.629
 well let's go to the configuration tab 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.629
 of the game 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.960
 here we click on edit we give in 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.979
 add and write what I want 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.979
 I will write counter-strike 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.330
 now we give ok and close here we go to 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.490
 Add 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 we go to where is the folder that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.750
 unzip there we enter the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.560
 efe gv expert folder and we open the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.100
 file called cs 16 experts 805 efe 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.500
 head 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.700
 here we go in search and we look for the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.700
 counter strike folder 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.390
 down here we search and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.280
 we select the folder striker faith that 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.430
 it's inside the counter's folder 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.430
 strike 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.440
 and finally here we search and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.180
 we select the valve folder that 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.050
 It is also found within the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.090
 counter strike folder 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.070
 here we select the folder where 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.510
 we want to save the maps that 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.510
 they are not complete yet 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.590
 well done that we go to the tab 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.590
 compilation programs 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.850
 well here we search and open the 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.850
 exe file of the counter strike 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.800
 here we search and we go to the 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.590
 folder that we decompressed we enter 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.030
 the zh lt folder and open the file 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.030
 called h lcs g 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.710
 here we open the one called h msp 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.830
 here the one that says h l bis 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.720
 and here the one called hl ra here 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.880
 we select the folder where we want 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.890
 that the finished maps are saved 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.240
 I recommend that you select the 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.240
 map folder of the counter 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.940
 now finally we go to the tab 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.940
 textures 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.970
 we give in add web 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.180
 and we go to the c striker folder and 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.010
 we select the textures that we want 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.170
 do not select textures that have not 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.180
 come with the counter strike why they 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.680
 will say that the web file is missing and not 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.570
 will let you enter your map 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.050
 that's why select those that are already in 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.050
 the game 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.769
 now we go again to add wat and 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.470
 let's go to the valve folder and open the 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:12.020
 texture to flip uat that file brings 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.570
 infinities of textures of lpf live 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.360
 well now they give in files already new and 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.000
 you can already create your map good friends 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.190
