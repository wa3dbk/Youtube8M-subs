 build real estate developments 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.980
 on its bed this was one of the nine 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.410
 main rivers within the sub basin 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.960
 of acapulco in relieving the water of 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.420
 rain to the sea now there it 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.910
 find an urban area the colony 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.640
 city ​​he met one of the most affected 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.680
 in acapulco by the storm manuel in 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.110

 sea ​​port that another train is appreciated 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.530
 canceled the mean channel that drains 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.960
 goes to the black lagoon the third 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.360
 blocking is in the mean channel 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.390
 trico known now as geo I think so 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.840
 what they did were great developments 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.700
 of rooms I think there are in all 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 the non- middle class levels up 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.010
 they gave the permits there was lime but that 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.490
 nothing if of the permits and then 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.780
 investigate who gave those permits 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.740
 knowing that this was an area 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.200
 flooded 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.299
 thousands of homes shopping centers 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.240
 hotels and roads were built 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.970
 in areas intended for water flow 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.729
 rivers were diverted and blocked are 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.860
 organized in the area of ​​the lagoon a 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.250
 Acapulco diamond area is basically 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.600
 a wetland is a flood zone 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.060
 by nature if they have invaded the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.369
 wetland if they have gotten 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.550
 to live in flood zones if they are 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.569
 in the federal zones if we have changed 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.480
 la la 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.760
 river beds if we have to put in 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.310
 better condition then we can wait in 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.780
 this moment to build the road 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.819
 that connects the airport with the area 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.670
 acapulco diamond rose a dike 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.739
 artificial a fill of more than one 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.930
 meter in height that does not allow water 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.780
 of rain flowing from the mountains towards the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.670
 sea ​​as it did naturally in 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.260
 10 days the conagua will announce the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.209
 result of the study in which 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.239
 will explain the areas that were 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.879
 deforested the causes of rivers the 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.639
 natural areas invaded the dots 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.319
 where it was built irregularly and 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.719
 if any authority granted the 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.189
