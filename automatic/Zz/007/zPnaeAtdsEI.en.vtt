00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.200
 once upon a time ricardo santana 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.790
 professional project ricardo santana 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.040
 bringing you another video 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 informative tutorial 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.290
 this time attending requests in box about 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.330
 bodybuilding accessories 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.279
 the first question that may appear 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.839
 because I'm recording this video, no 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.339
 inside the gym but within a 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.409
 Supplement store 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:26.029
 the first love motive from the south and mexico 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:28.919
 also asks for bodybuilding accessories 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.259
 right the second reason is so important 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.279
 I do not get the 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.460
 accessories 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.469
 simply because throughout the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.440
 period than the one in class and I 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.269
 advisors were in use and worrying 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 were not being 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.829
 students who arrived first took the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.239
 belt took over the entire 5 training 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.530
 deactivated the function of the accessory 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.159
 transformed into an orthopedic prosthesis 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.179
 big mistake 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:03.539
 the function of any accessory is belt 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:10.070
 for the furniture weight anklet 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:14.549
 to tracks single pay queras claws 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:20.460
 strep all kinds of accessory 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.560
 stress all kinds of claws and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.100
 sessions to improve to improve 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.899
 the grip for the squats 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.820
 elbows of new anklets 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:38.880
 they are all just accessories 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.310
 they are not meant to replace the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.759
 work your muscle they are used 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.820
 as reinforcement or when you have a 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.649
 muscle weakness or some problem 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.530
 articulate that needs attention 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.500
 differentiated support 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.170
 or when you are training with loads 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.570
 on one 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.390
 and that there is a risk that you may 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.680
 moment of distraction from weakness be 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.590
 subject to injury 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.910
 then the accessory is valid and very well 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:13.600
 now come to use that time attachment 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.390
 Do you go into the gym until now? 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.550
 Do you go out or take you home? 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.459
 You think it 's a courtesy from the gym? 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.569
 no wonder this happens this is a 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.360
 big mistake 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.250
 just as an example the bodybuilding cycle 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.620
 this is a very conventional kind of 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.110
 belts and does not correspond to the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.470
 bodybuilding documents that were made 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.360
 that had the same width as 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.870
 had this narrowing going to the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.980
 beads were all great thick lakes 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.709
 culture mainly as effects 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.480
 for support in the lumbar is logical but 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.250
 also and especially to block 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.310
 that maximum moment of distension 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.100
 abdominal we observe the 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.230
 weight lifters that make 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.500
 lands the cne squat with loads 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.769
 that can not be avoided with a 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.890
 projection of the abdomen at the front is normal 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.880
 just happens that the belt would also be to 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.549
 that 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.500
 This one has a little knack here to give more 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.329
 a comfort but the support to stretch 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.780
 but you will have here enclosed in the 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.780
 front 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.750
 and in front it had the same thickness 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.150
 and closed then helped support a 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.470
 to prevent hyperextension 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.769
 of the abdomen 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.780
 today its main characteristic is 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.720
 one more support for the map 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.769
 but we see people using the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.300
 belt 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:55.250
 from the squatting and movements of 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.340
 development or curl up 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.959
 to walk on the treadmill to stretch 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.819
 believe everybody is a person not 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.310
 I feel at ease when I have a 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.400
 continuous exercise with it and compress the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.079
 an arrow of the knee at the time of the 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.269
 in the continuous interval with 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:18.049
 that tight thing the whole workout 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:21.500
 I think the following does not mean I 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.160
 I find my opinion and my advice is 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.500
 the following do not confuse the things you 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.650
 will note that a large proportion of 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.220
 staff students do not use as many 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.760
 because the staff can 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.919
 give a differentiated attention and lead 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.770
 the training of that student in such a way that 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.300
 same time he would have the chance to 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.550
 use the accessory he is learning 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.580
 to strengthen some parts of the body 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.850
 where would these accessories and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.190
 can minimize their use so that 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.070
 are simply accessories and 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.740
 inside a weight room 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.320
 teachers who have to take care of 30 40 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.740
 50 students at the same time end 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.880
 encouraging the use of the accessory by a 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.160
 longer period 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.020
 during training simply to 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.520
 ensure a little more security for 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.310
 that student at a time when he or 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.979
 is supervising a student but this does not 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.340
 is a frequent habit and one that is not 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.729
 make a rule because the accessory does not 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.030
 may cease to be the non-accessory 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.830
 pay attention to the exercises stimulate 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.099
 teachers their students to 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.980
 strengthen and indicate the accessory in the 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:40.100
 right time with the right load 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.750
 Please, this is the tip of today and yours. 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.910
 Today's video continues to access 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.760
 personal design page my channel on 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.070
 youtube to feedback is being very 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.580
 positive I like this interaction that 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.740
 is happening please come into your 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.890
 That's why I think I'm here a lot. 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.890
 thank you
