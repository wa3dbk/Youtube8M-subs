dimension<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:44.950> as<00:01:45.939> we<00:01:46.090> see<00:01:46.270> around<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.509> back

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
dimension and as we see around the back

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.359 
dimension and as we see around the back
let's<00:01:46.989> take<00:01:47.110> a<00:01:47.170> look<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.530> can<00:01:47.590> see<00:01:47.920> there<00:01:48.159> are

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
let's take a look you can see there are

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.990 
let's take a look you can see there are
power<00:01:49.360> strips<00:01:50.129> strips<00:01:51.129> is<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.459> regular<00:01:51.789> red

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
power strips strips is a regular red

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.990 
power strips strips is a regular red
light<00:01:52.270> we<00:01:53.049> have<00:01:53.319> a<00:01:53.799> strobe<00:01:54.280> light<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.939> are

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
light we have a strobe light that are

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.719 
light we have a strobe light that are
running<00:01:55.179> off<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.390> 120<00:01:56.229> volt<00:01:56.439> house<00:01:56.770> power<00:01:57.340> or

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
running off of 120 volt house power or

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.440 
running off of 120 volt house power or
wherever<00:01:58.299> you<00:01:58.569> live<00:01:58.929> could<00:01:59.259> be<00:01:59.379> 220<00:02:00.149> run<00:02:01.149> those

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
wherever you live could be 220 run those

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.350 
wherever you live could be 220 run those
and<00:02:01.750> then<00:02:02.259> we<00:02:02.349> have<00:02:02.560> our<00:02:02.860> car<00:02:03.429> strip<00:02:04.090> lights

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
and then we have our car strip lights

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.690 
and then we have our car strip lights
you<00:02:04.750> can<00:02:04.899> see<00:02:05.110> they're<00:02:05.319> all<00:02:05.469> in<00:02:05.619> series<00:02:06.069> for<00:02:06.399> 12

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
you can see they're all in series for 12

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.119 
you can see they're all in series for 12
volt<00:02:06.789> they<00:02:07.780> were<00:02:07.840> off<00:02:08.049> a<00:02:08.110> car<00:02:08.440> 12<00:02:08.769> volts<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.099> we

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
volt they were off a car 12 volts so we

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.960 
volt they were off a car 12 volts so we
just<00:02:09.369> put<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.789> power<00:02:10.750> war<00:02:11.109> 12<00:02:11.530> volt<00:02:11.709> into<00:02:12.069> power

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
just put a power war 12 volt into power

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.050 
just put a power war 12 volt into power
strip<00:02:13.359> DC<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.440> course<00:02:14.680> into<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> power<00:02:15.280> strip<00:02:15.579> of

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
strip DC of course into a power strip of

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.180 
strip DC of course into a power strip of
120<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.079> when<00:02:17.319> we<00:02:17.440> did<00:02:17.620> was<00:02:17.769> they<00:02:17.889> add<00:02:18.010> these

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
120 so when we did was they add these

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.250 
120 so when we did was they add these
remote<00:02:18.459> controls<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.239> see<00:02:19.450> here<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
remote controls you can see here to

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.259 
remote controls you can see here to
switch<00:02:20.470> power<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.310> off<00:02:21.549> and<00:02:21.910> that's<00:02:22.060> it

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
switch power on and off and that's it

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.259 
switch power on and off and that's it
for<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.650> actual<00:02:24.010> smoke<00:02:24.519> we<00:02:24.700> use<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> smoke

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
for the actual smoke we use a smoke

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.750 
for the actual smoke we use a smoke
machine<00:02:25.389> with<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> vacuum<00:02:26.319> tube<00:02:26.980> attached<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.730> a

from<00:02:33.609> the<00:02:33.760> top<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.209> volcano<00:02:34.500> very<00:02:35.500> basic

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
from the top of the volcano very basic

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.210 
from the top of the volcano very basic
but<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.519> lot<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.819> work<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.389> fun<00:02:38.010> volcanoes<00:02:39.010> are

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
but a lot of work but fun volcanoes are

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.990 
but a lot of work but fun volcanoes are
fun<00:02:39.609> unless<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:40.599> are<00:02:41.019> running<00:02:41.290> from<00:02:41.560> them

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
fun unless you are running from them

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.970 
fun unless you are running from them
other<00:02:43.000> additions<00:02:43.480> could<00:02:43.810> be<00:02:44.019> attaching<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.709> fan

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980
