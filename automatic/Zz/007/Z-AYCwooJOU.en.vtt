hydraulics work had an issue when I went

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.420 
hydraulics work had an issue when I went
to<00:00:13.110> hook<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.130> up<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:14.969> what<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.179> was<00:00:15.360> given

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
to hook it up this is what I was given

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.240 
to hook it up this is what I was given
crank<00:00:17.430> handle<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.439> here's<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.650> original

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.439 

original<00:00:23.250> rod<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:26.150> for<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> shoot

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
original rod for the for the shoot

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.740 
original rod for the for the shoot
directional<00:00:27.990> control<00:00:28.550> as<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:30.000> hook<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.539> some

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
directional control as a hook and some

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.650 
directional control as a hook and some
sort<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.109> teflon<00:00:31.560> block<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> end<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
sort of teflon block on the end and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.760 
sort of teflon block on the end and
somehow<00:00:33.899> that's<00:00:34.890> supposed<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:36.559> hook<00:00:37.559> into

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
somehow that's supposed to hook into

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.520 
somehow that's supposed to hook into
that<00:00:38.040> hook<00:00:38.280> which<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:39.050> played<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.230> for

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
that hook which I played with that for

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.090 
that hook which I played with that for
about<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> half<00:00:40.980> an<00:00:41.100> hour<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.460> gave<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.969> them

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
about a half an hour and gave up on them

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
about a half an hour and gave up on them
so<00:00:44.100> all<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.690> conclude<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.870> I'm

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
so all I can conclude is that I'm

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.500 
so all I can conclude is that I'm
missing<00:00:46.440> some<00:00:46.620> parts<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.789> according<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> some

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
missing some parts and according to some

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.100 
missing some parts and according to some
parts<00:00:48.870> manuals<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.539> am<00:00:51.539> there's<00:00:51.840> supposed<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
parts manuals I am there's supposed to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
parts manuals I am there's supposed to
be<00:00:52.170> another<00:00:52.350> rod<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.829> between<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.579> real

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
be another rod in between I'm not real

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.299 
be another rod in between I'm not real
sure<00:00:54.649> it<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.800> easier<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:58.129> convert<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
sure it was just easier to convert it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.910 
sure it was just easier to convert it
over<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.670> this<00:01:00.170> standard<00:01:01.170> parts<00:01:01.440> from<00:01:01.559> Ace

prevent it from binding because it's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.560

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
kind of hard to see where it is own

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.980 
kind of hard to see where it is own
you're<00:01:15.780> sitting<00:01:16.250> in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> operators<00:01:17.880> seat<00:01:18.380> and

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
wore out and my put wheels on it too

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.220 
wore out and my put wheels on it too
it's<00:01:41.550> easier<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.150> from<00:01:42.300> this<00:01:42.450> side<00:01:42.660> you

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.810 

can<00:01:46.230> see<00:01:46.260> that's<00:01:46.590> all<00:01:46.800> paper-thin<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.490> had<00:01:47.730> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
can see that's all paper-thin I had to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.430 
can see that's all paper-thin I had to
go<00:01:47.940> on<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.180> beef<00:01:48.300> it<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:49.200> but

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
go on and beef it up it's not pretty but

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.640 
go on and beef it up it's not pretty but
it's<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:51.330> worked<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> time<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.410> then<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
it's it worked at the time and then I

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.390 
it's it worked at the time and then I
thought<00:01:54.290> why<00:01:55.290> even<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.560> those<00:01:55.920> let's<00:01:56.190> just

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
thought why even have those let's just

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.600 
thought why even have those let's just
put<00:01:56.640> wheels<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:57.120> it<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:58.400> actually<00:01:59.400> a<00:01:59.430> friend

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
put wheels on it and actually a friend

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.340 
put wheels on it and actually a friend
of<00:01:59.700> mine<00:01:59.850> in<00:01:59.910> Iowa<00:02:00.270> thought<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.840> same<00:02:01.050> thing

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
of mine in Iowa thought the same thing

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.460 
of mine in Iowa thought the same thing
and<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.060> he's<00:02:03.360> looking<00:02:03.390> into<00:02:03.990> possibly

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
and I know he's looking into possibly

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.900 
and I know he's looking into possibly
doing<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.890> too<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.190> that's<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.490> reason<00:02:05.670> why

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
doing that too and that's one reason why

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.389 
doing that too and that's one reason why
I'm<00:02:05.970> shooting<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.600> he<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.250> see<00:02:08.250> how<00:02:08.340> I

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I'm shooting this so he can see how I

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.960 
I'm shooting this so he can see how I
did<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.790> and<00:02:08.880> maybe<00:02:09.060> change<00:02:09.390> things

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
did it and maybe change things

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.030 
did it and maybe change things
originally<00:02:11.970> started<00:02:12.300> these<00:02:12.480> out<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:13.040> three

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
originally started these out with three

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.130 
originally started these out with three
washers<00:02:14.490> on<00:02:14.760> each<00:02:14.970> one<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.870> make<00:02:16.020> sure

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
washers on each one just to make sure

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.600 
washers on each one just to make sure
that<00:02:16.410> when<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> did<00:02:16.830> well<00:02:17.010> them<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.340> could

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that when I did well them on I could

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.280 
that when I did well them on I could
pull<00:02:17.820> washers<00:02:18.240> out<00:02:18.420> if<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.690> has<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.930> go<00:02:19.050> lower

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
pull washers out if it has to go lower

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.100 
pull washers out if it has to go lower
and<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.850> can't<00:02:21.090> really<00:02:21.360> see<00:02:21.570> what<00:02:21.750> there's<00:02:21.900> is

were<00:02:59.390> bad<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.600> usually<00:03:00.110> used<00:03:00.290> everything<00:03:00.740> just

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
were bad I usually used everything just

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.750 
were bad I usually used everything just
gaskets<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.180> seals<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.520> stopped<00:03:04.520> leaking

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
gaskets and seals and so stopped leaking

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.920 
gaskets and seals and so stopped leaking
but<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.720> lot<00:03:06.020> more<00:03:06.050> work<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.770> machine<00:03:07.930> need

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
but a lot more work on this machine need

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.080 
but a lot more work on this machine need
to<00:03:09.020> be<00:03:09.110> repainted<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.860> all<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.880> good<00:03:11.060> stuff

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
to be repainted and all that good stuff

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:32.670 
to be repainted and all that good stuff
someday<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.880> we'll<00:03:14.180> give<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.320> try

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.930 

hydraulics<00:03:33.549> work<00:03:33.730> good<00:03:33.970> and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
hydraulics work good and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.510 
hydraulics work good and
papi<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.570> didn't<00:03:35.720> have<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.930> mess<00:03:36.080> with<00:03:36.110> out

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:56.630 

are<00:03:43.580> down<00:03:43.760> capability

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.110 

not<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.970> back<00:03:57.150> gets<00:03:57.360> used<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.780> lot<00:03:57.810> but

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
not the back gets used a lot but

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:10.170 
not the back gets used a lot but
sir

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.880 

I<00:04:10.269> guess<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:10.930> doesn't<00:04:11.079> have<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.409> be<00:04:11.530> running<00:04:11.739> to

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
I guess it doesn't have to be running to

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.750 
I guess it doesn't have to be running to
see<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.819> shoot<00:04:13.030> control<00:04:13.480> but

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.760 

just<00:04:18.420> left<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.840> right<00:04:20.150> limits<00:04:21.150> witches

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.029 

motor<00:04:24.340> seems<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.820> be<00:04:24.970> good<00:04:25.449> speed<00:04:25.889> could<00:04:26.889> be<00:04:26.919> a

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
motor seems to be good speed could be a

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.120 
motor seems to be good speed could be a
little<00:04:27.250> bit<00:04:27.370> faster<00:04:27.759> I<00:04:27.820> guess<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:29.650> might<00:04:29.889> bog

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
little bit faster I guess it might bog

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.570 
little bit faster I guess it might bog
down<00:04:30.340> under<00:04:31.740> under<00:04:32.740> Lola<00:04:33.039> when<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.310> snow<00:04:33.550> is

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
down under under Lola when the snow is

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.840 
down under under Lola when the snow is
coming<00:04:33.729> out<00:04:34.090> but<00:04:35.280> it's<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.430> pretty<00:04:36.580> strong

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
coming out but it's a pretty strong

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.529 
coming out but it's a pretty strong
motor<00:04:37.180> it'll<00:04:38.400> should<00:04:39.400> work<00:04:40.000> even<00:04:40.150> when<00:04:40.389> it's

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
motor it'll should work even when it's

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.890 
motor it'll should work even when it's
full<00:04:41.350> of<00:04:41.470> some<00:04:41.650> snow<00:04:41.919> but<00:04:42.250> we'll<00:04:42.430> see<00:04:42.810> how<00:04:43.810> it

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
full of some snow but we'll see how it

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.790 
full of some snow but we'll see how it
works<00:04:44.020> in<00:04:44.199> reality<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:47.280> other<00:04:48.280> than<00:04:48.550> that

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
works in reality and other than that

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.250 
works in reality and other than that
that's<00:04:50.800> about<00:04:50.979> it
