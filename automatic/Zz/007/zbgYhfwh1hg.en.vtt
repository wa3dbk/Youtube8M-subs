it sounds better for skating you have

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.260 
it sounds better for skating you have
more<00:01:17.369> protection<00:01:18.830> from<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> board<00:01:20.270> but

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
more protection from the board but

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
more protection from the board but
