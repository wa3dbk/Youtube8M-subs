I'll<00:05:16.290> just<00:05:16.350> use<00:05:16.590> these<00:05:16.770> shaders<00:05:17.070> for<00:05:17.220> now<00:05:17.600> if

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
I'll just use these shaders for now if

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.940 
I'll just use these shaders for now if
you<00:05:18.900> shift<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.500> right<00:05:19.590> click<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:19.920> can

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
you shift and right click you can

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.670 
you shift and right click you can
actually<00:05:20.220> rotate<00:05:20.550> it<00:05:20.910> in<00:05:21.120> there<00:05:21.450> are<00:05:21.690> 24

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
actually rotate it in there are 24

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.410
