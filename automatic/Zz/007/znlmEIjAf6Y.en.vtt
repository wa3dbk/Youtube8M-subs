00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.990
 welcome to the first appointment of the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.790
 2014 world swimming bomb league 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 we immediately see that our hero 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.419
 hypercube launches towards the bomb but 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.340
 the referee arrives in a helicopter e 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.439
 prevents him from getting a bike 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.119
 of water with two huge fans who 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.670
 they try to take him down but he pulls 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.039
 out his gun and kill them all 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.570
 and two or at least take an assist now i 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.790
 his teammates managed to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.580
 take the bomb but they are not enough 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.800
 strong and so they did kill us there 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.960
 we turn to the end of the game now the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.329
 loyal hypercube exhibits behind the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
 his left wing forming part of the 5th 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.300
 nice diarrhea both as motorbikes 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.160
 of water are carried on the staircase 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 we see that they approach the site of the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.449
 bomb but as they climb the stairs 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 a pine arrives with the machine gun placed 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.620
 to distant mind to his or above yes 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.410
 approach the site of the hypercube bomb 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.410
 the hero approaches an enemy kills him 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.450
 epic youtube hypercubes are welcome in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.060
 this extra video on Saturday afternoon 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.490
 offered to you or subscribers to understand 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.860
 see evaluating the obliteration mode 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.929
 of battlefield 4 this mode was 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.050
 launched from very little time inside 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.700
 of the open beta and let's try to understand 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.390
 together as a done that strengths that defects 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.649
 and above all that future a and here vi 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.319
 I recommend to see the video until 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.300
 end because I will ask you to comment in 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.000
 a certain way first of all the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.819
 protagonist is this bomb we must 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.619
 bring in one of the three bomb sites 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.590
 available at the enemy they are 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.789
 those marked in red or those 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.739
 to attack 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.750
 at the same time we must defend ourselves 

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.849
 preventing the enemy from carrying this 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.310
 bomb in our three bomb sites 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:56.190
 marked in blue on the mini map in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 basically attack an individual a 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.300
 player will collect these people from 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.560
 land and will have to bring it to one of 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.869
 these sites 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.950
 then you will have to press the button and activate the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.659
 bomb 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.399
 defend the site until there is 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.080
 the explosion at the explosion we will have 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.390
 destroyed a site of the three available 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.950
 once you blow up three sites 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.420
 we would have won the game 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.970
 in the same way we can play the game 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.160
 lose if we let an enemy set up 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.080
 three times and blow it up for three 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.599
 times the bomb at our sites 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.069
 those we should defend as 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.140
 the attack works as the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.000
 defense well both are very fast 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.590
 very fast the same time a lot 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.200
 attacking tactics we must be 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.640
 fast because once we have the 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.190
 bomb in hand especially if we are 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.680
 bringing ourselves we have gathered to 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.480
 ourselves the whole map will try to 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.280
 really kill us all 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.380
 they will cast us from fallen paratroopers 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.610
 from buildings to random shores than sometimes 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.519
 we could also find ourselves behind then 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.739
 we must be very careful fast 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.620
 at the same time tactical therefore us 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.239
 will have a great team play for 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.430
 defend the bomb ourselves and decide 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.010
 the smarter goal to which 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.750
 bring this explosive as far as 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.239
 concerns defense we should also be 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.130
 fast and organized because before 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.079
 we will then intercept the bomb more towards 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.420
 the center of the map and we will succeed first 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.650
 to bring it back to the attack so it is 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.850
 as a kind of pass me the comparison 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.769
 American football game not 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.150
 we must not back away too much e 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.880
 when we go on we must be 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.500
 sure to do it the right way 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.269
 regarding the bomb this 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.739
 spawn was at a random point 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.769
 but in the middle of the map ie 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.170
 equidistant from both factions 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.120
 this of course to balance the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.160
 so we'll have to follow i 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.340
 messages on screen and when will the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.799
 message locating new bombs the game the 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.239
 game ropes is deciding where to lay them 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.359
 based also on the combinations they are 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.099
 exits in the previous phases of the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.170
 game in theory should be random 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.170
 there shouldn't be a sequence 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.880
 ordered two games can start in 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.060
 two different ways therefore substantially 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.760
 this will guarantee good longevity 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.700
 to the game mode at this point the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.000
 game will tell us that the bomb was 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.170
 placed and will be in white format ie 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.150
 neutral and therefore any 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.459
 factions can conquer it e 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.980
 collect to bring it to the sites of 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.040
 attack by killing the enemy who carries the 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.720
 bomb this will be found again and 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.370
 will then become transparent dino 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.960
 we could charge it for this 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.980
 looks a lot like a game of 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.380
 American Football 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.820
 as for these spots 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.590
 will be very similar to those of the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.600
 run mode ie we could spur 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.850
 behind our faction partner o 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.669
 however, within his dies vehicle 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.980
 entered two more spawns they have 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.270
 the symbol of a parachute well this 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.010
 parachute can be used for 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.600
 launch on some roof or 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.180
 simply in the center of the map at 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.950
 time of drop of the bomb in this 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.580
 so we can easily reach it and 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:00.220
 a little faster than having 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.350
 had a commercial inside the 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.750
 which deployment I think i am 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.120
 be advantages of this mode are the merits 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.370
 which has a really hectic pace 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.040
 even better than that of andy game 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.290
 where it was often stopped in base and is 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.120
 a team game where you need a lot 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.620
 together we would be organized more 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.810
 we will have people around us 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.180
 surround and help us go towards 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.970
 the goal is the more we will succeed 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.620
 finally it is definitely a mode where 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.720
 we will be able to improve the 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.190
 our own individual tactics 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.919
 because when we have the bomb in hand 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.020
 to live for more than 5 seconds we should 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.180
 be really clear in where to go 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.700
 how to cover yourself in identifying the 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.789
 direction to take friends for 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.669
 save us life what are the faults of 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.490
 this coin of defects that if it is not 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.260
 your teammate in the sense 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.930
 who is not talking to you about teen 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.910
 what stands out on other foxes 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.169
 got the bomb well you have to hope that 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.000
 really have an intelligence for him 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.979
 less average because if it stops in 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.250
 base to lose time will make you lose 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.620
 time to all your action I have to say 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.289
 which, however, so far has not happened 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.510
 it's the best way for me to bring 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.910
 the bombs for Romanians in Syria Shanghai I have 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.190
 discovered that is the best way is that 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.950
 to get on the skyscraper launch on 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.050
 a roof is based on the quantity and the 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.180
 arrangement of teammates who 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.950
 follow us choose the target bombs 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.560
 so that they can cover us that 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.410
 we will die they will be facilitated in the 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.330
 take the bomb and carry it up to the 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.760
 target then go down a roof 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.740
 you decide a moment also through ps 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.640
 where the hell to go where there are less 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.310
 vehicles 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.170
 maybe you do some small diversion 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.640
 in the sense that we throw ourselves in a little way 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.050
 a target and then with the bomb if 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.820
 the same film once you go in the other 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.260
 in short, there are so many 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.080
 possibility of play 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.780
 I would like to know from you in the comments if 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.250
 this mode is having fun and some 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.080
 it's your best tactic to bring 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.910
 see the bomb in the lens 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.080
 next video commented and voted 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.080
 if you want to sign up 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:18.589
 ok
