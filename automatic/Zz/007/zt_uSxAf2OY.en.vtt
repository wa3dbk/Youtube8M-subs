00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
we are not used to that a lot of

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.249 
we are not used to that a lot of
moisture<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.420> air<00:02:02.510> as<00:02:02.720> well<00:02:02.900> because

mainly just in San Bernardino County but

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.840 
mainly just in San Bernardino County but
we'll<00:02:06.979> take<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.190> look<00:02:07.340> at<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.460> Doppler<00:02:07.640> radar

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
we'll take a look at the Doppler radar

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.430 
we'll take a look at the Doppler radar
in<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.420> moment<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:08.810> first<00:02:08.869> up<00:02:09.259> we're

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
in just a moment but first up we're

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.890 
in just a moment but first up we're
looking<00:02:09.739> live<00:02:09.920> in<00:02:10.130> Malibu<00:02:10.340> where<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.720> is

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
looking live in Malibu where this is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.180 
looking live in Malibu where this is
actually<00:02:12.050> where<00:02:12.410> we're<00:02:12.530> gonna<00:02:12.650> start<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.160> see

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
actually where we're gonna start to see

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.400 
actually where we're gonna start to see
the<00:02:14.000> change<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.569> weather<00:02:14.750> along<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the change in the weather along the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.080 
the change in the weather along the
coast<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.980> when<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.100> say<00:02:16.340> change<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.940> mean

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
coast and when I say change I mean

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.380 
coast and when I say change I mean
instead<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.140> heat<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.890> humidity<00:02:19.390> we

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
instead of the heat and the humidity we

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.120 
instead of the heat and the humidity we
are<00:02:20.810> going<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.230> looking<00:02:21.590> at<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.770> return<00:02:22.100> of

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
are going to be looking at the return of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.790 
are going to be looking at the return of
the<00:02:22.489> marine<00:02:22.670> layer<00:02:23.060> which<00:02:23.480> what<00:02:24.320> means<00:02:24.560> for

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
the marine layer which what means for

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.710 
the marine layer which what means for
you<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.160> some<00:02:25.370> cooler<00:02:25.640> temperatures<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.660> I

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
you is some cooler temperatures and I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.630 
you is some cooler temperatures and I
know<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:27.110> lot<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.560> folks<00:02:27.769> are<00:02:28.010> looking<00:02:28.190> forward

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
know a lot of folks are looking forward

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.640 
know a lot of folks are looking forward
to<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.090> we're<00:02:29.810> looking<00:02:30.050> at<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.260> Doppler

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
to that we're looking at the Doppler

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.410 
to that we're looking at the Doppler
radar<00:02:30.680> right<00:02:31.130> now<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.640> can<00:02:31.820> see<00:02:32.000> most<00:02:32.239> of

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
radar right now and you can see most of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.330 
radar right now and you can see most of
that<00:02:32.540> activity<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.680> San<00:02:33.890> Bernardino

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
are seeing most of the activity in fact

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.009 
are seeing most of the activity in fact
just<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.280> southeast<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:41.000> Barstow<00:02:41.600> we<00:02:41.900> are

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
seeing the thunderstorm cells see this

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.060 
seeing the thunderstorm cells see this
little<00:02:44.150> area<00:02:44.330> blue<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:45.260> means<00:02:45.530> there<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.040> a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
little area blue that means there is a

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.100 
little area blue that means there is a
good<00:02:46.340> chance<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:46.880> were<00:02:47.000> seeing<00:02:47.269> hail<00:02:47.630> with

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
good chance we were seeing hail with

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.620 
good chance we were seeing hail with
that<00:02:48.290> particular<00:02:48.610> thunderstorm<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.880> just

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
that particular thunderstorm and just

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.660 
that particular thunderstorm and just
above<00:02:50.900> 40<00:02:51.410> we<00:02:51.530> are<00:02:51.650> also<00:02:51.860> seeing<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.340> strong

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
above 40 we are also seeing a strong

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.330 
above 40 we are also seeing a strong
thunderstorm<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:53.989> again<00:02:54.380> we<00:02:54.920> are<00:02:55.010> still

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
thunderstorm there so again we are still

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.490 
thunderstorm there so again we are still
looking<00:02:55.549> at<00:02:55.850> some<00:02:56.200> activity<00:02:57.200> in<00:02:57.290> San

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
looking at some activity in San

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.050 
looking at some activity in San
Bernardino<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.040> again<00:02:58.459> these<00:02:58.670> thunderstorms

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
Bernardino and again these thunderstorms

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.690 
Bernardino and again these thunderstorms
could<00:02:59.870> also<00:03:00.170> not<00:03:00.590> only<00:03:00.860> bring<00:03:01.100> hail<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
could also not only bring hail and

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.610 
could also not only bring hail and
lightning<00:03:02.030> dangerous<00:03:02.720> lightning<00:03:02.900> but<00:03:03.440> heavy

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
lightning dangerous lightning but heavy

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.930 
lightning dangerous lightning but heavy

amounts of rain with these nearly

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.789 
amounts of rain with these nearly
stationary<00:03:05.360> storms<00:03:05.989> we<00:03:06.140> could<00:03:06.290> see<00:03:06.410> up<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.530> two

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
stationary storms we could see up to two

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.490 
stationary storms we could see up to two
inches<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.250> rain<00:03:07.400> per<00:03:07.820> hour<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.870> is<00:03:09.110> why

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
inches of rain per hour and that is why

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.560 
inches of rain per hour and that is why
we<00:03:09.890> are<00:03:09.920> still<00:03:10.190> dealing<00:03:10.880> with<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.269> flood

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
sure feels warm and that is because of

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.520 
sure feels warm and that is because of

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
we're not used to then and that's why

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.240 
we're not used to then and that's why
it's<00:03:31.910> feeling<00:03:32.239> even<00:03:32.360> warmer<00:03:32.900> than<00:03:33.109> it<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.470> look

the<00:03:46.040> winds<00:03:46.250> have<00:03:46.549> started<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.150> shift<00:03:47.420> coming

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
the winds have started to shift coming

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.630 
the winds have started to shift coming
in<00:03:48.140> more<00:03:48.470> out<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.829> West<00:03:49.070> with<00:03:49.459> that

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
in more out of the West with that

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.880 
in more out of the West with that
onshore<00:03:49.850> flow<00:03:50.329> that<00:03:50.930> brings<00:03:51.260> in<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.560> marine

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
onshore flow that brings in the marine

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.560 
onshore flow that brings in the marine
layer<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.370> eventually<00:03:52.940> some<00:03:53.239> cooler

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
layer and eventually some cooler

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.599 
layer and eventually some cooler
temperatures<00:03:54.109> but<00:03:54.620> for<00:03:54.890> now<00:03:55.070> this<00:03:55.280> ridge<00:03:55.489> of

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
temperatures but for now this ridge of

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.789 
temperatures but for now this ridge of
high<00:03:55.730> pressure<00:03:55.760> is<00:03:56.150> still<00:03:56.600> pulling<00:03:57.079> in<00:03:57.500> all

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
high pressure is still pulling in all

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.800 
high pressure is still pulling in all
this<00:03:58.280> month<00:03:58.549> sooner<00:03:58.970> moisture<00:03:59.359> you<00:03:59.449> can<00:03:59.570> see

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
this month sooner moisture you can see

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.810 
this month sooner moisture you can see
over<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.109> Four<00:04:00.350> Corners<00:04:00.590> region<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.340> what

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
over the Four Corners region and what

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.980 
over the Four Corners region and what
that<00:04:02.030> will<00:04:02.180> do<00:04:02.359> is<00:04:02.389> bring

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
that will do is bring

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.480 
that will do is bring
the<00:04:03.140> moisture<00:04:03.560> we've<00:04:03.710> got<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.010> daytime

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
the moisture we've got the daytime

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.670 
the moisture we've got the daytime
heating<00:04:04.790> produces<00:04:05.540> more<00:04:05.780> instability<00:04:06.110> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
heating produces more instability and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.810 
heating produces more instability and
that's<00:04:06.860> why<00:04:07.040> we've<00:04:07.250> been<00:04:07.400> seeing<00:04:07.640> those

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
that's why we've been seeing those

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.430 
that's why we've been seeing those
thunderstorms<00:04:08.210> develop<00:04:08.870> in<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.020> afternoon

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
thunderstorms develop in the afternoon

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.590 
thunderstorms develop in the afternoon
and<00:04:09.620> evening<00:04:10.220> hours<00:04:10.580> this<00:04:11.180> ridge<00:04:11.360> of<00:04:11.390> high

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
and evening hours this ridge of high

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.600 
and evening hours this ridge of high
pressure<00:04:11.630> shifting<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.830> east<00:04:12.860> down<00:04:13.400> we

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
pressure shifting to the east down we

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.280 
pressure shifting to the east down we
start<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.940> deal<00:04:14.090> more<00:04:14.360> that<00:04:14.420> onshore<00:04:15.080> flow

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
start to deal more that onshore flow

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.680 
start to deal more that onshore flow
which<00:04:16.220> brings<00:04:16.490> in<00:04:16.640> the<00:04:16.730> cooler<00:04:17.150> temperatures

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
which brings in the cooler temperatures

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.870 
which brings in the cooler temperatures
and<00:04:17.960> it<00:04:18.440> also<00:04:18.650> brings<00:04:19.070> in<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.400> marine<00:04:19.730> layer

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and it also brings in the marine layer

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.760 
and it also brings in the marine layer
so<00:04:20.120> by<00:04:20.330> this<00:04:20.510> weekend<00:04:20.840> we'll<00:04:21.260> be<00:04:21.380> back<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.739> that

so by this weekend we'll be back to that

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.620 
so by this weekend we'll be back to that
routine<00:04:22.280> where<00:04:22.490> we<00:04:22.610> see<00:04:22.940> some<00:04:23.120> morning<00:04:23.420> clouds

activity<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.410> still<00:04:39.950> think<00:04:40.160> we<00:04:40.310> will<00:04:40.520> see<00:04:40.760> some
