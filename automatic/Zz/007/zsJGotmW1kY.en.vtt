bypass you want to make sure that when

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.240 
bypass you want to make sure that when
the<00:01:14.300> pedal<00:01:14.510> is<00:01:14.690> off<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.440> not<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.860> grade<00:01:16.100> in

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
the pedal is off it's not the grade in

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.820 
the pedal is off it's not the grade in
your<00:01:16.400> signal<00:01:16.760> okay<00:01:17.660> very<00:01:18.050> very<00:01:18.229> important

okay<00:01:19.280> let's<00:01:19.460> mess<00:01:19.580> around<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.910> bit<00:01:20.060> more<00:01:20.150> let's

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
okay let's mess around a bit more let's

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.640 
okay let's mess around a bit more let's
try<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.540> get<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.720> little<00:01:21.050> bit<00:01:21.140> more<00:01:21.320> over<00:01:21.560> the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
try to get a little bit more over the

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:33.800 
try to get a little bit more over the
top<00:01:21.710> pull<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.550> bottle

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:02:11.630 

Oh

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.430 

see<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.790> never<00:02:13.060> really<00:02:13.270> gets<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.200> always

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
see it never really gets you can always

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.020 
see it never really gets you can always
understand<00:02:14.890> all<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.160> notes<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.640> never<00:02:15.850> lose

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
understand all the notes you never lose

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.670 
understand all the notes you never lose
the<00:02:16.240> clarity<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.990> that's<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.350> think<00:02:17.470> is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
the clarity and that's I think is

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.160 
the clarity and that's I think is
largely<00:02:18.190> due<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.670> what<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.030> circuitry<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.630> you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
largely due to what the circuitry is you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.510 
largely due to what the circuitry is you
know<00:02:20.290> things<00:02:20.560> don't<00:02:20.770> get<00:02:20.890> mobile<00:02:21.280> things

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
know things don't get mobile things

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.040 
know things don't get mobile things
don't<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:21.820> all<00:02:21.940> much<00:02:22.540> together

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
don't get all much together

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.530 
don't get all much together
and<00:02:23.530> this<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.100> bone<00:02:24.370> clean<00:02:24.700> sound<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.300> if<00:02:25.420> you

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
and this is a bone clean sound so if you

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.030 
and this is a bone clean sound so if you
have<00:02:25.720> kind<00:02:25.960> of<00:02:25.990> an<00:02:26.110> overdrive<00:02:26.530> sound<00:02:26.740> on<00:02:26.950> your

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
have kind of an overdrive sound on your

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.949 
have kind of an overdrive sound on your
amp<00:02:27.250> or<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.850> crutch<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.600> take<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.900> thing

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
amp or a crutch then you take this thing

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.720 
amp or a crutch then you take this thing
you<00:02:29.200> get<00:02:29.320> like<00:02:29.530> pretty<00:02:30.160> much<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.310> massive

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
you get like pretty much the massive

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.980 
you get like pretty much the massive
distortion<00:02:31.150> thing<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.480> were<00:02:31.570> going<00:02:31.780> for
