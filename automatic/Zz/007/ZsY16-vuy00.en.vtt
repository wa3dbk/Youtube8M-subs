00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.600
 oh well that's okay then you have to 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.809

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.890
 what is not fun and taking a bath 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.280
 pipapanda 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.370
 look otto the elephant is coming 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.659
 hey pipapanda and bodhi the monkey is up 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.960

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.489
 I would rather play otto but in 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 bath you can re right 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.869
 also play pipapanda i always think 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.869
 stones on the book here 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:07.439
 yes you search at the bottom of the river 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.689
 stones and whoever has the largest wins 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.740
 pipapanda seems like that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.140
 and together they walk to the water look 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.100
 pipapanda the water comes from the river 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.020
 from the mountains there when it rains 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:29.390
 so it flows from the mountains into this 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.520
 river the river is nice and full I first 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.080

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.080
 bogey already disappeared under water 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.909

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.180

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.350

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.410
