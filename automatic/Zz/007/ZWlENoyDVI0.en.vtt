okay<00:00:00.840> so<00:00:00.900> Crysis<00:00:01.469> 2<00:00:01.500> lots<00:00:02.370> of<00:00:02.490> people<00:00:02.700> are

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay so Crysis 2 lots of people are

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.100 
okay so Crysis 2 lots of people are
complaining<00:00:03.060> about<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.419> motion<00:00:03.720> blur<00:00:03.810> in<00:00:04.020> the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
complaining about the motion blur in the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.390 
complaining about the motion blur in the
game<00:00:04.259> some<00:00:04.589> people<00:00:04.830> think<00:00:05.009> it<00:00:05.130> gives<00:00:05.220> some

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
game some people think it gives some

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.470 
game some people think it gives some
headaches<00:00:05.700> some<00:00:05.940> people<00:00:06.180> think<00:00:06.359> it's

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
headaches some people think it's

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.350 
headaches some people think it's
overkill<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.170> think<00:00:07.740> looks<00:00:07.890> great<00:00:08.160> but<00:00:08.400> alright

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
overkill I think looks great but alright

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.020 
overkill I think looks great but alright
so<00:00:09.540> how<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> disable<00:00:10.110> or<00:00:10.440> enable<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.920> at<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
so how to disable or enable it at the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.360 
so how to disable or enable it at the
very<00:00:12.179> top<00:00:12.450> left<00:00:12.719> there's<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> tilde<00:00:13.590> key<00:00:13.799> Tildy

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
very top left there's a tilde key Tildy

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.760 
very top left there's a tilde key Tildy
it<00:00:14.610> it's<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.780> squiggly<00:00:16.230> line<00:00:16.410> next<00:00:16.650> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
it it's a little squiggly line next to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.380 
it it's a little squiggly line next to
the<00:00:16.859> one<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> tab<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.060> if<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.210> press<00:00:18.330> it

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the one in the tab so if you press it

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.109 
the one in the tab so if you press it
this<00:00:18.930> console<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.410> come<00:00:19.680> up<00:00:19.830> let's<00:00:20.730> type<00:00:20.939> in

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
this console to come up let's type in

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.730 
this console to come up let's type in
our<00:00:21.500> underscore<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.850> motion<00:00:23.850> blur<00:00:24.000> space<00:00:24.990> zero

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
our underscore a motion blur space zero

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.040 
our underscore a motion blur space zero
and<00:00:26.010> then<00:00:26.580> press<00:00:26.730> Enter<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.180> then<00:00:27.689> there

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and then press Enter and then there

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.760 
and then press Enter and then there
should<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.199> no<00:00:28.260> more<00:00:28.529> motion<00:00:28.830> blur<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.310> can

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
should be no more motion blur as you can

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.640 
should be no more motion blur as you can
I<00:00:30.390> think<00:00:31.390> motion<00:00:31.900> blur<00:00:32.020> makes<00:00:32.259> YouTube<00:00:32.500> videos

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
I think motion blur makes YouTube videos

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.700 
I think motion blur makes YouTube videos
look<00:00:33.220> better<00:00:33.520> but<00:00:33.730> whatever<00:00:34.329> if<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.410> want<00:00:35.440> to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
look better but whatever if you want to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.450 
look better but whatever if you want to
only<00:00:36.340> turn<00:00:36.670> on<00:00:36.790> motion<00:00:37.510> blur<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:38.260> only<00:00:38.680> blurs

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
only turn on motion blur that only blurs

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.780 
only turn on motion blur that only blurs
when<00:00:39.700> you<00:00:39.760> move<00:00:40.030> around<00:00:40.150> or<00:00:40.570> walk<00:00:40.750> or<00:00:40.780> jump<00:00:41.790> do

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
when you move around or walk or jump do

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.000 
when you move around or walk or jump do
one<00:00:43.059> instead<00:00:43.600> as<00:00:43.809> you<00:00:44.290> can<00:00:44.440> see<00:00:44.620> right<00:00:44.860> now

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
one instead as you can see right now

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.100 
one instead as you can see right now
when<00:00:45.250> I'm<00:00:45.370> moving<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.879> gun<00:00:46.059> blurs<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.390> lot<00:00:46.690> this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
when I'm moving the gun blurs a lot this

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.080 
when I'm moving the gun blurs a lot this
blur<00:00:47.379> isn't<00:00:47.559> very<00:00:47.800> good<00:00:47.860> but<00:00:48.430> it's<00:00:48.640> better<00:00:48.940> on

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
blur isn't very good but it's better on

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.830 
blur isn't very good but it's better on
your<00:00:49.330> PC<00:00:49.930> just<00:00:50.559> make<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:50.830> lag<00:00:50.949> as<00:00:51.160> much<00:00:51.340> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
your PC just make it lag as much and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.869 
your PC just make it lag as much and
when<00:00:52.840> I<00:00:52.870> jump<00:00:53.170> there's<00:00:53.470> blur<00:00:53.650> but<00:00:54.250> as<00:00:54.580> you<00:00:54.760> can

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
when I jump there's blur but as you can

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.570 
when I jump there's blur but as you can
see<00:00:54.940> there's<00:00:55.570> no<00:00:55.690> blur<00:00:55.900> normally<00:00:56.800> but<00:00:57.550> this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
see there's no blur normally but this

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.759 
see there's no blur normally but this
blur<00:00:57.940> when<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.239> move<00:00:58.390> your<00:00:58.540> screen<00:00:58.809> all<00:00:59.620> right

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
blur when you move your screen all right

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.920 
blur when you move your screen all right
for<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.190> last<00:01:00.220> one<00:01:00.670> it's<00:01:00.930> object-based

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
for the last one it's object-based

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.920 
for the last one it's object-based
motion<00:01:02.350> blur<00:01:02.500> it's<00:01:02.769> -<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:04.570> one's<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.839> best

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
motion blur it's - this one's the best

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.620 
motion blur it's - this one's the best
one<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.500> keep<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.040> on<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:06.220> one<00:01:06.430> so<00:01:07.210> basically

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
one I keep it on this one so basically

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.090 
one I keep it on this one so basically
everything<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.260> your<00:01:08.350> screen<00:01:08.650> that<00:01:08.830> moves

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
everything on your screen that moves

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.000 
everything on your screen that moves
blurs<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:10.420> if<00:01:10.570> your<00:01:10.720> gun<00:01:10.900> is<00:01:11.049> moving<00:01:11.380> it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
blurs so if your gun is moving it

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.289 
blurs so if your gun is moving it
doesn't<00:01:12.250> really<00:01:12.340> blur<00:01:12.580> unless<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.030> moves<00:01:13.180> a

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
doesn't really blur unless it moves a

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.660 
doesn't really blur unless it moves a
lot<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:14.409> see<00:01:14.680> this<00:01:14.830> blur<00:01:15.100> yeah<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:18.310> one<00:01:18.490> is

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
lot you see this blur yeah this one is

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.710 
lot you see this blur yeah this one is
the<00:01:19.090> best<00:01:19.270> much<00:01:19.540> blur<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.950> is<00:01:21.070> our<00:01:21.220> chance

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the best much blur this is our chance

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.960 
the best much blur this is our chance
because<00:01:22.720> I'm<00:01:23.260> going<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:24.340> most<00:01:24.520> high-tech

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
because I'm going to the most high-tech

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.300 
because I'm going to the most high-tech
and

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.850 

it<00:01:28.210> dynamically<00:01:28.720> sees<00:01:29.079> how<00:01:29.380> much<00:01:29.439> people<00:01:29.710> are

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
it dynamically sees how much people are

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.429 
it dynamically sees how much people are
moving<00:01:30.159> can<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.430> make<00:01:30.579> simpler<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:32.140> other<00:01:32.229> ones

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
moving can I make simpler the other ones

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.069 
moving can I make simpler the other ones
are<00:01:32.590> really<00:01:32.740> cheap<00:01:33.040> bored<00:01:33.689> don't<00:01:34.689> have<00:01:34.840> it<00:01:34.990> at

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
are really cheap bored don't have it at

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:53.510 
are really cheap bored don't have it at
home

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.849 

that's<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:54.819> motion<00:01:55.270> blur<00:01:55.299> let's<00:01:56.229> do<00:01:57.569> the

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
that's with motion blur let's do the

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.990 
that's with motion blur let's do the
moving<00:01:59.859> only<00:01:59.979> motion<00:02:00.249> blur<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.520> see<00:02:00.850> how<00:02:00.909> it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
moving only motion blur and see how it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.690 
moving only motion blur and see how it
looks<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:02.020> as<00:02:02.229> you<00:02:02.380> can<00:02:02.500> see<00:02:02.709> only<00:02:02.979> motion

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
looks so as you can see only motion

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.639 
looks so as you can see only motion
blurs<00:02:04.000> when<00:02:04.149> I<00:02:04.179> move<00:02:04.450> or<00:02:05.079> when<00:02:05.289> I<00:02:05.380> move<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
blurs when I move or when I move the

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.630 
blurs when I move or when I move the
screen<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.579> I<00:02:06.729> throw<00:02:06.909> this<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:09.099> doesn't<00:02:09.250> blur

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.170 

but<00:02:12.640> if<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.819> enable<00:02:12.970> this<00:02:13.269> motion<00:02:13.629> blur<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:16.030> can

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
but if I enable this motion blur you can
