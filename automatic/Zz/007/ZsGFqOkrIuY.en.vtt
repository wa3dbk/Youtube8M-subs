00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
that is that a dead a David Lewis and

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.259 
that is that a dead a David Lewis and
Felipe<00:03:25.169> sent<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.709> partnership<00:03:26.459> at<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.970> back

Felipe sent on a partnership at the back

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.259 
Felipe sent on a partnership at the back
I<00:03:27.569> think<00:03:28.199> so<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.639> not<00:03:29.849> this<00:03:30.000> just

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
I think so so and it's not this just

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.759 
I think so so and it's not this just
this<00:03:30.389> episode<00:03:30.780> guys<00:03:30.959> I'm<00:03:31.199> not<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.560> saying<00:03:31.650> it

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
this episode guys I'm not just saying it

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.439 
this episode guys I'm not just saying it
because<00:03:31.919> there<00:03:32.159> are<00:03:32.310> two<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.639> two<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.299> the

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
because there are two of two of the

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.240 
because there are two of two of the
defense<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.049> three<00:03:34.379> games<00:03:34.680> are<00:03:34.889> using

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
defense that the three games are using

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.309 
defense that the three games are using
those<00:03:35.340> players<00:03:35.669> it<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.449> genuinely<00:03:36.959> because

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
those players it is genuinely because

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.890 
those players it is genuinely because
they<00:03:37.530> are<00:03:37.680> overused<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.609> everywhere<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.480> think

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
they are overused and everywhere I think

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.030 
they are overused and everywhere I think
I<00:03:39.989> come<00:03:40.139> up<00:03:40.319> against<00:03:40.620> them<00:03:40.799> are<00:03:40.889> probably

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
I come up against them are probably

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.490 
I come up against them are probably
about<00:03:41.359> probably<00:03:42.359> about<00:03:42.479> one<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.019> every<00:03:43.139> two

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
about probably about one in every two

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.020 
about probably about one in every two
games<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:43.949> half<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.220> games<00:03:44.579> I<00:03:44.699> have<00:03:44.849> to<00:03:44.940> play

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
games so half the games I have to play

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.610 
games so half the games I have to play
against<00:03:45.359> those<00:03:45.510> two<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.930> they're<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.139> so

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
against those two and they're just so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.099 
against those two and they're just so
powerful<00:03:46.949> is<00:03:47.340> actually<00:03:47.879> ridiculous<00:03:48.569> now<00:03:49.049> we

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
powerful is actually ridiculous now we

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.170 
powerful is actually ridiculous now we
went<00:03:49.470> behind<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.979> a<00:03:50.010> free-kick<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.849> much<00:03:51.000> we

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
went behind to a free-kick not much we

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.210 
went behind to a free-kick not much we
could<00:03:51.299> do<00:03:51.479> to<00:03:51.659> it<00:03:51.780> as<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:52.440> did<00:03:52.620> do<00:03:52.799> everything

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
could do to it as we did do everything

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.740 
could do to it as we did do everything
in<00:03:53.340> our<00:03:53.430> power<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.760> stop<00:03:53.879> it<00:03:54.090> jumping<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.599> wall

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
in our power to stop it jumping the wall

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.759 
in our power to stop it jumping the wall
putting<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> man<00:03:55.139> on<00:03:55.169> the<00:03:55.349> line<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.739> was

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
putting a man on the line but it was

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.830 
putting a man on the line but it was
just<00:03:55.859> well<00:03:56.129> enough<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:56.909> here<00:03:57.090> quickly<00:03:57.540> got

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
just well enough but we here quickly got

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.960 
just well enough but we here quickly got
back<00:03:58.019> into<00:03:58.229> the<00:03:58.409> game<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.829> nice<00:03:59.280> header<00:03:59.579> across

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
back into the game a nice header across

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.539 
back into the game a nice header across
from<00:04:00.329> Kagawa<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.260> Hernandez<00:04:02.129> managed<00:04:02.430> to

from Kagawa and Hernandez managed to

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.369 
from Kagawa and Hernandez managed to
score<00:04:02.790> now<00:04:03.269> this<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.690> where<00:04:03.840> I'm<00:04:03.989> starting<00:04:04.199> to

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.150 
happening is because when you're doing

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
going to be one-on-one with the keeper

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.780 
going to be one-on-one with the keeper
when<00:04:40.990> they<00:04:41.110> take<00:04:41.350> their<00:04:41.530> shot<00:04:41.830> so<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.639> in

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
when they take their shot so that in

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.400 
when they take their shot so that in

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
that instance you can see that I end up

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.100 
that instance you can see that I end up
conceding<00:04:44.979> 2<00:04:45.760> goals<00:04:46.090> out<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.600> five<00:04:46.840> shots

conceding 2 goals out of the five shots
on<00:04:47.229> target<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.770> know<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:48.070> managed<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.460> get

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
on target and I know you managed to get

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.909 
on target and I know you managed to get
one<00:04:48.850> goal<00:04:49.449> out<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:49.660> 9<00:04:49.960> on<00:04:49.990> target<00:04:50.530> because<00:04:50.650> my

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
one goal out a 9 on target because my

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.219 
one goal out a 9 on target because my
shots<00:04:51.190> were<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.340> lot<00:04:51.490> more<00:04:51.520> difficult<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.690> maybe

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
shots were a lot more difficult so maybe

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.810 
shots were a lot more difficult so maybe
I<00:04:53.380> need<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.710> completely<00:04:54.100> think<00:04:54.430> about<00:04:54.669> my

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
I need to completely think about my

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.120 
I need to completely think about my
style<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.300> play<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.840> actually<00:04:56.200> start<00:04:56.680> playing

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
style of play and actually start playing

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.740 
style of play and actually start playing
on<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.580> counter<00:04:57.970> because<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.330> seems<00:04:58.540> to<00:04:58.660> be

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
on the counter because it seems to be

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.750 
on the counter because it seems to be
what<00:04:58.870> everyone<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.770> doing<00:04:59.800> nowadays<00:05:00.280> people

play park the bus and then just do
