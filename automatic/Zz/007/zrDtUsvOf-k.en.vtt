00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
really get threats to the letter in the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.240 
really get threats to the letter in the
book<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.020> all<00:00:34.230> blurs<00:00:34.469> together<00:00:34.770> her

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
book it's just all blurs together her

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.290 
book it's just all blurs together her
because<00:00:35.550> she's<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.570> shock<00:00:36.809> then<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.440> left<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
because she's in shock then you left and

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.819 
because she's in shock then you left and
start<00:00:39.300> being<00:00:39.420> shocked<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.469> idea<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
start being shocked at that the idea of

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
start being shocked at that the idea of
what<00:00:40.980> heat<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.399> he's<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> go<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.090> um

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
what heat is that he's going to go do um

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.010 
what heat is that he's going to go do um
so<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.739> thought<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.210> in<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.360> context<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> was

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so I thought that in that context it was

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.209 
so I thought that in that context it was
better<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.230> leave<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> letter<00:00:46.739> out<00:00:46.800> because

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
better to leave the letter out because

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.790 
better to leave the letter out because
her<00:00:47.700> her<00:00:48.480> thinking<00:00:48.780> process<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.440> jumbled

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
her her thinking process was so jumbled

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.630 
her her thinking process was so jumbled
in<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.840> I'm<00:00:51.840> clear<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.649> many<00:00:53.280> many<00:00:53.340> people

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
in and I'm clear but many many people

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.119 
in and I'm clear but many many people
over<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> years<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.690> asked<00:00:54.899> me<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:55.890> in

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
over the years and asked me what was in

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
over the years and asked me what was in
the<00:00:56.280> letter<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.520> he<00:00:56.699> wrote<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the letter that he wrote and so I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.900
