00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
original shape and I didn't think I

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.729 
original shape and I didn't think I
would<00:00:43.129> ever<00:00:43.250> test<00:00:43.610> this<00:00:43.850> but<00:00:44.840> shows<00:00:45.440> them<00:00:45.680> a

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
would ever test this but shows them a

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.730 
would ever test this but shows them a
manual<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.090> I<00:00:47.120> feel<00:00:47.329> like<00:00:47.450> testing<00:00:47.900> it<00:00:50.740> alright

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
manual so I feel like testing it alright

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.810 
manual so I feel like testing it alright
