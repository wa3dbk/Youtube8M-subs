00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
through you have to go right from the

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.430 
through you have to go right from the
fence<00:03:10.830> so<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.310> go<00:03:11.490> round<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.260> go<00:03:16.350> up

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
fence so you go round it and you go up

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.340 
fence so you go round it and you go up
to<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.680> wall<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.510> can<00:03:18.690> jump<00:03:18.900> over<00:03:19.080> it

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
to this wall and you can jump over it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.750 
to this wall and you can jump over it
don't<00:03:19.590> fall<00:03:19.860> into<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.190> black<00:03:20.310> hole<00:03:20.610> wait

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
don't fall into the black hole wait

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.990 
don't fall into the black hole wait
you're<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:20.970> gonna<00:03:21.180> die<00:03:22.400> okay<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.460> you<00:03:23.760> jump

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
you're just gonna die okay so you jump

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.760 
you're just gonna die okay so you jump
over<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:26.000> sprint<00:03:27.000> jump<00:03:27.240> across<00:03:27.480> it

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
over it like that sprint jump across it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.720 
over it like that sprint jump across it
okay<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.830> can<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.100> look<00:03:29.280> anywhere<00:03:29.640> around

okay you can have a look anywhere around

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.250 
okay you can have a look anywhere around
there<00:03:30.030> but<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.390> quickest<00:03:30.720> route<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:30.960> get<00:03:31.110> to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
there but the quickest route to get to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.960 
there but the quickest route to get to
the<00:03:31.380> next<00:03:31.530> part<00:03:31.800> is<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.220> by<00:03:32.490> running<00:03:32.700> across

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the next part is just by running across

00:03:32.970 --> 00:04:03.649 
the next part is just by running across
this<00:03:33.240> frame<00:03:33.540> that's<00:03:33.780> off<00:03:33.960> route<00:03:34.500> across

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.050 

okay<00:04:04.659> this<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.140> final<00:04:05.319> area<00:04:05.829> you<00:04:06.310> can<00:04:06.819> get

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
okay this is the final area you can get

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.640 
okay this is the final area you can get
in<00:04:07.239> really<00:04:08.370> be<00:04:09.370> free<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:09.849> a<00:04:09.879> look<00:04:09.939> around

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
in really be free to have a look around

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.869 
in really be free to have a look around

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
but make sure you don't fall through a

don't mind that and you can start with

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.800 
don't mind that and you can start with
pre-built<00:04:18.760> into<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.269> can't<00:04:19.479> get<00:04:19.690> through

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
pre-built into you can't get through

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.960 
pre-built into you can't get through
that<00:04:19.930> fence<00:04:20.229> but<00:04:20.739> when<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.459> come<00:04:21.579> onto<00:04:21.729> this

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.550 

can<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.090> get<00:04:31.240> for<00:04:31.330> any<00:04:31.479> build<00:04:31.720> in<00:04:37.530> okay<00:04:38.530> this

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
can you get for any build in okay this

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.469 
can you get for any build in okay this
is<00:04:38.889> where<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.160> trouble<00:04:39.460> starts<00:04:39.820> because<00:04:40.150> as

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
is where the trouble starts because as

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.790 
is where the trouble starts because as
soon<00:04:40.660> as<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:40.840> approach<00:04:41.110> that<00:04:41.289> slope<00:04:41.650> you

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
soon as you approach that slope you

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.730 
soon as you approach that slope you
start<00:04:42.039> falling<00:04:42.220> down<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:43.360> from<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.470> point

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
start falling down and from that point

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.950 
start falling down and from that point
you<00:04:45.039> could<00:04:45.490> fall<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:46.240> could<00:04:46.389> fall<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.750> drive

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
you could fall you could fall and drive

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.650 
you could fall you could fall and drive
from<00:04:47.169> anywhere<00:04:47.470> really<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:47.949> we're<00:04:48.280> down<00:04:48.460> here

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
from anywhere really so we're down here

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.790 
from anywhere really so we're down here
and<00:04:49.660> have<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:49.780> look<00:04:49.990> around<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.320> map<00:04:50.530> again

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
and have a look around the map again

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.290 
and have a look around the map again
once<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.190> in<00:04:51.430> there<00:04:51.669> you<00:04:51.760> can't<00:04:51.970> really<00:04:52.030> get

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
once you in there you can't really get

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.560 
once you in there you can't really get
out<00:04:52.479> very<00:04:52.510> easily<00:04:53.669> so<00:04:54.669> I'm<00:04:55.060> just<00:04:55.240> gonna<00:04:55.360> have<00:04:55.510> a

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
out very easily so I'm just gonna have a

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:16.840 
out very easily so I'm just gonna have a
look<00:04:55.660> around<00:04:55.810> here<00:05:00.539> yeah<00:05:02.310> not<00:05:03.310> dead<00:05:03.490> yet

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.840 

and<00:05:17.330> there<00:05:17.510> we<00:05:17.630> go<00:05:18.110> fell<00:05:18.800> down<00:05:18.830> it's<00:05:19.490> invisible

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
and there we go fell down it's invisible

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.330 
and there we go fell down it's invisible
so<00:05:20.390> you<00:05:20.450> can<00:05:20.930> fail<00:05:21.200> from<00:05:21.410> anywhere<00:05:21.800> really<00:05:22.040> so

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
so you can fail from anywhere really so

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.630 
so you can fail from anywhere really so
be<00:05:23.030> careful<00:05:23.480> where<00:05:23.630> you<00:05:23.750> tread<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:24.640> yeah
