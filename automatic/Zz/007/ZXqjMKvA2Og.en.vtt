00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.399
 I know I have a lot of young people 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.370
 they follow me and support me and that is very 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:13.009
 good because I for example when I 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.559
 they say it 's my idol that thinks you're 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.509
 whatever it is I do not take it in plan to enhance 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.700
 my ego the rappers we have the ego of 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.220
 But he took it from me so I take it 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.560
 as I do not always have parents 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.619
 I was looking at someone older 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.500
 to have like a myth there to follow and 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.050
 It depends on what he was doing 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.570
 it was also my way of building me 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.120
 like a man not that skill that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.920
 was missing 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.890
 in the middle that my mother could not give me 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.019
 well copied then now that 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.699
 we should refer the good thing about this to the 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.890
 communicated is that the kids also 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.690
 They are thinking a bit as these that 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.640
 they are young and we can change things 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.170
 so today I'm going to ask you for a favor today 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.449
 I will not make a statement I will ask 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 a real favor there is one thing that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.440
 It has always blown me and I had 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.809
 a lot of fights with that I think that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.470
 we can start to change if you pass 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.750
 this video to another wall to another to another 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 Well, I want to ask that when you are in 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.200
 gang for my neighborhood or that we are for 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.780
 money whatever if a kid goes by 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 your relative that you have the maximum 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.060
 respect as if you were a 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 place where you do not know or is outside of 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.500
 neighborhood where you are not with colleagues 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.820
 where we know the maximum respect to 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.070
 that kid that goes with the girl 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.930
 say anything to the girl 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.550
 because we are going to show first the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.050
 our respect to be respected 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.479
 us because as we would not like 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.880
 well, we should not do it 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.189
 those things d 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.590
 to say guarded or stay 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.770
 looking is a bit what I ask is a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.659
 little respect and that you think that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.549
 really think about how you will feel 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.929
 you are in a place that is not 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.729
 the neighborhood because it's all in the neighborhood 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.250
 we know that there are many people who 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.039
 fuck you have to live your quiet life 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.770
 and it's not not going through for the best 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.630
 what you pass but you do not have to 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.849
 in a respectful way with him then 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.790
 when you see a boy with the girlfriend 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.450
 I ask you please let me go to 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.660
 its air that you do not get with it that 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.610
 truth there are many women the kid that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.140
 be with a girl do not look at her and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.400
 dedicated to yours and you listen to me 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.080
 honest really we'll start to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.959
 change things happening from wall the wall and 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.140
 it really happens that's a sample of 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.480
 respect and truth as men 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.360
