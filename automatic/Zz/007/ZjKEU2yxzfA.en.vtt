00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.420
 this is the video we're going through and so 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.070
 nothing colors a little bit of summer a 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.740
 little bit of autumn so it's that if you 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.780
 like how it looks and you want to know how 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.029
 stay and here I leave the video 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.580
 begins by applying a pre-base 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.350
 it may be the one you have up to 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.320
 people who do not have so greasy the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.330
 eyelid can use a concealer with 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.160
 this brush ruined him I'm going to apply my 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.830
 illuminator in this case this of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.590
 extensions with which I will apply 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.230
 below the eyebrow and I'll go 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.809
 blurring a bit towards the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.300
 in and towards the basin with a brush 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.530
 to blur preferably have 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.070
 the open bristles 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.930
 I'm going to drink this clear coffee and I'm going to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 apply a little bit above the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.690
 eye socket and I'm going to blur it 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.360
 upwards so that it diffuses with the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.390
 illuminator 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.970
 now I'm going to take this pencil which is a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.430
 shadow in cream and I'm going to apply it 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.020
 that would be the mobile eyelid this is going to 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 make the shadow that applies here 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.710
 all have one have a better 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.710
 intensity 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.920
 now with a brush for shadows I'm going to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.700
 use a shade always in this case 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 of the palette of 88 colors in sowing and 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.240
 I'm going to apply it on the eyelid 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.240
 mobile giving small taps 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.260
 once applied desire I will take another 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.870
 brush to blur in this case this 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.280
 that this diet is thinner and 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.860
 using a copper color 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.340
 I'm going to use it in what would be the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.740
 eye socket between the pair between the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.930
 shadow of the mobile eyelid and my color of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.990
 transition 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.000
 then I'm going to take the brush that is 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.640
 well sponge dita and I'm going to blur 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.030
 these two colors together with a brush 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.570
 at an angle or in pencil and you have used 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.030
 a color either black or brown and is the one 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.910
 I will use to give depth in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.730
 the outside of what would be the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.500
 eye socket 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.640
 this is going to make the look a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.640
 little more dramatic 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.599
 Now I will return with the brush to 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.450
 blur with which the color applies 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.920
 copper and I'm going to blur them together to 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.380
 that there are no marked stripes 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.239
 with the same brush either the pencil or 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.580
 is angular can apply that same 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.220
 coffee color in the line of the eyelashes 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.400
 inferior to middle 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.250
 and with a very small brush I will 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.070
 use this pigment is a green color 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.270
 but it has golden sparkles this I'm going 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.370
 to apply the tear to middle and 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.350
 below the brown color that applies 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.230
 previously 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.600
 then with a very small streak I'm going 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.330
 to use a golden color this is from the 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.400
 cost pallet cents and I'll apply it 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.560
 in what would be the tearing blurring 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.980
 I made it to the lash line 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.320
 superior and inferior in Chinese my 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.930
 eyelashes and I apply these lashes 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.330
 richter and number 600 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.210
 I will also apply an eyeliner on 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.130
 gel this is new web and once 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.990
 posts I'm going to apply what would be the 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.960
 mascara or mascara on the eyelashes 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.120
 inferior and superior with this one I'm going to 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.600
 delineate the water line 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.210
 this is a pencil that shadow in pencil and 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.490
 this is how the eyes look 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.090
 going to the lips I'm going to use a 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:47.030
 pencil of mix in the color ever and with it 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.640
 I'm going to outline the lips 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.380
 I'm going to fill them with this lipstick that 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.380
 it's called honey in a natural color 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.760
 and with my finger I'm going to blur what 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.549
 so that it is not so marked 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.920
 and later I will apply a lip 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.060
 gloss called a speed that is a 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.060
 flesh color too 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.330
 we move to the cheeks using the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.890
 palette of 10 cost cents rumors 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.470
 smile a little bit so you find the 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.620
 highest part of the cheeks and 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.440
 blurs back and that's how 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.750
 ends on Monday occasion is also a 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.550
 look with some color but not good 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.640
 You can also use for the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.370
 Autumn season as you see is a green 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.500
 with orange colors the green then it 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.470
 translate still that this little color a 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.480
 little more vibrant but if you want it 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.820
 replace with an olive green that is a 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.140
 little more neutral because you can 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.480
 replace 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.550
 I'm using copper colors that are 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.660
 as I told you one of the trends for 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.360
 this fall season little dramatic 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.150
 use a more eye-catching eyeliner 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.910
 with a tail or the one that there is that law 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.190
