00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.420
 both more than the exposed in the street in fact a model in lion exist in 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.980
 see him 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.789
 if we want to go 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.549
 see at what point is that an interest 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.429
 but obviously it is to extend it 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.400
 open 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.740
 this book consists of two parts the first time of the day showing the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.009
 its ports 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.150
 their 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.300
 details 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.619
 how will they see your screen is 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.310
 your keyboard 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.010
 full keyboard qwerty good paper the doctor commented back data 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.050
 you have a 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.289
 all of his 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.010
 two buttons 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.070
 percent 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.510
 these this keyboard similar but we do not want now I'm later 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.950
 like 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.210
 your movement this is where you learn 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 has jean output 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470
 those cd taboos 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.330
 for percent commissions 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.040
 up to three bike days per second 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.630
 to connect external hard drives 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.770
 this is the \ It \ him 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.010
 on Friday 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.170
 it's sensible to count the modern monitors 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.280
 has to incorporate comment other monitors 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.660
 modern also 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.350
 the sanaa are some of these dates for photographic shots I tried in porto 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.510
 portugal min 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.200
 to connect video cameras 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.320
 like that of 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.240
 two 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 and we have two centers of 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.100
 for hearing aids 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
 and not for microphone 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.980
 and basically it's all we have on the outside 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.980
 here only the current was cut off 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.460
 22 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.100
 there it says 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 what you have with others 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.520
 Specifically activate the puppet as well as put your name min 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.530
 in this case with these deals does not have do not have this 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.969
 uu no 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.289
 but for the most interesting part that is how to run this computer 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.510
 but for this we are going to have to check it with another computer 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.359
 klaus to buy them with the only author that we have at this moment what is 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.689
 is 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.669
 who are of age 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.769
 who knows how to deny it after these commercials 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.729
 love 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:41.799
 p 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.869
 The moment of the truth 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.769
 the two computers in the performance and the performance in which it was designed 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.749
 just him just like it's for games 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.959
 the night in the darkness that he estimated 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.699
 common that we have enjoyed their games the foals 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.559
 similarities between the two computers both 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.659
 they have a keyboard the film and not just to play 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:04.079
 There is no light 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.529
 in the case of 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:09.349
 singular country many potitos which has made quite popular 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.019
 respect because he knew dyn 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.949
 set absolutely 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:15.849
 all the colors of all the guys that come out 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.629
 and the same with 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.709
 but he and what are you waiting for? 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.439
 plant 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.439
 what it costs to do performance 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:28.599
 world of warcraft 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.309
 two configurations are in ultra 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:34.309
 and has an age sample who defends her 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.930
 this young man and has time that went out so any modern computer 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.930
 can cover the basic requirements to run the voters 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.529
 in fact the difference is marked by two of the processed 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.489
 that is why 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.230
 Normally the game runs with a little more fluency the Athenaeum r-tx 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.799
 In general, this difference is not so noticeable in the game 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.329
 in fact of tembleque comparing one with another more or less to realize that 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:05.649
 they 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.939
 but this difference increased dramatically when arriving at places like 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.089
 cities where, because there are so many people, the processing is very intense 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.259
 however despite the fact that the image is cooled much lower speed 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.799
 a little behind stays playable all the time 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:26.059
 towns like juarez and yet they are another story 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.349
 that does not exist because he feels that he demands a lot of power 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:34.419
 That's why the telenovela here in San Salvador is perfect and video is from 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.559
 72 valley identity cores instead of the 48 cores ti 512 megabytes that 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:41.870
 has the other computer 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.979
 let run in a moderately high specification 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.229
 Thank you 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.300
 neither of the two computers can run at full capacity 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:53.219
 and the difference between them is not bad 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.590
 In summary 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.150
 the m11x mess from it is a laptop designed 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.330
 especially for video games 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.680
 although its process is from a previous generation and less speed 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.130
 compensate performance with your video card superior to most computers 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.559
 portable 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:16.620
 compared to a macbook pro the gm 11 x leathery more or less at par 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.339
 but for half the price 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:22.229
 its only weak point is the processor p covering the extra cost can 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.839
 change to a core i5 or a core i7 in the online theme store 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.039
 that was our plane and we hope you liked it 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.699
 more information the wish together with mx point
