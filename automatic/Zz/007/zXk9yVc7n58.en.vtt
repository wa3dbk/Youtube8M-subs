00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 and they just write 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.669
 in the stomach 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.699
 the snake ski student advertising Jackson Euro pay attention there 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650
 he will certainly never say Julien 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.369
 Directed molecules 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.890
 archive 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.890
 Art thus offers 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.220
 when I'm hiding from me 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.400
 Ola after the bags 18 did not stand still Nahles March again for 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.000
 possible 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 the Marburger Bund and countries can provide 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.840
 Burgwald 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 I'm close 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 we will demand more in Europe 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.250
 because I'm active on the team 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.120
 To find the island the package is off 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 you can not just accelerate one and we're there 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.080
 La Concept 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.010
 as a form of expression 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010
 just stupid 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.340
 Paul 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.530
 Widing so far 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.530
 because it corresponds 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.890
 to the mediation 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.440
 not without doubt 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.150
 it is not so 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.630
 finally 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 the plump figure with Vista and Windows 7 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.590
 I would like the rainbow 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.489
 after on the other 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.979
 we are looking forward to the victory here 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.449
 and if it's really serious 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.629
 this hit 14 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.689
 and turn again 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.959
 infinite hit to the 2 0 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.959
 Opus I wanted Siegburg 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.649
 Applause harvested 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.649
 schleswig-holstein produces 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.559
 and if so 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.559
 because the format soil samples 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.409
 Of course we have one so we would like to 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.289
 it will be 2 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:20.349
 the 5th 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.629
 free 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.629
 Rottweil round enough 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:33.089
 this time AG 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.349
 motorman 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.469
 and we are powerful 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.469
 so tall 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.429
 off to bed 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:58.429
 easy way hard way 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.579
 good that can 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.579
 5 in the lead the boat missed more space 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.339
 background 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.339
 Nico's pious wish has been too heavy 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:15.729
 this is new here 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:16.789
 Philip KÃ¶ster 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.789
 Hutterer stopped the Mio now 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.809
 but Mehdorn and in Venice 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.050
 next to the Eclipse 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.860
 every war will be 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 Winkelmann Merkel 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.629
 you should still draw other traces 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:45.580
 Loosen the minute on quicksand 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.969
 the web portal 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.830
 Palop easily gets that far again 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.830
 Striker Teemu Broadley 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.430
 Nadia to lead smaller ones 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.289
 the system continues 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.259
 BRA ob and 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.960
 sometimes so Dungl 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.889
 how to cheer once 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.889
 Rome 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.889
 and there is nothing left 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.509
 quoted is like this 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:36.059
 so many ask 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.939
 No no 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.939
 and then only death 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.860
 LÃ¼nen the oligopoly Ivo Kummer 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.059

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.889
 vin / ap 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.589

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.300
 Wiblingwerde 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.969
 2nd place so why is she standing up? What do you really want to do? 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.889
 could use the other side 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:32.999
 - easy 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:35.999
 on the other hand 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:39.969
 unfortunately, there is time here that means I have my little friends 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:42.139
 I can not talk to you 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.139
 I have something to do 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:52.539
 Ground forces would 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.889
 important 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.889
 No, I would not 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.409
 Well that was really 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:09.409

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.319
 Frankfurt 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:14.319
 Pound the word war
