pretty<00:00:58.710> shaky<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.600> he<00:01:00.780> was

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
pretty shaky now you see here he was

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
pretty shaky now you see here he was
actually<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.230> very<00:01:01.379> aggressive<00:01:01.710> player<00:01:02.129> he

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
actually a very aggressive player he

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
actually a very aggressive player he
ended<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.850> taking<00:01:03.120> my<00:01:03.390> players<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.809> countless

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
ended up taking my players out countless

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
ended up taking my players out countless
times<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.589> think<00:01:04.650> he<00:01:04.830> had<00:01:04.949> already<00:01:05.220> five<00:01:05.760> yellow

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
times I think he had already five yellow

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.940 
times I think he had already five yellow
cards<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.630> David<00:01:07.229> Luiz<00:01:07.409> eventually<00:01:07.770> gets

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
cards and David Luiz eventually gets

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.890 
cards and David Luiz eventually gets
sent<00:01:08.159> off<00:01:08.250> however<00:01:08.729> he<00:01:09.210> does<00:01:09.360> manage<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.659> get

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
sent off however he does manage to get

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.330 
sent off however he does manage to get
one<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.350> goal<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> counter-attack<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
one more goal on the counter-attack I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.250

David Luiz was sent off and that was the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.030 
David Luiz was sent off and that was the

result after we went one build down and

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.020 
result after we went one build down and
we<00:02:58.560> were<00:02:58.709> doing<00:02:59.189> some<00:02:59.370> good<00:02:59.519> work<00:02:59.579> against

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
we were doing some good work against

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.970 
we were doing some good work against
like<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.329> don't<00:03:00.480> know<00:03:00.689> how<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:00.959> really<00:03:01.620> struggled

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
like I don't know how I really struggled

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.920 
like I don't know how I really struggled
so<00:03:02.099> much<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.400> think<00:03:02.760> my<00:03:02.909> finishing<00:03:03.659> is<00:03:03.900> a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
so much I just think my finishing is a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.369 
so much I just think my finishing is a
little<00:03:04.439> bit<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.159> no<00:03:05.700> rubbish<00:03:06.540> really<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.079> what

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
little bit but no rubbish really is what

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.809 
little bit but no rubbish really is what
i'm<00:03:07.470> going<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.650> say<00:03:07.709> forward<00:03:08.220> because<00:03:08.489> i<00:03:08.609> just

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
i'm going to say forward because i just

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.460 
i'm going to say forward because i just
can't<00:03:09.030> seem<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.450> be<00:03:09.629> clinical<00:03:10.139> enough<00:03:10.349> in

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
can't seem to be clinical enough in

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.500 
can't seem to be clinical enough in
front<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.829> goal<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.489> convert<00:03:11.879> my<00:03:12.030> chances

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
front of goal to convert my chances

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.699 
front of goal to convert my chances
that's<00:03:12.689> something<00:03:12.900> i<00:03:12.989> really<00:03:13.169> need<00:03:13.439> to<00:03:13.530> work

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
that's something i really need to work

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.990 
that's something i really need to work
