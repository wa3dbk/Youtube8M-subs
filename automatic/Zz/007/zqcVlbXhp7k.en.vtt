never<00:00:05.970> stood<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.390> fucking<00:00:06.810> chance<00:00:07.109> sunshine<00:00:10.040> to

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
never stood a fucking chance sunshine to

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.919 
never stood a fucking chance sunshine to
get<00:00:11.190> used<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.639> think<00:00:11.730> but<00:00:12.389> once<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.750> get

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
get used to I think but once you get

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.169 
get used to I think but once you get
better<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.980> name<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.700> means<00:00:15.030> not

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
better at it I name it means not

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.500 
better at it I name it means not
probably<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.570> think<00:00:15.660> they're<00:00:15.960> more<00:00:16.080> powerful

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
probably I think they're more powerful

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.269

they<00:00:18.510> are<00:00:18.539> but<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.320> it'd<00:00:19.560> be<00:00:19.770> better

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
they are but I just think it'd be better

they are but I just think it'd be better
to<00:00:20.520> use<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.180> oh<00:00:21.449> yeah<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> would<00:00:22.320> always
