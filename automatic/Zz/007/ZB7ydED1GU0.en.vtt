00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.459
 The boot of my car sm7 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.000
 U 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.519
 Two-day talk points to 157. 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:40.720
 Now the red light on the right comes in, so it is finished in the heap Deep pigment 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.720
 I'll test the state rpm and soup 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 U 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.480
 Stool test on 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:11.100
 cng cng state to state, passing by 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.100
 Let's try to go rpm 2ts * 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.180
 The green light is on the right side, so I'm done. 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.909
 5 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.950
 Let's see the rpm in gas now. 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.979
 Let's test whether the rpm drops steadily or not. 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.979
 Ah 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.130
 Software testing 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 cng Similar to the gasoline, s 2 is coming out more than 2000 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:03.469
 By inserting a small gas container valve 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.469
 Let's test whether the gas is automatically exhausted to exhausted gasoline. 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.870
 Gas valve Do not lock the valve and de flush it now Pressure drops 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.870
 There is 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:36.900
 4 As soon as the gas is off, it is a space state with no gasoline 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.900
 Cancer is the fourth to escape gauge 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.430
 Open the gas valve again 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.450
 cng Let 's do this 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.450
 10-character pressure on the gas valve has risen to 157 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.710
 Now let's barely back 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.750
 You have turned yourself
