to be I guess determined by the evenness
of<00:00:53.870> these<00:00:54.870> tops<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.320> spots<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.039> very

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
of these tops you spots so it's very

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.790 
of these tops you spots so it's very
important<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.699> pick<00:00:56.969> near<00:00:57.420> halfway<00:00:57.719> points<00:00:58.320> or

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
important to pick near halfway points or

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.939 
important to pick near halfway points or
pass<00:00:59.160> near<00:00:59.550> halfway<00:00:59.789> points<00:01:00.800> generally<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
pass near halfway points generally the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.939 
pass near halfway points generally the
way<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> process<00:01:02.399> works<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:04.500> find<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
way the process works is you find a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.370 
way the process works is you find a
point<00:01:05.630> roughly<00:01:06.680> halfway<00:01:07.939> between<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.630> collar

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
point roughly halfway between the collar

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.710 
point roughly halfway between the collar
and<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.250> start<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> sleeve<00:01:14.299> it's<00:01:15.299> kind<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and the start of the sleeve it's kind of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.440 
and the start of the sleeve it's kind of
hard<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.580> find<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.700> point<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.299> you've

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
hard to find this point out so you've

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.380 
hard to find this point out so you've
got<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.720> go<00:01:18.780> through<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> few<00:01:19.170> shirts<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:21.240> get

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
got to go through a few shirts to to get

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.120 
got to go through a few shirts to to get
it<00:01:21.479> figured<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.200> best<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.950> right

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it figured it's best to do this right

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.780 
it figured it's best to do this right
after<00:01:23.310> you've<00:01:23.640> done<00:01:24.119> your<00:01:24.240> laundry<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:26.460> next

after you've done your laundry the next

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.580 
after you've done your laundry the next
point<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:29.000> you've<00:01:30.000> got<00:01:30.240> another<00:01:30.810> spot<00:01:31.200> about

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
point is you've got another spot about

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.940 
point is you've got another spot about
half<00:01:31.890> way<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.900> little<00:01:33.900> bit<00:01:34.020> past<00:01:34.320> halfway<00:01:34.619> down

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
half way a little bit past halfway down

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.340 
half way a little bit past halfway down
the<00:01:35.009> shirt<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> need<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.090> recognize<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
finally after that you're going to have

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.319 
finally after that you're going to have
to<00:01:40.530> grab<00:01:40.799> another<00:01:41.100> spot<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.680> on<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> bottom

to grab another spot down on the bottom
all<00:01:45.329> these<00:01:45.890> three<00:01:46.890> points<00:01:47.899> you<00:01:48.899> should<00:01:49.140> be

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
all these three points you should be

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.580

able<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> draw<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> line<00:01:50.009> between<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.640> all<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
able to draw a line between them all and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.160 
able to draw a line between them all and
this<00:01:52.590> will<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.100> help<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:54.090> finished<00:01:54.780> fold

this is what we have at the sleeve
hanging<00:03:14.099> out<00:03:14.419> now<00:03:15.470> what's<00:03:16.470> great<00:03:16.680> about<00:03:16.799> this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
hanging out now what's great about this

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:24.339 
hanging out now what's great about this
is<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.669> just<00:03:18.000> bring<00:03:19.370> your<00:03:20.370> hands<00:03:20.760> over<00:03:22.760> and

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
then it's not exactly even but this is

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:35.270 
then it's not exactly even but this is
the<00:03:29.849> first<00:03:30.560> pass<00:03:32.659> on<00:03:33.659> the<00:03:33.750> shirt<00:03:33.900> fold<00:03:34.280> so

the first pass on the shirt fold so
let's<00:03:35.579> do<00:03:35.729> this<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:35.940> few<00:03:36.060> more<00:03:36.299> times<00:03:38.629> and<00:03:39.629> we'll

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
let's do this a few more times and we'll

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.610 
let's do this a few more times and we'll
see<00:03:40.019> if<00:03:40.079> we<00:03:40.139> can<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.349> perfect

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.020
