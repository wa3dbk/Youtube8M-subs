00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.430
 This time from the boat is october middle 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.250
 October so optimal weather for 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.900
 vertical between and doing exactly that 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.699
 We now also months so for fanny trough 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.699
 you can lie that you now 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.560
 So that's how we manage the bait 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.869
 can just slow down to 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.200
 Reason we arrived we are 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.720
 again piece up and then back in 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.720
 slow-motion slow down 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.570

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.920

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.820
 a nice zander one again 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.820
 more beautiful and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.440
 if I do not appreciate it can be so great 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.520
 you also loose on the fear completely 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.959
 still refrain 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.920
 here now takes a different revenge 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.920
 wonderful so the time off actually 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.660
 virtually no addition to zander so 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.050
 I caught two times he has two 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.280
 had touched now let stand up 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.790
 he has taken a right then 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.010
 skin of course he missed but 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.870
 miller goes back on travel spot is 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.230
 started again 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.230
 on it goes s 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.700
 very nice 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.980
 zander has nailed important 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.550
 so comes the bait and beautiful hotel 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:41.410
 celebrated chur 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.610
 so it may go on so friends 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.650
 I have just been with the assembly once 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.440
 demolished last time for you 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.990
 Show times as we vertically plants 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.430
 go fishing so is quite normal with 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.820
 a small vertical route with a 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780
 top action 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.390
 important, it is a strong 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.830
 backbone at we fish here all over 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.209
 short distance instant pause but 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.560
 then yes, it must also be continuous 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.420
 normal flow carbon cord connected 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.220
 with the braided whiskers and purrs 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:19.600
 then just a small one comes down below 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.530
 duo look werberat or you lure 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:32.110
 hanger and then just with the blood only 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:34.150
 123 times only wrap folk do so 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.520
 that the best knot at the 30 only 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.900
 not three times because I'm here 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.330
 the line at the top quickly 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.130
 could rejuvenate and then it becomes 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.120
 Oath break come at the strong fish 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.430
 we do not want that 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.280
 So that was all about what we cover 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.950
 To prepare here we come to 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.660
 bait 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.820
 I already have heads for that 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.010
 prepared that is 28 grams 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.900
 head may like a bit stronger 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.570
 because we have better controls 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.490
 Just when we are against currents 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.800
 have to fight or we have one 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.250
 better reason control 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.330
 I made the lead off in the front and 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.130
 so we can often times a greener 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.530
 change without ever getting that of the 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.880
 bait here in front fray so we 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.880
 are hung in the normal way 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.400
 so do not pull too deep so that the 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.280
 bait also that the hook bow too 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.040
 completely rausguckt and now finally 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.919
 just my sticker the one before me 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.000
 has already prepared here in the front 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:46.620
 houses and for the rear drilling 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:49.300
 Indirectly that looks like this then 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.630
 just pay attention once again that 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.260
 We also place the Dunlop 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:59.650
 say I made once to the 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.480
 sticker also really under the small one 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.669
 bow from the hook seat and not over it 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.919
 or nothing can happen now 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.870
 Assembly is ready to use 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.370
 and now let's see that we can do it 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.540
 drive my beautiful big zander 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.540
 can see you soon 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:29.060
 so they are running shoot i say it 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:37.490
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, such a splash 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:41.120
 but okay semi-strong but I say it 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:50.630
 just where are you there yes baby 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:07:08.289
 it likes you age vertical crack nice 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:07:08.289
 Yes, we present here 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:17.949
 Mum hear I have not in the picture 2 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.949
 my best great fish 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.080
 so friends our vertical fishing is too 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.650
 The End 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.140
 we have a total of 10 zander today 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.570
 can catch a few again 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.550
 small but also brands right 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.590
 Stately caught was very much 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.590
 beautiful in any case, looking forward to 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:45.010
 next time and until then all the best 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.010
 until the next compulsory game
