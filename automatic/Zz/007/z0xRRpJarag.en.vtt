00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.530

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.630
 silicone gel hulls for the week to 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.119
 ghetto and then it's available to 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.430
 from 9 euros 90 overprotests 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.500
 crampons like and it's also available 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.810
 in four colors so in version 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.300
 transparent white version 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 turquoise in pink version and in version 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.149
 black so good if so that get away has 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.320
 beautiful being very pretty with his little back 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.079
 in imitation leather and its contour in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.239
 aluminum is still very good of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.510
 protect it because it's still 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.180
 a smartphone that weighs 133 g with a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.820
 5-inch screen when it is not 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 protected if it falls like that of 2 1 or 2 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.620
 meters high it may melt at 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.260
 level of the screen and the silicone gel has 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.780
 for peculiarity of amortizing a small 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.460
 little shocks so here we will test 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 right away those little products that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.290
 will allow you to protect your 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.979
 precious then I tried everything the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.530
 white version the one that allows 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.710
 keep a little bit of color there I 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.330
 am on the navy version of this week at 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.600
 gateway so a little bit navy 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.040
 for feast and then tested 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.110
 this one 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.670
 that's all it's easy for you 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 tuck your smartphone in like 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 these have adjusted to the millimeter and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.110
 every opening has been thought so we have 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.590
 well an opening for the 3.5 jack 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.560
 no problem getting in your cable 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.740
 same for the micro usb as well as the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.610
 little microphone right next we have a good 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.400
 access to power keys and keys 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.410
 however, it will be necessary to 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.140
 obviously remove this shell for 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.310
 have access to different map edges 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.229
 micro-sim micro sd then flies to the otherwise 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.990
 at the level of this hull and well we have a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.509
 outline that is pretty clear enough 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.990
 transparent and as usual we have a 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.660
 back a little math that's nice to 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.180
 touch and who is going really well protected 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.700
 your smartphone finally it's a little 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.400
 the goal and without really distorting 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.820
 this one this transparent version is 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.010
 perfect for that we still have 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.750
 the reminder of the colors of the week 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.160
 gateway and we can see the slices in 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.440
 external aluminum 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.610
 so it's rather nice handfield 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.610
 try the turquoise version 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 hop 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.500
 then for this turquoise version 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.940
 listen it's pretty nice we have 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.870
 really feels like having a wilko 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.830
 guetta or is turquoise 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.550
 it's a nice enough effect 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.220
 it changes 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.750
 history to color a little this one if 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.989
 you have a black version for example 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.269
 even a version of life finally 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.099
 listened to that but even worth the color 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.489
 naji from this week to get away to 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.349
 the outside is rather nice and thanks 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.250
 at transparent edges we always 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.170
 access to the pretty aluminum edge of the 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.920
 ghetto had so it's really good 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.680
 thought it's really millimeter and that 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.239
 add a very slight thickness 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.510
 really light so that's it really 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.239
 nice and we have a small in a small 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.989
 bead like that all around the 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.549
 front side that allow you to get 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.120
 catch up when he goes down and 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:47.769
 that's pretty cool and the device 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.510
 photo of the week at the gateway is really it 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.819
 spring almost no what makes it 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.790
 is well protected by this shell 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.250
 it's pretty cool too and I prefer 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.970
 you show it we know enough that's 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.150
 pretty well thought 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.420
 hop we'll let you go to the version in 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.420
 pink 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.060
 here to give a touch 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.060
 feminine at this we come get away 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.000
 we see there in pink version it's a 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.690
 funny effect 1 with the navy version to 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.430
 the outside but why not maybe 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.410
 with a white version to it will make 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.130
 surely better at a white version of 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.160
 this smartphone and to finish the version 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:39.070
 black who she has the particularity of being 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.070
 matt rather the hull that I like is there 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.050
 so I said this black version she 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.360
 is completely mattel is not 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.910
 transparent 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.790
 so she will not let the 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.550
 aluminum edges etc this week at 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.370
 get away and it completely changes his 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.919
 his design finally blow I guess 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.520
 that you realize it is enough 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.520
 nice to his 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.550
 we just have a little reminder of it on 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.139
 the keys actually makes it 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.960
 but otherwise it's the same thing if at 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.910
 the limit you have the outline of your 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.410
 curico ghetto and scratched for example on 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.990
 aluminum since aluminum sas 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.760
 claw quite easily it must be said 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.130
 it really belongs to the materials 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.199
 super pretty finally but who gets 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.389
 scratch quite easily good story 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.389
 to hide aulas to the safra a rendering 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.360
 quite simple again so that's it 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.789
 for these old silicone gel shells 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.940
 forgiveness that are available from 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.800
 9 euros 90 overprotective point like 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.400
 I recall overprotective dot

 as the shipping costs are offered to 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.180
