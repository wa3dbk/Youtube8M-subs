00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
 so welcome to the last exercise of yoga 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.890
 for athletes and 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.080
 Here we do something for the guy again 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:18.099
 whole body in reality the whole 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:21.060
 money is so we start in the 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.060
 opposition 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.860
 from here it rests on one 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:38.230
 side and then kick with the other 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.269
 leg comes out and squats 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.280
 without turning off the leg and goes 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:48.730
 in front and then crack back in 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.760
 the starting position kick other side 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.420
 to turn the outside or the leg off 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.530
 kick forward and like that 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.539
 starting position 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.530
 now we can connect that has 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.750
 He already met 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:09.500
 from here to the back 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:15.580
 looking down dog forward towards 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:20.560
 went outside starting position to the front 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:25.340
 away to the outside forward 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.790
 starting position jump back and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.979
 forward again I have the exercise yet 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.810
 never done 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.149
 and how does that look like shit 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.979
 but I notice it then let you then 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.830
 Do not fool or if I'm the people 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.500
 I see what are you doing there completely 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.170
 honestly I notice already in here 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.970
 happier and in the fuselage I notice too 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 So the tension in the trunk that the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.940
 bos stages it 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.979
 As I said, the concept of yoga works 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.860
 just not as that limited a 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.259
 body of the body but trained in the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.820
 First of all, you always take that 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.280
 whole area of ​​your body 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.720
 But just change the duo in the area 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.429
 stabilize more times 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.680
 is meaningful and the others more in the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.239
 mobilization and then you come 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.980
 again in another position where 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.519
 that can exactly reverse and find that 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.610
 i have the most effective in yoga especially 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.049
 Yoga for athletes can be very good 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.269
 anticipate these exercises 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.980
 because actually in the burden 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.080
 they usually have that a lot 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.660
 one-sided is that the body only ever 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.340
 the same areas must stabilize 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.350
 and a range now be movable 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.310
 But if you have changed times 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.269
 you also use another technique slides 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.570
 knows that when you new 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.510
 trainingsreiz sets you continue it 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.840
 is just that way the body reacts and 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.560
 consumes more energy and you can 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.960
 to bring more power 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.630
 also here from the recommendation the 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.610
 position stabilizing for the first time 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.160
 Practice with this body feeling this 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.720
 body tension also feels one 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.850
 Elongation will then adjust if 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.780
 your position easy and if you have it 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.490
 Dynamic makes repetition so often 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.950
 like the technology like that said what 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.470
 can be done clean and then 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.700
 as often as possible during the week 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.710
 safety the effects quickly 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.360
 can adjust so that was the last 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.570
 juba exercise for athletes 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.230
 we hope you enjoyed it yes you 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.600
 have seen 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.130
 I'm not exactly the professional in yoga 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.820
 but I have a pro here next to me 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.010
 and I do not try it anymore 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.760
 just that I become more mobile and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.340
 Everyone who does yoga will be through that 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.940
 same story and yoga is life 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.940
 In my opinion this is for us athletes 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.770
 a must try it out too 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.150
 if you only do bodybuilding or just 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.790
 Martial arts do you have to do that 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.940
 Try it out then I'll keep coming 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.940
 promise you that rainer said 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.110
