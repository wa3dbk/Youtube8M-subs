00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello everyone this is up to want again 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.309
 tell about your operating experience 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.900
 Forester rc motorcycle racer 200 lt 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.980
 drove it already two thousand two hundred 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.980
 fifty kilometers 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.910
 during this time I brought up no changes and 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:31.320
 improving the design of a fast motorcycle 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.280
 here is this wind visor 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.220
 pentagons on the plug 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:42.390
 special thanks to one person and to 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:47.670
 world to the current line put kofor 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.670
 and then slightly redid it and 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:56.880
 push design features 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.880
 who had to fix it to say 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.540
 rear wing 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.400
 wind visor and anthers at me 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.899
 there is a separate video which put there 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.729
 was going to raise the wing and stretched 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.660
 anthers a little bit away but somehow everything 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.660
 hands do not reach 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.039
 about the case too its installation 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.550
 shot a separate video I want to say 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.670
 the following standard coffer stood slightly 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.640
 closer on luggage rack but this 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.250
 it was not very comfortable because the seat 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.410
 still a bit short if 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.619
 carry passengers sometimes I'm taking a vase 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.300
 passenger and therefore ahead of strengthening 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.050
 pushed aside 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.690
 here a little bit further back with all 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.120
 this is no difficulty about it 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.950
 remove meaning was not redone and 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.190
 mount the lower shock absorber on the back 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:06.230
 pendulums perfectly withstand the load 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:08.810
 nothing comes off all right wing 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.750
 again in burst after a while 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.100
 had to make additional changes 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.830
 actually manually did not become anywhere 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.180
 handle any welder with this 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.830
 service set in parallel 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 standard wire like this 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.740
 metal bar along the length of all 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.230
 the wing and all the vibrations the trembling stopped 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.800
 and nothing else cracks not 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.800
 bursts 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.270
 general impression of a motorcycle 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.200
 positive 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.110
 despite the bias of others 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.370
 Chinese technology people I want to say 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.220
 that it is pretty reliable and no 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.970
 surprises during this time motorcycle me 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.700
 not presented in the city and on the highway 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.880
 I feel very good on it 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.660
 confident by the way despite the fact that his 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.660
 positioned like a motorcycle for easy 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.820
 so to say off-road in the city or I'm on 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.989
 I feel great in comparison 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:26.170
 I tried the other enduro ride 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.110
 this to me is somehow simpler rings 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.030
 it turns out very easy maneuver 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:36.690
 endures all the hardships of the roadway 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.900
 urban crack and fossa 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:46.630
 very comfortable off-road a couple of times 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:50.110
 went to ride on the forest dirt road 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.360
 Feels like a motorcycle 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.480
 field in the forest without any road 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.410
 coatings can go I do not really 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.569
 I liked how he behaves in his knee I 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.689
 not very comfortable here 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.260
 reported on the principle of a motorcycle from katy 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.920
 perry 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.189
 suspension short-stroke progress and on 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.489
 her and so he behaves a little bit 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:19.799
 harsh on entering sandu rama and there 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:24.240
 that kind of motorcycle for starters who 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.440
 it takes a motorcycle to understand what it is 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.960
 such form your opinion 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.009
 recommend this model can be principle 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.009
 you didn't like 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:39.680
 who murder just ask answer 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:43.220
 happy to like everyone for now 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.220
 it was igor
