doing a lot of interesting stuff so I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.710 
doing a lot of interesting stuff so I
this<00:02:30.190> right<00:02:30.430> here<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.730> basically<00:02:30.850> my<00:02:31.270> life<00:02:31.300> it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
this right here is basically my life it

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.480 
this right here is basically my life it
sums<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.230> all<00:02:32.350> up<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.800> my<00:02:32.890> first<00:02:32.980> impression

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
sums it all up the my first impression

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.190 
sums it all up the my first impression
is<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:33.910> pretty<00:02:34.300> awesome<00:02:34.510> actually<00:02:34.990> if

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
is it's pretty awesome actually if

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.600 
is it's pretty awesome actually if
you're<00:02:35.290> traveling<00:02:35.770> because<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.130> small<00:02:36.400> its

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
you're traveling because it's small its

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.710 
you're traveling because it's small its
compact<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.390> comes<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:37.600> this<00:02:37.660> little

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
compact and it comes with this little

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.150 
compact and it comes with this little
carrying<00:02:38.140> case<00:02:38.200> which<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.650> probably<00:02:38.860> will

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
carrying case which I probably will

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.960 
carrying case which I probably will
never<00:02:39.460> use<00:02:39.820> again<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.420> wish<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.560> came<00:02:42.190> with<00:02:42.760> a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
never use again I wish this came with a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.270 
never use again I wish this came with a
mini<00:02:43.360> USB<00:02:43.570> because<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.380> GoPro<00:02:44.740> charges<00:02:45.190> off

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
mini USB because the GoPro charges off

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.920 
mini USB because the GoPro charges off
of<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.520> mini<00:02:45.700> USB<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.420> lot<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.600> mikandi

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
of a mini USB and a lot of mikandi

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.930 
of a mini USB and a lot of mikandi
cameras<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.530> have<00:02:47.710> also<00:02:47.980> charged<00:02:48.520> from

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
cameras that I have also charged from

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.960 
cameras that I have also charged from
the<00:02:49.060> mini<00:02:49.210> student<00:02:49.780> probably<00:02:50.220> not<00:02:51.220> make<00:02:51.820> this

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
the mini student probably not make this

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.530 
the mini student probably not make this
anymore

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
anymore

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.070

cool I'm sure you can find it somewhere

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.430 
cool I'm sure you can find it somewhere
on<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.090> internet<00:03:01.390> but<00:03:01.870> they<00:03:01.990> do<00:03:02.050> have<00:03:02.230> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
on the internet but they do have the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.710 
on the internet but they do have the
Apple<00:03:02.709> Store<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.580> multi<00:03:03.880> XL<00:03:04.270> charger

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
Apple Store this is the multi XL charger

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.990 
Apple Store this is the multi XL charger
they<00:03:05.020> have<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.709> many<00:03:05.980> different<00:03:06.610> ones<00:03:06.730> of

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
they have so many different ones of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.310 
they have so many different ones of
these<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.390> come<00:03:07.480> in<00:03:07.600> different<00:03:07.720> sizes<00:03:08.020> so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
these that come in different sizes so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.530 
these that come in different sizes so
honestly<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.580> depends<00:03:09.910> how<00:03:10.120> much<00:03:10.240> money<00:03:10.450> you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
honestly it depends how much money you

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.120 
honestly it depends how much money you
want<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.720> spend<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.200> also<00:03:11.380> depends<00:03:11.920> how

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
want to spend and it also depends how

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.100 
want to spend and it also depends how
much<00:03:12.430> power<00:03:12.730> you're<00:03:13.180> gonna<00:03:13.300> need<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:13.660> me<00:03:14.080> I

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
much power you're gonna need for me I

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.900 
much power you're gonna need for me I
need<00:03:14.500> as<00:03:14.620> much<00:03:14.800> as<00:03:15.010> possible<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.640> when<00:03:15.820> they

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
need as much as possible so when they

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.060 
need as much as possible so when they
make<00:03:16.090> one<00:03:16.360> like<00:03:17.110> this<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.709> size<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.010> my

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070
