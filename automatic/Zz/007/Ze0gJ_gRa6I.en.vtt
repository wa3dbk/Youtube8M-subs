at La Music Academy in Pasadena
California<00:00:05.600> in<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.750> last<00:00:06.870> segment<00:00:07.170> we<00:00:07.470> talked

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
California in the last segment we talked

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.160 
California in the last segment we talked
about<00:00:07.980> reducing<00:00:08.790> bar<00:00:09.330> chords<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.809> their<00:00:09.960> most

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
about reducing bar chords to their most

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.080 
about reducing bar chords to their most
fundamental<00:00:10.380> information<00:00:10.920> basically<00:00:11.730> just

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
fundamental information basically just

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.620 
fundamental information basically just
the<00:00:12.269> Triad<00:00:12.540> notes<00:00:13.190> root<00:00:14.190> third<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.820> fifth<00:00:14.910> we

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the Triad notes root third and fifth we

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.330 
the Triad notes root third and fifth we
did<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> D<00:00:16.619> chord<00:00:17.690> and<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:19.680> B<00:00:19.980> minor<00:00:20.220> chord

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
did so on a D chord and a B minor chord

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.220 
did so on a D chord and a B minor chord
and<00:00:21.260> we<00:00:22.260> reduced<00:00:22.590> those<00:00:22.740> two<00:00:22.980> triads<00:00:23.990> in<00:00:24.990> this

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
and we reduced those two triads in this

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.450 
and we reduced those two triads in this
unit<00:00:25.590> I'm<00:00:25.769> going<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.430> add<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:27.029> minor<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
unit I'm going to add a minor and a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.620 
unit I'm going to add a minor and a
together<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> two<00:00:33.059> chords<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.420> talked

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
together with the two chords we talked

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.780 
together with the two chords we talked
about<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> first<00:00:34.320> unit<00:00:34.559> D<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.070> B<00:00:35.190> minor<00:00:35.460> E

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
about in the first unit D and B minor E

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.040 
about in the first unit D and B minor E
minor<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:37.879> added<00:00:38.879> those<00:00:39.300> two<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.690> chord

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
minor and a added those two that chord

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.420 
minor and a added those two that chord

position a chord this way a C sharp E or
if<00:01:32.009> we're<00:01:32.159> gonna<00:01:32.250> stay<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> first<00:01:32.880> three

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
if we're gonna stay on the first three

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.149 
if we're gonna stay on the first three
strings<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.479> we're<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
strings which we're going to do just a

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.100 
strings which we're going to do just a
first<00:01:35.909> inversion<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.630> triad<00:01:37.079> C<00:01:37.680> sharp

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.100 

now<00:01:41.740> in<00:01:42.490> order<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.790> practice<00:01:43.330> getting<00:01:43.660> triads

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
now in order to practice getting triads

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.140 
now in order to practice getting triads
together<00:01:44.440> for<00:01:44.980> rhythm<00:01:45.100> guitar<00:01:45.580> purposes

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
together for rhythm guitar purposes

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.820 
together for rhythm guitar purposes
probably<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> good<00:01:47.170> approach<00:01:47.440> would<00:01:47.680> be<00:01:47.710> to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
probably a good approach would be to

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.730 
probably a good approach would be to
start<00:01:48.280> with<00:01:48.430> just<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.730> first<00:01:48.820> two<00:01:49.270> D<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.350> B

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
start with just the first two D and B

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.280 
start with just the first two D and B
minor<00:01:51.150> you'll<00:01:52.150> remember<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.570> D<00:01:52.990> occurred

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
minor you'll remember that D occurred

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.540 
minor you'll remember that D occurred
here<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.120> here<00:01:55.120> and<00:01:55.660> here<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.310> first

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
here and here and here in the first

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.760 
here and here and here in the first
segment<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:58.030> we<00:01:58.090> did<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.540> now<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.500> B

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
segment that we did of this now the B

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:08.790 
segment that we did of this now the B
minor<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:01.600> going<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:01.990> be<00:02:02.590> here<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.350> now<00:02:08.500> let's

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
minor is going to be here so now let's

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.200 
minor is going to be here so now let's
try<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.040> put<00:02:09.280> those<00:02:09.429> two<00:02:09.700> chords<00:02:10.000> together

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
try to put those two chords together

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.540 
try to put those two chords together
just<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:11.080> what<00:02:11.380> we<00:02:11.500> call<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.860> first<00:02:12.130> group<00:02:12.400> of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
just on what we call the first group of

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.070 
just on what we call the first group of
three<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.000> first<00:02:13.240> three<00:02:13.420> strings<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.990> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
three the first three strings of the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.560 
three the first three strings of the
guitar<00:02:14.250> here's<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.340> second<00:02:15.760> inversion<00:02:15.970> D<00:02:16.240> chord

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
guitar here's a second inversion D chord
