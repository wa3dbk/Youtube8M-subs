00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
first of all I will start by saying off

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.569 
first of all I will start by saying off
that<00:00:32.450> this<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:32.870> just<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.380> theme<00:00:33.920> it<00:00:34.190> is<00:00:34.309> not

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
that this is just a theme it is not

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.750 
that this is just a theme it is not
actually<00:00:34.790> running<00:00:35.270> windows<00:00:36.219> as<00:00:37.219> far<00:00:37.520> as<00:00:37.640> i

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
actually running windows as far as i

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.360 
actually running windows as far as i
know<00:00:37.820> that's<00:00:38.149> impossible<00:00:38.540> so<00:00:39.200> if<00:00:39.890> you<00:00:39.980> just<00:00:40.160> go

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
know that's impossible so if you just go

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.540 
know that's impossible so if you just go
to<00:00:40.430> such<00:00:41.390> in<00:00:41.750> your<00:00:41.810> play<00:00:42.290> store<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:42.800> go

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
to such in your play store and go

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:57.280 
to such in your play store and go
windows<00:00:50.050> launcher<00:00:51.050> or<00:00:53.500> launch<00:00:56.290> actually

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
windows launcher or launch actually

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.560 
windows launcher or launch actually
launch<00:00:57.560> it<00:00:57.770> would<00:00:57.860> be<00:00:57.980> better<00:00:58.250> better<00:00:59.000> so

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
launch it would be better better so

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.880 
launch it would be better better so
launcher<00:01:00.290> and<00:01:01.570> then<00:01:02.570> you've<00:01:03.350> got<00:01:03.380> your<00:01:03.620> choice

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
out ok so you guys that's how to run

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.400 
out ok so you guys that's how to run
windows<00:03:10.760> on<00:03:11.360> your<00:03:12.910> android<00:03:13.910> device<00:03:14.019> very<00:03:15.019> very

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
windows on your android device very very

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.220 
windows on your android device very very
easy<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.160> you<00:03:16.910> can't<00:03:17.150> actually<00:03:17.390> run<00:03:17.780> windows

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
easy and you can't actually run windows

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.759 
easy and you can't actually run windows
and<00:03:18.560> that's<00:03:19.130> impossible<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:20.000> think<00:03:20.269> so<00:03:21.110> if<00:03:21.590> you

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
and that's impossible I think so if you

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.680
