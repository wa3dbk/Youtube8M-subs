if<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.310> pulled<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.580> along<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:03.000> side<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.390> here

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
if you pulled up along one side one here

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.840 
if you pulled up along one side one here
do<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.470> should<00:02:04.650> zoom<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> little

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
do you should zoom out a little

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.390 
do you should zoom out a little
middle<00:02:07.479> mouse<00:02:07.630> click<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.709> then

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
middle mouse click and then

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.590 
middle mouse click and then
so<00:02:10.400> you<00:02:10.490> kind<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.759> get<00:02:10.850> us<00:02:10.970> into<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.300> scale<00:02:11.570> of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
so you kind of get us into the scale of

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.480 
so you kind of get us into the scale of
like<00:02:11.900> his<00:02:12.110> ship

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.230 

the<00:02:14.880> more<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.120> fly<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.140> you

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
we learned rating with them and that on

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.870 
we learned rating with them and that on
that<00:02:29.790> unlocks<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.150> ability<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.660> fly<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.900> shift
