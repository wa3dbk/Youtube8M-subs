 great let's leave in the description to 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.890
 of course to seek to emphasize that flap 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.350

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.540

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.030
 in this in what is the google play and the 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.470
 author I'm not sure I do not know how to do it 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.390
 but I may investigate the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.710
 leave here below 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.710
 gay king 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.910
 and in this game you are a small 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.480
 appointment ship 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.480
 no way 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.979
 that we are focused 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.979
 from right to left 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.270
 and they have to grab the little lights 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.480
 and those little blue lights 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.350
 without hitting the meteorites yes yes already 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.350
 I know I am very bad 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.169
 let's try it one more time 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.360
 73 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.440
 it's a building 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.569
 but it serves 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:02.190
 to continue what to do and just want 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.529
 waste time are bored 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.199
 to this one 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:10.969
 now we go in the next game and the 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.969
 next game is more chic 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:20.900
 I like very father is 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.900
 very well done 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.100
 it's a jockey mistake 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.610
 not only in April 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.830
 we already have it, let's start and 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.040
 you are going to be able to throw balls 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.110
 for triangles 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.960
 to these and I have those who give three 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.940
 little balls and this is a game in third 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.940
 dimension is very beautiful 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.830
 and then suddenly obstacles 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:59.360
 and those obstacles have to break them 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.360
 with the balls that have 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:06.680
 and we break it 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.680
 you have to open the door and open it 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.370
 you exist that does not clash with you because 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.840
 if it collides they lose good they do not lose they are 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.949
 the balls fall and if they run out 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.949
 balls lose 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.900
 how can you see the shock 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:29.550
 that is the most hits and they go through different 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.410
 Well, in what different areas are parents 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.930
 ok the next one is called super hexagon 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.700
 you can not download it unfortunately 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.480
 free for what is the app store for 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.910
 the actor does cost but for what 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.210
 is android if I can give them I'm going to 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.780
 send a link to download 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.780
 completely free 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.909
 to the credits 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.770
 ep 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:07:01.389
 then it has different levels 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:04.120
 art barter and harvest although we were going with 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.190
 the easiest level 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.160
 then the promotion from left to 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:13.130
 right here it's worth 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.440
 this click on the sides and the joke is that 

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.930
 they have to leave if they are fixed there is a 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.210
 hexagon always to see if it's a 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.260
 triangle a square and they have to leave 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.330
 of him or they can not hit the lines 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.470
 if it is complicated and the skins that 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.080
 they showed this game I became addicted 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.600
 honestly I got to 70 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.120
 seconds without dying 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.680
 but as the game is repeated now it comes 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.680
 one more to the 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.680
 57 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.220
 and how can you see 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:52.689
 and the music is quite father is the 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:55.509
 music they play is exciting 

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:57.459
 is something is an extra that she is left 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.469
 game and is pretty father like 

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:03.339
 the exchange of lights that they put is 

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:06.249
 very father and in addition to subscribe 

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:07.729

00:08:06.249 --> 00:08:09.300

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.200
