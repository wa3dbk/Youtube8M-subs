00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.910 
stretched to a four it is burning a bit
but<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:14.119> doesn't<00:01:14.659> hurt<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:15.050> bad<00:01:15.080> as<00:01:15.680> when<00:01:15.890> I

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
but it doesn't hurt as bad as when I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.380 
but it doesn't hurt as bad as when I
went<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.310> six<00:01:18.520> not<00:01:19.520> merely<00:01:19.759> as<00:01:19.940> that<00:01:20.119> is<00:01:20.240> when

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
went to a six not merely as that is when

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.760 
went to a six not merely as that is when
I<00:01:20.420> went<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.750> sex<00:01:21.050> probably<00:01:21.350> because<00:01:21.680> I

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
I went to a sex probably because I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.020 
I went to a sex probably because I
waited<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.399> long<00:01:22.640> but<00:01:23.600> yeah<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.890> here's<00:01:25.880> what

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
waited so long but yeah so here's what

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.520 
waited so long but yeah so here's what
it<00:01:26.090> looks<00:01:26.240> like<00:01:26.360> I'm<00:01:26.600> debating<00:01:26.899> on<00:01:27.259> if<00:01:27.409> I

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
it looks like I'm debating on if I

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.749 
it looks like I'm debating on if I
should<00:01:27.680> just<00:01:27.800> go<00:01:27.950> ahead<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.220> put<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.399> tunnels

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
should just go ahead and put the tunnels

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.109 
should just go ahead and put the tunnels
in<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.410> just<00:01:30.950> wait<00:01:31.250> from<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:31.910> because

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
in so I just wait from this because

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.120 
in so I just wait from this because
these<00:01:32.390> are<00:01:32.570> getting<00:01:33.140> pretty<00:01:33.380> heavy<00:01:33.649> and<00:01:33.979> so

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
these are getting pretty heavy and so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.740 
these are getting pretty heavy and so
for<00:01:34.429> and<00:01:34.700> they're<00:01:34.789> weighing<00:01:34.970> my<00:01:35.179> ear<00:01:35.390> down<00:01:35.570> as

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
for and they're weighing my ear down as

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.200 
for and they're weighing my ear down as
you<00:01:35.899> can<00:01:36.050> see<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.340> think<00:01:37.580> I'm<00:01:37.820> just<00:01:37.940> going<00:01:38.090> to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210

attempt<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.630> go<00:01:38.750> ahead<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.050> put<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.289> tunnels

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
attempt to go ahead and put the tunnels

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.290 
attempt to go ahead and put the tunnels
in<00:01:39.890> our<00:01:40.160> eyelets<00:01:40.759> in<00:01:40.910> to<00:01:41.660> see<00:01:42.789> if<00:01:43.789> it'll<00:01:44.000> go<00:01:44.149> in

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
in our eyelets in to see if it'll go in

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.880 
in our eyelets in to see if it'll go in
smooth<00:01:44.660> or<00:01:44.960> if<00:01:45.229> I'm<00:01:45.410> going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.649> have<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.800> let
