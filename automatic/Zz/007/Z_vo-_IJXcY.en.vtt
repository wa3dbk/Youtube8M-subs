00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
even if it's Matt Flynn you could see

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:55.779

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
think that the organization has been

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.520 
think that the organization has been
very<00:00:59.149> up<00:00:59.269> front<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.629> Matt<00:00:59.899> Moore<00:01:00.109> is<00:01:00.199> not<00:01:00.409> the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
very up front that Matt Moore is not the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.439

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
fine with him being the backup but

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.160

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
Sparano was fired so I think that's

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.770
