00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.600
 we played league of legends for fun and 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.850
 It's usually more fun when 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.500
 we succeed on what depends on 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.390
 a lot of things need more than 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.490
 ability and good reflexes to 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.410
 to overcome their ability to work in 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.779
 team has a significant impact on 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.630
 result of the match 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.670
 team spirit wins on average 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.740
 million more matches than others 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.240
 players every day working on 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.340
 team has a much more 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.750
 important than you think link 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.700
 let's take a look at how it can 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.620
 affect your game, let's say you 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.720
 a match begins and one of his colleagues 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.880
 already died a few times before you 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.310
 realize he's giving a chill 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.530
 now choose yours you could play one 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.870
 child with him cursing and shouting 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.150
 he feels bad because of course it is 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.980
 which will improve the situation what some 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.720
 players do not understand is that break with 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.050
 your teammates and does not bring a 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.910
 Turn is anger does not win matches every 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.980
 negative player on your team and reduces 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.350
 your chances of winning river an average of 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.610
 54 percent chance with 10 billion 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.920
 to 46% with 3 and so on until the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.800
 Well then it makes more sense 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.600
 Focus on Victory Help Your Colleague Purchase 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.550
 some sentinels or focus on your 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.860
 route and calm the moods in the chat 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.020
 players who keep their team focused 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.120
 wins more matches than 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.980
 They face the fire with less sabotam. 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.630
 their own chances of winning the 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.790
 sports spirit and teamwork 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.409
 the impact of work on 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.690
 team can also be 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.370
 real time is just seeing the amount in another 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.170
 our initial findings suggest a 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.820
 relationship between the behavior of 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.010
 a team and the gold they get 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.690
 accumulate in a match in this case 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.890
 Things will put downhill after 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.840
 an ambush that went wrong 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.610
 the player decided to listen to him and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.500
 pev the reason meanwhile the team 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.060
 remains concentrated, which means that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.520
 means they can complete more 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.140
 more objective goals plus gold 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.180
 gold more items unnecessarily 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.180
 large more items unnecessarily 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.770
 great more gg the power of work in 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.630
 team can even be seen on the level 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.610
 individual players with a history of 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.739
 Positive behavior wins at 10 per 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.899
 one hundred more matches than others by another 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.409
 player side with a history of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.629
 and will on average win 35% - matches 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.249
 It is very clear teams where everyone 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.840
 help in stumbling has much more 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.610
 chances to win then 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.830
 the next time you want to win in 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.180
 league is just remembering the work in 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.180
 team is op
