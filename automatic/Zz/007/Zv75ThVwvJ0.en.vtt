00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
we'll just toss these in and like I said

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.410 
we'll just toss these in and like I said
you<00:00:54.470> can<00:00:54.620> adjust<00:00:55.100> your<00:00:55.400> peanut<00:00:55.909> butter<00:00:56.120> and

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
you can adjust your peanut butter and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.200 
you can adjust your peanut butter and
your<00:00:56.839> bananas<00:00:57.290> you<00:00:57.710> know<00:00:57.800> as<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.699> go<00:00:58.909> if<00:00:59.089> you

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
your bananas you know as you go if you

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.570 
your bananas you know as you go if you
decide<00:00:59.540> you've<00:00:59.750> got<00:00:59.900> too<00:01:00.110> much<00:01:00.339> peanut<00:01:01.339> butter

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
decide you've got too much peanut butter

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.700 
decide you've got too much peanut butter
you<00:01:01.699> can<00:01:01.850> add<00:01:01.940> another<00:01:02.030> banana<00:01:02.330> and<00:01:02.900> vice

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
you can add another banana and vice

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.010 
you can add another banana and vice
versa<00:01:04.190> so<00:01:04.699> I'll<00:01:05.059> just<00:01:05.210> throw<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:05.659> there

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
versa so I'll just throw that in there

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.710 
versa so I'll just throw that in there
and<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.790> don't<00:01:07.940> want<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.240> have<00:01:08.330> too<00:01:08.570> much

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
and you don't want to have too much

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.210 
and you don't want to have too much
peanut<00:01:08.990> butter<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.590> that's<00:01:09.860> all<00:01:10.040> you'd

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
peanut butter so that that's all you'd

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.149 
peanut butter so that that's all you'd
really<00:01:10.250> taste<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.360> it's<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.110> good<00:01:12.260> idea<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.680> use

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
really taste and it's a good idea to use

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.940 
really taste and it's a good idea to use
bananas<00:01:13.909> that<00:01:14.690> are<00:01:15.549> nice<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:16.790> ripe<00:01:17.710> so<00:01:18.710> just

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
bananas that are nice and ripe so just

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.630 
bananas that are nice and ripe so just
take<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.100> masher<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.850> start<00:01:20.479> mashing<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:22.430> just

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
take a masher and start mashing you just

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.370 
take a masher and start mashing you just
want<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.820> blend<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.270> up<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.690> like<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:24.080> said<00:01:24.260> we

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
want to blend this up and like I said we

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.420 
want to blend this up and like I said we
can<00:01:24.500> always<00:01:24.560> add<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:24.830> little<00:01:24.979> more<00:01:25.070> peanut

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
can always add a little more peanut

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.560 
can always add a little more peanut
butter<00:01:25.610> if<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.850> doesn't<00:01:26.090> seem<00:01:26.240> like<00:01:26.390> it's

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
butter if it doesn't seem like it's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.499 
butter if it doesn't seem like it's
quite<00:01:26.810> enough<00:01:27.820> ok<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:28.880> we've<00:01:29.149> got<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.420> all

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
quite enough ok so we've got it all

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.779 
quite enough ok so we've got it all
blended<00:01:29.960> up<00:01:30.049> nicely<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.770> think<00:01:30.799> that<00:01:31.340> was<00:01:31.490> just

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
blended up nicely I think that was just

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.749 
blended up nicely I think that was just
the<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:32.119> amount<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.950> peanut<00:01:33.950> butter<00:01:34.070> ratio

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
the right amount of peanut butter ratio

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.840 
the right amount of peanut butter ratio
to<00:01:35.000> banana<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.079> just<00:01:36.320> use<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.649> as<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:36.920> sort<00:01:37.820> of

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
to banana so just use that as a sort of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.179 
to banana so just use that as a sort of
a<00:01:37.969> guide<00:01:38.359> you<00:01:38.750> know<00:01:38.899> half<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.500> cup<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.859> 2<00:01:40.039> bananas

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
a guide you know half a cup to 2 bananas

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.910 
a guide you know half a cup to 2 bananas
you<00:01:41.090> know<00:01:41.119> of<00:01:41.450> course<00:01:41.630> bananas<00:01:42.200> vary<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:42.710> size

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
you know of course bananas vary in size

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.700 
you know of course bananas vary in size
so<00:01:43.280> it's<00:01:43.729> not<00:01:43.880> gonna<00:01:44.000> be<00:01:44.149> an<00:01:44.240> exact<00:01:44.570> science<00:01:44.840> ok

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
so it's not gonna be an exact science ok

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.440 
so it's not gonna be an exact science ok
so<00:01:45.770> now<00:01:46.070> take<00:01:46.549> your<00:01:46.700> graham<00:01:46.880> cracker<00:01:47.180> and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
so now take your graham cracker and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.270 
so now take your graham cracker and
they're<00:01:47.990> scored<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:48.590> just<00:01:48.770> break<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.159> in<00:01:49.219> half

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
they're scored so just break it in half

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.810 
they're scored so just break it in half
and<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.500> can<00:01:51.500> make<00:01:51.649> them<00:01:51.799> in<00:01:52.189> quarters<00:01:52.670> as

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
and you can make them in quarters as

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.029 
and you can make them in quarters as
well<00:01:52.850> I<00:01:53.329> used<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.899> do<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.200> when<00:01:54.469> they<00:01:54.590> were<00:01:54.619> my

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
well I used to do this when they were my

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.399 
well I used to do this when they were my
kids<00:01:55.100> were<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.579> little<00:01:56.170> because<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.229> didn't

advance so that you could see the end
result<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.820> here<00:03:26.390> they<00:03:26.510> are<00:03:26.660> they're<00:03:26.840> frozen

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
result and here they are they're frozen

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.380 
result and here they are they're frozen
they<00:03:27.770> don't<00:03:28.040> squish<00:03:28.580> anymore<00:03:29.030> they're<00:03:29.240> nice
