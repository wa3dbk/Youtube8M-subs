about what they do one of the reasons I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770 
about what they do one of the reasons I
really<00:00:50.250> wanted<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> work<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.210> series<00:00:51.600> is

I<00:00:51.870> think<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.410> important<00:00:53.220> to<00:00:53.580> get

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
I think it's really important to get

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
I think it's really important to get
kids<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.570> excited<00:00:54.989> about<00:00:55.080> science<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
kids really excited about science at a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.030 
kids really excited about science at a
young<00:00:56.010> age<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.210> amber<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.350> filming<00:00:58.950> an

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
young age so amber and I are filming an

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.870 
young age so amber and I are filming an
episode<00:00:59.130> about<00:00:59.820> Richie<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.899> series<00:01:04.259> is<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
episode about Richie the series is that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.830 
episode about Richie the series is that
so<00:01:05.880> no<00:01:06.000> actress<00:01:06.300> here<00:01:06.540> we're<00:01:06.690> actually

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so no actress here we're actually

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.540 
so no actress here we're actually
imagine<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.649> can<00:01:07.800> actually<00:01:07.890> work<00:01:08.250> together

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
imagine you can actually work together

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.639 
imagine you can actually work together
why<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.300> you<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:09.539> science<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.050> so<00:01:10.170> important

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
why do you think science is so important

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.889 
why do you think science is so important
to<00:01:10.800> what<00:01:11.039> we<00:01:11.160> do<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.340> imaginary<00:01:11.789> well<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> think

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
to what we do it imaginary well I think

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.570 
to what we do it imaginary well I think
science<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:13.890> great<00:01:14.070> tool<00:01:14.280> for

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
science is a really great tool for

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
science is a really great tool for
creating<00:01:14.759> creative<00:01:15.630> experience<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.259> common

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
creating creative experience in common

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.870 
creating creative experience in common
these<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:16.800> of<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.130> could<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.310> science

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
these kind of what we could use science

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
these kind of what we could use science
to<00:01:18.060> create<00:01:18.240> whether<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.960> attractions<00:01:19.619> or

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to create whether it's attractions or

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.609 
to create whether it's attractions or
shows<00:01:20.190> or<00:01:20.789> any<00:01:21.210> sort<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.660> technologies<00:01:22.320> people

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
shows or any sort of technologies people

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
shows or any sort of technologies people
tend<00:01:23.039> to<00:01:23.100> think<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.369> science<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:23.910> is<00:01:24.030> all

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
tend to think that science really is all

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
tend to think that science really is all
about<00:01:24.300> memorizing<00:01:24.960> formulas<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.680> tables<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
about memorizing formulas and tables and

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.230 
about memorizing formulas and tables and
charts<00:01:27.950> sort<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.010> formula<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> chart

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
charts sort of formula it's not a chart

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.500 
charts sort of formula it's not a chart
it's<00:01:30.710> science<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.830> action<00:01:32.510> everything

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
it's science and action everything

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.730 
it's science and action everything
Imagineering<00:01:34.080> starts<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> story

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
Imagineering starts with the story

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.780 
Imagineering starts with the story
ultimately<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.430> we're<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> business

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
ultimately because we're in the business

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.870 
ultimately because we're in the business
of<00:01:36.240> stories<00:01:37.080> people<00:01:37.710> come<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.189> us<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.340> crazy

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
of stories people come to us with crazy

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.340 
of stories people come to us with crazy
ideas<00:01:39.030> all<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.450> time<00:01:39.570> right<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.110> say<00:01:40.259> they

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
ideas all the time right they say they

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.660 
ideas all the time right they say they
want<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.530> make<00:01:40.650> our<00:01:40.830> guests<00:01:41.220> feel<00:01:41.310> like

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
want to make our guests feel like

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
they're you know flying over California

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.830 
they're you know flying over California
well<00:01:44.250> how<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.400> we<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
well how do we do that you know with a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.350 
well how do we do that you know with a
series<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.380> levers<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> pulleys<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:48.090> design

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
series of levers and pulleys we design

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.090 
series of levers and pulleys we design
this<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.780> cool<00:01:48.900> cable<00:01:49.290> system<00:01:49.650> but<00:01:50.009> as

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
this really cool cable system but as

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
this really cool cable system but as
people<00:01:50.520> who<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.570> meet<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
people who have that really meet to the
