layer background along with the two
layer<00:02:57.419> and<00:02:57.689> then<00:02:57.840> they<00:02:57.989> also<00:02:58.260> determine<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
layer and then they also determine the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.729 
layer and then they also determine the
size<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.909> it<00:03:00.030> since<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.359> had<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.689> so<00:03:00.870> big<00:03:01.139> across

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
size of it since I had it so big across

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.240 
size of it since I had it so big across
the<00:03:01.950> whole<00:03:02.069> chest<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.549> was<00:03:02.609> a<00:03:02.669> little<00:03:02.849> bit<00:03:03.030> more

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
the whole chest it was a little bit more

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.649 
the whole chest it was a little bit more
that's<00:03:05.250> why<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.459> see<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> lot<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:06.000> youtubers<00:03:06.450> do

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
that's why you see a lot of youtubers do

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.929 
that's why you see a lot of youtubers do
just<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.019> basic<00:03:07.439> really<00:03:07.980> small<00:03:08.310> stuff<00:03:08.639> really

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
just the basic really small stuff really

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.339 
just the basic really small stuff really
right<00:03:09.180> across<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.599> chest<00:03:09.629> because<00:03:10.049> they're

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
right across the chest because they're

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.039 
right across the chest because they're
doing<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.739> keep<00:03:10.889> the<00:03:11.280> cost<00:03:11.549> low<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.150> that

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
doing it to keep the cost low and that

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.300 
doing it to keep the cost low and that
way<00:03:13.169> they<00:03:13.319> can<00:03:13.469> charge<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.799> little<00:03:13.980> bit<00:03:14.099> more<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
way they can charge a little bit more to

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.670 
way they can charge a little bit more to
make<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.549> little<00:03:14.730> bit<00:03:14.819> more<00:03:14.939> profit<00:03:15.389> on<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
make a little bit more profit on that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.259 
make a little bit more profit on that
but<00:03:16.680> for<00:03:16.859> me<00:03:16.980> personally<00:03:17.010> you<00:03:17.909> know<00:03:17.939> I'd

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269
