00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.599 
let's look at gold and bubble since
these<00:00:16.289> are<00:00:16.350> two<00:00:16.680> words<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.010> people<00:00:17.250> often

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
these are two words that people often

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.029 
these are two words that people often
use<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> same<00:00:18.420> sentence<00:00:18.990> if<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.590> look<00:00:19.770> back

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
use in the same sentence if we look back

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.490 
use in the same sentence if we look back
at<00:00:20.250> gold<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.730> April<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.270> had<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.750> big

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
at gold in April what it had that big

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.620 
at gold in April what it had that big
correction<00:00:23.130> would<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.430> say<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.699> was<00:00:24.090> Gold's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
correction would you say that was Gold's

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.509 
correction would you say that was Gold's
bubble<00:00:25.050> bursting<00:00:25.619> or<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.039> simply<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
bubble bursting or was that simply a

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.419 
bubble bursting or was that simply a
necessary<00:00:27.090> correction<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> long

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
necessary correction so I have a long

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.220 
necessary correction so I have a long
history<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.150> gold<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.750> think<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.050> lot<00:00:31.080> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
history of gold and I think a lot of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
history of gold and I think a lot of
people<00:00:31.369> don't<00:00:32.369> understand<00:00:32.910> my<00:00:33.090> relationship

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
to my next question if I were to give

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.490 
to my next question if I were to give
you<00:03:23.640> ten<00:03:23.910> thousand<00:03:24.390> dollars<00:03:24.840> how<00:03:25.080> would<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.470> I

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
you ten thousand dollars how would you I

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.350 
you ten thousand dollars how would you I
spend<00:03:26.010> out<00:03:26.130> in<00:03:26.250> 2014<00:03:26.760> how<00:03:27.030> would<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.300> be

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
spend out in 2014 how would it be

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.449 
spend out in 2014 how would it be
divided<00:03:27.780> for<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.019> ideally<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:29.040> what<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.220> would

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
divided for you ideally so what I would

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.120 
divided for you ideally so what I would
do<00:03:29.610> today<00:03:29.850> would<00:03:30.390> be<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> combination<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.920> we're

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
do today would be a combination so we're

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.190 
do today would be a combination so we're
asset<00:03:32.519> allocators<00:03:32.970> meaning<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:33.690> like<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.050> own

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
seeing a lot of inflation threats out

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.590 
seeing a lot of inflation threats out
there<00:03:45.590> but<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:46.830> would<00:03:47.010> be<00:03:47.250> corporate<00:03:48.120> bonds

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
there but they would be corporate bonds

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.920 
there but they would be corporate bonds
mew<00:03:49.049> knees<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:50.060> um<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.150> little<00:03:51.600> bit<00:03:51.810> of

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
typical 60 40 or 70 30 portfolio we we

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.699 
typical 60 40 or 70 30 portfolio we we
want<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.450> be<00:04:03.540> underweight<00:04:03.989> bonds<00:04:04.410> because<00:04:04.530> we

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
want to be underweight bonds because we

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.310 
want to be underweight bonds because we
think<00:04:04.920> yields<00:04:05.489> eventually<00:04:06.420> go<00:04:06.720> higher<00:04:06.989> so

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
think yields eventually go higher so

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.699 
think yields eventually go higher so
that's<00:04:08.280> number<00:04:08.519> one<00:04:08.970> number<00:04:09.360> two<00:04:09.540> we<00:04:10.530> would

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
that's number one number two we would

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.820 
that's number one number two we would
own<00:04:10.950> some<00:04:11.700> percentage<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.480> US<00:04:12.660> equities<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.650> I

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
own some percentage of US equities and I

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.190 
own some percentage of US equities and I
would<00:04:14.010> guess<00:04:14.280> somewhere<00:04:15.239> between<00:04:15.450> thirty<00:04:16.080> and

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
would guess somewhere between thirty and

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.289 
would guess somewhere between thirty and
forty<00:04:16.350> percent<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.220> portfolio<00:04:17.519> would

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
forty percent of the portfolio would

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.229 
forty percent of the portfolio would
would<00:04:18.709> typically<00:04:19.709> be<00:04:19.859> uh<00:04:20.400> look<00:04:20.790> like<00:04:21.000> that

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
would typically be uh look like that

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.620 
would typically be uh look like that

came down in this area I did an

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.420 
came down in this area I did an

interview on yahoo finance and said uh

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.490 
interview on yahoo finance and said uh
you<00:04:31.790> know<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:31.940> think<00:04:32.090> gold<00:04:32.480> has<00:04:32.660> become<00:04:32.960> deeply

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
you know I think gold has become deeply

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.520 
you know I think gold has become deeply
oversold<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.730> due<00:04:35.000> for<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.300> bounce<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:35.990> I

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
oversold and is due for a bounce and I

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.200 
oversold and is due for a bounce and I
wouldn't<00:04:36.890> surprise<00:04:37.190> me<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.430> see<00:04:37.520> gold<00:04:37.910> over

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
wouldn't surprise me to see gold over

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.860 
wouldn't surprise me to see gold over
1,400<00:04:39.020> 1,500<00:04:39.700> before<00:04:40.700> it<00:04:40.760> rolls<00:04:40.970> over<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.480> the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
1,400 1,500 before it rolls over and the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.110 
1,400 1,500 before it rolls over and the
risk<00:04:42.170> at<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:42.620> point<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.250> roll<00:04:43.460> over<00:04:43.730> is

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
risk at that point of the roll over is

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.200 
risk at that point of the roll over is
that<00:04:44.480> we<00:04:44.840> can<00:04:45.050> get<00:04:45.200> down<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.500> 800<00:04:46.060> eventually<00:04:47.060> I

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
that we can get down to 800 eventually I

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.940 
that we can get down to 800 eventually I
don't<00:04:47.810> think<00:04:48.020> we're<00:04:48.170> getting<00:04:48.290> down<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.620> 800

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950

printing but gold has not used that as a
catalyst<00:05:45.020> so<00:05:45.290> I<00:05:45.700> can't<00:05:46.700> figure<00:05:47.270> out<00:05:47.680> what<00:05:48.680> the

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
catalyst so I can't figure out what the

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.520 
catalyst so I can't figure out what the
next<00:05:48.980> catalyst<00:05:49.910> is<00:05:50.120> for<00:05:50.360> gold<00:05:50.600> all<00:05:51.380> right

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530
