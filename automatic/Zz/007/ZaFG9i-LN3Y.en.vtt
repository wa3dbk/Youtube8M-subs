00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:18.450
 good hello everyone i'm santi jacomet i'm 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.840
 the boss studies furnaces 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.610
 Bachelor of Medicine 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.070
 and we are going to start a series of programs 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.930
 that they intend to do in a way 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:33.800
 informative what would be all the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.450
 more medical and complex aspects within 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.030
 of what would be the practice of 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.290
 physical activity and especially in the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.790
 field of theaters I hope that 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.070
 be of your pleasure and well yes yes 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.590
 we can connect will be one thing 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.720
 wonderful the first aspect we're going 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.380
 to touch is 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.990
 a concept that is deeply rooted in 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.480
 Europe and is now reaching 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.370
 our country that is the exercise as 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.630
 medicine 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.600
 We all know that exercise contributes 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.350
 great benefits to practice weights 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.250
 doing cardiovascular makes us stay 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.320
 better you had thought that sometimes 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.520
 exercising is like taking a 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.759
 medicine in this sense we could do 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.940
 a complete parallel between taking a 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.940
 drug 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.450
 and perform a type of exercise 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.270
 the parallelism that can be done is 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.869
 complete is to say you can think 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.960
 what kind of drug are you going to consume that 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.770
 you prescribe to the doctor and here we would pose 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.770
 as an antibiotic 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.960
 an antihistamine an anti-inflammatory 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.210
 what you consider however 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.909
 when we exercise 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 we are also giving a pattern 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.030
 guideline and here we could talk for 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.190
 example of cardiovascular work 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.190
 or also toning exercise 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.160
 this parallelism also reaches even the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.370
 chemical product that is inside the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.780
 drug if they give you an antibiotic 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.620
 we could talk about what they are giving us 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 penicillin 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.630
 and from the point of view of the exercise 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.630
 the indication would be to do indoor cycle 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.100
 or any of the other activities 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.020
 cardiovascular that you know 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.780
 elliptical treadmill what 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:58.000
 consider opportune 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:00.760
 like all drugs the doctor tells us 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.140
 prescribes in a concrete way we what 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.140
 gives a certain dose 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.799
 and what in medicine is a dose for 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.799
 we trainers is an intensity 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.070
 let's do 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.370
 Cardiovascular exercise on tape 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.260
 elliptical in elliptical machine between 70 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.569
 and 80 percent of our capacity 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.329
 maximum 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.249
 every drug also has about 600 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.030
 secondary 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:42.299
 we have diarrhea, headaches, 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.450
 stomach therefore these effects 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.450
 secondary 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.780
 we can also find them in the 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.130
 practice of physical activity and who 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.130
 has not suffered from lace-ups 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.220
 or just fatigue 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.180
 all these parallels conclude with 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.190
 the fact that there are certain 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.010
 drugs that we can not give to some 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.990
 people and therefore they are 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.120
 contraindicated 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.600
 in the same way that also some 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.860
 exercises are contraindicated in the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.860
 people with whom we work 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.170
 when we make this parallelism 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.270
 we are referring to exactly what 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:39.120
 that's a dose of drug 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.830
 my training is a pill 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.640
 exercise 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.180
 for example a person with bronchitis 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.820
 asthmatic 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.190
 it is cured simply by exercising 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.960
 in a very high percentage of the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.710
 population 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.900
 another very clear example are people 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.410
 who have diabetes or people who 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.720
 have a diabetic hypertension that 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.230
 do exercise 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.870
 can eliminate one of the doses of 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:18.510
 insulin or the sugar pill that 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:22.600
 say those who take them and in this way 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.510
 they skip doses, which improves their 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.270
 quality of life a hypertensive also 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.540
 can reduce the doses it takes from 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.970
 antihypertensive 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:36.120
 I want to emphasize that this is an approach 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.000
 very important we do not work 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.330
 only with exercise and with the benefits 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.810
 of exercise but we cure the 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.810
 people
