00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
alright we're looking at the p55 GD 85

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.700 
alright we're looking at the p55 GD 85
from<00:00:14.910> MSI<00:00:15.330> very<00:00:15.929> nice<00:00:16.170> p55<00:00:16.650> chipset

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
from MSI very nice p55 chipset

from MSI very nice p55 chipset
motherboard<00:00:17.100> as<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> matter<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.029> fact<00:00:18.170> it's<00:00:19.170> not

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
motherboard as a matter of fact it's not

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.130 
motherboard as a matter of fact it's not
really<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.850> flagship<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.029> MSI's<00:00:21.480> p55<00:00:22.080> chipset

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
really the flagship of MSI's p55 chipset

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.580 
really the flagship of MSI's p55 chipset
family<00:00:22.740> motherboards<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.840> it's<00:00:24.840> sort<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.320> is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
family motherboards but it's sort of is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
family motherboards but it's sort of is
because<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.980> only<00:00:26.070> that's<00:00:26.310> above<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.330> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
because the only that's above it is this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.240 
because the only that's above it is this
guy<00:00:27.840> which<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> Big<00:00:28.380> Bang<00:00:28.529> fusion<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
guy which is the Big Bang fusion and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.429 
guy which is the Big Bang fusion and
this<00:00:29.340> thing<00:00:29.460> costs<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.939> lot<00:00:30.630> more<00:00:30.929> money<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
this thing costs a lot more money and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.110 
this thing costs a lot more money and
has<00:00:31.590> features<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.460> lot<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> people

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
has features that a lot of people

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
has features that a lot of people
wouldn't<00:00:33.870> really<00:00:34.050> want<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.320> pay<00:00:34.440> extra<00:00:34.620> for

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
wouldn't really want to pay extra for

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.830 
wouldn't really want to pay extra for
its<00:00:35.280> cool<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.180> has<00:00:36.360> some<00:00:36.510> features<00:00:36.660> that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
its cool but this has some features that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.049 
its cool but this has some features that
even<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.500> motherboard<00:00:37.860> does<00:00:38.280> not<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
even this motherboard does not have and

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.369 
even this motherboard does not have and
they're<00:00:39.510> probably<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.899> more<00:00:40.050> important

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
they're probably little more important

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.799 
they're probably little more important
than<00:00:40.440> having<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.640> Lucid<00:00:42.090> hydra<00:00:42.390> chip<00:00:42.600> because

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
than having the Lucid hydra chip because

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.010 
than having the Lucid hydra chip because
this<00:00:42.989> comes<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.230> USB<00:00:43.530> 3.0<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.129> SATA<00:00:44.520> 6<00:00:45.149> or

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this comes with USB 3.0 and SATA 6 or

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.139 
this comes with USB 3.0 and SATA 6 or
SATA<00:00:46.230> 3<00:00:46.590> side<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> 6<00:00:47.250> gigabit<00:00:47.579> per<00:00:47.700> second<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
SATA 3 side of 6 gigabit per second so

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
SATA 3 side of 6 gigabit per second so
there's<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.450> pretty<00:00:48.600> new<00:00:49.230> options<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.770> are

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
there's some pretty new options that are

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.319 
there's some pretty new options that are
very<00:00:50.010> future<00:00:50.370> proof<00:00:50.640> if<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> be

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
very future proof if you're going to be

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.580 
very future proof if you're going to be
using<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.780> motherboard<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> next<00:00:52.469> two

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
using this motherboard for the next two

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.959 
using this motherboard for the next two
to<00:00:52.710> three<00:00:52.739> years<00:00:52.949> those<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.699> something<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
to three years those are something that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
to three years those are something that
you<00:00:54.120> definitely<00:00:54.360> want<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:54.989> inside<00:00:55.379> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you definitely want to get inside of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.889 
you definitely want to get inside of
your<00:00:55.559> motherboard<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.160> let's<00:00:56.879> take<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
your motherboard so let's take you for a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.020 
your motherboard so let's take you for a
little<00:00:58.020> tour<00:00:58.559> we're<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.730> start<00:00:59.910> off

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
little tour we're going to start off

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.080 
little tour we're going to start off
with<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.570> chip<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.140> always<00:01:01.620> socket<00:01:02.309> 1156<00:01:02.760> it's

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
with the chip as always socket 1156 it's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.880 
with the chip as always socket 1156 it's
going<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.270> take<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.449> core<00:01:03.629> i3<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.019> i5<00:01:04.170> s<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
going to take your core i3 or i5 s and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.300 
going to take your core i3 or i5 s and
your<00:01:05.159> i7s<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.390> use<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.840> socket<00:01:07.350> eight<00:01:07.979> plus

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
your i7s that use that socket eight plus

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
your i7s that use that socket eight plus
two<00:01:08.580> phase<00:01:08.820> pulse<00:01:09.240> width<00:01:09.360> modulation<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
two phase pulse width modulation so you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200 
two phase pulse width modulation so you
have<00:01:10.290> eight<00:01:10.470> phases<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> cpu<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:12.000> for

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
have eight phases for the cpu two for

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
have eight phases for the cpu two for
the<00:01:12.270> memory<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.689> good<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.020> overclocking

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
to give you a pretty good overclock I've

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.780 
to give you a pretty good overclock I've
seen<00:02:38.810> up<00:02:39.049> to<00:02:39.200> 3.6<00:02:39.890> Giga<00:02:40.159> heard<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.459> our<00:02:40.579> clocks

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.679 
with just a push of the button in less
than<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.590> second<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.129> a<00:02:43.310> pretty<00:02:44.120> nice<00:02:44.329> as<00:02:44.480> far<00:02:44.599> as

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
than a second so a pretty nice as far as

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.360 
than a second so a pretty nice as far as
