00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
gallon just to let you know this is one

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.499 
gallon just to let you know this is one
of<00:01:05.899> our<00:01:06.049> race<00:01:06.259> vehicles<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.820> engine<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:08.210> stock

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
of our race vehicles the engine is stock

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.510 
of our race vehicles the engine is stock
but<00:01:08.930> we<00:01:09.020> put<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> tornado<00:01:09.649> device<00:01:10.009> on<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.430> we

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
but we put a tornado device on it we

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.969 
but we put a tornado device on it we
took<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:10.969> track<00:01:11.299> we<00:01:11.869> tested<00:01:12.320> mileage

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
took it to the track we tested mileage

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.740 
took it to the track we tested mileage
both<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.399> and<00:01:13.430> from<00:01:13.579> the<00:01:13.820> track<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.360> at<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
both to and from the track and at the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.440 
both to and from the track and at the
track<00:01:14.990> we<00:01:15.200> found<00:01:15.439> gains<00:01:15.710> in<00:01:15.950> both<00:01:16.100> places<00:01:16.450> you

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
track we found gains in both places you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.879 
track we found gains in both places you
know<00:01:17.539> our<00:01:17.689> understanding<00:01:18.259> how<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.499> tornado

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:18.889 
know our understanding how the tornado

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:20.709 
know our understanding how the tornado
works<00:01:19.159> is<00:01:19.369> by<00:01:19.520> an<00:01:19.729> improvement<00:01:20.119> of<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.569> air

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
works is by an improvement of the air

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.559 
works is by an improvement of the air
flow<00:01:21.079> of<00:01:21.319> swirling<00:01:21.889> a<00:01:21.979> beard<00:01:22.249> and<00:01:22.569> creating

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
flow of swirling a beard and creating

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.719 
flow of swirling a beard and creating
then<00:01:23.719> of<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.990> better<00:01:24.409> combustion<00:01:25.009> mix<00:01:25.399> as<00:01:25.579> it

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
then of a better combustion mix as it

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.539 
then of a better combustion mix as it
moves<00:01:25.969> into<00:01:26.359> the<00:01:26.479> engine<00:01:26.810> well<00:01:27.529> anyway<00:01:28.219> we<00:01:28.429> can

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
moves into the engine well anyway we can

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.690 
moves into the engine well anyway we can
induce<00:01:28.909> that<00:01:29.389> if<00:01:30.289> you<00:01:30.499> will<00:01:30.679> tornado<00:01:31.189> effect

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
induce that if you will tornado effect

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.749 
induce that if you will tornado effect
or<00:01:31.880> vortex<00:01:32.240> effect<00:01:32.929> we<00:01:33.679> can<00:01:33.829> mix<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.249> and<00:01:34.700> we

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
or vortex effect we can mix that and we

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.160 
or vortex effect we can mix that and we
get<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:34.939> better<00:01:35.119> burn<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.659> that's<00:01:35.810> really<00:01:36.049> the

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
get a better burn and that's really the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.289 
get a better burn and that's really the
reason<00:01:36.409> why<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:37.069> product<00:01:37.579> like<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.939> tornado

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
reason why a product like the tornado

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.339 
reason why a product like the tornado
will<00:01:38.539> work<00:01:38.779> it<00:01:39.529> literally<00:01:41.079> increases<00:01:42.079> the

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
will work it literally increases the

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.699 
will work it literally increases the
velocity<00:01:42.859> of<00:01:43.639> the<00:01:43.939> air<00:01:43.969> and<00:01:44.119> fuel<00:01:44.869> going<00:01:45.319> into

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
velocity of the air and fuel going into

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.699 
velocity of the air and fuel going into
the<00:01:45.829> engine<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:46.779> more<00:01:47.779> air<00:01:47.929> cooler<00:01:48.439> air

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
the engine and more air cooler air

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.190 
the engine and more air cooler air
better<00:01:49.279> charge<00:01:49.579> more<00:01:49.939> oxygen<00:01:50.479> going<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.109> get

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
better charge more oxygen going to get

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.539 
better charge more oxygen going to get
more<00:01:51.349> explosion<00:01:51.950> which<00:01:52.130> is<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.399> whole<00:01:52.490> thing

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
more explosion which is the whole thing

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.519 
more explosion which is the whole thing
we're<00:01:52.880> looking<00:01:53.119> for<00:01:53.359> more<00:01:53.630> power<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:54.079> like<00:01:54.380> that

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:54.529 
we're looking for more power I like that

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:56.889 
we're looking for more power I like that
it's<00:01:54.679> made<00:01:54.889> in<00:01:55.009> America<00:01:55.509> we<00:01:56.509> need<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:56.749> keep

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
it's made in America we need to keep

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.690 
it's made in America we need to keep
more<00:01:57.109> manufacturing<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.039> country<00:01:58.099> I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
more manufacturing in this country I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.099 
more manufacturing in this country I
think<00:01:59.179> one<00:01:59.299> of<00:01:59.329> the<00:01:59.479> exciting<00:01:59.749> things<00:02:00.049> about

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
think one of the exciting things about

was<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.210> tornado<00:03:35.570> actually<00:03:36.080> not<00:03:36.290> only

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
was that the tornado actually not only

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320 
was that the tornado actually not only
increased<00:03:36.950> fuel<00:03:37.250> economy<00:03:37.820> but<00:03:37.970> we<00:03:38.150> actually

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
increased fuel economy but we actually

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.090 
increased fuel economy but we actually
found<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.230> we<00:03:39.320> weren't<00:03:39.500> looking<00:03:39.620> for<00:03:39.950> this

found and we weren't looking for this

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.470 
found and we weren't looking for this
some<00:03:41.770> drivability<00:03:42.770> improvements<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:44.150> after

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
some drivability improvements but after

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.810 
some drivability improvements but after
testing<00:03:44.960> the<00:03:44.990> tornado<00:03:45.680> on<00:03:45.950> my<00:03:46.100> own<00:03:46.250> vehicle<00:03:46.730> as

several<00:05:25.670> years<00:05:25.880> ago<00:05:26.120> we<00:05:26.270> were<00:05:26.360> approached<00:05:26.720> by

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
several years ago we were approached by

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.320 
several years ago we were approached by
a<00:05:27.050> local<00:05:27.320> TV<00:05:27.620> station<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.490> test<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.910> product

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
a local TV station to test the product

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.410 
a local TV station to test the product
and<00:05:29.710> we<00:05:30.710> began<00:05:31.130> testing<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.730> product<00:05:32.030> on<00:05:32.300> our

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
and we began testing the product on our

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.620 
and we began testing the product on our
own<00:05:32.540> personal<00:05:32.750> vehicles<00:05:33.470> and<00:05:33.740> found<00:05:34.010> a

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
own personal vehicles and found a

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.720 
own personal vehicles and found a
substantial<00:05:35.630> increase<00:05:35.930> in<00:05:36.400> what<00:05:37.400> we<00:05:37.520> thought

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
substantial increase in what we thought

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.480 
substantial increase in what we thought
was<00:05:37.970> horsepower<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:39.320> we<00:05:39.500> right<00:05:39.800> away<00:05:39.980> decided

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
was horsepower so we right away decided

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.330 
was horsepower so we right away decided
to<00:05:40.610> take<00:05:40.760> to<00:05:41.000> the<00:05:41.120> dyno<00:05:41.420> and<00:05:41.950> after<00:05:42.950> putting<00:05:43.160> it

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
to take to the dyno and after putting it

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.280 
to take to the dyno and after putting it
on<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.490> dyno<00:05:43.850> we<00:05:44.510> noticed<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:44.960> there<00:05:45.080> was

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
on the dyno we noticed that there was

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.170 
on the dyno we noticed that there was
about<00:05:45.500> a<00:05:45.560> ten<00:05:45.830> to<00:05:45.980> fifteen<00:05:46.340> percent<00:05:46.730> increase

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
about a ten to fifteen percent increase

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.040

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
in in fuel economy that we wanted to see

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.050 
in in fuel economy that we wanted to see
what<00:05:51.590> kind<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:52.040> changes<00:05:52.640> there'd<00:05:52.880> actually

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
there was actually an increase in

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.480 
there was actually an increase in
