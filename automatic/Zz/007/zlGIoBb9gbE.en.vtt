00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.270
 I can 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.080
 Amen 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.170
 German one more year growing this year to 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.360
 mix has achieved a series of objectives 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.460
 very important, tell us a little bit about 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.619
 them our main objective is to 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.869
 this year was to consolidate growth 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.149
 of the company to make us a hole in 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.159
 the market that I think more or less 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.899
 we are getting and almost almost what 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.420
 we have gotten but well we continue 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.430
 struggling and working to consolidate 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.380
 even more the brand more and more in the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.330
 market not especially in Spain and the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.939
 rest of europe also very important 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.159
 here we go the night world by signing 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.080
 which we are very happy with the 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.420
 third place he has done in olympia 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.280
 for us it has also been a help 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.259
 very important I think it was a bet 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.090
 important a risky bet for 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.610
 part of amics but I think that has 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.369
 it went very well and I think the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.659
 amateurs and people in general 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.280
 lovers of this sport I think that they 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.280
 they like us too 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.400
 talking a little bit about the new line 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.840
 muscle core well then in the flour mus 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.090
 What copper we wanted to look for 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.220
 has been and a step higher still 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.470
 in what would be the classic amics line 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.690
 a professional line that has not been 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.320
 spared neither in raw material nor in 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.480
 investigation and we said look for the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.160
 perfection we have used matters 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.680
 bonuses that until now were totally 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.270
 unknown in europe and I think this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.700
 is going to be going to be an injection at 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.560
 very important market because people 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.940
 that really looks for something different something 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.460
 of quality and something that gives you 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.500
 extraordinary results will you trust 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.050
 in this line they have sent some 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.720
 doubts about what the difference 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.480
 example among the cpm our traditional 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.280
 that has many followers and that is sold 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.340
 which would be much with the new one 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.140
 we just launched now in first place 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.050
 the new protein would be sweetened with 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.970
 stevia and not with sucralose which 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.480
 know all have been natural ante place 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.690
 better known then is also the acpm the 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.820
 nitro to say is the new crpm that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.740
 we said change just take the 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.050
 market is a separate protein that 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.120
 contains here we are worth that power 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.890
 much more whatever the absorption of 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.010
 the nutrients for example here you have 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.630
 all the logos like the amino people 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.100
 lactobacilli that are going to be the ones that 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.200
 they will help maintain a flora 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.970
 perfect intestinal with which 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.010
 we will increase a lot the absorption of 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.980
 nutrients and all this will bring us 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.230
 a leaving an improvement in quality more 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.170
 what important, do not say, is a 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.600
 protein better than the previous cpm but 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.610
 it is simply more modern it is last 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.920
 generation is much more modern is what 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.910
 last of the last and as to me always 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.950
 we pretend to be to the last 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.720
 obviously we have to be the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.720
 first to launch or the first 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.090
 you 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.930
 We are with Mario ' HervÃ¡s competitor 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.610
 the new category of physical mails 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.480
 talking about a little bit of this new 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.930
 category 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.729
 with the opposite as plastic is a 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.729
 new category is having many 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.380
 participants and it's more like a body of 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.290
 beach a more aesthetic body 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.870
 more finite more defined are you 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.330
 consolidated by amics which of the 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.240
 products is your favorite and you use to 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.770
 the trainings and so on amino acid 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.170
 synchronized is what usually 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.700
 use because it goes directly to the 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.700
 blood and nitric oxide 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.920
 in the same 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.020
 no no
