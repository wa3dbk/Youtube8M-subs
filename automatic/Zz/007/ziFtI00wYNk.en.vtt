00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
goggles are recommended for this laser

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.160 
goggles are recommended for this laser
so<00:00:15.990> by<00:00:16.529> those<00:00:16.770> because<00:00:17.400> they<00:00:17.690> pipe<00:00:18.690> hour<00:00:18.900> later

on today I'll be telling you the pros

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.960 
on today I'll be telling you the pros
and<00:00:22.050> cons<00:00:22.439> about<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.890> laser<00:00:23.130> first<00:00:23.820> we'll

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and cons about this laser first we'll

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.870 
and cons about this laser first we'll
start<00:00:24.060> off<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.449> cons<00:00:24.660> um<00:00:25.609> okay<00:00:26.609> we'll

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
start off with the cons um okay we'll

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.029 
start off with the cons um okay we'll
start<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.269> Cosmo<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.500> cons<00:00:28.740> are

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
start for the Cosmo one of the cons are

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.990 
start for the Cosmo one of the cons are
that<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.640> ships<00:00:30.029> from<00:00:30.269> Kentucky<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.850> it<00:00:32.850> takes

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
that it ships from Kentucky and it takes

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.270 
that it ships from Kentucky and it takes
a<00:00:33.360> while<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:34.020> get<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.230> your<00:00:34.910> house<00:00:37.010> mine<00:00:38.010> took

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
a while to get to your house mine took

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.160 
a while to get to your house mine took
two<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> half<00:00:38.940> weeks<00:00:40.100> so<00:00:41.100> yeah<00:00:41.570> another<00:00:42.570> con

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
two and a half weeks so yeah another con

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.360 
two and a half weeks so yeah another con
is<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:44.329> it's<00:00:45.329> hard<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.800> like

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
is that it's hard to see the like

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.389 
is that it's hard to see the like
reflected<00:00:48.059> beam<00:00:48.270> which<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.190> worst

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
reflected beam which it's not the worst

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.200 
reflected beam which it's not the worst
but<00:00:51.860> another<00:00:52.860> con<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.059> think

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
but another con is like you would think

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.959 
but another con is like you would think
this<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.539> pop<00:00:54.809> booms<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.829> well<00:00:56.820> when

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
this would pop booms like that well when

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.439 
this would pop booms like that well when
I<00:00:57.059> got<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.539> takes<00:00:57.809> maybe<00:00:58.309> 34<00:00:59.309> seconds<00:00:59.820> it's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
I got it it takes maybe 34 seconds it's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.850 
I got it it takes maybe 34 seconds it's
pop<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:02.059> it's<00:01:03.059> all<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.619> wish<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
pop one it's all right but just wish it

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.210 
pop one it's all right but just wish it
took<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> little<00:01:05.369> faster<00:01:06.470> um<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:09.619> yeah<00:01:10.619> that's

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
took a little faster um and yeah that's

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.149 
took a little faster um and yeah that's
pretty<00:01:11.400> much<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.030> cons<00:01:12.299> um<00:01:12.869> no<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.979> one

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
pretty much all the cons um no the one

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.100 
pretty much all the cons um no the one
more<00:01:14.340> con<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.360> balloons<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.020> be

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
more con is that the balloons have to be

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.149 
more con is that the balloons have to be
dark<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.890> won't<00:01:17.220> pop<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.900> theyíve<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
dark they won't pop like that theyíve to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.429 
dark they won't pop like that theyíve to
have<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.520> color<00:01:20.880> sharpie<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:22.640> or<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.439> or
