00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.379
 Hello my name is Zuykov Yuri 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.139
 today I decided to write one more video and 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:14.880
 just a video guitar lesson 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 analysis of the song nerves gun that I decided 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.949
 write down this particular song because 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.390
 that and and chords you can hardly find in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.990
 Internet or its interpretation of how to play 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.779
 also unlikely to find from what I have 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:38.300
 it turned out to pick up by ear that's what 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.300
 It came out generally starts with 5 strings and 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.960
 3 1 finger clamp and all the rest 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:54.410
 empty strings 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:57.310
 In general, it goes 5 3 2 1 2 3 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.310
 that's how it sounds 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.340
 then on the 5th string we go further on the seventh 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.340
 fret clamp also the first finger 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.440
 We also play the fifth mode 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.430
 and hold the first string on the fifth fret 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.430
 second finger yet 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.690
 it 's a three-body construction 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.750
 but 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.240
 but 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920
 but 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.729
 here from what I still do extra 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.259
 how would i play i add fleet vest 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.009
 on the second chord when we clamp 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.690
 the fifth string of the seventh scale first finger 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.720
 play 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.700
 I add a finger here on the 12th fret 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.270
 as close as possible to the string 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.890
 bottom and pull the first string 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.890
 it turns out that sound 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.700
 but at first it is not at all necessary 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.700
 teach 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.950
 that's how it sounds in the office 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.800
 but 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.030
 h 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:08.930
 well for the heart 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.190
 you mom 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.810
 with 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.810
 you will know 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:35.150
 you are better than me even at a distance 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:37.329
 stay samara without road 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.329
 one 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:46.630
 in general, then there is a loss the same 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.780
 I play the same toy pro entry 2 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:55.540
 verse and after the second verse there is still 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:59.400
 one move there I will play with that move 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.400
 I have explained it is played Click is 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.980
 generally 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:13.120
 everything is played very simply the first chord 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:17.620
 which we taught is the fifth string 3 fret 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:21.300
 first finger pulling four strings fifth 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.300
 third second first 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.990
 then the fifth fret also 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.990
 then 7 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340
 is coming 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.060
 say you 'll be waiting 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.880
 and 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.600
 igrok 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.920
 here it is cold 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:07.160
 do not be silent 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:07.160
 say you will wait until 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.280

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.840
 7 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.179
 further goes on the third fret first 

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:40.669
 chord which was taught 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:40.669
 say you will 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:54.780
 here they go 3 5 7 5 thousand data 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.919
 say what will you give 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.919
 food 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.470

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:31.800
 thank you first hope this lesson

 evolve set goals 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.460
 which is hard to achieve because 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.300
