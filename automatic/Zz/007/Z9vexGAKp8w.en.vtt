as<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.030> 111<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> balance<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
as you see 111 for the balance for the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.529 
as you see 111 for the balance for the
alignment<00:00:17.400> everything<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> left<00:00:18.359> that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
alignment everything to the left that

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.300 
alignment everything to the left that
makes<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.930> better<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> corners<00:00:19.590> however

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
makes it better in the corners however

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.859 
makes it better in the corners however
less<00:00:20.699> stable<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> straights<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:21.779> that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
less stable on the straights but that

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.830 
less stable on the straights but that
really<00:00:22.109> does<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.890> matter<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:24.510> only<00:00:24.720> other

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
really does not matter the only other

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.450 
really does not matter the only other
thing<00:00:25.080> I'm<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> change<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> break

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
thing I'm going to change is the break

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.060 
thing I'm going to change is the break
size<00:00:26.760> change<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.630> too<00:00:27.810> large<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.470> means<00:00:28.949> you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
size change that too large I means you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.700 
size change that too large I means you
can<00:00:29.189> stop<00:00:29.490> more<00:00:29.880> quickly<00:00:30.240> extra<00:00:31.170> weight<00:00:31.349> but

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
can stop more quickly extra weight but

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.459 
can stop more quickly extra weight but
you<00:00:31.980> won't<00:00:32.189> notice<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.300> anyway<00:00:34.230> onto
