00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
some protectors for them which these

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.920 
some protectors for them which these
ones<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.020> found<00:00:43.610> nice<00:00:44.610> locking<00:00:45.180> clasp<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.750> like

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
ones I found nice locking clasp I like

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.500 
ones I found nice locking clasp I like
that<00:00:46.260> hinge<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.460> plastic<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.180> okay

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that hinge is just plastic but it's okay

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
that hinge is just plastic but it's okay
fine<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.500> thing<00:00:49.649> I'll<00:00:49.739> mention<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.370> as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
fine one thing I'll mention is that as

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
fine one thing I'll mention is that as
much<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.120> these<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.539> add<00:00:51.660> protection<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.770> not

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
much as these do add protection it's not

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:53.930 
much as these do add protection it's not
like<00:00:53.070> putting<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> fully<00:00:53.730> padded

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
like putting them in a fully padded

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.670 
like putting them in a fully padded
Pelican<00:00:54.449> case<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.899> no<00:00:55.110> padding<00:00:55.469> here

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
Pelican case there is no padding here

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.529 
Pelican case there is no padding here
with<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> exception<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> top<00:00:57.270> which

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
with the exception of on the top which

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
with the exception of on the top which
is<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> meant<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:59.039> hold<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.579> drive

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
is really just a meant to hold the drive

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.189 
is really just a meant to hold the drive
in<00:00:59.969> there<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.539> rattling<00:01:01.079> around

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
in there so it's not rattling around

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.149 
in there so it's not rattling around
inside<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.530> lip

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
inside so I do like that there is a lip

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.990 
inside so I do like that there is a lip
so<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.180> actually<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.140> wining<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.000> securing

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so it's actually a wining and securing

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.920 
so it's actually a wining and securing
in<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.270> fashion

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
in that fashion

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.330 
in that fashion
it's<00:01:10.200> protected<00:01:10.650> against<00:01:10.830> dust<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.250> water

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it's protected against dust and water

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's protected against dust and water
from<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.820> getting<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
from of getting up and in there and I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
from of getting up and in there and I
like<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> they<00:01:14.130> also<00:01:14.369> lipped<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.420> front<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
like that they also lipped the front and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.510 
like that they also lipped the front and
back<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.229> these<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.560> they<00:01:16.680> stack<00:01:17.009> very<00:01:17.280> nicely

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
back of these so they stack very nicely

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.850 
back of these so they stack very nicely
as<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.090> see<00:01:18.270> not<00:01:18.630> falling<00:01:18.960> apart<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
as you can see not falling apart so it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
as you can see not falling apart so it
makes<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.250> they<00:01:20.340> don't<00:01:20.490> slide<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:21.060> over

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
makes it so they don't slide all over

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
makes it so they don't slide all over
the<00:01:21.360> place<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.689> you're<00:01:21.810> stacking<00:01:22.080> them

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
the place if you're stacking them

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
the place if you're stacking them
vertically<00:01:22.619> like<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.860> could<00:01:23.790> also<00:01:23.909> stack

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
vertically like this could also stack

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.370 
vertically like this could also stack
them<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.840> guess<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
them like this but I guess you have a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
them like this but I guess you have a
little<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.830> annoyance<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.400> pull<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.970> out

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
little bit of annoyance to pull it out

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510 
little bit of annoyance to pull it out
and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.780> forward<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:29.130> none<00:01:29.280> other<00:01:29.460> than

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and then forward but none other than

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.910 
and then forward but none other than

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
three half inch hard drive I'll also

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.860 
three half inch hard drive I'll also
link<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.069> another<00:02:28.340> option<00:02:29.330> which<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.480> also

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
link you to another option which is also

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.660 
link you to another option which is also
rated<00:02:30.049> pretty<00:02:30.349> well<00:02:30.530> which<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.769> more<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.580> a

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
rated pretty well which is more of a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.369 
rated pretty well which is more of a
open<00:02:31.879> top<00:02:32.360> kind<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.690> design<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.260> can

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
open top kind of design so you can

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.720 
open top kind of design so you can
choose<00:02:33.590> from<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:33.920> but<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.519> definitely

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
choose from that but I definitely

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.070 
choose from that but I definitely
recommend<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.269> pick<00:02:35.390> these<00:02:35.540> up<00:02:35.599> because<00:02:35.930> they

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
recommend you pick these up because they

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.050 
recommend you pick these up because they
are<00:02:36.170> very<00:02:36.349> inexpensive<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:37.790> help<00:02:38.000> to

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
are very inexpensive and they help to

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.880 
are very inexpensive and they help to
protect<00:02:38.150> your<00:02:38.629> precious<00:02:38.900> precious<00:02:39.200> data<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
microphone so I hope I also sound

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.800 
microphone so I hope I also sound
somewhat<00:02:48.590> prettier<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:49.430> enjoy<00:02:50.420> these<00:02:50.569> hard
