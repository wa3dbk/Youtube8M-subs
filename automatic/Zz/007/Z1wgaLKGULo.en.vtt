this thing feels in the hand it actually

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.729 
this thing feels in the hand it actually
has<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> plastic<00:00:42.840> finish<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> sort<00:00:43.710> of

has a plastic finish with a sort of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
has a plastic finish with a sort of
metal<00:00:44.070> look<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:45.090> 6.9

metal look to it and it's 6.9

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.600 
metal look to it and it's 6.9
millimeters<00:00:46.350> thin<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.800> basically<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.280> flat

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
millimeters thin with basically a flat

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
back
it<00:00:48.450> fits<00:00:48.750> incredibly<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> hands<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
kind of come to the conclusion that the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
kind of come to the conclusion that the
flat<00:00:52.410> sides<00:00:52.710> along<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> thin<00:00:53.640> build<00:00:53.910> are

flat sides along with the thin build are

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.240 
flat sides along with the thin build are
a<00:00:54.329> killer<00:00:54.899> combination<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.010> really

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
a killer combination and one that really

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.920 
a killer combination and one that really
elevates<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.879> thing's<00:00:57.180> build<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> whole

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
elevates this thing's build to a whole

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.520 
elevates this thing's build to a whole
new<00:00:58.079> level

new level
it<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.280> feels<00:00:59.520> quite<00:00:59.969> distinguished<00:01:00.510> in

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it really feels quite distinguished in

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
it really feels quite distinguished in
the<00:01:00.750> hand<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> really<00:01:01.350> high-end<00:01:01.800> build

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
best side was still extremely robust and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.080 
best side was still extremely robust and
eye-catching<00:01:16.439> overall<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.670> build<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
eye-catching overall the build of the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.830 
eye-catching overall the build of the
Emax<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.380> quite<00:01:19.650> good<00:01:19.830> indeed

Emax is really really quite good indeed

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.960 
Emax is really really quite good indeed
so<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> features<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.710> Emax<00:01:23.100> does<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
so the features of the Emax does it

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.120 
so the features of the Emax does it
stand<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:24.479> or<00:01:24.869> does<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.140> fade<00:01:25.470> into<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> crowd

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
stand out or does it fade into the crowd

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.460 
stand out or does it fade into the crowd
of<00:01:26.280> Android<00:01:26.640> devices<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.840> thing<00:01:28.110> has<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470

quite<00:01:45.750> sort<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.170> 2k<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.979> actually<00:01:47.100> think

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
quite sort of 2k but I actually think

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
quite sort of 2k but I actually think
that's<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.700> good<00:01:47.820> thing<00:01:47.880> yet<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:49.049> only<00:01:49.229> thing

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
that's a good thing yet the only thing

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
that's a good thing yet the only thing
is<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.829> thing<00:01:50.040> doesn't<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.700> most

snappy<00:05:05.770> on<00:05:05.800> here<00:05:06.070> it's<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:06.370> as<00:05:06.550> snappy<00:05:06.760> as

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
snappy on here it's just as snappy as

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.240 
snappy on here it's just as snappy as
any<00:05:07.150> lollipop<00:05:07.690> device<00:05:07.960> I've<00:05:08.140> used<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:09.100> only

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
any lollipop device I've used the only

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.440 
any lollipop device I've used the only
downside<00:05:09.640> is<00:05:09.670> obviously<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.090> don't<00:05:10.180> get<00:05:10.330> this

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
downside is obviously you don't get this

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.240 
downside is obviously you don't get this
sort<00:05:10.660> of<00:05:10.690> flashy<00:05:10.960> looking<00:05:11.230> animations<00:05:11.950> on<00:05:12.130> the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
sort of flashy looking animations on the

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.010 
sort of flashy looking animations on the
flat<00:05:12.460> look<00:05:12.670> but<00:05:13.300> then<00:05:13.420> again<00:05:13.510> that's<00:05:13.870> a

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
flat look but then again that's a

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.720 
flat look but then again that's a
sacrifice<00:05:14.230> worth<00:05:14.710> making<00:05:15.190> for<00:05:15.370> these<00:05:15.490> good

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
sacrifice worth making for these good

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
suspicion here is that the built in

suspicion here is that the built in
browser<00:05:29.320> is<00:05:29.650> just<00:05:29.920> weak<00:05:30.160> and<00:05:30.520> that<00:05:30.640> switching

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
browser is just weak and that switching

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.340 
browser is just weak and that switching
to<00:05:31.090> something<00:05:31.390> like<00:05:31.510> Chrome<00:05:31.870> would<00:05:32.140> yield

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
to something like Chrome would yield

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.240 
to something like Chrome would yield
better<00:05:32.590> results

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
better results

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.040

apart from the internet browser this

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.170 
apart from the internet browser this
phone<00:05:35.260> feels<00:05:35.710> like<00:05:36.010> a<00:05:36.040> super<00:05:36.850> high-end

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
lightness the way it fits into the hand

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.060 
lightness the way it fits into the hand
it<00:05:49.180> really<00:05:49.360> has<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.660> nice<00:05:50.020> personality<00:05:50.650> and

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
it really has a nice personality and

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.810 
it really has a nice personality and
look<00:05:51.280> to<00:05:51.460> it

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
look to it

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.820 
look to it
I<00:05:51.850> think<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:52.600> display<00:05:52.930> is<00:05:53.170> really<00:05:53.590> quite

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
I think the display is really quite

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.650 
I think the display is really quite
special<00:05:54.160> although<00:05:55.060> it's<00:05:55.180> not<00:05:55.360> the<00:05:55.510> most

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
special although it's not the most

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.870 
special although it's not the most
vibrant<00:05:55.930> it's<00:05:56.290> not<00:05:56.470> the<00:05:56.590> most<00:05:56.770> contrast<00:05:57.640> rich

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
vibrant it's not the most contrast rich

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.850 
vibrant it's not the most contrast rich
display<00:05:58.300> it<00:05:58.510> still<00:05:58.780> looks<00:05:59.020> surprisingly<00:05:59.470> nice

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
display it still looks surprisingly nice

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.860 
display it still looks surprisingly nice
and<00:06:00.100> I<00:06:00.160> think<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.880> neutral<00:06:01.240> palette<00:06:01.360> actually

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
and I think the neutral palette actually

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.080 
and I think the neutral palette actually
suits<00:06:02.140> me<00:06:02.320> quite<00:06:02.350> well<00:06:02.800> for<00:06:03.400> some<00:06:03.580> people<00:06:03.910> I

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
suits me quite well for some people I

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.060 
suits me quite well for some people I
think<00:06:04.150> there<00:06:04.480> might<00:06:04.600> be<00:06:04.660> a<00:06:04.780> benefit<00:06:05.260> on<00:06:05.470> top<00:06:05.950> of

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
think there might be a benefit on top of

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.710 
think there might be a benefit on top of
that<00:06:06.130> it<00:06:06.250> can<00:06:06.370> reach<00:06:06.580> a<00:06:06.760> really<00:06:07.210> high<00:06:07.360> level<00:06:07.660> of

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
that it can reach a really high level of

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.650 
that it can reach a really high level of
brightness<00:06:08.140> about<00:06:08.490> 420<00:06:09.490> nits<00:06:09.700> and<00:06:09.910> its<00:06:10.330> lowest

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
brightness about 420 nits and its lowest

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.450 
brightness about 420 nits and its lowest
level<00:06:10.900> is<00:06:11.050> also<00:06:11.350> very<00:06:11.590> low<00:06:11.860> which<00:06:12.040> means<00:06:12.250> that

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
level is also very low which means that

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.280 
level is also very low which means that
it's<00:06:12.760> actually<00:06:12.940> pretty<00:06:13.660> easy<00:06:13.900> on<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.170> eyes

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
it's actually pretty easy on the eyes

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.200 
it's actually pretty easy on the eyes
especially<00:06:14.650> in<00:06:15.070> dark<00:06:15.220> situations<00:06:15.970> such<00:06:16.180> as

especially in dark situations such as
