tie<00:00:55.350> rods<00:00:55.650> all<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> stuff<00:00:56.579> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
tie rods all that kind of stuff so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.170 
tie rods all that kind of stuff so
pretty<00:00:57.120> much<00:00:57.240> everything<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.200> squared<00:00:58.739> away

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
pretty much everything is squared away

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:08.609 
connections for the the wiring that was

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.559 
connections for the the wiring that was
a<00:01:08.929> attach<00:01:09.929> through<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> subframe<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.359> my<00:01:12.359> last

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
a attach through the subframe so my last

a attach through the subframe so my last
videos<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> told<00:01:13.859> you<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.039> make<00:01:14.340> sure<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.670> is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.340 
tires on and all these covers on top
here<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:38.399> then<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.119> last<00:01:39.359> thing<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.719> I<00:01:40.049> have

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
here and then the last thing that I have

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.709 
here and then the last thing that I have
to<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.649> which<00:01:41.249> is<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.969> sock

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
to do which is a sock

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.789 
to do which is a sock
cost-wise<00:01:43.529> is<00:01:44.399> put<00:01:44.729> new<00:01:45.350> transaxle<00:01:46.350> fluid<00:01:46.619> or

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
cost-wise is put new transaxle fluid or

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.370 
cost-wise is put new transaxle fluid or
beer<00:01:46.950> fluid<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:48.450> reason<00:01:48.689> why<00:01:48.779> it<00:01:48.840> sucks<00:01:49.170> is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
beer fluid the reason why it sucks is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.370 
beer fluid the reason why it sucks is
because<00:01:49.700> they're<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.359> $4<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> quart

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
because they're not like $4 a quart

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.910 
because they're not like $4 a quart
they're<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.069> don't<00:01:53.969> know<00:01:54.179> 20<00:01:54.810> bucks<00:01:54.990> for

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
they're like I don't know 20 bucks for

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.949 
they're like I don't know 20 bucks for
like<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> half<00:01:57.029> a<00:01:57.119> gallon<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.630> something<00:01:57.869> like

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
like a half a gallon or something like

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.690 
like a half a gallon or something like
that<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.439> still<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> lot<00:01:59.069> of<00:01:59.130> money<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.459> think<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that but still a lot of money I think I

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.309 
that but still a lot of money I think I
have<00:01:59.789> to<00:01:59.880> get<00:01:59.999> two<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.179> those<00:02:00.359> so<00:02:01.109> I'm<00:02:01.229> probably

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
have to get two of those so I'm probably

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.599 
have to get two of those so I'm probably
going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.709> driving<00:02:01.889> about<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.459> both

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
going to be driving about for you both

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:03.889 
going to be driving about for you both
so<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.819> said<00:02:02.969> yes<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> lot

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
so it said yes it's not a lot

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.430 
so it said yes it's not a lot
if<00:02:04.049> you

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
if you

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.820 
if you
but<00:02:04.830> I'm<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.360> anyway<00:02:06.870> other<00:02:07.650> than<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:09.830> or

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
but I'm not so anyway other than that or

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.420 
but I'm not so anyway other than that or
pretty<00:02:11.280> well-off<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.850> guess<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.120> should<00:02:12.270> say

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
pretty well-off I guess I should say

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.590 
pretty well-off I guess I should say
along<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.030> about<00:02:15.180> two<00:02:15.360> o'clock<00:02:15.540> in

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
along it so it's about two o'clock in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.600 
along it so it's about two o'clock in
