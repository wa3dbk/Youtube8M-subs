00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:13.500

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.660
 giving you specific land I wasn't looking for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.400
 marchiol you can play it to grant in 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.380
 evidence of central left defender 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.539
 we don't define it because it can do 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.029
 but both are in one though 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.730
 game we saw where he played it 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:35.270
 we can define queen defender 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.270
 central left and this defender 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:44.610
 left 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:47.879
 these are the 4 2 3 1 and there are two 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.149
 central midfielders then vi 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:55.230
 we call the media we don't call you in 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.090
 form here the definition medians 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.930
 in this way the two medians are the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.250
 central right midfielder and the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.030
 center left center here 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:15.830
 in the world of napoli of call 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.830
 playmaker and right outside 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.840
 outside right midfielder 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.409
 this we can call trequartista 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.960
 to come in 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.899
 central or there is also the definition 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.899
 half-pointed 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:45.329
 and this the trequartista I went to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.280
 external writer is then you 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.649
 we call it the first community and of 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.649
 this mode updates critical mixed 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.140
 how much midfielder 9 you are not 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.299
 so the midfielders that's why 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.049
 the fertile midfielders are the lines 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:12.269
 Central quartist with half-fare ago 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:14.340
 the finisher receiver trimmer 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.970
 shoulders is too much for a detention 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.650
 central playmaker chapter of hama 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.480
 central midfielder who already during the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.730
 fourth and plays central and therefore also 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.450
 half tip 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.450
 in these things 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.480
 so deleting this is not there 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.590
 when it happens to the right the tall outside 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.520
 we must accept this is all this 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.150
 that we are enrolled in this third series 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.099
 but if one says fullback in my opinion it is 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.260
 precisely because we have to call a 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.450
 Friend of technology this year 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.670
 external defender right in defender 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.860
 left exterior you can also these here 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.340
 we can also call them external 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.860
 right external left low external 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.330
 tall left is another definition that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.810
 we can also use lateral right e 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.069
 lateral lateral lateral left 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.030
 low and low side only side in 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.090
 act can not be dared 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.799
 the tall external actress was not there then 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.900
 after these make the movements then it is 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.239
 better I don't say lateral high it doesn't sound 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.239
 well the lateral one more for parolo in low 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.569
 if we make this form of naples in 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.769
 form what he was doing 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.769
 Yes No
