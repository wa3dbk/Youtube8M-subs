specific muscle that is over developed

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.470 
specific muscle that is over developed
and<00:00:48.480> guess<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:48.930> two<00:00:48.989> muscle<00:00:49.559> groups<00:00:49.770> are

most over develop muscles it's my form
semi<00:00:56.010> back<00:00:57.050> interesting<00:00:58.070> because<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.250> was

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
semi back interesting because I was

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.939

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
years straight I didn't climbing every

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320 
years straight I didn't climbing every
single<00:01:04.799> day<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> would<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.580> would<00:01:06.060> be

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
single day I would do I would be

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.870 
single day I would do I would be
climbing<00:01:06.659> buildings<00:01:07.189> to<00:01:08.189> require<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> lot<00:01:08.729> of

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
climbing buildings to require a lot of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.810 
climbing buildings to require a lot of
grip<00:01:09.150> strength<00:01:09.229> okay<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:11.130> why<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.430> forms

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
grip strength okay that's why my forms

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.810 
grip strength okay that's why my forms
are<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.090> big<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.439> required<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.159> lot<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> back

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
are so big and it required a lot of back

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.350 
are so big and it required a lot of back
strength

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
strength

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.030

I<00:01:15.979> see<00:01:16.979> overtraining<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:19.530> used<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
I see overtraining we used to think that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.039 
I see overtraining we used to think that
it<00:01:20.220> was<00:01:20.310> bad<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> look<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.720> people

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
it was bad but if you look at people

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.749 
it was bad but if you look at people
pull<00:01:22.470> outside<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> bodybuilding<00:01:23.610> community

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
pull outside the bodybuilding community

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
pull outside the bodybuilding community
like<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.600> third-world<00:01:24.930> countries<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.770> all

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
like in third-world countries and all

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.130 
like in third-world countries and all
these<00:01:26.189> types<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.520> things<00:01:26.700> these<00:01:27.659> people<00:01:28.020> are

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
these types of things these people are

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.690 
these types of things these people are
training<00:01:28.380> every<00:01:28.650> single<00:01:28.680> day<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
training every single day for the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.249 
training every single day for the
survival<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:30.780> want<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> build

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
survival not because they want to build

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.440 
survival not because they want to build
a<00:01:31.560> bigger<00:01:32.189> muscular<00:01:32.670> physique<00:01:32.850> but<00:01:33.150> because

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
a bigger muscular physique but because

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230 
a bigger muscular physique but because
it's<00:01:34.380> necessary<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.189> them

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it's necessary for them

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.580 
it's necessary for them

power<00:02:02.229> lifting<00:02:02.470> workouts<00:02:03.660> blow<00:02:04.660> up<00:02:04.890> blew<00:02:05.890> up

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
power lifting workouts blow up blew up

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.570 
power lifting workouts blow up blew up
completely<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.960> when<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:08.979> really<00:02:09.250> think<00:02:09.520> about

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
completely and when I really think about

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.530 
completely and when I really think about
it<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.950> doing<00:02:11.980> climbing<00:02:12.780> hours<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> day<00:02:14.459> from

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it I was doing climbing hours a day from

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.510 
it I was doing climbing hours a day from
1<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:17.680> 5<00:02:18.130> or<00:02:18.400> 6<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:18.820> I'd<00:02:19.690> be<00:02:19.930> given<00:02:20.230> thing<00:02:20.520> for

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
1 to 5 or 6 so I'd be given thing for

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.120 
1 to 5 or 6 so I'd be given thing for
hours<00:02:21.820> every<00:02:22.000> day<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.660> climbing<00:02:22.950> seven<00:02:23.950> days<00:02:24.100> a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
hours every day of climbing seven days a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.090 
hours every day of climbing seven days a
week<00:02:24.220> three<00:02:25.090> years<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.380> imagine<00:02:26.530> why<00:02:26.890> my

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
week three years you can imagine why my

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.470 
week three years you can imagine why my
back<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.489> forms<00:02:27.790> grew<00:02:27.970> up<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.270> there's<00:02:28.390> a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
back and forms grew up and there's a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.860 
back and forms grew up and there's a
reason<00:02:28.780> for<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.230> science<00:02:29.590> has<00:02:29.830> confirmed

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
reason for it the science has confirmed

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.940 
reason for it the science has confirmed
that's<00:02:31.870> because<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:33.430> muscle<00:02:33.790> cell<00:02:34.060> has<00:02:34.950> more

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that's because the muscle cell has more

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.250 
that's because the muscle cell has more
nuclei<00:02:36.340> okay<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.510> when<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.690> train<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.959> muscle

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
nuclei okay and when you train a muscle

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.190 
nuclei okay and when you train a muscle
every<00:02:38.350> day<00:02:38.590> instead<00:02:39.520> of<00:02:39.670> um<00:02:40.140> rebuilding<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
every day instead of um rebuilding the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.900 
every day instead of um rebuilding the
muscle<00:02:41.470> itself<00:02:41.590> you're<00:02:41.950> creating<00:02:42.880> more

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
muscle itself you're creating more

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.420 
muscle itself you're creating more
nuclei<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:44.140> nuclei<00:02:44.530> are<00:02:44.680> responsible<00:02:45.220> for

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
nuclei the nuclei are responsible for

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.550 
nuclei the nuclei are responsible for
protein<00:02:46.030> synthesis<00:02:46.570> which<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:46.989> the

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
protein synthesis which is the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.990 
protein synthesis which is the
rebuilding<00:02:47.980> process<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.549> muscles<00:02:48.880> how

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
rebuilding process of the muscles how

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.910 
rebuilding process of the muscles how
the<00:02:49.060> protein<00:02:49.510> synthesizes<00:02:50.500> all<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.769> type<00:02:50.890> of

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
the protein synthesizes all that type of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.539 
the protein synthesizes all that type of
 you<00:02:51.370> could<00:02:51.519> do<00:02:52.239> your<00:02:52.390> science<00:02:53.049> research

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
 you could do your science research

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.880 
 you could do your science research
but<00:02:54.549> essentially<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.480> lot<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.440> guys<00:02:56.560> they<00:02:56.739> take

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
but essentially a lot of guys they take

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.100 
but essentially a lot of guys they take
drugs<00:02:57.269> to<00:02:58.269> increase<00:02:58.450> their<00:02:58.810> protein

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
drugs to increase their protein

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.710 
drugs to increase their protein
synthesis<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.739> steroids<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:01.330> know<00:03:01.420> stuff

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
synthesis like steroids you know stuff

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.960 
synthesis like steroids you know stuff
like<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.019> but<00:03:02.290> when<00:03:03.250> you're<00:03:03.370> training<00:03:03.670> every

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
like that but when you're training every

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.300 
like that but when you're training every
single<00:03:04.269> day<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:05.170> increase<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> nuclei<00:03:06.040> so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
single day you increase the nuclei so

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.100 
single day you increase the nuclei so
that<00:03:06.489> you're<00:03:06.880> almost<00:03:07.120> making<00:03:07.870> your<00:03:08.080> own

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
that you're almost making your own

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.320 
that you're almost making your own
steroids<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:09.459> that's<00:03:09.760> exactly<00:03:10.090> what

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
steroids and that's exactly what

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.630 
steroids and that's exactly what
happened<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.600> me<00:03:10.720> my<00:03:10.870> back<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.070> developed

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
happened to me my back is so developed

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.620 
happened to me my back is so developed
signing<00:03:13.269> funny<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.980> when<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.489> was<00:03:15.700> when<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.540> was

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
signing funny like when I was when I was

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.900 
signing funny like when I was when I was
when<00:03:16.989> I<00:03:17.049> was<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.230> 15<00:03:17.440> years<00:03:17.650> old<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.340> had<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
when I was like 15 years old I had a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.810 
when I was like 15 years old I had a
freakin<00:03:19.510> v<00:03:19.690> paper<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.350> had<00:03:20.830> never<00:03:21.040> done<00:03:21.250> rows<00:03:21.580> in

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
freakin v paper I had never done rows in

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.600 
freakin v paper I had never done rows in
my<00:03:21.910> life<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.440> was<00:03:23.440> like<00:03:23.560> pretty<00:03:24.070> much<00:03:24.130> pull-ups

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
my life I was like pretty much pull-ups

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.430 
my life I was like pretty much pull-ups
every<00:03:24.850> day<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.720> know<00:03:25.780> cuz<00:03:26.019> I<00:03:26.110> was<00:03:26.200> doing<00:03:26.350> the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
every day you know cuz I was doing the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.690 
every day you know cuz I was doing the
climbing

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
climbing

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.320 
climbing
so<00:03:29.650> if<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.770> have<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.920> lagging<00:03:31.130> body<00:03:31.370> part<00:03:31.730> or<00:03:32.180> if

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
so if you have a lagging body part or if

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.720 
so if you have a lagging body part or if
you<00:03:32.420> want<00:03:32.599> something<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.230> stand<00:03:33.440> out<00:03:33.730> train

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
you want something to stand out train

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.850 
you want something to stand out train
that<00:03:35.090> every<00:03:35.270> single<00:03:35.569> day<00:03:35.690> hi

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
that every single day hi

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.850 
that every single day hi
frickin<00:03:37.430> volume<00:03:37.849> as<00:03:37.970> well<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:39.050> know<00:03:39.170> because

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
frickin volume as well you know because

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.100 
frickin volume as well you know because
let's<00:03:40.130> be<00:03:40.190> honest<00:03:40.550> I<00:03:40.670> was<00:03:40.880> carrying<00:03:41.180> my<00:03:41.870> body

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
let's be honest I was carrying my body

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.660 
let's be honest I was carrying my body
which<00:03:42.560> was<00:03:42.680> about<00:03:43.030> anywhere<00:03:44.030> from<00:03:44.239> 120<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.989> 140

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
which was about anywhere from 120 to 140

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.120 
which was about anywhere from 120 to 140
every<00:03:46.670> single<00:03:47.090> day<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:48.500> weight<00:03:48.770> wasn't

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
every single day so the weight wasn't

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.090 
every single day so the weight wasn't
that<00:03:49.220> much<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:49.760> had<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.060> recompensate<00:03:50.750> by

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
that much so I had to recompensate by

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.949 
that much so I had to recompensate by
increasing<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.430> time<00:03:52.670> under<00:03:53.030> tension<00:03:53.060> one<00:03:53.870> of

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
increasing the time under tension one of

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.240 
increasing the time under tension one of
the<00:03:54.050> muscle<00:03:54.350> building<00:03:54.560> principles<00:03:55.069> that<00:03:55.190> I

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
the muscle building principles that I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.920 
the muscle building principles that I
still<00:03:55.459> talk<00:03:55.489> about<00:03:55.700> in<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.450> bodybuilding

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
still talk about in the bodybuilding

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.650 
still talk about in the bodybuilding
community<00:03:57.290> how<00:03:57.590> interesting

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
community how interesting

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.270 
community how interesting
so<00:03:59.660> buying<00:03:59.810> cream<00:04:00.110> by<00:04:00.440> increasing<00:04:00.920> time<00:04:01.100> and

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
so buying cream by increasing time and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.100 
so buying cream by increasing time and
attention<00:04:01.720> that's<00:04:02.720> how<00:04:02.870> you're<00:04:02.959> going<00:04:03.050> to

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
attention that's how you're going to

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.580 
attention that's how you're going to
build<00:04:03.290> more<00:04:03.530> muscle<00:04:03.560> now<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:04.069> course<00:04:04.370> I<00:04:05.590> mean

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
build more muscle now of course I mean

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.830 
build more muscle now of course I mean
it<00:04:07.040> shouldn't<00:04:07.489> hype<00:04:07.730> over<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.120> because<00:04:08.690> if
