 Hebrew university of jerusalem believes that 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.190
 The high level of phenolic fiber 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.020
 trace nutrients and minerals make 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.360
 that persimmon is preferable in a diet

 with apples 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.690
 according to gorinstein consume a single persimmon 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.900
 of medium size every day is enough 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.079
 to stop cardiovascular disease

 persimmon also relieves diabetes a 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.129
 study at the institute of food 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.900
 technology from japan discovered that a 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.760
 khaki skin extract in a way 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.459
 effective improved resistance to 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.230
 insulin in rats when the diet of 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.480
 rodents was supplemented with the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.909
 extract over 12 weeks the 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.250
 insulin expression was enriched 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.459
 meaningful way carrying a 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.739
 improvement in receiving sensitivity 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.879
 overflowing with harmful flavonoids acid

 venturini coi symbol 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.500
 the persimmon is a protective food 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.750
 exceptional the presence of catechins and 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.879
 tannins to catec and helps us limit 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.799
 oxidative damage and reduce the 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.440
 blood pressure in addition to levels of 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.120
 serum lipids betul and niko acid 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.010
 is specifically geared towards 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.290
 carcinogenic tumors that dissolves 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.389
 while a plentiful amount of 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.329
 flavonoids protect against mutations 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.250
 of the DNA stands out for its content in 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.139
 beta carotene or provitamin that is 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.569
 transforms into a vitamin according to 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.340
 organism needs it and this vitamin is 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.370
 essential for the good condition of the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.199
 mucosal hair skin bones as well as 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.920
 for proper operation of the 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.770
 system 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.020
 logical for all this we can indicate that 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.090
 the persimmon as a source of provitamin is 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.130
 recommended to the entire population and more 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.290
 specifically in those people who 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.110
 they have a higher risk of suffering 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.970
 in said vitamin as are people who 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.709
 they follow low-fat diets in 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.950
 situation of nutritional needs 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.510
 Increased growth periods 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.150
 pregnancy breastfeeding 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.830
 also tobacco alcohol employment 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.560
 of certain medications 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.630
 stress intense physical activity the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.720
 AIDS cancer and inflammatory diseases 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.030
 Chronicles also the persimmon is a source of 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.670
 vitamin c which intervenes in the 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.459
 bone formation teeth collagen 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.109
 red blood cells promotes the absorption of 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.990
 iron of food and resistance 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.000
 at infections 2 vitamins 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.430
 previously cited have a 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.200
 antioxidant effect thus contributing to 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.540
 reduce the risk of diseases 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.400
 degenerative cardiovascular diseases and 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.550
 cancer neutralize substances 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.870
 carcinogens such as nitrosamines 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.780
 They also present a good contribution of 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.400
 vitamin b1 and b2 which favor a 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.490
 correct functioning of 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.350
 nervous system potassium is necessary 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.560
 for nerve impulse transmission 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.580
 and for normal muscle activity 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.370
 involved in water balance 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.740
 inside and outside the cell its content 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.840
 in potassium and low sodium supply makes 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.400
 of persimmon a fruit highly recommended for 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.699
 People suffering from hypertension 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.440
 arterial and cardiovascular diseases 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.020
 although the persimmon has a great efficiency 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.570
 as an antioxidant is a fruit with a 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.000
 high caloric content each serving 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.639
 equivalent to a fruit the size of a 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.490
 tennis ball contains around 70 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.650
 calories is not worth consuming it like 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.600
 juice because if it's done that way the 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.850
 portion of persimmon more water would not give us 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.490
 more than 100 milliliters which is very 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.039
 little and if we add more fruits and more 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.590
 persimmon we increase the caloric intake what 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.300
 which is not really recommended 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.190
 you should think about including this 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.530
 wonderful fruit to your diet is not 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.349
 expensive and you can find it very easy 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.240
 in countries of america and europe a way 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:45.190
 natural to prevent diseases that in 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.169
 the last few years has had a high rate 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.030
 of mortality in the world and that the 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.290
 more secure and reliable solution 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.480
 to have a truly life 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.440
 healthy and full is what it offers us 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.440
 nature
