highly<00:04:51.430> trained<00:04:51.700> sensitive<00:04:52.300> horse<00:04:52.680> that's

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
highly trained sensitive horse that's

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.070 
highly trained sensitive horse that's
very<00:04:53.950> electric<00:04:54.790> almost<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.480> leg<00:04:55.660> so

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
very electric almost to the leg so

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.440 
very electric almost to the leg so
basically<00:04:56.680> what<00:04:57.340> happened<00:04:57.790> was<00:04:57.820> he<00:04:58.060> gathered

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
basically what happened was he gathered

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.380 
basically what happened was he gathered
speeds<00:04:58.770> encounter<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.550> immediate

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
speeds encounter and the immediate

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.450 
speeds encounter and the immediate
reaction<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.990> nicholae<00:05:02.320> which<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.800> would<00:05:03.040> not

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
reaction of nicholae which I would not

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.230 
reaction of nicholae which I would not
blame<00:05:03.730> anybody<00:05:04.180> for<00:05:04.360> doing<00:05:04.650> was<00:05:05.650> she<00:05:05.980> actually

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
blame anybody for doing was she actually

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.430 
blame anybody for doing was she actually
squeezed<00:05:07.240> him<00:05:07.510> with<00:05:07.630> her<00:05:07.750> leg<00:05:07.930> so<00:05:07.960> basically

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
squeezed him with her leg so basically

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.630 
squeezed him with her leg so basically
she<00:05:08.710> was<00:05:08.860> telling<00:05:09.190> des<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:10.180> go<00:05:10.330> faster<00:05:10.870> and

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
she was telling des to go faster and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.680 
she was telling des to go faster and
obviously<00:05:12.640> then<00:05:12.850> he<00:05:12.940> got<00:05:13.060> to<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.330> point<00:05:13.540> a

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
obviously then he got to that point a

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.230 
obviously then he got to that point a
little<00:05:13.810> bit<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:14.290> panic<00:05:14.950> mode<00:05:15.430> which<00:05:15.790> we<00:05:16.090> could

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
little bit of panic mode which we could

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.440 
little bit of panic mode which we could
all<00:05:16.420> do<00:05:16.860> wrong<00:05:17.860> clamping<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:18.910> so<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.150> just

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
all do wrong clamping and so you just

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.690 
all do wrong clamping and so you just
saw<00:05:19.660> him<00:05:19.870> gathering<00:05:20.260> speed<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.770> then<00:05:20.890> I<00:05:21.160> think

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
saw him gathering speed and then I think

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.860 
saw him gathering speed and then I think
Nicky<00:05:21.910> did<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.150> right<00:05:22.300> thing<00:05:22.540> I<00:05:22.630> mean<00:05:22.720> she

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
Nicky did the right thing I mean she

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.780 
Nicky did the right thing I mean she
bailed<00:05:23.080> out<00:05:23.320> and<00:05:23.530> I<00:05:23.620> tried<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:24.040> stop<00:05:24.490> him<00:05:24.640> for

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
bailed out and I tried to stop him for

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.240 
bailed out and I tried to stop him for
her<00:05:25.000> but<00:05:25.210> she<00:05:26.110> jumped<00:05:26.290> off<00:05:26.530> and<00:05:26.740> had<00:05:27.010> a<00:05:27.040> little

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
her but she jumped off and had a little

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.430 
her but she jumped off and had a little
tumble<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:27.730> you<00:05:28.690> know<00:05:28.780> that<00:05:28.960> sources<00:05:29.260> and

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
tumble and you know that sources and

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.510 
tumble and you know that sources and
that's<00:05:29.560> why<00:05:29.680> it's<00:05:29.800> really<00:05:29.950> important<00:05:30.460> that

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
that's why it's really important that
