where<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> burn<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.730> sit<00:00:38.969> let<00:00:39.660> the

layers<00:00:40.050> dry<00:00:40.500> gradually<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.610> pop<00:00:41.879> some

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
layers dry gradually and then pop some

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.760 
layers dry gradually and then pop some
more<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.870> we're<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.320> pull<00:00:43.620> it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
more on because we're going to pull it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.880 
more on because we're going to pull it
to<00:00:43.980> give<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.910> sort<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.719> bird<00:00:46.170> skin

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.330 
to give that really sort of bird skin
look<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:48.620> decided<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.860> didn't<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
look I decided I didn't like the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
look I decided I didn't like the
coverage<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.120> eyebrows<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> ended<00:00:52.320> up

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
coverage on my eyebrows so I ended up

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.209 
coverage on my eyebrows so I ended up
pulling<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.039> part<00:00:53.430> off<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.239> actually

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
pulling that part off and actually

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.830 
pulling that part off and actually
reapplying<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.460> glue<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.180> stippling

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
reapplying the glue and then stippling

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.680 
reapplying the glue and then stippling
some<00:00:58.559> foundation<00:00:59.309> over<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.570> can

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

my brush to go over my eyelids and I
area<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.280> suggest<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:21.970> don't<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.540> though

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
area I suggest you don't do this though

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.750 
area I suggest you don't do this though
because<00:02:23.290> there<00:02:23.709> is<00:02:23.830> alcohol<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.550> brush

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
because there is alcohol on the brush

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.310 
because there is alcohol on the brush

but for some reason I just want to have

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.130 
but for some reason I just want to have
them<00:02:26.470> do<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:28.030> can<00:02:28.209> use<00:02:28.360> brown<00:02:28.660> blacks

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
them do that you can use brown blacks
