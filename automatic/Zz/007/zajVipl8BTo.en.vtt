00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.330
 the one that ibar bulldozer when we hear key 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.490
 bar is inevitable to think about knives 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.010
 military and combat in fact from 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.050
 50 years ago is possibly the best 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.970
 bet in this segment but when you 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.490
 it's about a project as ambitious as 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.590
 make a resignification of the knife 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.870
 of combat things are even more 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.850
 complicated because it must be fulfilled as 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.310
 minimum with the specifications of 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.710
 traditional and uss itself that was going in 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.780
 special if it comes from the same house and the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.940
 reputation of liu is itself has not 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.489
 seen diminished in the last 60 years 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.010
 it's because it's a fantastic tool 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.050
 the botox jr designer is recognized by 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.659
 its production in fixed blade knives 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.399
 with a unique attention to detail and 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.199
 the steel treatment process 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.659
 within a very high price range 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.429
 rational what is not very normal is the 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.219
 wait time to load a knife 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:00.440
 of dossier takes approximately 32 months 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.050
 so that you want to design a knife 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.760
 combat that would be sold by kmart the 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.650
 house of the combat knife by 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.900
 excellence I had to make a bet 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.190
 innovative and at the same time safe by 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.740
 which chose to decrease risks 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.470
 using a tradition construction 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.780
 with modern but proven materials 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.909
 towards the construction of the command is of 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.159
 two streets that hug the leaf that is 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.439
 full profile but the grips are 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.750
 made on site the super material 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.970
 resistant and in elastic and with three 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.610
 creighton inserts that is softer 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.409
 which ensures that the anti-slip is 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.299
 Ergonomics of course should be better 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.520
 that the de liu is itself so it 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.409
 started with a profile of the oval handle 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.330
 instead of circulating and the three 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.399
 creighton surfaces provide 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.740
 much certainty in handling at the same 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.630
 time they avoid suffering the hand in 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.179
 prolonged use the handle has a 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.940
 concavity for the index with a shoulder 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.770
 that resembles a sub grip that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.750
 It is very useful to maintain traction 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.130
 when the knife is removed after 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.740
 to have been nailed 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.959
 In short, a lot of security in the use of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.270
 handguards as in the heel too 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.729
 is given by the profile of the sheet in 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.739
 conjunction with the handle 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.810
 It is also from site and is compatible with 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.180
 mold with slots to weave the as 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.350
 straps or perforations to tie it 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.780
 with elbow 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.760
 being rigid does not absorb water and holds the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.800
 knife so firmly that you can 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.630
 to be led vertically oriented 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.760
 up or down the sheet is 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.890
 manufactured in aws 8 which is a steel 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.870
 North American of great resistance to 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.850
 oxidation but since it's a knife 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.250
 combat was finished with a painting 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.200
 epoxy antre and restrictive the greatest 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.240
 dossier contribution to the design was in the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.730
 sheet generating a clip-type sheet 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.890
 point with a broad edge that yes 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.750
 well it did not facilitate turning with the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.630
 knife makes it a lethal weapon 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.300
 in combat the frosting is concave and 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.160
 has a sharp side at 20 degrees what 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.590
 it's unusual for a working knife 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.230
 but that confirms his devotion to combat 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.980
 although the package case and knife 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.040
 it reaches 1.2 pounds and 12 and an eighth 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.170
 of inches of total length makes it 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.780
 in a slightly heavy tool 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.660
 for long walks but a bet 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.730
 safe for the camper and a lot 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.730
 better for those friends in combat
