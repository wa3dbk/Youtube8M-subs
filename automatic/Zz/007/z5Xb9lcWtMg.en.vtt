00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.700
 political reasons just a video 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 broken due to ending memory in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.910
 camera 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.780
 now we have flue gas temperature 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.150
 already become 90 degrees I will continue the story 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.859
 oh while he's still warming up about what is 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.650
 possibility of installing indoor 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.020
 thermostat which will transmit 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.820
 thoroughly the team that needs to be increased 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 this heating figure or vice versa 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 slightly reduce the prize from our analogue 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.840
 4 thousandth automatic with side control 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 have full now i'm writing already climbed in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.510
 principle we can open for now 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.330
 from burning 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.890
 you throw smoke going chimney just not that 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.600
 century 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.600
 it's summer on the street plus degrees 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.460
 not 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.480
 bunker and burner but on this boiler can 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.210
 only on one side of the west 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.490
 you can order on and accommodation 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 bunker as right Natalia herself with the left 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.619
 sides and there are only four modifications 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.720
 which takes into account power and per kilowatt 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.770
 what it looks like at the moment with us and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.259
 boiler 25 and accordingly such power 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.200
 arrangement of bunkers regal so and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.689
 on the left side then order 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.580
 the boiler then you need to specify which 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.340
 burger location you need 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.319
 replace the bunker already in place to do it 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.500
 ultrasound is impossible if in this boiler 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.110
 some cottages if for example open 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.869
 bunker yes if we are given now 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.350
 position heard the signal and automatics 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.110
 boiler 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.369
 completely stop working this is due 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.750
 so that the boiler works with on and smoke 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.400
 gases can clinics a boat with grandsons sheltered 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.929
 chop through his seal room 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.369
 these gases are very numerous therefore 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.170
 automatics this take into account the fan 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.510
 In this case, you stopped at 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.480
 closing after the radiator continues 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.920
 work even if we happen 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.800
 the loss of light then at the time of ramadan 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.830
 light of two hours when re-enabled 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.110
 light will go into the operating mode of the systems that 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.800
 corruption 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.260
 directly in america going on 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.690
 burning will re-automatically 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.970
 how threatening if it were lost 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.510
 light about four to five hours of friction 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.960
 will stop and need to be reused 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.830
 the customer is leaving the kitten now 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.830
 already 100 degrees 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.260
 show us the branch came 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.439
 can see how poor stands out 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.439
 middle pyrolysis gas 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.450
 as expected taxis 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.490
 air which 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.680
 burner work 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.959
 at half power 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.959
 Peru Tuva reaches for 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.780
 the subject automatically increases 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.760
 here on burning 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.900
 he needs to be reached cyprus 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.900
 cheers boiler water 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.260
 how do we know the fuel quality happens 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.460
 miscellaneous including whether the ticket is possible 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.520
 somehow tune 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.000
 burner in the boiler but very good 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.880
 the matter is that coal is either a ticket 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.380
 depending on the supplier may 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.690
 change their qualities and in order to 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.960
 we need to set up the boiler 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.820
 produce 23 loop manipulations in 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.150
 boiler settings you sun and said 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.100
 as follows what to 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.270
 fuel burned correctly after 2 3 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.630
 hours of work you must open the door and 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.820
 look at the surface which 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.420
 is on burned if we see on it 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.230
 a lot of unburned fuel to us 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.850
 is necessary 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.280
 automatics it can do 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.620
 the user is almost there the design is very 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.960
 described is very simple and at Come 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.850
 main menu 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.070
 choosing the exact where we choose the view 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.890
 Murugan fuel either and pipes or 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.660
 Bagramov and set altering 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.840
 coefficient which allows us 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.580
 add the amount of fuel either explicit 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.960
 reduce just as well associated with 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.300
 fan if you use us 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.720
 as kind as coal and this coal as 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.720
 sueza 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.010
 recommendations that changed these 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.380
 odds you can change the quality 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.540
 burning if you like sueza need 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.729
 a little less fan if you have 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.080
 for example 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.790
 unburned fuel coal pours 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.199
 touch box from here you can him and brains 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.550
 amount of togawa it's done too everything 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.740
 from this menu which is available 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.860
 to the user, that is, if coal was brought 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.290
 one quality you used it 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.470
 brought 2 you can do it through 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.160
 two works fine for how long 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.410
 bunker capacity for boiler operation 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.720
 volume booker of this model triste de la 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.240
 vostra three hundred eighty five liters 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.150
 bunker need to fill up fuel 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.949
 about this line 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.229
 Basque is the maximum or backfill 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:56.650
 minimal backfill here is this way 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.360
 if we talk about work time in 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.850
 depending on the type of fuel this time 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.750
 is celebrated if we use the boiler 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.940
 more than 130 kilowatts at during backfilling 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.180
 at loud 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.980
 bunker is 48 hours of work if we 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.650
 use brown coal unfortunately we 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.130
 its in our video is not so big 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.160
 doubt is more russian federation 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.020
 then this coal will be enough for 31 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.840
 it works now if we use 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.180
 the client is only 22 hours working 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.310
 continuously at maximum power 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.870
 Well, as the equipment in principle for 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.000
 season does not work at maximum 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.840
 capacity we can talk about what 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.070
 this is about houses or work now 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:44.490
 flue gas temperature was 123 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.160
 degrees boiler runs at one hundred percent 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:51.120
 Power water temperature is 47 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.030
 degrees now again you can re 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.510
 I no longer have 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.050
 burner power 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.050
 rises 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.120
 gorenje 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.640
 down below 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.260
 my burner is located special 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.470
 element 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.470
 your 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.400
 waltz reflector below 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.040
 which the 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.610
 falls and 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.610
 namely 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.490
 torch 1 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.979
 that's against overheating 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.060
 top ten items 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.740
 when setting up in the burner hit 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.630
 factor can be used 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.030
 gas analyzer with which you can 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.220
 better optimize the process 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:56.710
 plumage 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.720
 By kindling, in principle, this is all 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.250
 information 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.460
 thank you for watching ours 

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.460
 roller
