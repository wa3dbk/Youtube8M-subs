hard any two

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.890 
hard any two
of<00:03:31.670> course<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.060> room<00:03:32.180> is<00:03:32.300> problem<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:32.660> score

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
of course the room is problem to score

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.430 
of course the room is problem to score
goal<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.100> think<00:03:34.450> we<00:03:35.450> had<00:03:35.600> we<00:03:35.900> had<00:03:35.930> number<00:03:36.320> of

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
goal so I think we had we had number of

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.680 
goal so I think we had we had number of
tangents<00:03:36.860> of<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:37.010> scoring<00:03:37.490> goal<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:38.270> we<00:03:38.450> have<00:03:38.570> to

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
tangents of a scoring goal so we have to

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.570 
tangents of a scoring goal so we have to
improve<00:03:38.810> on<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.440> be<00:03:39.560> more<00:03:39.800> precise<00:03:40.280> and

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
improve on that to be more precise and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.120 
improve on that to be more precise and
whenever<00:03:41.300> chances<00:03:41.930> created<00:03:42.110> we<00:03:42.800> have<00:03:42.920> to

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
whenever chances created we have to

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.720 
whenever chances created we have to
scold<00:03:43.520> them<00:03:44.200> am<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.320> feeling<00:03:45.470> disappointed
