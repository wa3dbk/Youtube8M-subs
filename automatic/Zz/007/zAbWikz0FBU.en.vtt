00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.360
 here we are, a very good first video 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.730
 very short tutorial to see together 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.000
 how to make a boot of one 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.720
 infinite neck warmer then started up 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.720
 iron all the stitches you need 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.050
 take a brand name point stitch 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.109
 insert and start another shirt again 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:36.649
 which we then need to join in circles 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.649
 without creating a little step in short 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:47.370
 here it is now we rotate the work e 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.000
 we check that all the jerseys are 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.219
 in the same sense therefore not so but 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.610
 well 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:01.079
 so put it then we check well 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.469
 here all you see all in the same 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.469
 sense 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 now to create infinite movement 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:18.330
 we have to rotate the iron on the left 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:21.299
 with the latest 360 degree meshes here 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.380
 here we need to create this movement a 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:30.630
 spiral you see it from here but here and then it goes 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.060
 behind I do it all well in order 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.590
 now I take the last jerseys with a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:43.049
 left iron rotated here that returns 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:47.670
 in position is seen and start finish in 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:52.670
 round then I wear the last shirt 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.670
 started on the right on the left iron 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.410
 the point mark is used to mark 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.180
 the start of the tour will leave him working 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.670
 the first shirt started and the last one 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.670
 knit started together then two in one 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.890
 here it is 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.500
 I always keep course work rest 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.080
 started with the portion and continue 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.420
 work as stated in the straight 6 scheme 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.670
 right and backhand reverse is costinha 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.740
 this case we try with the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.840
 right and you will see that there is not really 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.010
 no such annoyance at all 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.510
 problem because the jerseys appear 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:44.440
 normally it just remains one 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.440
 twist in my work 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.099
 you see 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.049
 see you soon. Bye
