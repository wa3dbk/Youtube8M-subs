a<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> pressure<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> great

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
a lot of pressure so that was a great

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.550 
a lot of pressure so that was a great
pick<00:00:27.420> up<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.840> them<00:00:27.960> yeah<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.439> definitely

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
pick up there for them yeah I definitely

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.410 
pick up there for them yeah I definitely
think<00:00:28.980> first<00:00:29.310> picking<00:00:29.640> Lulu<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.179> pretty

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
think first picking Lulu was pretty

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.269 
think first picking Lulu was pretty
genius<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.199> honestly<00:00:31.410> didn't<00:00:31.859> even<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.250> that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
genius I honestly didn't even see that

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
genius I honestly didn't even see that
because<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.730> kind<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.360> forgot<00:00:33.660> Lulu<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.140> top

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
because I kind of forgot Lulu as a top

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340 
because I kind of forgot Lulu as a top
champion<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.219> when<00:00:36.149> they<00:00:36.300> did<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:37.079> kind

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
champion so when they did that it kind

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.790 
champion so when they did that it kind
of<00:00:37.850> hurt<00:00:38.850> LM<00:00:39.180> q's<00:00:39.420> bad<00:00:39.780> faith<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.200> pig<00:00:40.469> face<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
of hurt LM q's bad faith or pig face the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
of hurt LM q's bad faith or pig face the
second<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.129> picked<00:00:41.309> Lulu<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.820> goes<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.750> we

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
second they picked Lulu it goes do we

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
second they picked Lulu it goes do we
pick<00:00:42.960> syndra<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:43.559> well<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.820> Cinderella

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
pick syndra now well if I Cinderella

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.369 
pick syndra now well if I Cinderella
something<00:00:45.510> there's<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> Lulu<00:00:46.050> ult<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
something there's going to Lulu ult it

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.340 
something there's going to Lulu ult it
so<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.039> kind<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.489> think<00:00:47.550> persuaded<00:00:48.300> lmq<00:00:48.930> from

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so it kind of I think persuaded lmq from

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
so it kind of I think persuaded lmq from
not<00:00:49.770> picking<00:00:50.100> syndra<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.730> TSM<00:00:51.270> took<00:00:51.420> at

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
not picking syndra and then TSM took at

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
not picking syndra and then TSM took at
the<00:00:51.600> next<00:00:51.809> rotation<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.129> opinion<00:00:53.219> they

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the next rotation and in my opinion they

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.920 
the next rotation and in my opinion they
won't<00:00:53.670> pick<00:00:53.850> ban<00:00:54.000> phase<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.660> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
won't pick ban phase off of that and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.840 
won't pick ban phase off of that and
let's<00:00:55.289> isolate<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.980> top<00:00:56.219> lane<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.610> already

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
let's isolate the top lane you already

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
let's isolate the top lane you already

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
mentioned the Lulu but I feel like so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.990 
mentioned the Lulu but I feel like so
much<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.710> matchup<00:00:58.949> hinges<00:00:59.640> there<00:00:59.820> on<00:00:59.910> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
much of this matchup hinges there on the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.270 
much of this matchup hinges there on the
top<00:01:00.180> lane<00:01:00.480> because<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.770> watched<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.160> mid

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
then they started focusing later on in

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.870 
then they started focusing later on in
the<00:01:31.590> game<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.220> Bjork<00:01:32.460> she<00:01:32.579> was<00:01:32.700> getting

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.219 
the game and then Bjork she was getting
assists<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> mid<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.540> they<00:01:33.720> spilled<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
assists in the mid and they spilled that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.630 
assists in the mid and they spilled that
over<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> really<00:01:35.070> liked<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.310> play<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
kind of sacrificed the bot lane for a

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.719 
kind of sacrificed the bot lane for a
bit<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.009> worked<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.610> there

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
bit but it worked out for them if there

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
bit but it worked out for them if there
wasn't<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:38.970> huge<00:01:39.270> amount<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.540> pressure<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.960> mean

probably<00:02:21.200> I'm<00:02:21.379> going<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.709> let<00:02:21.799> you<00:02:21.829> take<00:02:22.099> this

one<00:02:22.340> walks<00:02:22.670> through<00:02:22.909> it<00:02:22.999> so<00:02:23.719> this<00:02:23.870> was<00:02:24.019> a

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
one walks through it so this was a

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.839 
one walks through it so this was a
really<00:02:24.230> interesting<00:02:24.319> it<00:02:24.980> looks<00:02:25.189> like<00:02:25.340> lmq

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
really interesting it looks like lmq

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.270 
really interesting it looks like lmq
wants<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.810> defend<00:02:27.109> the<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.709> dragon<00:02:28.069> but

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
wants to defend the the dragon but

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.250 
wants to defend the the dragon but
they're<00:02:28.400> not<00:02:28.609> fully<00:02:28.819> group<00:02:29.090> yet<00:02:29.359> so<00:02:29.719> beer<00:02:30.019> sins

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
they're not fully group yet so beer sins

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.140 
they're not fully group yet so beer sins

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.569 
able to start off the fight by getting
good<00:02:32.450> poke<00:02:32.719> down<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.439> I<00:02:34.040> think<00:02:34.099> right<00:02:34.459> now

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
good poke down and I think right now

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.220 
good poke down and I think right now
amazing<00:02:34.819> head<00:02:35.120> over<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.540> sends<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.870> bit<00:02:36.019> not

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
amazing head over it sends a bit not

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.589 
amazing head over it sends a bit not
realizing<00:02:36.620> how<00:02:36.680> FAR's<00:02:36.920> team<00:02:37.189> is<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:38.450> right

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
realizing how FAR's team is and so right

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.809 
realizing how FAR's team is and so right
now<00:02:38.629> it<00:02:38.810> seems<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.290> little<00:02:39.349> weak<00:02:39.799> there<00:02:39.980> TSM<00:02:40.609> is

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
now it seems a little weak there TSM is

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.179 
now it seems a little weak there TSM is
honestly<00:02:41.180> at<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.659> health<00:02:41.930> disadvantage<00:02:42.469> but

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
honestly at a health disadvantage but

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.679 
honestly at a health disadvantage but
they<00:02:43.430> are<00:02:43.489> able<00:02:43.639> to<00:02:43.849> collapse<00:02:44.060> on<00:02:44.239> Monday<00:02:44.569> and

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
they are able to collapse on Monday and

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.050 
they are able to collapse on Monday and
then<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:46.010> link<00:02:46.159> you<00:02:46.280> just<00:02:46.400> funnels<00:02:46.819> into

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
then that link you just funnels into

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.059 
then that link you just funnels into
that<00:02:47.329> little<00:02:47.510> choke<00:02:47.750> point<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.169> Pearson<00:02:48.950> gets

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
that little choke point and Pearson gets

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.470 
that little choke point and Pearson gets

mundo<00:02:50.750> at<00:02:51.139> this<00:02:51.319> point<00:02:51.469> they're<00:02:51.739> just<00:02:51.919> able<00:02:52.129> to

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.219 
mundo at this point they're just able to

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.439 
mundo at this point they're just able to
turn<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.519> fight<00:02:52.669> and<00:02:52.790> start<00:02:52.969> chasing<00:02:53.150> down

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:53.449 
turn the fight and start chasing down

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.020 
turn the fight and start chasing down
and<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:54.739> best<00:02:54.889> part<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.609> beautiful

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
and the best part is this beautiful

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.390 
and the best part is this beautiful
flash<00:02:56.689> tsunami<00:02:56.989> bubble<00:02:57.409> boom<00:02:57.769> gets<00:02:58.010> poor

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
flash tsunami bubble boom gets poor

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.490 
flash tsunami bubble boom gets poor
people<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:58.939> yeah<00:02:59.120> so<00:02:59.329> follows<00:02:59.689> up<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.169> only

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
people and yeah so follows up the only

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.199 
people and yeah so follows up the only
thing<00:03:00.650> that<00:03:00.799> stopped<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.129> from<00:03:01.400> turning<00:03:01.760> it

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
thing that stopped that from turning it

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.270 
thing that stopped that from turning it
around<00:03:02.359> was<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.989> exhaustion<00:03:03.439> yah<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.829> if<00:03:04.069> they

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
around was the exhaustion yah so if they

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.679 
around was the exhaustion yah so if they
didn't<00:03:04.489> have<00:03:04.579> exhaust<00:03:04.849> for<00:03:04.969> that<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.329> think

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
didn't have exhaust for that I think

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.149 
didn't have exhaust for that I think
that<00:03:05.780> woulda<00:03:05.900> been<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.019> 35<00:03:06.560> turn<00:03:06.769> around<00:03:07.010> and

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
that woulda been a 35 turn around and

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.520 
that woulda been a 35 turn around and
Ellen<00:03:07.489> Keota<00:03:07.790> came<00:03:07.909> out<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.150> top<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:09.079> that's

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
Ellen Keota came out on top and that's

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.439 
Ellen Keota came out on top and that's
that<00:03:09.709> playmaking<00:03:10.099> potential<00:03:10.669> that<00:03:10.760> we<00:03:10.879> see<00:03:11.180> on

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:11.449 
that playmaking potential that we see on

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.319 
that playmaking potential that we see on
Joey's<00:03:12.049> ow<00:03:12.260> but<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:13.280> mundo<00:03:13.639> being<00:03:13.939> relatively

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
Joey's ow but the mundo being relatively

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.929 
Joey's ow but the mundo being relatively
unaffected<00:03:14.629> ineffective<00:03:15.590> rather<00:03:15.799> on<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.489> TP

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
unaffected ineffective rather on that TP

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.670 
unaffected ineffective rather on that TP
whereas<00:03:17.359> when<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:17.689> Lulu<00:03:17.959> came<00:03:18.139> in<00:03:18.349> had<00:03:18.650> that

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
whereas when the Lulu came in had that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.710 
whereas when the Lulu came in had that
ultimate<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.459> keep<00:03:19.669> kha'zix<00:03:20.090> alive<00:03:20.389> there

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
ultimate to keep kha'zix alive there

ultimate to keep kha'zix alive there
which<00:03:21.079> really<00:03:21.290> let<00:03:21.439> them<00:03:21.590> secure<00:03:21.979> that<00:03:22.099> fight

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
which really let them secure that fight

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
banning out the rise we need to put you

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.629 
banning out the rise we need to put you
on<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.840> wave<00:04:15.049> clear<00:04:15.259> champion<00:04:15.739> in<00:04:15.889> case<00:04:16.250> we<00:04:16.519> get

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
on a wave clear champion in case we get

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.759 
on a wave clear champion in case we get
behind<00:04:16.789> early<00:04:17.209> um<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.169> think<00:04:18.199> Corky's

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
behind early um I think Corky's

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.349 
behind early um I think Corky's
supplements<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.519> wave<00:04:19.669> clear<00:04:19.849> a<00:04:19.909> bit

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
supplements the wave clear a bit

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.450 
supplements the wave clear a bit
obviously<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.530> game<00:04:21.739> they're<00:04:22.159> able<00:04:22.279> to

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
obviously in that game they're able to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.950 
obviously in that game they're able to
break<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:22.760> base<00:04:22.940> pretty<00:04:23.389> quickly<00:04:23.630> with

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
break the base pretty quickly with

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.659 
break the base pretty quickly with
cinder<00:04:24.349> sons<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.770> stuff<00:04:24.919> like<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.070> so

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
cinder sons and stuff like that so

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.370 
cinder sons and stuff like that so
between<00:04:26.029> win<00:04:26.330> wall<00:04:26.510> and<00:04:26.779> core

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
between win wall and core

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.410 
between win wall and core
geez<00:04:27.500> waveclear<00:04:27.980> it<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:28.520> wasn't<00:04:29.030> enough<00:04:29.090> and

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
geez waveclear it just wasn't enough and

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.030 
geez waveclear it just wasn't enough and
the<00:04:29.480> second<00:04:29.720> thing<00:04:29.750> lost<00:04:29.990> mid<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.350> hip<00:04:30.470> at

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
the second thing lost mid and hip at

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.590 
the second thing lost mid and hip at
that<00:04:31.250> point<00:04:31.460> they<00:04:31.820> definitely<00:04:32.300> don't<00:04:32.450> have

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
that point they definitely don't have

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.090 
that point they definitely don't have
enough<00:04:32.750> waveclear<00:04:33.050> if<00:04:33.320> they<00:04:33.620> were<00:04:33.680> able<00:04:33.920> to

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
enough waveclear if they were able to

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.070 
enough waveclear if they were able to
stop<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.820> basement<00:04:35.180> being<00:04:35.330> cracked<00:04:35.570> I<00:04:35.780> think

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
stop the basement being cracked I think

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.420 
stop the basement being cracked I think
Corky<00:04:36.350> could<00:04:36.530> kind<00:04:36.680> of<00:04:36.710> extend<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.190> but<00:04:37.370> the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
Corky could kind of extend it but the

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.280 
Corky could kind of extend it but the
second<00:04:37.670> base<00:04:37.820> is<00:04:37.970> correct<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.750> was<00:04:38.930> very

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
second base is correct it was very

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.180 
second base is correct it was very
obvious<00:04:39.470> they<00:04:39.710> didn't<00:04:39.920> have<00:04:40.010> enough

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
obvious they didn't have enough

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.770 
obvious they didn't have enough
waveclear<00:04:40.520> for<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.000> at<00:04:41.330> that<00:04:41.450> point<00:04:41.600> is

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
waveclear for it and at that point is

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.050 
waveclear for it and at that point is
just<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:42.740> know<00:04:42.860> TSM<00:04:43.370> could<00:04:43.640> just<00:04:43.790> win<00:04:44.030> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
just you know TSM could just win the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.880 
just you know TSM could just win the
game<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.510> that's<00:04:44.810> when<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:44.990> saw<00:04:45.110> lmq<00:04:45.620> doing

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
game and that's when you saw lmq doing

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.770 
game and that's when you saw lmq doing
that<00:04:46.040> kind<00:04:46.220> of<00:04:46.340> sneaky<00:04:46.880> engage<00:04:47.300> from<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.600> left

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
that kind of sneaky engage from the left

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.930 
that kind of sneaky engage from the left
side<00:04:47.930> because<00:04:48.440> they<00:04:48.590> knew<00:04:48.770> if<00:04:49.010> TSM<00:04:49.700> gotten

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
side because they knew if TSM gotten

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.460 
side because they knew if TSM gotten
position<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.330> start<00:04:50.450> see<00:04:50.660> gene<00:04:50.840> they<00:04:51.230> won't<00:04:51.410> be

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
position to start see gene they won't be

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.410 
position to start see gene they won't be
able<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.680> stop<00:04:51.830> it<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.190> czars<00:04:52.670> Irenee<00:04:53.120> pointed

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
able to stop it and czars Irenee pointed

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.120 
able to stop it and czars Irenee pointed
out<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.960> because<00:04:54.350> of<00:04:54.530> their<00:04:54.650> lack<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:54.860> wave

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
out that because of their lack of wave

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.070 
out that because of their lack of wave
clear<00:04:55.430> in<00:04:55.670> those<00:04:56.090> times<00:04:56.120> they<00:04:56.630> needed<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.900> look

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
clear in those times they needed to look

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.970 
clear in those times they needed to look
for<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.290> team<00:04:57.440> fight<00:04:57.620> so<00:04:57.770> we're<00:04:57.890> actually

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
for the team fight so we're actually

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.200 
for the team fight so we're actually
gonna<00:04:58.160> pull<00:04:58.250> up<00:04:58.460> another<00:04:58.550> replay<00:04:58.880> because<00:04:59.030> we

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
gonna pull up another replay because we

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.450 
gonna pull up another replay because we
have<00:04:59.390> to<00:04:59.510> look<00:04:59.600> at<00:04:59.720> this<00:04:59.840> the<00:05:00.320> pentakill<00:05:00.860> from

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
have to look at this the pentakill from

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.430 
have to look at this the pentakill from
joe<00:05:01.730> is<00:05:01.910> out<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.360> although<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.990> wasn't<00:05:03.170> enough

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
joe is out and although it wasn't enough

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.480 
joe is out and although it wasn't enough
to<00:05:03.590> turn<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.860> game<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.190> is<00:05:04.310> pretty

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
to turn the game it is pretty

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
to turn the game it is pretty
spectacular<00:05:04.670> I'll<00:05:05.060> let<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.240> take<00:05:05.360> this<00:05:05.450> one

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
spectacular I'll let you take this one

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.150 
spectacular I'll let you take this one
away<00:05:05.630> all<00:05:05.990> right<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.350> last<00:05:06.560> replay<00:05:06.920> we<00:05:07.130> saw

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
away all right so the last replay we saw

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.830 
away all right so the last replay we saw
their<00:05:07.580> exact<00:05:07.970> there's<00:05:08.150> an<00:05:08.210> exhaust<00:05:08.480> that<00:05:08.630> came

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
their exact there's an exhaust that came

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.240 
their exact there's an exhaust that came
down<00:05:08.990> it's<00:05:09.200> not<00:05:09.440> up<00:05:09.650> this<00:05:09.830> time<00:05:10.040> so<00:05:10.190> we'll

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
down it's not up this time so we'll

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.860 
down it's not up this time so we'll
start<00:05:10.430> rolling<00:05:10.760> the<00:05:10.850> clip<00:05:11.030> out<00:05:11.150> here<00:05:11.390> we<00:05:11.690> see

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
start rolling the clip out here we see

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.290 
start rolling the clip out here we see
no<00:05:12.110> name<00:05:12.290> try<00:05:12.890> to<00:05:12.950> go<00:05:13.310> for<00:05:13.790> an<00:05:13.850> insect<00:05:14.180> play

series<00:06:48.560> adaptations<00:06:49.190> is<00:06:49.370> it<00:06:49.490> enough<00:06:49.790> for<00:06:49.820> them

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
series adaptations is it enough for them

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.480 
series adaptations is it enough for them
to<00:06:50.180> come<00:06:50.510> in<00:06:50.570> third<00:06:51.380> game<00:06:51.620> and<00:06:51.650> break<00:06:52.310> that

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
to come in third game and break that

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.510 
to come in third game and break that
trend<00:06:52.790> of<00:06:53.000> blue<00:06:53.180> side<00:06:53.420> winning<00:06:54.400> I'm<00:06:55.400> gonna

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
trend of blue side winning I'm gonna

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.550 
trend of blue side winning I'm gonna
have<00:06:55.640> to<00:06:55.700> go<00:06:55.760> with<00:06:55.940> lmq<00:06:56.330> on<00:06:56.510> this<00:06:56.900> one<00:06:57.050> I<00:06:57.230> think

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
have to go with lmq on this one I think

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.020 
have to go with lmq on this one I think
that<00:06:57.710> the<00:06:58.100> fact<00:06:58.370> that<00:06:58.460> they're<00:06:58.610> gonna<00:06:58.700> be<00:06:58.820> blue

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
that the fact that they're gonna be blue

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.940 
that the fact that they're gonna be blue
side<00:06:59.270> again<00:06:59.570> and<00:06:59.780> they<00:06:59.990> ban<00:07:00.170> rise<00:07:00.470> last<00:07:00.740> time

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
side again and they ban rise last time

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.890 
side again and they ban rise last time
so<00:07:01.340> they<00:07:01.460> get<00:07:01.700> themselves<00:07:01.910> to<00:07:02.480> ban<00:07:02.720> outlet

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
so they get themselves to ban outlet

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.540 
so they get themselves to ban outlet
syndrome<00:07:03.260> once<00:07:03.770> again<00:07:03.980> so<00:07:04.100> Pearson<00:07:04.430> won't

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
syndrome once again so Pearson won't

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.250 
syndrome once again so Pearson won't
have<00:07:04.670> that<00:07:04.700> champion<00:07:05.210> and<00:07:05.360> then<00:07:05.810> that<00:07:05.930> puts<00:07:06.140> it

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:06.260 
have that champion and then that puts it

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.040 
have that champion and then that puts it
on<00:07:06.350> TSM<00:07:06.890> to<00:07:07.280> really<00:07:07.580> make<00:07:07.790> an<00:07:08.000> adaptation<00:07:08.360> in

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
on TSM to really make an adaptation in

this series so I think I'm gonna have to

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.500 
this series so I think I'm gonna have to
go<00:07:11.000> with<00:07:11.180> lmq<00:07:11.570> here<00:07:11.750> probably<00:07:12.580> mmm<00:07:13.580> I'm<00:07:14.180> just

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:14.510 
go with lmq here probably mmm I'm just

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.600 
go with lmq here probably mmm I'm just
here<00:07:14.840> to<00:07:14.870> piss<00:07:15.320> off<00:07:15.470> Cyrene<00:07:15.920> so<00:07:16.160> I'm<00:07:16.310> gonna<00:07:16.490> go

here to piss off Cyrene so I'm gonna go

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.640 
here to piss off Cyrene so I'm gonna go
with<00:07:16.730> TSM<00:07:17.180> i<00:07:17.390> think<00:07:17.750> i<00:07:17.870> got<00:07:18.020> it<00:07:18.080> i<00:07:18.320> do<00:07:18.380> think

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
with TSM i think i got it i do think

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.290 
with TSM i think i got it i do think
blue<00:07:18.890> sides<00:07:19.130> really<00:07:19.460> advantageous<00:07:19.760> in<00:07:20.210> this

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 
blue sides really advantageous in this

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.450 
blue sides really advantageous in this
matchup<00:07:20.510> just<00:07:21.140> because<00:07:21.350> of<00:07:21.380> the<00:07:21.830> top<00:07:22.100> laners

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460 
matchup just because of the top laners

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.640 
matchup just because of the top laners
they<00:07:22.640> need<00:07:22.790> a<00:07:22.820> playmaker<00:07:23.030> and<00:07:23.420> then<00:07:23.870> mid<00:07:24.470> lane

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
they need a playmaker and then mid lane

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.050 
they need a playmaker and then mid lane
you<00:07:24.860> got<00:07:24.980> a<00:07:25.010> ban<00:07:25.220> on<00:07:25.370> said<00:07:25.550> you<00:07:25.670> got<00:07:25.820> to<00:07:25.940> get

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
you got a ban on said you got to get

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.810 
you got a ban on said you got to get
syndra<00:07:26.420> so<00:07:26.900> i<00:07:27.290> think<00:07:27.470> TSM<00:07:28.190> has<00:07:28.220> an<00:07:28.520> advantage

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:28.820 
syndra so i think TSM has an advantage

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.820 
syndra so i think TSM has an advantage
because<00:07:29.120> they<00:07:29.510> just<00:07:29.690> boom<00:07:30.380> they<00:07:30.530> won<00:07:30.680> that

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
because they just boom they won that

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.260 
because they just boom they won that
last<00:07:30.980> game<00:07:31.160> and<00:07:31.400> they're<00:07:31.490> ready<00:07:31.640> to<00:07:31.730> just<00:07:31.970> go

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
last game and they're ready to just go

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.090 
last game and they're ready to just go
hard<00:07:32.480> for<00:07:32.600> the<00:07:32.690> next<00:07:32.720> enclose<00:07:33.680> it<00:07:33.710> out<00:07:33.920> and

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.100 
hard for the next enclose it out and

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.580 
hard for the next enclose it out and
blue<00:07:34.520> side<00:07:34.730> has<00:07:35.000> won<00:07:35.390> every<00:07:35.630> game<00:07:35.990> so<00:07:36.350> far<00:07:36.470> in

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590 
blue side has won every game so far in

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.470 
blue side has won every game so far in
the<00:07:36.680> series<00:07:36.860> so<00:07:37.010> we'll<00:07:37.130> see<00:07:37.310> if<00:07:37.340> TSM<00:07:37.910> is<00:07:38.120> able

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:38.480 
the series so we'll see if TSM is able

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.960 
the series so we'll see if TSM is able
to<00:07:38.630> break<00:07:38.990> that<00:07:39.260> trend<00:07:39.680> but<00:07:40.400> for<00:07:40.610> now<00:07:40.700> we're

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:40.970
