00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:49.000 
make a change to that baseline I'm going
to<00:01:39.600> delete<00:01:39.930> these<00:01:40.320> three<00:01:40.800> notes<00:01:41.450> gone

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.890 

I'm<00:01:50.010> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> also<00:01:50.790> delete<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.360> little<00:01:51.630> bass
