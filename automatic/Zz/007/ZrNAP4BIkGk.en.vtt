00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.179
 hello to all guys today as from 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.030
 request from my fans on the page 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.190
 facebook we have fan tutorial 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.869
 at the freshman's pressure then vi 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.939
 I invite you to like the page 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.910
 facebook you will find the link below 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.680
 to suggest tutorials and to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 keep you updated on the less videos that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.849
 they will come out on what I do what is not done 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.679
 in short, it is also a nice way to keep oneself 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 in contact and to see when they come out 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.750
 new videos before others 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 let's go immediately to see the feng flash 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.219
 I show it a couple of times with i 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.190
 dossier with faces and then I go there to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.370
 explain so we have a fan with 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.930
 face with backs and so we have a 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.140
 fan with ok faces and see that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.079
 the cards are stretched and then fanned 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.620
 in a very very homogeneous way while 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:08.040
 with the fan with the thumb happens 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.680
 that some decks do not allow to do 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.420
 come a good fan has a good one 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.180
 mental or normal then those with the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
 thumb with pressure fans up 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.799
 facilitated because it is with decks 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.200
 plasticized with those a little more 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.939
 hard or in short with almost all types of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.340
 I don't want to say the Modiano bunches now 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.650
 but with almost all types of decks 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.490
 you will be able to make a fan more or 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.930
 less homogeneous and good everything depends on 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.540
 how do you apply pressure if you know 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.460
 the accordion this one shooting at 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.840
 Finger cards would be facilitated 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.720
 because all that is the fan a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.720
 pressure is an accordion excuse the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.119
 disturb an accordion though performed 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.579
 the lateral if you see it now executes it from the 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.439
 on the contrary, even I approach a little way 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.320
 certainly on fire here 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.950
 ok you see that the cards are fired 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.130
 one by one 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.320
 however to the ok side now you are not a 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.409
 look at the shape of the fan though 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.750
 the latomia of the move is this the cards 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.810
 they are fired one by one 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.430
 so i do it again it also feels 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.970
 just ok 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.240
 and meanwhile the hand moves sideways 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.160
 let's go back here let's see now 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.650
 the handle the right hand onwards 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.440
 in the cards with the middle ring index 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.140
 above and thumb on the short inner side 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.880
 near the right corner 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.690
 the left hand takes with the usual 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.760
 two index and middle fingers below and the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.459
 thumb does not go on this corner but it goes 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.830
 or centrally or next to each other 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.660
 inch anyway to perform a 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.709
 normal fan we say what my 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.810
 position 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.410
 ok see before running the fan 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.209
 I what water do move location 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.780
 a bit the deck then the corner of 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.270
 let's say 45 degrees in such a way that from 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.440
 below you took it so I do it 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.430
 see with this deck because you 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.489
 see it through this e 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.640
 the handle the fingers go here thumb 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.230
 close another thumb move the deck in 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.420
 this way then the index will be 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.420
 on the corner the medium slightly outside e 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.220
 then the fan began but pressure 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.540
 let's go back to the normal boulder 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.390
 ok from here tac rotate and crush against 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.860
 the two fingers thumb and thumb index 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.459
 and middle of the left hand 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.560
 the deck in this way I fold it ok 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.959
 thanks to thumb pressure e 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.910
 these three fingers of the right hand 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.310
 see the deck folds like this 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.269
 and then you have to start the accordion 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.130
 then shoot the cards a dune from the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.160
 fingers I recommend not by the thumb are 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.950
 absolutely nothing comes out 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.269
 shoot out a dune cards and turn around 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.090
 the hand in the side 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.660
 many will have problems closing 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.760
 of the fan I have had too 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.410
 because you will have problems or less back 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.320
 which he found and this after when 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.180
 I came here this guy happened to me 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.690
 deck came a spread so this 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.590
 it was a bit disgusting 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.269
 then sucks with training anyway 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.760
 it will come out because any move 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.110
 most beautiful boys born more comes out 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.960
 better always better and always better 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.610
 so train so much though 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.560
 one advice I give you is to 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.040
 think of the three companies on the fingers 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.070
 there is a certain inch as a space 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.520
 space when you go between the three fingers e 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.770
 the thumb when you finish the fan 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:48.880
 the space must be reduced to this from here 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.520
 here because the fingers and the thumb are 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.510
 getting closer and closer 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.220
 as I go to follow the 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.020
 fan the thumbs are approaching 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.760
 more and more always more than always 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.710
 more crushes and crushes crushes yes 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.900
 they approach approach until they do 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.750
 come to the end the fingers leaves them 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.330
 go and get right to touch the 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.070
 thumb then fan twenty years i 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.260
 fan fans let go of the fingers 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.200
 so that they do not touch the thumb you see 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.780
 now I 'm in contact to conclude 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.570
 just in a circular way this has me 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:23.470
 helped fingers of water turn around does a little 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.840
 this movement the hand from here to here from 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.020
 in front you will see only the four fingers 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:36.330
 covering the deck at the end in this 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:40.750
 so you see it pressure ok deck move 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.790
 pressure on the fingers and then I conclude 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.890
 if today's tutorial was helpful 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.090
 if you have learned to make a fan a 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.890
 pressure thanks to this tutorial 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.630
 maybe put an answer video here 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.340
 below to show me that you succeeded 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.130
 maybe he could n't do it to you before 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.669
 succeeds thanks me yen and put a nice me 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.320
 like it and the next no I 'm saying 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.780
 to the 120 lay people comes to the next 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.050
 tutorial now of this series between the 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.410
 blooms and forces those like the video of 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:11.350
 quick tips because 150 comes the other 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:13.780
 video on kit tips and nothing and not me 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.510
 it remains to tell you that soon the 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.390
 initial and sign up and I recommend it 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.870
 always a commentary that makes me happy 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.870
 bye Bye
