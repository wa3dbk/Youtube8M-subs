working with Siemens on some of the
electrical<00:00:40.350> systems<00:00:41.059> Siemens<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> company

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
electrical systems Siemens is a company

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.799 
electrical systems Siemens is a company
with<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:43.489> hundred<00:00:44.489> years<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.760> history<00:00:44.910> working

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
with a hundred years of history working

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.959 
with a hundred years of history working
with<00:00:45.899> electrical<00:00:46.200> machines<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.700> um

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
with electrical machines but it's um

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
with electrical machines but it's um
it's<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:48.899> big<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> automotive<00:00:49.770> space

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it's not big in the automotive space

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.459 
it's not big in the automotive space
whereas<00:00:50.629> Volvo<00:00:51.629> obviously<00:00:52.079> knows<00:00:52.230> how<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
whereas Volvo obviously knows how to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.830 
whereas Volvo obviously knows how to
build<00:00:52.590> cars<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.309> doesn't<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.300> quite<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
build cars that doesn't have quite the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.160 
build cars that doesn't have quite the
same<00:00:55.170> expertise<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:56.190> building<00:00:56.460> electric<00:00:56.850> cars

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
same expertise of building electric cars

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.119 
same expertise of building electric cars
so<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> two<00:00:58.440> companies<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:58.859> working

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so the two companies are working

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.819 
so the two companies are working
together<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.489> try<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.649> productionize<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
together to try and productionize the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.189 
together to try and productionize the
technologies<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.430> they'll<00:01:02.879> need<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:04.049> full

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
technologies that they'll need for full

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.039 
technologies that they'll need for full
electric<00:01:04.710> production<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.430> drove<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.630> first

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
electric production I drove the first

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
electric production I drove the first
generation<00:01:07.619> c30<00:01:08.310> electric<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.909> couple<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
generation c30 electric a couple of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
generation c30 electric a couple of
years<00:01:09.360> ago<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.320> second<00:01:10.650> generation<00:01:10.680> is

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
years ago and this second generation is

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.510 
years ago and this second generation is
really<00:01:11.280> quite<00:01:11.880> similar<00:01:12.180> behind<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> wheel

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
really quite similar behind the wheel

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.710 
really quite similar behind the wheel
it's<00:01:14.520> got<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:15.240> power<00:01:15.479> than

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it's got a little bit more power than

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
it's got a little bit more power than
the<00:01:15.840> previous<00:01:16.229> generation<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.159> 120

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the previous generation this is 120

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.929 
the previous generation this is 120
horsepower<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.689> previous<00:01:19.020> version<00:01:19.290> 110<00:01:19.939> it's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
horsepower the previous version 110 it's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
horsepower the previous version 110 it's
not<00:01:21.060> really<00:01:21.330> something<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:21.930> protect

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
not really something you can protect

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.929 
not really something you can protect
from<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> woman<00:01:23.159> behind<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> wheel<00:01:23.670> they

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
from the woman behind the wheel they

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.719 
from the woman behind the wheel they
feel<00:01:24.240> very<00:01:24.720> similar<00:01:25.170> both<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.310> them<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.580> very

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
feel very similar both of them are very

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
feel very similar both of them are very
well<00:01:27.000> sorted<00:01:27.479> cars<00:01:27.720> they're<00:01:27.990> very<00:01:28.170> smooth<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
well sorted cars they're very smooth to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.359 
well sorted cars they're very smooth to
drive<00:01:29.090> very<00:01:30.090> easy<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.630> drive<00:01:30.840> around<00:01:31.110> town<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
drive very easy to drive around town and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.499 
drive very easy to drive around town and
actually<00:01:33.329> quite<00:01:33.540> speedy

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.149 

it's<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.600> shame<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:37.869> Volvo<00:01:38.259> haven't<00:01:38.920> really

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
it's a shame that Volvo haven't really

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.889 
it's a shame that Volvo haven't really
sorted<00:01:39.520> out<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.759> business<00:01:39.939> model<00:01:40.119> yet<00:01:40.600> that

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
sorted out the business model yet that

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.929 
sorted out the business model yet that
would<00:01:41.020> let<00:01:41.500> them<00:01:41.649> put<00:01:41.890> an<00:01:42.100> electric<00:01:42.579> car<00:01:42.759> like

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
would let them put an electric car like

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.469 
would let them put an electric car like
this<00:01:43.060> electric<00:01:43.479> c30<00:01:43.920> into<00:01:44.920> production<00:01:45.479> for

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
this electric c30 into production for

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.669 
this electric c30 into production for
the<00:01:46.539> moment<00:01:46.869> this<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.170> small<00:01:47.500> volume

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
the moment this is a small volume

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.889 
the moment this is a small volume
production<00:01:48.549> they're<00:01:49.030> making<00:01:49.270> 100<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.780> this

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
production they're making 100 of this

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.800 
production they're making 100 of this
second<00:01:50.229> generation<00:01:50.259> car<00:01:50.920> they<00:01:51.579> made<00:01:51.789> 250<00:01:52.539> of

can they produce it make money out of it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.949 
can they produce it make money out of it
is<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.580> business<00:02:12.880> model<00:02:13.150> there<00:02:13.329> so<00:02:13.630> those<00:02:13.780> are

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
is the business model there so those are

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.440 
is the business model there so those are
the<00:02:14.019> questions<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.440> they<00:02:14.590> need<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.829> answer
