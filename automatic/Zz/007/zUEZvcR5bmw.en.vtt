00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
anyway so yeah reliable yams was nice

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.160 
anyway so yeah reliable yams was nice
enough<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.160> give<00:00:11.309> me<00:00:11.519> AK<00:00:12.090> 101<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.990> would

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
enough to give me AK 101 it would

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.890 
enough to give me AK 101 it would
probably<00:00:13.380> never<00:00:13.530> found<00:00:13.769> about<00:00:13.950> myself<00:00:14.130> cuz

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
probably never found about myself cuz

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.990 
probably never found about myself cuz
bandit<00:00:15.900> looking<00:00:16.199> at<00:00:16.260> things<00:00:16.699> well<00:00:17.699> yeah<00:00:17.820> it's

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
bandit looking at things well yeah it's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.400 
bandit looking at things well yeah it's
like<00:00:18.180> an<00:00:19.140> AK<00:00:19.439> 74<00:00:19.800> chambered<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.640> 55<00:00:21.300> 645<00:00:22.140> NATO

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
like an AK 74 chambered for 55 645 NATO

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.900 
like an AK 74 chambered for 55 645 NATO
rounds<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.010> shoots<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> same<00:00:23.490> rounds<00:00:23.789> as

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
rounds so it shoots the same rounds as

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.349 
rounds so it shoots the same rounds as
the<00:00:24.060> m4<00:00:25.160> so<00:00:26.160> I'm<00:00:26.460> gonna<00:00:26.580> assume<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.240> only

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
the m4 so I'm gonna assume you can only

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.900 
the m4 so I'm gonna assume you can only
find<00:00:27.630> ammo<00:00:27.869> at<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.320> crash<00:00:28.769> sites<00:00:29.130> i<00:00:29.460> think<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
find ammo at the crash sites i think the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
find ammo at the crash sites i think the
magazine<00:00:30.480> should<00:00:30.929> spawn<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> military

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
magazine should spawn a military

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
magazine should spawn a military
locations<00:00:32.369> though<00:00:32.489> along<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:32.910> weapon<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
locations though along with weapon to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.080 
locations though along with weapon to
this<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> military<00:00:34.410> spawn<00:00:35.030> before<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
this can be a military spawn before the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.220 
this can be a military spawn before the
ammo<00:00:36.360> you're<00:00:36.510> probably<00:00:36.690> gonna<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
ammo you're probably gonna have to go to

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.049 
ammo you're probably gonna have to go to
a<00:00:37.350> crash<00:00:37.649> site<00:00:37.890> i'm<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.190> assume<00:00:38.340> i<00:00:38.820> can't

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
a crash site i'm gonna assume i can't

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.709 
a crash site i'm gonna assume i can't
confirm<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.480> though<00:00:39.950> but<00:00:40.950> yet<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> use

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
confirm that though but yet can the use

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
confirm that though but yet can the use
mostly<00:00:43.110> ATM<00:00:43.680> attachments<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> i<00:00:44.309> think<00:00:44.579> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
mostly ATM attachments to i think you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
mostly ATM attachments to i think you
use<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> am<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.420> stack<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.960> gonna<00:00:46.320> place<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
use the am but stack and gonna place the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.819 
use the am but stack and gonna place the
RAS<00:00:47.039> real<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.719> PSO<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.200> school<00:00:49.500> so

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
RAS real on it and a PSO one school so

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.740 
RAS real on it and a PSO one school so
it's<00:00:50.039> basically<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:52.640> like<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.850> an<00:00:54.000> m4<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
it's basically like like like an m4 a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.250 
it's basically like like like an m4 a
