00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.059
 the program 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.710
 look old 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 here is the molding was rust 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.310
 this part 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.480
 all etched primed on the highway 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.480
 need to locally under the edge 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:38.079
 mated and all 1000 transition here roller 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.710
 three thousandth roller captivity and so 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.680
 maximum area 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.790
 in line with them on the label just a little bit 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 genuinely to 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.820
 opel you could not get there 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.940
 Alla Korbut about this post and all. 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.859
 Nalchik 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.949
 degreased before roller 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.270
 glued then one more width otherwise 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.120
 divorces here on 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.760
 Balakovo 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.700
 and such an important factor before 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.290
 how do we start painting it to go 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.140
 exactly 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.330
 if the whole red cross were alone 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.970
 case breeding 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.610
 in this case, the breeding base goes a little 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.090
 slightly thinner than full fungus for 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.690
 affairs for one simple reason so that all 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.450
 grain which will break itself 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.450
 the grain there does not change its 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 thickness 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.850
 filler that carries this grain 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.630
 so that he was as small as possible so as not to 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.090
 it was shagreen on the paint itself 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.590
 either do this pressure raise to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.900
 broke better but then 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.820
 the grain will become and 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.780
 will stand it will be different color 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.830
 immediately visible 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.940
 so we dilute the paint thinner and 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.070
 pressure 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.020
 and twos as it should be there 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.640
 182 and what limits are looking for sheltering all 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.840
 and finger 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.840
 to have a thin layer 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.730
 pray 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.680
 machine tools 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.680
 8 new building 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.220
 replacement 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.220
 did 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.090
 amagami ss 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.090
 will consider 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.539
 she is 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.160
 finished result 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.320
 he Felt more 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.320
 own paint nozzle ass 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.880
 maiden grove 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.880
 kiss 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.980
 and most importantly that 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.400
 by arrival 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.400
 kitchens 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.220
 really 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.199
 so 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.000
 difficulties 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.280
 to go on silver 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.330
 you do nâ€™t have any 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.909
 I don't know why but 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.110
 don't be afraid go silver and yes 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.969
 generally for silver 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.009
 button but complicated 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:02.319
 if you do everything correctly complexity 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.319
 no hope from another
