a<00:00:24.180> lot<00:00:24.300> more<00:00:24.330> sense<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.500> basically<00:00:25.830> run

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
a lot more sense you just basically run

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.439 
a lot more sense you just basically run
through<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.640> if<00:00:26.789> they're<00:00:27.090> too<00:00:27.300> powerful

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449

through it and if they're too powerful
of<00:00:27.810> an<00:00:27.900> enemy<00:00:28.019> they'll<00:00:28.320> probably<00:00:28.500> stop<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.010> uh

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810
