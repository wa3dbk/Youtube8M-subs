00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 save a good range as you already 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.259
 You must know why it was news in Brazil. 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.210
 and throughout the world, Nintendo has 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.910
 about making matches for 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.820
 smartphones and tablets as well know the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.680
 Nintendo only make games for the consoles 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.420
 unique but today 's day of 7 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.670
 March was announced by the president 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.279
 satoru the attack and nintendo signed a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 partnership with company inss company 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.750
 It is not very known here in Brazil but 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.220
 She is a giant company in Japan. 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.349
 owner of the social 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.239
 moby dick development is a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.520
 platform where developers of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.469
 android and ea can provide 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.600
 their developments so that the other 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.550
 people download the mobile that has more 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.460
 of 30 million users and it encompasses 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 a huge part of the mobile games of the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.500
 with this partnership had not even been 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.980
 free to use the franchises of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.930
 nintendo as mario zelda metroid and all 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.760
 the library of Nintendo in project 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.480
 development for smartphones and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.789
 tablets 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.239
 in return the nintendo stayed with 10% of the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.280
 dna and ethiene shares were left with 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 that a point 2 percent of the shares of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.840
 the two slices are equivalent to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.610
 same thing somewhere around 200 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.159
 million dollars summing up nintendo 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.400
 gave the green light for mario zelda 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.799
 metroid are all on smartphones and 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 tablets by the hands of the hyena and a 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.549
 extremely competent company in that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.020
 branch or, roughly speaking, we have two 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.869
 developing companies 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.240
 of nintendo franchises on smartphones 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.090
 and tablets because this news is so 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.280
 first obvious because it has 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.740
 a company that knows how to make games for 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.610
 consoles is the nintendo nintendo 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.680
 3ds and the ds and the game boys are not there 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.329
 let me lie sony never got 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.090
 To Make A Laptop Avenge More Than One 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.600
 Nintendo has always dominated the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 portable consoles then it is presumed 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.570
 that it will bring this quality to 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.490
 smartphones and tablets 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.649
 The second major reason for this is 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 great news is that we will have more 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.420
 nintendo franchise games more 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.450
 games that many more people will power 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.000
 play so the fan April and immensely 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.369
 people were already throwing 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.080
 nintendo now a game 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.090
 even more so now they're going to play 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.640
 in smartphones practically today 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.709
 anyone has a smartphone capable 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.840
 to run a game on good quality without 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.180
 tell we're talking about the market 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.040
 smartphones a market that has 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.560
 very little time and that in this 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.319
 very little time the game library 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.769
 is already larger than the library of all 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.450
 the video game consoles launched in the 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.329
 story ie we will have more games 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.030
 of nintendo to play with more people 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.190
 And my God, what I did here and of course 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.349
 we must not forget our 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.940
 concerns about this project. 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.400
 we must also remember that Nintendo 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.709
 sometimes you do not help yourself to nintendo either 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.810
 began is meant the fruits of 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.459
 its often conservative policy 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.560
 not many details have yet 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.959
 this partnership has not yet been clear 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.060
 games will be developed and how they 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.400
 shall be made available to the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.739
 knowing nintendo is not any 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.530
 absurd to think that nintendo suddenly 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.599
 will launch a specific smartphone to 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.720
 run your games and neither is it 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.370
 absurd to think that maybe she will 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.560
 invent a new operating system 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.480
 to rival android is to 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.940
 able to run their games that would be 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.590
 operating system exclusive 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.379
 thing that worries a bit is with 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.060
 relation to the games here in brazil as 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.129
 we already know nintendo 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.870
 ended its activities here in the 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.970
 Brazil does not have a distributor anymore 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.040
 here in the country we have to 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.230
 import the nintendo games then we 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.629
 We do not know your games will be 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.400
 available at google's virtual stores 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.590
 of the time you can ask our 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.530
 absurd a store is not available 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.970
 virtual happens the moby of the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.699
 company that I spoke to recently and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.410
 not available on our play goal 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.709
 is available only from united states 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.419
 japan if i'm not mistaken china and more 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.519
 few other countries here in the 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:04.430
 Brazil we can not download the mobile from 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.410
 on our android and nintendo shut down 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.060
 Your activities in Brazil I do not know until 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.310
 How much will this interfere with 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.260
 distribution of the game and even if the 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.269
 games are not distributed here in the 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.310
 Brazil, I can not tell you 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.930
 that difficulty would be to import a 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.160
 I play this game because I never cared 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.440
 a game 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.780
 but I do not know how difficult or whether it is 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.550
 possible to get a game from a store 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.990
 virtual from another country I do not know 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.770
 honestly I do not know 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.750
 and of course all this is supposition 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.790
 no one can crucify does not understand 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.650
 reasons to be crucified so far 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.780
 all she did was give us flowers 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.940
 chocolate can reach us and say 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.040
 Yes we are officially starting to 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.750
 make games for smartphones and tablets 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.940
 and this is it they did not give any more 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.030
 detail this is all supposition of mine 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.310
 I did not come any site, but let's agree 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.460
 I have my reasons to think something. 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.110
 These are not nintendo nintendo but it's like 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.420
 I said now all we know is that 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.760
 we will have for smartphones knowing 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.740
 The day is not even 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.870
 android developers like the diary 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.970
 this is very likely they will vote 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.310
 for this possibility to play games and 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.830
 android and west the nintendo come to want 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.360
 restrict your audience and for now 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.910
 moment we have to do 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.370
 celebrate because we will have 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.080
 she will have metroid we will have father and mother 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.780
 we will have any other franchise you 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.920
 want and that Nintendo wants to make a 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.590
 game for smarphones imagined something of the 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.360
 type the pok√©mon game of your smartphone 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.040
