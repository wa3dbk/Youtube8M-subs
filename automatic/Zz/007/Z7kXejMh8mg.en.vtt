 either lamb I have about a kilo 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.650
 Well, in fact there is less than a kilogram 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.460
 except for 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.970
 the bone itself is now you and I 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.180
 beef pour water and salted well all 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.609
 water scored so that's a lot 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.130
 because we do it all weighs 1 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.170
 kilogram as I told you when we 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.840
 pull the level we fall plus a pair 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.059

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.050
 there solim add a tablespoon of salt 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.440
 no slide 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.239
 and at the end when we have everything 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.820
 get ready to try on 40 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.420
 add or not so we still 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.219
 we will need three bulbs 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:00.480
 these are the small one tomatoes 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:03.019
 so garlic 200 grams of rice is required 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.600
 seasoning hops suneli 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.119
 surely it is there that edema can be 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.390
 pain when roasting slightly add salt 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.180
 Well, be sure to walnut 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.659
 you have 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.420
 coffee grinder like this can be crushed 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.119
 crayon if there is no you can cute stone and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.979
