00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
that free which is a nice thought but

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.720 
that free which is a nice thought but
I'm<00:01:24.530> not<00:01:24.860> trying<00:01:25.010> to<00:01:25.160> make<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.400> sad<00:01:25.610> or

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.730 
I'm not trying to make you sad or
anything<00:01:25.820> but<00:01:26.270> I'd<00:01:26.720> like<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.080> face<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.410> facts

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
anything but I'd like to face the facts

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.720 
anything but I'd like to face the facts
about<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.030> pipe<00:01:29.210> free<00:01:29.420> will<00:01:29.810> close<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.730> I

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
about the pipe free will close and I

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.490 
about the pipe free will close and I
think<00:01:31.940> there's<00:01:32.150> nothing<00:01:32.480> we<00:01:32.630> can<00:01:32.750> do<00:01:32.900> do<00:01:33.260> about

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
think there's nothing we can do do about

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.130 
think there's nothing we can do do about
it<00:01:33.710> because<00:01:34.340> EA<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:34.910> not<00:01:35.120> earning<00:01:35.810> enough

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
it because EA is not earning enough

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.830 
it because EA is not earning enough
money<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.800> therefore<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:38.240> not<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.510> good

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
money and therefore is not a good

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.910 
money and therefore is not a good
investment<00:01:39.140> for<00:01:39.410> you

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
investment for you

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.990

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
and even though battlefield play free

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.550 
and even though battlefield play free
got<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.300> bugs<00:01:45.450> got<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> lot<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> involved

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560

playing<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.159> game<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.869> think<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.050> have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
playing this game I think we all have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.930 
playing this game I think we all have
tried<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.650> think<00:01:59.009> optimistic<00:01:59.550> in<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.670> past

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
tried to do think optimistic in the past

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.310 
tried to do think optimistic in the past
about<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.690> game<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.360> hoping<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.229> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
about this game and and hoping that it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.520 
about this game and and hoping that it
won't<00:02:04.470> die<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.220> and<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:06.000> closed<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.290> course

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
won't die in and be closed but of course

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.340 
won't die in and be closed but of course
I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.800> we<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.160> kind<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.489> saw<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:10.080> end

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
I think we all kind of saw this this end

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.180 
I think we all kind of saw this this end
coming<00:02:10.679> quite<00:02:11.520> slowly<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.739> personally<00:02:13.739> it's

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
