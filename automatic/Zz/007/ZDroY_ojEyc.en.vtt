until the collectors get here so what we
do<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.750> set<00:00:21.900> about<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.230> four<00:00:22.500> high<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.859> kind

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
do is we set about on four high we kind

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.820 
do is we set about on four high we kind
of<00:00:23.100> hide<00:00:23.250> them<00:00:23.430> until<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> event<00:00:23.970> starts<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
as people come in we can estimate

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.269
