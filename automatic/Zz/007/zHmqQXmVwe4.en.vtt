was pretty simple i only learned a few
little<00:00:49.230> things<00:00:49.520> that's<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:50.850> not<00:00:51.290> not<00:00:52.290> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
little things that's really not not a

little things that's really not not a
little<00:00:52.560> big<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.400> i<00:00:53.430> thought<00:00:53.640> was<00:00:53.760> pretty

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
little big so i thought was pretty

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
stupid you do a final your project is a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.830 
stupid you do a final your project is a
big<00:00:56.610> group<00:00:56.850> project<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.450> is<00:00:57.570> hard<00:00:57.780> because

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
really easy you just use on quicktime

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.929 
really easy you just use on quicktime
video<00:01:35.670> recording<00:01:36.209> just<00:01:36.359> to<00:01:36.539> do<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.939> mean
