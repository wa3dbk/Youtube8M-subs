00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello to all and welcome to my geek 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.760
 today I make you a little 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.790
 video of the good old reason of 4 to know 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.759
 the mercenary mode today I 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.050
 especially wanted to show you the boss the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.720
 harder mercenary mode the last 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.470
 level obviously and especially the double 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.720
 Chainsaw guy for not doing too much 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.900
 small and I'm going to take a character 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 normal I will not take krauser that's it 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.239
 I took henk here then knowing that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.260
 I played what I sometimes hear me 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.520
 we 4 it's going to change a lot 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.290
 so that's gone I do not guarantee anything 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.930
 but I want to at least show you the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.930
 guy with double chainsaw and smart 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.710
 maybe a little down so knowing 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.460
 that the inventory is still enough 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.360
 reduced it's a little demerde you guys 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.360
 to the flames 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.470
 very powerful shots 2nd the British 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.470
 will fart that fart it's going to fart 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.450
 we will try to find the double 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.450
 chainsaw and survive there to try 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.780
 to kill especially because in my opinion it's not 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.780
 condescended 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.510
 but here in this video I'm not looking to 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:19.620
 to make big scores I live to find 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:35.250
 the boss to show you a little bit 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:38.959
 how is life going I 'll have 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:46.040
 golden whore 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.040
 we 'll break your back 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:02.580
 here it is, well it was the big boss 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.700
 I have not done a long time I did 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:14.400
 three minutes 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:15.950
 that's actually good eh bah that's how 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.950
 what the antilles four mercenaries 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.000
 2004 and is much much harder 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.140
 knowing that things like that there are 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.940
 has three in the amap is that if you kill 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.780
 not the first quickly and ben the 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.959
 second comes and the third etc 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.989
 so here you have landed to manage 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:41.010
 what's best is to take the name of 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.799

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.660

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.130
