00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 oh i'm exhorting you to remain active in 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.919
 word of god don't wait sunday when 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.880
 you will go to church to turn to 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.389
 word of god 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.580
 get up earlier one thing changed my 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.890
 mind I told you about it before 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.630
 but I will repeat it again because it 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.939
 was very important at that time 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:30.420
 i believed about john my son so he 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.470
 corrected he really encouraged 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.860
 pray me 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.320
 he prompted to this probably should be 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.559
 he is a little grateful because he is me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.960
 I was warming you, I saw that he was going wrong 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.239
 by and did not do what he knew 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 should have done and I was worried about 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.449
 I was worried about him and in my 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.690
 the heart arose desire pray in the spirit of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.030
 an hour a day i began to pray for john 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.309
 I then prayed an hour a day in the spirit and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.549
 I don't even remember what year it was but it 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.650
 was long ago when he was a teenager if 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.830
 think then he played a major role in my 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.150
 spiritual life when a boy becomes 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.350
 as a teenager he goes out his not 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.909
 lock up 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.460
 because then you will be taken to the police 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.460
 so you have to deal with it somehow and 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.079
 lord taught me how to handle it 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.720
 so of course you know what john 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.770
 became a wonderful person he is strong 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.630
 husband of god is faithful but he is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.090
 the reason that I started praying in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.450
 one hour a day every day and soon 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.520
 he completely changed his behavior to 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.649
 it did not take much time when you 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.570
 pray in the spirit you don't know exactly what 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.979
 you pray but you know you pray 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.590
 according to the will of God 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.320
 but when I started to pray it was that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.610
 lay on my heart and after that he 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.489
 of course corrected but pray by the hour in 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.280
 the day has become a habit for me and so 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.500
 blessing in my life 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.090
 that I didn't even think to say well with 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.810
 john is okay now i can 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.670
 stop and sleep an extra hour no it's 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.230
 it has already affected me in many ways 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.140
 influenced my life you get used to 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.890
 I remember how it was at the very beginning 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.319
 winter was cold i remember where we lived and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.450
 I remember how I prayed in the morning to me 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.120
 had to get up after dark and pray 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.690
 it was hard i didn't want to get up 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.170
 it was cold it was winter 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.260
 I wanted to comfortably hide and sleep, but 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:54.180
 god put it in my heart i think 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.920
 it was a very important time in my life 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.920
 since I spent time in prayer 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.730
 of course we said this week 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.519
 that you need to spend time in the word of God 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.310
 every day and what if you will 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.870
 pray 15 minutes a day 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.230
 what if you do what god 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.470
 speaks in your heart just do 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.400
 do it but give it every day 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.389
 the time for it to strengthen you is our 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.799
 contact with him is our time with them so 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:36.250
 we let him in and give him the opportunity 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:38.560
 help us in our lives amen and you 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.600
 never regret how much you would 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.329
 did not take the time to dedicate it 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.000
 your spiritual life to spend it 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.579
 with god it will bring you so big 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.510
 dividends you never never 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.510
 regret the abbot
