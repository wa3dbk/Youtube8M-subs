00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.639
 so we were asked the first exercise 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.289
 rewrite a second read wait 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 wait now take a closer look 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.270
 for some reason I will consider Chechelnik so closely 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.359
 I was so accustomed to me in another way 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.010
 winters need to do something urgently and what 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.369
 with me you can urgently do 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.100
 operate on operate slightly 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.450
 correct 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.450
 how can laser correct vision 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.550
 for just a few seconds 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.559
 if the question itself is interested in how it is 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.289
 happens then we change 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.049
 cornea the front of the eye do 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.609
 her other refractive power 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:55.609
 myopia hyperopia astigmatism 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.489
 this is all corrected by a laser getting up on 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.780
 stranded man feels pressure 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.390
 touching a bright light but not more 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.589
 the fact that such a cornea if you look 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.170
 each other's eyes 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.149
 you see that they are different colors rainbow 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.909
 shell on is on dredge wichka 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.110
 to the front transparent part on 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.659
 which we operate 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.030
 she looks like a little lens she possesses 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.179
 some refractive power to children 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.799
 do laser correction after 18 in 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.229
 provided that the cons he does not 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.209
 increases as the operation itself goes 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.039
 what do you see the microscope laser 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.569
 work on a specific purpose 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.490
 the program runs very fast 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.610
 literally in a few seconds 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.220
 here is this red dot that runs 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.250
 this is a laser track 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 it runs at a speed of 250 shots 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.040
 second this shame worked we needed on 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.840
 horn hiv cinema transparent part 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.150
 form a very thin petal two 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.340
 human hair and how thick 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.740
 diagnostics diagnostics 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.630
 performed on a special 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:04.910
 diagnostic line where a lot of devices 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:06.800
 Now we will go there 379 66 remains 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.540
 we only need to check on the device 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.880
 any glasses to 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.540
 see better libor immediately makes three 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.040
 measurements, see if the pros and cons 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.360
 astigmatism world thickness size 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
 corneal curvature 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.590
 least someone pupil even though you say that 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.120
 operation is not sick but can also 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.550
 do something not to give 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.230
 ideal for surgery 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.690
 sometimes it is possible in children and eyes 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.420
 tired more than adults need 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.209
 take breaks visually work you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.600
 made sure that it's not scary yes but better 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.660
 I will abide by the rules 20-20-20 that 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.070
 this is when working at a computer 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.950
 every 20 minutes for twenty seconds 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.860
 caretaker 20 meters tribute and eyes will 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.940
 how new all good vision learned 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.930
