there for another four hours it could

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.140 
there for another four hours it could
take<00:02:49.590> less<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:50.040> could<00:02:50.220> take<00:02:50.370> longer<00:02:50.640> that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
take less it could take longer that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.850 
take less it could take longer that
really<00:02:51.360> just<00:02:51.569> depends<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.470> internal

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
really just depends the internal

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.100 
really just depends the internal
temperature<00:02:52.980> was<00:02:53.490> 200<00:02:54.000> degrees<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.510> that

temperature was 200 degrees and that

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.900 
temperature was 200 degrees and that
really<00:02:55.410> varies<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.250> more<00:02:56.490> important

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
