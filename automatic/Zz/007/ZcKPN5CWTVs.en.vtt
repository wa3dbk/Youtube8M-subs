00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
percent alcohol it's an ice cider so

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.490 
percent alcohol it's an ice cider so
what<00:00:21.119> they<00:00:21.210> do<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.480> they<00:00:21.600> freeze<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.380> make

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
it a little bit smoother there it's a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.759 
it a little bit smoother there it's a
philosophy<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.340> they<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> lot<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.769> Canada

in<00:00:28.890> Quebec<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.460> believe<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.910> originated<00:00:30.330> but

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
in Quebec it I believe it originated but

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.069 
in Quebec it I believe it originated but
10%<00:00:31.380> alcohol<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.070> actually<00:00:32.369> oak<00:00:32.550> aged<00:00:33.079> so

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
10% alcohol and actually oak aged so
