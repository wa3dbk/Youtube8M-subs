engine we put in you can see the engines
complete<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> way<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.039> got<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
complete this is just the way we got it

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.209 
complete this is just the way we got it
we<00:00:30.000> haven't<00:00:30.240> added<00:00:30.840> anything<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.560> other

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
and putting water in it so we can run it

and putting water in it so we can run it
well<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.590> go<00:00:40.770> we're<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> try<00:00:41.850> this

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
well here we go we're going to try this

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.819 
well here we go we're going to try this
out<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:42.930> it'll<00:00:43.110> start

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
out and see if it'll start

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.580 
out and see if it'll start
we're<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.539> don't<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.440> need

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
we're on there we don't think we need

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.979 
we're on there we don't think we need
the<00:00:46.680> fan<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.399> point<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:47.989> let's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the fan on at this point in time let's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.660 
the fan on at this point in time let's
see<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.530> fit<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:51.050> branch<00:00:52.050> over<00:00:52.670> well

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
see if we can fit a one branch over well

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.139 
see if we can fit a one branch over well
on<00:00:53.820> our<00:00:53.850> last<00:00:54.149> attempt<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> start<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:56.149> it

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
on our last attempt to start this it

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
on our last attempt to start this it
wouldn't<00:00:57.449> start<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.379> found<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
wouldn't start what we found was that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
wouldn't start what we found was that
there<00:00:59.280> was<00:00:59.399> no<00:00:59.930> spark<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.399> point<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.359> we

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
there was no spark at the point so we

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.240 
there was no spark at the point so we
played<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.409> Reese<00:01:04.530> I've<00:01:04.830> reset

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
played with that and Reese I've reset

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.120 
played with that and Reese I've reset
them<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.549> everything<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.119> let's<00:01:06.270> try<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.659> now

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
them and everything so let's try it now

now you can see my fingers two days
after<00:03:12.960> sticking<00:03:13.740> them<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.340> fan<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.450> gives

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
after sticking them in the fan it gives

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.410 
after sticking them in the fan it gives
you<00:03:16.230> an<00:03:16.320> idea<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.800> can<00:03:16.980> happen<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.610> really

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
you an idea what can happen I really

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.460 
you an idea what can happen I really
thought<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.750> was<00:03:18.810> going<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.020> be<00:03:19.140> worse<00:03:19.440> than

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
thought it was going to be worse than

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.680 
thought it was going to be worse than
what<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.160> I'll<00:03:20.670> probably<00:03:20.850> lose<00:03:21.210> that<00:03:21.480> one

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
what it is I'll probably lose that one

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.450 
what it is I'll probably lose that one
nail<00:03:22.200> there<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:23.010> see<00:03:23.250> there's

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
nail there and you can see there's

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.520 
nail there and you can see there's
probably<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.850> little<00:03:24.000> blood<00:03:24.570> on<00:03:24.600> both<00:03:25.110> fingers

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
probably a little blood on both fingers

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.970 
probably a little blood on both fingers
there<00:03:25.740> still<00:03:26.100> but<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.840> just<00:03:28.050> tells<00:03:28.710> you<00:03:28.860> you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
there still but it just tells you you

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:42.280 
there still but it just tells you you
want<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.370> careful<00:03:29.640> when<00:03:29.970> you're<00:03:30.120> doing<00:03:30.180> it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.170 

now<00:03:43.290> teach<00:03:43.560> me<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.830> stick<00:03:44.040> my<00:03:44.069> hand<00:03:44.310> in<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.549> fan

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.949 

god<00:03:48.209> damn

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
god damn

00:03:48.959 --> 00:04:01.940 
god damn
oh<00:03:59.569> we<00:04:00.569> had<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.900> valve<00:04:01.110> cover<00:04:01.409> off<00:04:01.500> here<00:04:01.860> and

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
oh we had the valve cover off here and

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.649 
oh we had the valve cover off here and
everything's<00:04:02.340> clean<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:02.970> nice<00:04:03.090> underneath

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
everything's clean and nice underneath

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.259 
everything's clean and nice underneath
there<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.079> everything<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:05.220> again<00:04:06.120> this

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
there and everything so it again this

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.270 
there and everything so it again this
engine<00:04:06.629> was<00:04:06.750> supposed<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.049> be<00:04:07.200> rebuilt<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.859> I

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
engine was supposed to be rebuilt and I

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.339 
engine was supposed to be rebuilt and I
think<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:08.640> has<00:04:08.879> been<00:04:09.180> it's<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.750> really<00:04:09.989> clean

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
think it has been it's just really clean

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.170 
think it has been it's just really clean
and<00:04:10.379> of<00:04:10.680> course<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.010> saw<00:04:11.189> the<00:04:11.250> soft<00:04:11.640> plug<00:04:11.909> has

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
and of course you saw the soft plug has

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.140 
and of course you saw the soft plug has
been<00:04:12.840> replaced<00:04:13.319> we<00:04:13.980> wash<00:04:14.250> this<00:04:14.579> engine<00:04:14.970> off

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
been replaced we wash this engine off

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.360 
been replaced we wash this engine off
and<00:04:15.359> it<00:04:15.450> just<00:04:15.510> looks<00:04:15.930> really<00:04:16.049> really<00:04:16.919> good<00:04:17.160> now

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and it just looks really really good now

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.849 
and it just looks really really good now
now<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.389> carburation<00:04:18.930> here<00:04:19.380> we<00:04:19.500> didn't<00:04:19.769> do

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
now this carburation here we didn't do

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.580 
now this carburation here we didn't do
anything<00:04:20.190> with<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.340> particularly<00:04:21.169> so<00:04:22.169> that

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
anything with that particularly so that

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.140 
anything with that particularly so that
carburetor<00:04:22.949> probably<00:04:23.520> could<00:04:23.669> stand<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.030> be

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
carburetor probably could stand to be

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.750 
carburetor probably could stand to be
rebuilt<00:04:24.660> or<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.440> it<00:04:26.250> probably<00:04:26.580> run<00:04:26.729> a

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
rebuilt or so and it probably run a

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.300 
rebuilt or so and it probably run a
little<00:04:26.940> better<00:04:27.180> with<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:28.199> rebuilt<00:04:28.830> carburetor

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
little better with a rebuilt carburetor

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.659 
little better with a rebuilt carburetor
on<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.600> engine<00:04:31.169> sounds<00:04:31.590> great<00:04:31.889> we

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
on it but it engine sounds great we

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.180 
on it but it engine sounds great we
jury-rigged<00:04:33.449> up<00:04:33.660> this<00:04:33.900> here<00:04:34.350> exhaust<00:04:34.740> system

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
jury-rigged up this here exhaust system

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.680 
jury-rigged up this here exhaust system
so<00:04:35.220> we<00:04:35.520> could<00:04:35.699> you<00:04:35.910> know<00:04:36.000> you<00:04:36.060> can<00:04:36.240> hear<00:04:36.449> it<00:04:36.510> run

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
so we could you know you can hear it run

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.469 
so we could you know you can hear it run
better<00:04:36.900> and<00:04:37.710> everything<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:38.520> it's<00:04:39.090> looking

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
better and everything so it's looking

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.689 
better and everything so it's looking
