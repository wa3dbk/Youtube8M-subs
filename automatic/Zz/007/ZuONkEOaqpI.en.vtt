00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello everyone I'm hero and here I am going to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.590
 teach in this video how to get 570 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.120
 coins in phase 37 of pokemon shuffle 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.880
 this is a common phase of my classroom the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.770
 special event and I have to place the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.430
 coins in a way that suits us so that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.800
 so when in the line of five coins 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.470
 this is not as easy as it seems because 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.949
 we have very limited shifts we are going to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 get 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.119
 sybase we have two turns just 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.940
 now in this shift we make the line of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.469
 five ways if we have one more turn 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 to enable me out if not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.110
 enable we do not get the coins 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.840
 if this is not looking like good over here 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.840
 let's make this guest 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.480
 and how are we getting the 570 coins 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.159
 as we will see now 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.910
 there we have fifths and mint ways 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.460
 if we are not add 5 give us less 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.470
 coins as we will see now 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 we will make the line of four so that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.400
 Let 's say they make it easier us 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.500
 give less dolls 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.440
 let's see I'm thinking very well we have 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:20.610
 what happens is here 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:24.580
 good care we weaken unintentionally 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.100
 now we take off this slow dota kings 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.940
 Careful care combos well the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.230
 good rope 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:37.070
 We combo bing 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.850
 so as not to weaken them 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.130
 there we already do the line of four 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.840
 coins 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.340
 and there are some of screaming if we believe that 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.689
 I 'm not the same and this will give us 330 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.689
 coins that is not bad either 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.590
 This is the easiest way 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.590
 get coins in pokemon shuffle 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.020
 obviously if I was going to do it as of 55 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.330
 coins better than better but it's nothing 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.790
 easy to get it I hope that I have 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.780
 liked this little video and see you 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.780
 in the next chao
