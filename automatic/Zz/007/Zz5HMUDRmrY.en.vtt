00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.040
 asus had great success last year 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.380
 hands with the nexus 7 not together with 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.030
 google made and what that nexus 7 them 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.869
 It was popular that it was good 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.140
 tablet was with the relatively low price 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.720
 249 euros 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.789
 well asus now think they can do themselves 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.890
 surpass because they come with the memo 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 pad hd 7 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
 and that his tablet i rotatable far away 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.349
 has 7 of that nexus 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.610
 but then it costs a lot less 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.610
 169 euros 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.970
 as you can see they are about the same 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.800
 fat and are the same size and you can too 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.960
 say they are about the same weight 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.240
 bad also fine in the hand and true 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.370
 they differ that is the finish that 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.020
 back of that nexus 7 is another 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.420
 structure are kind of small pits in it 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.060
 and that memo pad hd 7 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.320
 it is completely wet and slippery 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.120
 look at that even further 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.610
 the outside of a few more 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.590
 differences on so does that hd7 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.630
 a camera well that is nice if you like 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 photograph with your tablet but I do 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.869
 not that 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.850
 but also has a micro-sd slot on 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.740
 the sides that he had nexus 7 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.630
 again not and that is nice because that micro 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.060
 sd tickets cost almost nothing more 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.979
 nowadays for the euro or 9 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.530
 you double the 16 that went internal 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.050
 has after 32 and for just over 20 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.350
 euro you can already add 32 here 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.270
 total 48 get there is one more 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.550
 thingetje on the outside and that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.830
 is the placement of the usb port that sits 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.840
 name not on the bottom but on top well 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.970
 why no idea maybe 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.320
 have done it in terms of appearance 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.990
 more clearly distinguishable from that 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.280
 Nexus 7 in practice does not make it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.050
 very much like you will be in it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.729
 start getting used to it if you do 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.770
 plugs it in somewhere under the hood 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.960
 there are more differences they have 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.390
 both a quad core CPU but the one in the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 nexus 7 is based on cortex a9 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.720
 design and here is a cpu with cortex 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.000
 a7 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.549
 on paper it means that this is 30 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.540
 percent should be slow and that 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.299
 you also notice in practice 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.410
 because very quickly I would not really have that hd7 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.880
 want to mention 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.769
 you notice it especially when navigating 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.299
 by the interface and French of the one after 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.250
 the other activity goes and sees one 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.440
 kind of transition animation then it goes 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.010
 regularly choppy and it is just 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.959
 very bad 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.489
 inconsistent is now happily 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.930
 all a little less once you 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.000
 so within an app if you are in the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.709
 for example, the browser is fine 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.420
 working with that hd7 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.920
 but in general you notice 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.470
 that you have to deal with a budget tablet 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.780
 am for a tablet in this class 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.150
 I am very satisfied with the screen 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.459
 a resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.860
 just then with the nexus 7 but it is a lot 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.810
 more than with other cheap tablet and 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.519
 in addition is an eps screen that means 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.440
 that the viewing angles are good and that too 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.970
 the color reproduction is fine 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.720
 look you can in this price range 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.820
 of course not 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.080
 expect too much but I had it whole 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.210
 very nice as well as the screen 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.160
 laminated just like the nexus 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.960
 7 again that means name it the screen 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.820
 really is on the surface that is 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.400
 not so now and therefore it seems to me 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.350
 it just a little bit sunk 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.940
 has the battery in the memo pad hd 7 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.090
 the same capacities as the battery in the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.740
 nexus 7 and went that slow and economical 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.790
 you would have a processor in that hd7 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.960
 maybe expect that longer 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.700
 goes along 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.980
 that is unfortunately not just him 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.810
 if not yet bad in ours 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.640
 browsing test goes seven hours and one 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.770
 as much as fifteen minutes less 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.570
 then nexus 7 and, for example, half an hour 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.860
 less than ipad mini 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.900
 no in the video test then it runs 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.940
 backlog a little further but goes 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.600
 still a good 7 hours and that is one 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.420
 score well 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.220
 asus has android on that hd7 here and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.050
 a bit modified there but not very 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.940
 very much the settings menu now has 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.680
 a different color and the notification bar 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.200
 a field notification menu is now also 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.940
 otherwise purple with other buttons like 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.900
 you just don't like it you can just do it 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.380
 turn of 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.550
 you say i don't want hazes quick settings 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.890
 and then you just get it standard 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.380
 android menu and that's the one 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.269
 who finds in beautiful and handy 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.950
 furthermore, there are some other apps that we 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.790
 previously we have seen other asus 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.380
 tablet 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.080
 so you can video button at the bottom one 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.890
 kind of mini apps calls can preview 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.299
 think about 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.299
 small calculator or a very small one 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.769
 browser window very handy I think 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.240
 it doesn't but it is almost standard 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.860
 nowadays that age 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.870
 Samsung provides the people do not agree 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.400
 like who can know it stands 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.169
 on it 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.660
 from further on the reporting beard is the 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.340
 app asus splendit and then you can put it on 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.169
 the color reproduction for the screen 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.479
 adjust really it is not from it 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.250
 is already a good screen, but that's how it is 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.479
 the advanced user that since 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.479
 that possibility flour evert 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.900
 just like with nexus 7 it is bait 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.940
 again managed to get a relatively low 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.870
 amount a great tablet together 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.069
 put 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.449
 look for this money you should not 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.699
 expect it to do the same 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.789
 as an ipad mini or as a nexus 7 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.110
 but he is also a lot cheaper 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.840
 you will get a very decent one 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.169
 housing and with the micro sd slot one 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.449
 excellent screen and equal battery life 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.740
 if you can miss 250 euros then you can 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.180
 maybe even better for that nexus 7 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.539
 go or maybe wait for his 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.820
 successor but for 169 euros you can 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.020
 currently find few better than the 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.020
 memo pad hd 7
