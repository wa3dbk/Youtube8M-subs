00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
love my many many phones and so what's

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.760 
love my many many phones and so what's
going<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> low-light

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
going on is that they have a low-light

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100 
going on is that they have a low-light
box<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.760> here<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.570> there's<00:00:42.750> actually<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
box in here and so there's actually a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.220 
box in here and so there's actually a
mode<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.730> camera<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.660> if<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.840> go<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
mode on the camera so if we go into the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430 
mode on the camera so if we go into the
camera<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.239> then<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.480> into<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> mode<00:00:49.140> here

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
camera and then we go into the mode here

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.889 
camera and then we go into the mode here
so<00:00:50.070> we're<00:00:50.579> gonna<00:00:50.700> shoot<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.420> low<00:00:51.660> light<00:00:51.870> mode

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so we're gonna shoot the low light mode

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.420 
so we're gonna shoot the low light mode
and<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.500> actually<00:00:52.890> reduces<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.280> 8

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and that actually reduces the 8

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
and that actually reduces the 8
megapixel<00:00:53.910> camera<00:00:53.940> down<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:54.719> megapixel

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
megapixel camera down to two megapixel

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.090 
megapixel camera down to two megapixel
so<00:00:56.039> let's<00:00:56.520> try<00:00:56.789> to--<00:00:56.850> let's<00:00:57.840> put<00:00:58.079> these<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.649> let

let's see let's go back ok now if we
kind<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.479> look<00:02:00.659> at<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.960> let's<00:02:01.200> put<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.500> over

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
kind of look at this let's put this over

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.609 
kind of look at this let's put this over
here<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.090> kind<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> got

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
here so you can kind of see that it got

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.650 
here so you can kind of see that it got
you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.939> let's<00:02:06.090> do<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> side-by-side

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.500 

that's<00:02:09.660> quite<00:02:09.899> funny<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.239> play<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that's quite funny so this is play the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.790 
that's quite funny so this is play the
best<00:02:12.660> little<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> camera<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.379> market<00:02:13.590> and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
best little a camera on the market and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.009 
best little a camera on the market and
that's<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.160> that's<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> difference<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.930> now

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
that's what that's the difference so now

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.410 
that's what that's the difference so now
let's<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.860> one<00:02:17.010> more<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.330> many

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.430 
phones to choose from but I'm gonna go
with<00:02:19.920> an<00:02:20.010> iPhone<00:02:20.340> because<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:21.170> just<00:02:22.170> want<00:02:22.379> to

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
where we're seeing like 20 megapixel and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.440 
where we're seeing like 20 megapixel and
all<00:03:10.829> kinds<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.430> other<00:03:11.579> like<00:03:11.850> scaled<00:03:12.269> up

all kinds of other like scaled up

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.210 
all kinds of other like scaled up
resolutions<00:03:13.109> on<00:03:13.230> cameras<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:13.829> just<00:03:14.010> kind<00:03:14.190> of

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
resolutions on cameras it's just kind of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.610 
resolutions on cameras it's just kind of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
megapixels as we want so it's

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.400
