rusty<00:01:42.970> old<00:01:43.120> boat<00:01:43.420> uses<00:01:44.229> one<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.560> my<00:01:44.650> favorite

rusty old boat uses one of my favorite
scales<00:01:45.220> as<00:01:45.460> you<00:01:45.670> know<00:01:45.940> a<00:01:46.270> minor<00:01:46.780> pentatonic

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
scales as you know a minor pentatonic

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.020 
scales as you know a minor pentatonic
but<00:01:47.800> instead<00:01:48.070> of<00:01:48.130> just<00:01:48.340> playing<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:48.790> in<00:01:48.940> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
but instead of just playing it in the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.340 
but instead of just playing it in the
usual<00:01:49.210> spot<00:01:49.570> I<00:01:51.060> found<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.750> notes<00:01:52.990> for<00:01:53.229> you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
usual spot I found the notes for you

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.609 
usual spot I found the notes for you
minor<00:01:53.500> pentatonic<00:01:53.770> all<00:01:54.190> over<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.670> place<00:01:54.910> so

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
minor pentatonic all over the place so

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.870 
minor pentatonic all over the place so
for<00:01:56.619> example<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:02.560> whole<00:02:02.800> line<00:02:03.070> uses<00:02:03.550> notes

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
for example that whole line uses notes

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.650 
for example that whole line uses notes
from<00:02:04.150> E<00:02:04.270> minor<00:02:04.450> pentatonic<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.009> line<00:02:06.250> up

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.710 

that's<00:02:10.660> all<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:11.020> minor<00:02:11.200> pentatonic<00:02:11.410> as<00:02:11.860> well<00:02:12.720> so

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
that's all a minor pentatonic as well so

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.449 
that's all a minor pentatonic as well so
it's<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:13.959> different<00:02:14.230> ways<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.739> using<00:02:15.040> that

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
it's just different ways of using that

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:25.020 
it's just different ways of using that
pentatonic<00:02:15.940> sound<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.450> get<00:02:16.570> phrases<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.940> I'm

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
pentatonic sound to get phrases and I'm

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.970 
pentatonic sound to get phrases and I'm
trying<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.300> get<00:02:25.420> lots<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.780> little<00:02:25.950> kind<00:02:26.950> of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
trying to get lots a little kind of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:36.120 
trying to get lots a little kind of
funky<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.450> hear<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.890> almost<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.040> a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
funky you can hear that almost like a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.270 
funky you can hear that almost like a
drum<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:38.080> I'm<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.290> muting<00:02:38.680> out<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.950> strings

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
drum and I'm just muting out the strings

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.890 
drum and I'm just muting out the strings
with<00:02:39.519> my<00:02:39.550> left<00:02:39.880> hand<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.330> covering<00:02:40.660> them<00:02:40.780> so

with my left hand and covering them so

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.660 
with my left hand and covering them so
they<00:02:40.989> won't<00:02:41.110> ring<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.680> then<00:02:42.190> with<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.459> right

they won't ring and then with my right
hand

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140

drummer I'll make your playing funky
let's<00:02:56.090> see<00:02:56.330> after<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.430> go<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.900> sort<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.930> an

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
let's see after that I go to sort of an

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.340 
let's see after that I go to sort of an
a7<00:03:00.410> chord<00:03:01.480> well<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.600> plant<00:03:02.870> power<00:03:03.020> chords

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
a7 chord well the plant power chords

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.010 
a7 chord well the plant power chords
there<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.560> want<00:03:03.890> an<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.070> sip<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.430> sound<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.780> do

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
there I want an a sip and sound so I do

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.230 
there I want an a sip and sound so I do
the<00:03:06.590> craziest<00:03:07.010> mixolydian<00:03:07.550> scale<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:08.060> can

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
the craziest mixolydian scale I can

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.770 
the craziest mixolydian scale I can
think<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:09.430> I'm<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.580> using<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.150> three<00:03:11.630> note

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
think of I'm just using this three note

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.360 
think of I'm just using this three note
per<00:03:11.810> string<00:03:11.989> scale<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.620> trying<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.130> lots

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
per string scale and trying to do lots

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.460 
per string scale and trying to do lots
of<00:03:16.520> soloing<00:03:17.420> within<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:22.870> any<00:03:23.870> patterns<00:03:24.350> that

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
of soloing within that any patterns that

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.120 
of soloing within that any patterns that
I<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.800> they're<00:03:25.070> different<00:03:25.250> every<00:03:25.489> time

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.340 

and<00:03:32.240> I'll<00:03:33.240> show<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.570> some<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.960> those<00:03:34.080> patterns

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
and I'll show you some of those patterns

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.590 
and I'll show you some of those patterns
when<00:03:34.650> we<00:03:34.740> get<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.190> hammer<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.180> pull<00:03:36.240> up<00:03:36.420> at

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
when we get to the hammer on pull up at

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.880 
when we get to the hammer on pull up at
the<00:03:36.690> end<00:03:36.840> but<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.230> just<00:03:37.440> wanted<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.710> give<00:03:37.800> you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
the end but I just wanted to give you

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.090 
the end but I just wanted to give you
the<00:03:37.980> general<00:03:38.190> scale<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:40.230> then<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.650> go<00:03:40.830> nuts

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
the general scale and then I go nuts

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.589 
the general scale and then I go nuts
inside

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.640 

the<00:03:45.530> same<00:03:45.739> thing<00:03:45.890> up<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.040> whole-step<00:03:46.249> and<00:03:46.609> B

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
the same thing up a whole-step and B

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.050 
the same thing up a whole-step and B
this<00:03:48.650> time<00:03:48.859> I'm<00:03:48.980> playing<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.400> scale<00:03:49.730> from<00:03:49.909> the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
this time I'm playing the scale from the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.360 
this time I'm playing the scale from the
low-end

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.800 

and<00:03:55.370> again<00:03:55.790> I'm<00:03:55.850> trying<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.180> go<00:03:56.270> as<00:03:56.390> much<00:03:56.420> as<00:03:56.720> I

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
and again I'm trying to go as much as I

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.930 
and again I'm trying to go as much as I
can<00:03:57.020> with<00:03:57.170> any<00:03:57.260> patterns<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.860> work

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.250 

and<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.030> last<00:04:05.270> thing<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:05.540> have<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.930> big

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
and the last thing I have is a big

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.640 
and the last thing I have is a big
stretch<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:07.360> speed<00:04:08.360> like<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.540> d7<00:04:08.990> sound<00:04:11.650> and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
stretch in speed like a d7 sound and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.759 
stretch in speed like a d7 sound and
their<00:04:12.890> cameras<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.490> pull-offs<00:04:17.560> look<00:04:18.560> at<00:04:18.650> that

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
their cameras and pull-offs look at that

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.300 
their cameras and pull-offs look at that
note<00:04:19.010> rise<00:04:19.250> up<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.500> big<00:04:21.709> stretch<00:04:22.040> at<00:04:22.220> the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
note rise up and the big stretch at the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.680 
note rise up and the big stretch at the
end<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.800> if<00:04:25.400> possible<00:04:25.610> I'm<00:04:26.240> going<00:04:26.480> to<00:04:26.540> try<00:04:26.630> to

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
end and if possible I'm going to try to

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.610 
end and if possible I'm going to try to
bend<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.140> up<00:04:27.200> at<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.440> end<00:04:29.080> because<00:04:30.080> any<00:04:30.380> time

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
bend it up at the end because any time

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.860 
bend it up at the end because any time
you<00:04:30.710> bend<00:04:30.950> it's<00:04:31.130> cool<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:35.180> between<00:04:35.660> these

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
you bend it's cool and between these

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.140 
you bend it's cool and between these
notes<00:04:36.170> I'm<00:04:36.470> trying<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.220> get<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> clear<00:04:37.910> enough

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
notes I'm trying to get a clear enough

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.470 
notes I'm trying to get a clear enough
sound<00:04:38.510> where<00:04:38.930> it's<00:04:39.050> not<00:04:39.170> so<00:04:39.380> distorted<00:04:39.740> and

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
sound where it's not so distorted and

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.060 
sound where it's not so distorted and
hissy<00:04:41.480> that<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.050> can<00:04:42.200> actually<00:04:42.470> stop<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:42.980> the

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
hissy that I can actually stop in the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.300 
hissy that I can actually stop in the
middle<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:47.840> have<00:04:47.870> little<00:04:48.290> spaces<00:04:48.620> as<00:04:48.980> opposed

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
middle you have little spaces as opposed

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.920

to<00:04:49.460> of<00:04:49.850> course<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.090> can<00:04:50.240> sustain<00:04:50.630> all<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.840> way

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
to of course I can sustain all the way

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.470 
to of course I can sustain all the way
through<00:04:51.140> it

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.580 

a<00:04:55.330> possible<00:04:56.330> app<00:04:56.420> for<00:04:56.690> funky<00:04:57.110> it's<00:04:57.290> good<00:04:57.500> to

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
a possible app for funky it's good to

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.760 
a possible app for funky it's good to
stop

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.330 

some<00:05:06.759> kind<00:05:06.939> of<00:05:06.969> funky<00:05:07.300> core

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
some kind of funky core

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.510 
some kind of funky core
that's<00:05:10.340> an<00:05:10.490> e-flat<00:05:11.030> I<00:05:12.130> have<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.250> think<00:05:13.430> about

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
that's an e-flat I have to think about

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.490 
that's an e-flat I have to think about
this<00:05:13.760> one<00:05:13.990> dominant<00:05:14.990> it's<00:05:15.919> got<00:05:16.040> a<00:05:16.070> 13<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.720> 9<00:05:19.450> so

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
this one dominant it's got a 13 and 9 so

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.570 
this one dominant it's got a 13 and 9 so
those<00:05:21.500> are<00:05:21.680> some<00:05:21.800> of<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:21.950> cool<00:05:22.160> parts<00:05:22.460> I'm

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
those are some of the cool parts I'm

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.830 
those are some of the cool parts I'm
going<00:05:22.700> to<00:05:22.760> show<00:05:22.880> you<00:05:22.910> one<00:05:23.240> more<00:05:23.270> lick<00:05:23.660> because

I love it so much this is something I do
in<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.430> solo<00:05:28.669> it's<00:05:28.880> an<00:05:28.970> arpeggio<00:05:29.300> D<00:05:29.900> major<00:05:31.930> in

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
in the solo it's an arpeggio D major in

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:43.659 
in the solo it's an arpeggio D major in
octaves<00:05:35.500> using<00:05:36.500> pull<00:05:36.710> ups<00:05:36.889> a<00:05:42.370> lot<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.490> shifting

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
octaves using pull ups a lot of shifting

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.460 
octaves using pull ups a lot of shifting
with<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.030> left<00:05:44.240> hand<00:05:44.419> but<00:05:45.110> it's<00:05:45.229> a<00:05:45.260> really

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
nice smooth sound and in context it's

00:05:48.950 --> 00:06:20.310 
nice smooth sound and in context it's
something<00:05:49.340> like<00:05:49.460> this

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320
