00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.610
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.400
 gt5 video online like this video 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.010
 we are here in utah a recreator gta 5 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.170
 and we started previously exposed 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.640
 previously as you already know 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.170
 yesterday or before he's leaving with 23 watching 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.550
 this video but good the case today rose 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.189
 to the channel a video then showed a 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.020
 map of a pedestrian and regulated in gt5 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.060
 this case because I bring an improved map 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.529
 since good improved from my point of 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.910
 view and from my opinion you can all 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.780
 think the opposite but good the case 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.370
 that I think this map is 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.000
 improved since it is smaller 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.770
 the group like this one is smaller and at 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.600
 be smaller because they have more 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.920
 that's why knock down 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.480
 which is improved is not a little more 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.190
 improved than the previous mop then 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.600
 I can, why are we putting one on 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.760
 part and supporting all parties fears 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.110
 you're looking at the roof we're what 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.210
 we are not dead is motivated 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.880
 for it comes out from behind I think they come out 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.340
 here is not worth it worth a pomegranate here 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.530
 a grenade to the folia very part of 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.629
 place of file no 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.390
 and yesterday all maps of grenades that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.190
 go to see if any fall as it falls 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.190
 someone has chest 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.900
 there is enough system for mind as 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.900
 I say it seems better 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.630
 go Go 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.150
 do not 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.570
 write very well you hit me a smack 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.120
 in the store from the emotion easy uncle 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.220
 until ago my god threw salt makes a 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.760
 very very frustrating moment very team in 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.480
 the kid that action that action is 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.480
 very small 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.440
 that man and he killed him a modest box 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.640
 this I am as I said on the other map 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.870
 and this could not happen only 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.280
 occurs in this since this is much more 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.280
 reduced much smaller thing that cool 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.069
 above 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.099
 do not look at it 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.540
 is dead is dead not like tandil 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.670
 another side cha al madrid 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.209
 from above I have to leave it to a 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.219
 minimum shot to the bottom sometimes I do not know nor 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.420
 how much are we more earning for 1 uncle and 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.359
 there are two minutes of shooting that the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.590
 25 minute game and there is no limit 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.519
 of casualties and also tell you that if 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.069
 you want to try this game 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.989
 technically down on the description and 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.439
 this man is going to come for me what 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.439
 do not you know that 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.019
 worth several holdups 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.560
 boston 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:55.640
 come on I'm very son I'm bumping 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.640
 saying it clear 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.680
 we go another 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:07.310
 a lad a madryn lad already 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.310
 this also literally falls 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.359
 my character to kill me cago me 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.950
 in everything but we are very, very, very, very 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.329
 well here a little bit at stake well not 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.340
 It looks so good We started really 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:28.970
 It's really cool to have a car here 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:32.040
 up god they are going to kill me here is something 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.480
 it's for your life 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.950
 not impossible a case that follows and twitter 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.870
 right beat you have let's go for 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.840
 five points to see if we get 15.15 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.909
 down so we managed to win the game 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.130
 he paid as he climbed 77 as men of 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:48.470
 up here around here 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.730
 the same job here to have someone for 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.010
 here in front of putting here back I have not 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.209
 viewed 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.209
 in others 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.810
 here 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.730
 my fourfold mother 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.810
 because it answers up and then 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.400
 it is also shining in the end I hope 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.560
 is that there is a moment before god en masse 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.930
 4 I'm sure you stay then kind to 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.310
 Sometimes this man right now I do not know 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.960
 are giving everything we were going to lose 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.700
 Now we are giving for two guys, we have to 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.680
 to hold you have to tell please and 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.980
 fly more lines that win us than the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.870
 vice for you 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.080
 we were packed we're packed 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.449
 appears because the aim 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.639
 with everything we lose we lose 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:45.229
 kid 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.750
 but we're not going to 23 seconds guys 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.669
 23 points we are walking down a low there 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.509
 to put the batteries you have to put 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.509
 the machines 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:01.650
 this uncle please 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.050
 let's avalmadrid that under work you 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.050
 they see badly thought 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.180
 but we have won we have won more line 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.889
 the game is still very, very, very, very 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.410
 Well, I do not have the moment in the 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.759
 Magola's which the UAZ and we can say 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.110
 which killed the positives followed there 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.610
 madrid or really is that quique epic 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.289
 there I want to look at the marker that 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.400
 first position has remained as 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.660
 you see guys we're going very cool that 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.979
 I would link the description as I say 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.330
 to download it that was quite 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.070
 enough to play with friends 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.509
 and as you can have a lot of 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.360
 action and besides it puts you remember a lot 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.610
 never have this to see how about deaths 9 or 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.050
 be the result result 12 I think that 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.580
 he has charged me 12 do not let him do not 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.740
 I understand very well how this is going but I think 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.389
 that are at all 59 times are nothing more 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.650
 the truth very well I'm from trees 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.449
 favorites and liked it if it's the most 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.449
 cried 6 and 2 we have approximated greater
