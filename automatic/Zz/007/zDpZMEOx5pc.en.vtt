thousand twelve the true elites know
this<00:02:38.620> all<00:02:38.860> too<00:02:38.920> well<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.880> they<00:02:40.360> definitely

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
this all too well and they definitely

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.550 
this all too well and they definitely
know<00:02:41.590> it's<00:02:42.010> also<00:02:42.430> not<00:02:43.090> because<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.750> galactic

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
know it's also not because of galactic

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.979 
know it's also not because of galactic
alignment<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.060> one<00:02:46.209> hand<00:02:46.420> it's<00:02:46.600> kind<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.900> a

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
alignment so in one hand it's kind of a

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.110 
alignment so in one hand it's kind of a
misdirection<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:48.160> make<00:02:48.280> sure<00:02:48.459> we<00:02:48.640> don't<00:02:48.670> pay

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
misdirection to make sure we don't pay

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.570 
misdirection to make sure we don't pay
attention<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.810> real<00:02:50.230> prophecies<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.459> on

attention to the real prophecies but on

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.699 
attention to the real prophecies but on
the<00:02:51.730> other<00:02:51.760> hand<00:02:51.940> they<00:02:52.510> are<00:02:52.690> trying<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.590> make

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
the other hand they are trying to make

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.740 
the other hand they are trying to make
it<00:02:53.890> look<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.520> other<00:02:54.760> prophecies<00:02:55.209> are<00:02:55.390> coming

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
it look like other prophecies are coming

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.590 
it look like other prophecies are coming
true<00:02:55.930> all<00:02:56.290> prophecies<00:02:57.100> but<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.120> trying<00:02:58.450> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
true all prophecies but in trying to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.850 
true all prophecies but in trying to
fulfill<00:02:58.930> all<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.200> them<00:02:59.470> they're<00:02:59.620> going<00:02:59.800> to

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
fulfill all of them they're going to

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.800 
fulfill all of them they're going to
have<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.070> paint<00:03:00.340> with<00:03:00.610> very<00:03:00.910> broad<00:03:01.270> strokes

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
have to paint with very broad strokes

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.300 
have to paint with very broad strokes
and<00:03:02.080> what<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.530> mean<00:03:02.739> by<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.950> is<00:03:03.280> that

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
and what I mean by that is that

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.220 
and what I mean by that is that
ultimately<00:03:03.910> we're<00:03:04.150> going<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.420> be<00:03:04.540> asked<00:03:05.020> to

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
ultimately we're going to be asked to

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.770 
ultimately we're going to be asked to
settle<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.330> there's<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.750> be

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
settle that is that there's going to be

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.630 
settle that is that there's going to be
a<00:03:07.840> lot<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.170> miraculous<00:03:08.800> things<00:03:09.190> going<00:03:09.520> on

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
a lot of miraculous things going on

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.760 
a lot of miraculous things going on
maybe<00:03:09.910> even<00:03:10.209> aliens<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.290> things<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.709> that

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
maybe even aliens and things like that

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.160 
maybe even aliens and things like that
and<00:03:12.250> they're<00:03:12.850> going<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.120> basically<00:03:13.450> say<00:03:13.750> hey

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
and they're going to basically say hey

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.960 
and they're going to basically say hey

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.770 
been an awful long time things like that
that's<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:30.010> plan<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:31.090> following<00:03:31.420> is<00:03:31.570> what<00:03:31.750> I

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
that's the plan the following is what I

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.180 
that's the plan the following is what I
think<00:03:32.170> will<00:03:32.320> happen<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.650> keep<00:03:32.800> in<00:03:32.920> mind<00:03:33.100> it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
think will happen and keep in mind it

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.860 
think will happen and keep in mind it
could<00:03:33.310> happen<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:33.820> many<00:03:33.850> different<00:03:34.330> ways<00:03:34.510> and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
could happen so many different ways and

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.960 
could happen so many different ways and
I'm<00:03:35.260> probably<00:03:35.590> wrong<00:03:36.040> about<00:03:36.310> some<00:03:36.550> very<00:03:36.730> key

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
religions kind of had it right and they

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.689
