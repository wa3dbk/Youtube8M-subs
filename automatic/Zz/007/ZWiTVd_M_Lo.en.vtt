we randomly shoot a small object say a
marble<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.160> screen<00:00:23.840> we<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> pattern<00:00:25.410> on

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
marble at the screen we see a pattern on

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.890 
marble at the screen we see a pattern on
the<00:00:26.039> back<00:00:26.220> wall<00:00:26.519> where<00:00:27.180> they<00:00:27.390> went<00:00:27.599> through

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
the back wall where they went through

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.540 
the back wall where they went through
the<00:00:28.109> slit<00:00:28.380> then<00:00:28.800> hit<00:00:29.510> now<00:00:30.510> if<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.590> add<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> second

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the slit then hit now if we add a second

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.569 
the slit then hit now if we add a second
slit<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.840> would<00:00:33.989> expect<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> see<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.980> second

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579

slit we would expect to see a second
band<00:00:36.079> duplicated<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:39.770> now<00:00:40.879> let's

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
band duplicated to the right now let's

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.060 
band duplicated to the right now let's
look<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.300> waves<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:44.340> waves<00:00:44.610> hit<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.210> slit<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
look at waves the waves hit the slit and

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.180 
look at waves the waves hit the slit and
radiate<00:00:47.070> out<00:00:47.539> striking<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> back<00:00:48.870> wall<00:00:49.230> with

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
radiate out striking the back wall with

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
radiate out striking the back wall with
the<00:00:50.250> most<00:00:50.510> intensity<00:00:51.510> directly<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.680> line<00:00:52.739> with

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the most intensity directly in line with

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.720 
the most intensity directly in line with
the<00:00:53.910> slit<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:55.320> line<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.860> brightness<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the slit the line of brightness on the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.680 
the slit the line of brightness on the
back<00:00:57.149> screen<00:00:57.570> shows<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.710> intensity<00:00:59.420> this<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
back screen shows that intensity this is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.390 
back screen shows that intensity this is
similar<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.620> line<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.370> marbles<00:01:02.789> make<00:01:03.049> but

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
similar to the line the marbles make but

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.320 
similar to the line the marbles make but
when<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.670> add<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.540> second<00:01:07.080> slit<00:01:08.330> something

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
when we add the second slit something

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.679 
when we add the second slit something
different<00:01:09.900> happens<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.580> top<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.390> wave

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
different happens if the top of one wave

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.520 
different happens if the top of one wave
meets<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.650> bottom<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.369> another<00:01:14.850> wave<00:01:15.530> they

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
meets the bottom of another wave they

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.719 
meets the bottom of another wave they
cancel<00:01:17.070> each<00:01:17.159> other<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.619> now<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> an

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
cancel each other out so now there is an

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.320 
cancel each other out so now there is an
interference<00:01:21.299> pattern<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.409> back<00:01:22.590> wall

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
interference pattern on the back wall

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
interference pattern on the back wall
places<00:01:24.330> where<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> two<00:01:25.080> tops<00:01:25.500> meet<00:01:25.890> are<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
places where the two tops meet are the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.359 
places where the two tops meet are the
highest<00:01:27.000> intensity<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.350> bright<00:01:28.590> lines<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
highest intensity the bright lines and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.630 
highest intensity the bright lines and
where<00:01:29.970> they<00:01:30.119> cancel<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.500> nothing<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
where they cancel there is nothing so

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.410 
where they cancel there is nothing so
when<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.720> throw<00:01:34.079> things<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.850> matter

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
when we throw things that is matter

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.999 
when we throw things that is matter
through<00:01:37.350> two<00:01:37.740> slits<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.939> get<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.530> two<00:01:40.530> bands

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
through two slits we get this two bands

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.690 
through two slits we get this two bands
of<00:01:41.340> hits<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.200> with<00:01:43.200> waves<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:44.340> get<00:01:44.579> an

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of hits and with waves we get an

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.039 
of hits and with waves we get an
interference<00:01:45.240> pattern<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:46.110> many<00:01:46.710> bands<00:01:48.049> good

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
interference pattern of many bands good

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.030 
interference pattern of many bands good
so<00:01:49.500> far

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
so far

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.570 
so far
now<00:01:50.869> let's<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.409> quantum

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.790 

an<00:01:58.580> electron<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.630> a<00:02:00.050> tiny<00:02:00.740> tiny<00:02:01.400> bit<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.060> matter

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
an electron is a tiny tiny bit of matter

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.090 
an electron is a tiny tiny bit of matter
like<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:04.040> tiny<00:02:04.460> marble<00:02:05.350> let's<00:02:06.350> fire<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:06.650> stream

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
like a tiny marble let's fire a stream

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.810 
like a tiny marble let's fire a stream
through<00:02:07.520> one<00:02:07.760> slit<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:09.800> behaves<00:02:10.280> just<00:02:10.429> like

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
through one slit it behaves just like

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.910 
through one slit it behaves just like
the<00:02:11.240> marble<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.900> single<00:02:12.590> band<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:15.410> we<00:02:15.620> shoot

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
the marble a single band so if we shoot

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.030 
the marble a single band so if we shoot
these<00:02:16.220> tiny<00:02:16.670> bits<00:02:17.120> through<00:02:17.660> two<00:02:17.990> slits<00:02:18.350> we

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
these tiny bits through two slits we

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.220 
these tiny bits through two slits we
should<00:02:19.370> get<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.660> marbles<00:02:21.110> two<00:02:21.590> bands

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
should get like the marbles two bands

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.390 
should get like the marbles two bands
what<00:02:24.230> an<00:02:25.270> interference<00:02:26.270> pattern<00:02:26.860> we<00:02:27.860> fired

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
what an interference pattern we fired

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.620 
what an interference pattern we fired
electrons<00:02:29.170> tiny<00:02:30.170> bits<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.680> matter<00:02:30.890> through

electrons tiny bits of matter through

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.290 
electrons tiny bits of matter through
but<00:02:32.630> we<00:02:32.720> get<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> pattern<00:02:33.320> like<00:02:33.470> waves<00:02:34.030> not<00:02:35.030> like

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
but we get a pattern like waves not like

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.760 
but we get a pattern like waves not like
little<00:02:35.480> marbles<00:02:36.250> how<00:02:37.959> how<00:02:38.959> could<00:02:39.170> pieces<00:02:39.620> of

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
little marbles how how could pieces of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.130 
little marbles how how could pieces of
matter<00:02:40.040> create<00:02:40.970> an<00:02:41.180> interference<00:02:41.870> pattern

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
matter create an interference pattern

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.010 
matter create an interference pattern
like<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.709> wave<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:44.300> doesn't<00:02:45.110> make<00:02:45.380> sense<00:02:45.410> but

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
like a wave it doesn't make sense but

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.620 
like a wave it doesn't make sense but
physicists<00:02:48.020> are<00:02:48.260> clever<00:02:48.530> they<00:02:49.370> thought<00:02:49.730> maybe

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
physicists are clever they thought maybe

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.780 
physicists are clever they thought maybe
those<00:02:51.170> little<00:02:51.560> balls<00:02:51.739> are<00:02:52.100> bouncing<00:02:52.580> off<00:02:52.730> each

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
those little balls are bouncing off each

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.949 
those little balls are bouncing off each
other<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.540> creating<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.590> pattern<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.959> they

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
other and creating that pattern so they

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.860 
other and creating that pattern so they
decide<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.739> shoot<00:02:58.010> electrons<00:02:58.730> through<00:02:59.120> one<00:02:59.750> at

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870
