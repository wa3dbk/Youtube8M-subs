at about fish five we're taking up sixty

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.300 
at about fish five we're taking up sixty
five<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:43.950> far<00:03:44.630> works<00:03:45.630> great<00:03:45.959> nice<00:03:46.800> and<00:03:47.070> smooth

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
five so far works great nice and smooth

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.170 
five so far works great nice and smooth
now<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:49.590> yeah<00:03:50.450> it's<00:03:51.450> great<00:03:51.570> little<00:03:51.900> car<00:03:53.180> I'll

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
now so yeah it's great little car I'll

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.710 
now so yeah it's great little car I'll
start<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.810> up<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.050> maybe<00:03:55.200> drive<00:03:55.440> around

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
start it up and maybe drive around

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.880 
start it up and maybe drive around
second<00:03:58.250> doesn't<00:03:59.250> let<00:03:59.370> start<00:04:00.110> when<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.650> warm

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
second doesn't let start when it's warm

second doesn't let start when it's warm
or<00:04:02.070> cold<00:04:02.310> because<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.390> de<00:04:03.989> la<00:04:04.140> Rose<00:04:04.380> never

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
or cold because the de la Rose never

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.870 
or cold because the de la Rose never
work<00:04:05.700> right<00:04:05.820> white<00:04:06.180> right

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
if you ask me I would get a single carb

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.210 
if you ask me I would get a single carb
six<00:04:12.820> barrel<00:04:13.240> has<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.200> lot<00:04:14.410> more<00:04:14.440> power<00:04:14.800> in<00:04:15.070> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
six barrel has a lot more power in the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.760 
six barrel has a lot more power in the
bottom<00:04:15.790> end<00:04:15.940> these<00:04:16.930> like<00:04:17.170> to<00:04:17.290> have<00:04:17.380> power<00:04:17.560> in

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
bottom end these like to have power in

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.500 
bottom end these like to have power in
the<00:04:17.980> top<00:04:18.190> end<00:04:18.370> which<00:04:18.580> we<00:04:18.730> never<00:04:18.940> use<00:04:19.150> because

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
the top end which we never use because

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.040 
the top end which we never use because
of<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:21.010> old<00:04:21.190> world<00:04:21.340> car<00:04:21.640> that's<00:04:21.820> wicked<00:04:22.050> don't

of the old world car that's wicked don't
like<00:04:23.170> doing<00:04:23.410> that<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:25.600> here<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.930> fuel<00:04:26.170> pump

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
like doing that in here a fuel pump

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.820 
like doing that in here a fuel pump
there's<00:04:26.710> no<00:04:27.150> pump<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.660> engine<00:04:29.380> block<00:04:29.530> so

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
there's no pump in the engine block so

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.080 
there's no pump in the engine block so
it's<00:04:30.010> upright<00:04:30.630> both<00:04:31.630> Neath<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.200> gas<00:04:32.770> tank

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:13.529 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:26.689 

a<00:05:13.589> fun<00:05:14.369> little<00:05:14.519> car

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.640 

brakes<00:05:27.699> don't<00:05:27.910> like<00:05:28.090> working

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
brakes don't like working

brakes don't like working
we<00:05:29.949> need<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:30.220> bleed<00:05:30.460> them<00:05:30.669> and<00:05:30.850> put<00:05:31.060> more<00:05:31.240> fluid

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
we need to bleed them and put more fluid

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:40.050 
we need to bleed them and put more fluid
and<00:05:31.919> that's<00:05:32.919> pretty<00:05:33.070> much<00:05:33.160> all<00:05:33.400> it<00:05:36.389> runs<00:05:37.389> good

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.570 

but<00:05:40.389> these<00:05:40.509> carburetors<00:05:41.020> have<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.259> weird<00:05:42.190> fuel

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
but these carburetors have a weird fuel

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.779 
but these carburetors have a weird fuel
pressure<00:05:42.759> very<00:05:43.539> sensitive<00:05:44.400> we<00:05:45.400> had<00:05:45.520> to<00:05:45.639> change

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
pressure very sensitive we had to change

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.430 
pressure very sensitive we had to change
out<00:05:45.970> fuel<00:05:46.180> pumps<00:05:46.419> several<00:05:47.080> times<00:05:47.259> because

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
out fuel pumps several times because

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.260 
out fuel pumps several times because
they<00:05:47.949> never<00:05:48.130> liked<00:05:48.340> going<00:05:48.520> right<00:05:48.789> we<00:05:49.060> finally

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
found one that works good takes about

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.180 
found one that works good takes about
three<00:05:52.630> pounds<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:52.960> pressure<00:05:53.199> with<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:53.949> fuel

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
three pounds of pressure with the fuel

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.120 
three pounds of pressure with the fuel
in<00:05:55.120> these<00:05:55.330> carburetors<00:05:57.539> yeah<00:05:58.860> great<00:05:59.860> clean

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
around it and it seemed to clear it

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.320 
around it and it seemed to clear it
right<00:06:14.590> up<00:06:15.539> on<00:06:16.539> all<00:06:16.900> one<00:06:17.650> little<00:06:18.010> thing<00:06:18.190> but<00:06:19.180> if
