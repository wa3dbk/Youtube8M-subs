1960s<00:03:21.750> prototype<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.340> it's<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.760> same<00:03:24.030> colors

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450

orange<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.120> dome<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> little<00:03:28.170> bit

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
orange on the dome is a little bit

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.350

deeper orange the Reggie's on the guns
are<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.599> much<00:03:31.019> more<00:03:31.319> vibrant<00:03:31.560> red<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.489> same

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
are a much more vibrant red so same

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.300 
are a much more vibrant red so same
colors<00:03:33.900> pretty<00:03:34.260> much<00:03:34.440> used<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.040> they<00:03:35.190> are

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
colors pretty much used but they are

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:46.300 
colors pretty much used but they are
just<00:03:35.459> more<00:03:35.760> vibrant<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.450> time<00:03:36.720> around

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.360 

and<00:03:46.420> lastly<00:03:47.420> let's<00:03:47.750> take<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.020> look<00:03:48.319> at<00:03:48.500> inferno

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
and lastly let's take a look at inferno

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.520 
and lastly let's take a look at inferno
the<00:03:49.640> flame<00:03:49.970> man<00:03:50.270> of<00:03:50.480> mercury

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
the flame man of mercury

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.040 
the flame man of mercury
now<00:03:51.890> this<00:03:52.130> one's<00:03:52.400> probably<00:03:53.000> got<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.420> biggest

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
now this one's probably got the biggest

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.100 
now this one's probably got the biggest
change<00:03:54.410> out<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.980> group<00:03:55.250> his<00:03:56.120> head<00:03:56.480> gun

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
change out of the group his head gun

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.220 
change out of the group his head gun
chest<00:03:57.890> button<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.489> back<00:03:59.000> flames<00:03:59.420> have<00:03:59.900> now

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
chest button and back flames have now

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.250 
chest button and back flames have now
been<00:04:00.470> cast<00:04:00.800> in<00:04:01.130> clear<00:04:01.520> red<00:04:02.000> orange<00:04:02.599> instead<00:04:03.200> of

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
been cast in clear red orange instead of

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.350 
been cast in clear red orange instead of
being<00:04:03.590> painted<00:04:04.220> with<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.400> red<00:04:04.760> orange<00:04:05.060> flame

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
being painted with that red orange flame

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.690 
being painted with that red orange flame
look<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:06.319> that<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.650> huge<00:04:07.130> difference<00:04:07.370> when

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
look so that is a huge difference when

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.370 
look so that is a huge difference when
comparing<00:04:08.120> him<00:04:08.300> to<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.450> original<00:04:08.989> figure

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
comparing him to the original figure

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.740 
comparing him to the original figure
and<00:04:09.650> those<00:04:10.220> translucent<00:04:11.000> colors<00:04:11.300> just<00:04:11.510> seemed

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
and those translucent colors just seemed

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.900 
and those translucent colors just seemed
to<00:04:11.870> work<00:04:11.989> so<00:04:12.380> much<00:04:12.680> better<00:04:12.980> for<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.310> fire<00:04:13.610> guy

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
to work so much better for a fire guy

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.659 
to work so much better for a fire guy
like<00:04:14.180> this<00:04:15.010> one<00:04:16.010> of<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.160> other<00:04:16.280> things<00:04:16.459> that<00:04:16.579> I

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
like this one of the other things that I

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.039 
like this one of the other things that I
think<00:04:16.850> is<00:04:16.940> really<00:04:17.239> neat<00:04:17.419> is<00:04:17.450> if<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:17.810> look<00:04:17.959> at

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
think is really neat is if you look at

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.990 
think is really neat is if you look at
the<00:04:18.139> back<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.590> helmet<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.669> back<00:04:19.850> of

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
the back of the helmet and the back of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.340 
the back of the helmet and the back of
