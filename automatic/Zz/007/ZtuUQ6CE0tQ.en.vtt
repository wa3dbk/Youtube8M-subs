00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.210 
time left and for them to go from like
50<00:03:15.160> yards<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:16.209> 10<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:17.080> like<00:03:17.620> amount<00:03:18.100> of

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
50 yards to 10 in that like amount of

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.740 
50 yards to 10 in that like amount of
time<00:03:18.490> where<00:03:18.820> there<00:03:18.910> wasn't<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.360> lot<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.570> time

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
time where there wasn't a lot of time

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.910 
time where there wasn't a lot of time
left<00:03:20.080> I<00:03:20.140> really<00:03:20.500> thought<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.770> they<00:03:20.860> were

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
left I really thought that they were

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.230 
left I really thought that they were
back<00:03:21.130> in<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.490> they<00:03:21.550> were<00:03:21.640> gonna<00:03:21.760> take<00:03:22.000> it

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
back in it and they were gonna take it

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.449 
back in it and they were gonna take it
and<00:03:22.450> then<00:03:22.630> right<00:03:23.470> at<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.650> end<00:03:23.740> like<00:03:24.250> around

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
and then right at the end like around

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.360 
and then right at the end like around
the<00:03:24.610> 25<00:03:25.060> second<00:03:25.420> mark<00:03:25.630> they<00:03:26.620> threw<00:03:27.040> it

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370

I<00:03:33.400> was<00:03:33.730> proud<00:03:33.910> of<00:03:33.970> Seattle<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.630> think<00:03:34.690> they<00:03:34.959> did

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
I was proud of Seattle I think they did

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.550 
I was proud of Seattle I think they did
really<00:03:35.260> good<00:03:35.440> their<00:03:35.650> defense<00:03:35.980> was<00:03:36.420> amazing

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
really good their defense was amazing

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.479 
really good their defense was amazing
but<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:38.620> was<00:03:38.890> just<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.070> little<00:03:39.190> bit<00:03:39.340> better

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
but that was just a little bit better

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.850 
but that was just a little bit better
and<00:03:39.760> I<00:03:39.910> accept<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.840> think<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.800> lot<00:03:42.100> of<00:03:42.390> the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
and I accept that I think a lot of the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.130 
and I accept that I think a lot of the
defense<00:03:45.640> at<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.850> beginning<00:03:46.120> was<00:03:46.600> cuz<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.900> lane

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
defense at the beginning was cuz of lane

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.260 
defense at the beginning was cuz of lane
and<00:03:47.560> when<00:03:48.070> Lane<00:03:48.280> got<00:03:48.430> pulled<00:03:48.670> out<00:03:48.790> for<00:03:49.000> his<00:03:49.120> arm

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
and when Lane got pulled out for his arm

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:56.670 
and when Lane got pulled out for his arm
I<00:03:49.450> was<00:03:49.600> like<00:03:51.600> but<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.720> my<00:03:55.720> reaction<00:03:56.260> to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
I was like but that is my reaction to

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.530
