the level right now it's very clean and
well<00:01:12.960> lit<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.229> pristine<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.399> battle

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640

rages on and on it's going to get more
and<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:16.830> damaged<00:01:17.690> so<00:01:18.690> in<00:01:19.009> for<00:01:20.009> example<00:01:20.340> we

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
and more damaged so in for example we

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.309 
and more damaged so in for example we
have<00:01:20.580> integrated<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.479> lot<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.750> choreograph<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
have integrated a lot of choreograph the

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.199 
have integrated a lot of choreograph the
winds<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.979> sandbox<00:01:23.220> brilliant<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.149> you

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
winds in the sandbox brilliant so you

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.510 
winds in the sandbox brilliant so you
have<00:01:24.599> here<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.020> example<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.679> daily<00:01:26.190> unit

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
have here for example the daily unit

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.460 
have here for example the daily unit
pinger<00:01:26.910> coming<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.360> which<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.289> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
pinger coming in which is the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.460 
pinger coming in which is the
choreography<00:01:28.890> itself<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.780> important

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
choreography itself but the important

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.230 
choreography itself but the important
thing<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:32.069> unlike<00:01:32.520> your<00:01:32.670> typical<00:01:32.789> games

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
thing is like unlike your typical games

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.790 
thing is like unlike your typical games

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
need all the powers of the Nanosuit in

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.719 
need all the powers of the Nanosuit in
order<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.810> survive<00:01:55.099> one<00:01:56.099> thing<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.550> going

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
order to survive one thing that's going

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.160 
order to survive one thing that's going
to<00:01:56.759> happen<00:01:56.849> here<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.390> we're<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:57.959> to<00:01:58.020> look

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to happen here is we're going to look

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.660 
to happen here is we're going to look
around<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> corner<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:58.979> figure<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.429> what

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
around the corner and figure out what

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.339 
around the corner and figure out what
weapons<00:02:00.030> are<00:02:00.209> around<00:02:00.569> the<00:02:00.690> sandbox<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.289> we

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
weapons are around the sandbox that we

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:02.719 
weapons are around the sandbox that we
can<00:02:01.500> use<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.649> take<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:02.069> the<00:02:02.190> pinger<00:02:02.429> because

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
can use to take out the pinger because

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.899 
can use to take out the pinger because
the<00:02:02.970> shotgun<00:02:03.360> isn't<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:03.780> of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
the shotgun isn't kind of

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.489 
the shotgun isn't kind of
on<00:02:03.969> it<00:02:04.149> so<00:02:04.689> we're<00:02:04.840> going<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:05.020> jump<00:02:05.200> over<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
on it so we're going to jump over the

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:06.959 
on it so we're going to jump over the
balcony<00:02:05.649> here<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.130> use<00:02:06.249> the<00:02:06.340> power<00:02:06.490> jump<00:02:06.880> of

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
balcony here and use the power jump of

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.820 
balcony here and use the power jump of
the<00:02:06.999> Nanosuit<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:07.960> across<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.410> space<00:02:08.649> and

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
the Nanosuit to get across the space and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.660 
the Nanosuit to get across the space and
survive<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.399> get<00:02:09.610> better<00:02:09.759> weaponry<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:12.459> I'm

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
survive and get better weaponry and I'm

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.979 
survive and get better weaponry and I'm
taken<00:02:13.000> quite<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.239> beating<00:02:13.330> here<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.930> mean

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
taken quite a beating here so I mean

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.390 
taken quite a beating here so I mean
what<00:02:14.379> I<00:02:14.410> really<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.190> use<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
what I really have to do is use the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.160 
what I really have to do is use the
powers<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:15.940> suit<00:02:16.209> like<00:02:16.420> stealth<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.959> order

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
powers of the suit like stealth in order

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.630 
powers of the suit like stealth in order
to<00:02:17.260> get<00:02:17.410> around<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.799> side<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.190> finger<00:02:18.489> and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
to get around the side of the finger and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.610 
to get around the side of the finger and
get<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.269> good<00:02:19.420> firing<00:02:19.690> position<00:02:20.230> in<00:02:20.319> order<00:02:20.530> to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
get a good firing position in order to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.809 
get a good firing position in order to
flank<00:02:20.830> him<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.190> I'm<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.430> hit<00:02:21.549> him<00:02:21.670> here
