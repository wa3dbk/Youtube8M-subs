trimmed<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.820> loosened<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.660> lot<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.900> things<00:01:59.080> to

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
trimmed and loosened a lot of things to

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.990 
trimmed and loosened a lot of things to
kind<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.410> save<00:01:59.590> time<00:01:59.860> here<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:00.340> what<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.670> want

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.430 
your tech light and your purse is errs
now<00:02:09.610> if<00:02:09.729> you've<00:02:09.850> ever<00:02:10.000> had<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.180> shotgun<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.899> you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
now if you've ever had a shotgun and you

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.530 
now if you've ever had a shotgun and you
know<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.710> forearm<00:02:12.160> nut<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.880> there<00:02:13.270> it's<00:02:13.420> got

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
know the forearm nut on there it's got

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.730 
know the forearm nut on there it's got
these<00:02:13.660> weird<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.290> got<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.500> slip

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
these weird little it's got to slip

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.800 
these weird little it's got to slip
there<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.040> slip<00:02:15.250> there<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:16.570> have<00:02:16.720> to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
there and slip there and you have to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.300 
there and slip there and you have to
take<00:02:16.960> something<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.680> either<00:02:17.830> lay<00:02:18.100> across

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
take something to either lay across

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.240 
take something to either lay across
there<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:19.570> turn<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.900> well<00:02:20.320> in<00:02:20.560> this<00:02:20.920> case<00:02:21.070> you

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
there to turn it well in this case you

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.050 
there to turn it well in this case you
can't<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.580> lay<00:02:21.700> anything<00:02:21.910> across

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
can't really lay anything across

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.310 
can't really lay anything across
therefore<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.510> recess<00:02:22.870> done<00:02:23.050> or<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.230> you

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
therefore this recess done or so you

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.590 
therefore this recess done or so you
take<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> pair<00:02:23.710> of<00:02:23.740> metal<00:02:23.890> scissors<00:02:24.600> or

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
take a pair of metal scissors or

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.390 
take a pair of metal scissors or
whatever<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.530> pair<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.830> needle<00:02:27.280> nose<00:02:27.370> pliers

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
whatever a pair of needle nose pliers

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.910 
whatever a pair of needle nose pliers
would<00:02:27.820> probably<00:02:28.150> work<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.680> start

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
would probably work and you start

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.330 
would probably work and you start
turning<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.450> then<00:02:31.690> just<00:02:31.840> unscrews<00:02:32.340> now

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
turning it and then just unscrews now

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.830 
turning it and then just unscrews now
you<00:02:33.400> get<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.060> loose<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.330> then<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.630> can<00:02:34.750> go<00:02:34.810> to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
you get so loose and then you can go to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.750 
you get so loose and then you can go to
your<00:02:34.990> fingers<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.130> set<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.160> aside<00:02:39.430> do

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
your fingers like that set that aside do

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.730 
your fingers like that set that aside do
not<00:02:39.940> throw<00:02:40.300> anything<00:02:40.600> away<00:02:40.990> at<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:41.470> point

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
not throw anything away at this point

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.500 
not throw anything away at this point
now<00:02:42.310> see<00:02:42.460> that<00:02:42.580> little<00:02:42.760> booger<00:02:42.910> inside<00:02:43.240> there

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
now see that little booger inside there

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.840 
now see that little booger inside there
that<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.650> source<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.040> problem<00:02:45.070> that<00:02:45.700> is

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
that is the source of a problem that is

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.000 
that is the source of a problem that is
the<00:02:45.940> circuit<00:02:46.210> board<00:02:46.420> don't<00:02:47.080> need<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.470> you

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
the circuit board don't need that you

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.430 
the circuit board don't need that you

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
want the rubber boot which I've already

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.899 
want the rubber boot which I've already
trimmed<00:03:41.599> which<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:41.930> why<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.139> looks<00:03:42.319> like<00:03:42.409> this

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
trimmed which is why it looks like this

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
thing with the little raised edges right

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.780 
thing with the little raised edges right
there<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.260> this<00:05:56.260> little<00:05:56.740> booger<00:05:56.950> your<00:05:57.280> spring

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
there and this little booger your spring

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.860 
there and this little booger your spring
that<00:05:57.880> you<00:05:58.000> removed<00:05:58.210> from<00:05:58.300> your<00:05:58.510> cheapo

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
that you removed from your cheapo

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.980 
that you removed from your cheapo
flashlight<00:05:59.460> and<00:06:00.460> you<00:06:00.520> stick<00:06:00.790> this<00:06:00.970> up<00:06:01.510> through

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
flashlight and you stick this up through

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.320 
flashlight and you stick this up through
like<00:06:02.500> that<00:06:02.710> now<00:06:03.490> what<00:06:03.640> this<00:06:03.760> is<00:06:03.820> going<00:06:04.060> to<00:06:04.120> do

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
like that now what this is going to do

okay and you want to put those little

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.980 
okay and you want to put those little
pegs<00:06:11.500> on<00:06:11.800> either<00:06:12.460> side<00:06:12.910> of<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.420> clicky<00:06:13.750> it's

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990

retaining cap D just unscrewed from this

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.470 
retaining cap D just unscrewed from this
thing<00:06:23.710> with<00:06:23.860> the<00:06:23.920> scissors<00:06:24.220> and<00:06:24.340> it<00:06:25.330> got<00:06:25.450> a

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
thing with the scissors and it got a

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.070 
thing with the scissors and it got a
little<00:06:25.600> little<00:06:26.530> wire<00:06:26.910> bit<00:06:27.910> of<00:06:28.120> the<00:06:28.720> coil

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
little little wire bit of the coil

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.650 
little little wire bit of the coil
spring<00:06:29.530> there<00:06:29.770> sticking<00:06:30.580> out<00:06:30.730> the<00:06:30.850> bottom<00:06:30.970> now

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
spring there sticking out the bottom now

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.500 
spring there sticking out the bottom now
this<00:06:31.960> needs<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.890> contact<00:06:33.370> this<00:06:33.790> spring<00:06:34.210> so<00:06:34.480> you

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
this needs to contact this spring so you

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.910 
this needs to contact this spring so you
will<00:06:34.720> complete<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.080> circuit<00:06:35.440> goes<00:06:35.560> from<00:06:35.710> here

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
will complete the circuit goes from here

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.070 
will complete the circuit goes from here
to<00:06:35.980> the<00:06:36.220> spring<00:06:36.520> to<00:06:37.090> the<00:06:37.120> cliquey<00:06:37.510> to<00:06:37.780> the<00:06:37.900> side

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
to the spring to the cliquey to the side

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.380 
to the spring to the cliquey to the side
of<00:06:38.170> the<00:06:38.230> frame<00:06:38.520> so<00:06:39.520> you<00:06:39.550> just<00:06:39.760> put<00:06:40.000> it<00:06:40.150> on<00:06:40.210> there

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
of the frame so you just put it on there

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.260 
of the frame so you just put it on there
like<00:06:40.420> so<00:06:41.070> squish<00:06:42.070> it<00:06:42.250> all<00:06:42.370> down<00:06:42.580> kind<00:06:43.180> of

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
like so squish it all down kind of

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.880 
like so squish it all down kind of
thread<00:06:43.750> it<00:06:43.840> under<00:06:44.050> here<00:06:44.200> phille<00:06:44.380> be<00:06:44.560> careful

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
thread it under here phille be careful

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.050 
thread it under here phille be careful
not<00:06:45.010> to<00:06:45.190> throw<00:06:45.400> through<00:06:45.640> this<00:06:45.790> because<00:06:45.970> this

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
not to throw through this because this

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.080 
not to throw through this because this
is<00:06:46.210> plastic<00:06:46.840> it<00:06:47.050> easily<00:06:47.440> cross<00:06:47.680> threads<00:06:48.090> and

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
is plastic it easily cross threads and

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.970 
is plastic it easily cross threads and
this<00:06:49.300> could<00:06:49.570> be<00:06:49.780> a<00:06:50.190> little<00:06:51.190> tricky<00:06:51.960> now

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
this could be a little tricky now

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.350 
this could be a little tricky now
because<00:06:53.980> it's<00:06:54.190> taking<00:06:54.880> up<00:06:55.000> a<00:06:55.090> different

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
because it's taking up a different

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.970 
because it's taking up a different
amount<00:06:55.570> of<00:06:55.720> space<00:06:55.990> it's<00:06:56.290> not<00:06:56.500> going<00:06:56.710> to<00:06:56.770> thread

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
amount of space it's not going to thread

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.130 
amount of space it's not going to thread
in<00:06:57.130> there<00:06:57.250> as<00:06:57.460> deep<00:06:57.670> as<00:06:57.850> it<00:06:57.880> did<00:06:58.150> before<00:06:58.300> it's

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
in there as deep as it did before it's

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.570 
in there as deep as it did before it's
probably<00:06:59.650> going<00:06:59.800> to<00:06:59.860> stick<00:07:00.040> up<00:07:00.220> just<00:07:00.430> a<00:07:00.550> little

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
probably going to stick up just a little

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.290 
probably going to stick up just a little
bit<00:07:00.790> like<00:07:01.000> that<00:07:01.050> that's<00:07:02.050> okay

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
bit like that that's okay

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.790 
bit like that that's okay
you're<00:07:04.600> still<00:07:04.870> gonna<00:07:05.020> have<00:07:05.199> plenty<00:07:05.350> of<00:07:05.530> room

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
you're still gonna have plenty of room

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.320 
you're still gonna have plenty of room

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
for your battery pack declare because

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.939 
for your battery pack declare because
this<00:07:07.479> is<00:07:07.630> on<00:07:07.780> a<00:07:07.810> spring<00:07:08.259> as<00:07:08.380> well<00:07:08.500> so<00:07:08.770> has

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:08.949 
this is on a spring as well so has

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:10.550 
this is on a spring as well so has
plenty<00:07:09.310> of<00:07:09.340> room<00:07:09.490> to<00:07:09.550> move

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
plenty of room to move

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.020 
plenty of room to move
now<00:07:11.560> you<00:07:11.620> just<00:07:11.740> resemble<00:07:12.250> screw<00:07:12.639> back<00:07:12.849> in

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
now you just resemble screw back in

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.710 
now you just resemble screw back in
there

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.850

if you don't over-tighten this might

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.080 
if you don't over-tighten this might
turn<00:07:21.080> it<00:07:21.170> back<00:07:21.320> a<00:07:21.350> little<00:07:21.560> bit

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
turn it back a little bit

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.540 
turn it back a little bit
tah-dah<00:07:23.090> you<00:07:24.020> got<00:07:24.200> it<00:07:24.320> working<00:07:24.440> clicking<00:07:25.010> and
