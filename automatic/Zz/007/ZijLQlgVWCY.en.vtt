00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
when they were
doing<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> road<00:01:57.630> track<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.289> they're

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
doing the road track you know they're

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.590 
doing the road track you know they're
building<00:01:58.679> a<00:01:58.829> sport<00:01:59.789> track<00:01:59.969> across<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.359> street

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
building a sport track across the street

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.200 
building a sport track across the street
and<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.859> thought<00:02:02.069> about<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.490> car<00:02:02.759> being<00:02:02.939> used

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and we thought about this car being used

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.200 
and we thought about this car being used
for<00:02:03.359> that<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:04.409> could<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.679> used<00:02:04.950> as<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> trainer

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
for that it could be used as a trainer

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.419 
for that it could be used as a trainer
that<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:07.049> used<00:02:07.289> as<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> hot<00:02:07.859> lap<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.310> know

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that can be used as a hot lap you know

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.320 
that can be used as a hot lap you know
for<00:02:08.549> instance<00:02:08.640> you've<00:02:08.879> got<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.149> great

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
for instance you've got some great

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.509 
for instance you've got some great
drivers<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:09.959> people<00:02:10.860> come<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.190> pick<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
drivers here people come and pick up the

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.190 
drivers here people come and pick up the
car<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.819> say<00:02:11.910> hey<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:12.599> about<00:02:12.629> we<00:02:12.810> do<00:02:12.900> some<00:02:13.049> hot

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
car and say hey how about we do some hot

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.380 
car and say hey how about we do some hot
laps<00:02:13.349> over<00:02:13.709> at<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.830> track<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.209> would

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
laps over at the track and so this would

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.940 
laps over at the track and so this would
be<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> great<00:02:15.720> car<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.319> you<00:02:16.620> know<00:02:16.739> it's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
be a great car for that you know it's

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.920 
be a great car for that you know it's
caged<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.700> harnesses<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.450> all<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.690> stuff

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
caged and harnesses and all that stuff

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.559 
caged and harnesses and all that stuff
and<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.459> was<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.610> idea<00:02:20.970> we<00:02:21.330> were<00:02:21.420> gonna

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
and so that was the idea we were gonna

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.570 
and so that was the idea we were gonna
you<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.019> actually<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.040> know<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.310> idea

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
you know actually but you know the idea

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.890 
you know actually but you know the idea
was<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.849> was<00:02:23.879> gonna<00:02:24.120> run<00:02:24.299> when<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.720> track

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
was it was gonna run when the track

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900 
was it was gonna run when the track
opened<00:02:25.319> not<00:02:25.739> necessarily<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> first<00:02:26.370> car<00:02:26.730> but

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
opened not necessarily the first car but

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.979 
opened not necessarily the first car but
it<00:02:26.970> was<00:02:27.060> gonna<00:02:27.150> be<00:02:27.299> one<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.569> ran<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
it was gonna be one that ran on the

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.440 
it was gonna be one that ran on the
track<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.680> then<00:02:29.099> also<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.489> possibility<00:02:30.209> would

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
track and then also a possibility would

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.910 
track and then also a possibility would
be<00:02:30.510> when<00:02:30.720> people<00:02:30.989> come<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.500> pick<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.769> their

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
be when people come and pick up their

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.100 
be when people come and pick up their
car<00:02:32.069> here<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:33.150> like<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> pro<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.780> take<00:02:33.989> him

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
car here and they like a pro to take him

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.600 
car here and they like a pro to take him
around<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.650> give<00:02:34.799> him<00:02:34.920> some<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.340> know<00:02:35.430> give

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
around to give him some you know give

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.729 
around to give him some you know give
them<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.940> some<00:02:36.030> beginner<00:02:36.810> lessons<00:02:37.260> how<00:02:37.709> to

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
them just some beginner lessons how to

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.009 
them just some beginner lessons how to
apex<00:02:38.220> how<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.519> exit<00:02:39.030> entry<00:02:39.420> points<00:02:39.750> all<00:02:39.870> that

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
apex how to exit entry points all that

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.630 
apex how to exit entry points all that
kind<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.230> stuff<00:02:40.349> this<00:02:40.890> would<00:02:41.040> be<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.160> great<00:02:41.370> cart

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
kind of stuff this would be a great cart

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.759 
kind of stuff this would be a great cart
to<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.120> that's<00:02:42.269> already<00:02:42.540> built<00:02:42.720> for<00:02:42.989> it

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
to do that's already built for it

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.199 
to do that's already built for it
didn't<00:02:44.190> really<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.519> do<00:02:44.610> anything<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:45.060> it

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
didn't really have to do anything to it

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.819 
didn't really have to do anything to it
to<00:02:45.299> make<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.569> safe<00:02:45.720> or<00:02:45.930> anything<00:02:46.170> like<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.440> so

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
to make it safe or anything like that so

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.490 
to make it safe or anything like that so
that<00:02:47.670> was<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> idea<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.450> more<00:02:48.780> importantly<00:02:49.230> I

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
that was the idea but more importantly I

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.110 
that was the idea but more importantly I
was<00:02:50.099> gonna<00:02:50.220> be<00:02:50.370> able<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.609> be<00:02:50.670> able<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.849> come<00:02:51.030> up

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
was gonna be able to be able to come up

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.520 
was gonna be able to be able to come up
here<00:02:51.269> whenever<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.629> wanted<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.079> maybe<00:02:52.290> take<00:02:52.500> a

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
here whenever I wanted and maybe take a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.599 
here whenever I wanted and maybe take a
lap<00:02:52.739> or<00:02:52.859> two<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.859> that<00:02:55.859> kind<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.220> pushed<00:02:56.430> me<00:02:56.519> I'm

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
lap or two so that kind of pushed me I'm

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
like you know what so it's not really

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.009 
like you know what so it's not really
leaving<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.890> family<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.519> but<00:03:00.209> now<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.810> can

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019

go drive it when I want so you know so I

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.089 
go drive it when I want so you know so I
was<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.139> was<00:03:04.290> thinking<00:03:04.560> maybe<00:03:04.650> I've<00:03:04.829> come<00:03:05.010> in

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
was I was thinking maybe I've come in

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.410 
was I was thinking maybe I've come in
for<00:03:05.220> once<00:03:05.370> or<00:03:05.459> twice<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.700> year<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.090> know<00:03:06.389> and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
for once or twice a year you know and

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.660 
for once or twice a year you know and
maybe<00:03:06.989> make<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> few<00:03:07.440> laps<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.430> hole

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
maybe make a few laps it's in this hole

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.420 
maybe make a few laps it's in this hole
somewhere<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.870> yeah<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:10.349> guess<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.920> uncovered

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
somewhere and yeah I guess I uncovered

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.240 
somewhere and yeah I guess I uncovered
the<00:03:11.489> first<00:03:11.700> piece<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:12.269> know<00:03:12.450> late
