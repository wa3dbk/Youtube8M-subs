this<00:00:38.940> pedal<00:00:39.270> has<00:00:39.300> two<00:00:39.540> effects<00:00:39.840> loops

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
this pedal has two effects loops

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.709 
this pedal has two effects loops
I<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.829> loop<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.670> know<00:00:41.730> send<00:00:41.969> retune<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I have loop a you know send retune a and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.170 
I have loop a you know send retune a and
send<00:00:42.960> return<00:00:43.290> B<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.280> master<00:00:44.820> input

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
send return B and then a master input

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.119 
send return B and then a master input
and<00:00:45.360> master<00:00:45.719> output<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.500> basically<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:46.950> tire

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and master output so basically your tire

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.010 
and master output so basically your tire
goes<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.640> side<00:00:47.879> I'll<00:00:48.420> deliver<00:00:48.809> your

goes in one side I'll deliver your
amplifier<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.950> two<00:00:50.129> effects

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
amplifier and then you have two effects

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.209 
amplifier and then you have two effects
sends<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.289> two<00:00:52.500> knobs<00:00:52.710> each

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
of these volume knobs corresponds with

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.099 
of these volume knobs corresponds with
each<00:00:55.379> sense<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.640> an<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.180> knob<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.660> B<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.050> a

what I think makes this puddle so cool

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.090 
what I think makes this puddle so cool
is<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.640> mix<00:01:36.049> option<00:01:37.049> what<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> mix<00:01:37.710> option

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
is the mix option what the mix option

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.429 
is the mix option what the mix option
allows<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.820> run<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.450> both<00:01:40.020> effects

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
allows you to do is run to both effects

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.530 
allows you to do is run to both effects
sends<00:01:40.710> at<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> same<00:01:41.009> time<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> mix<00:01:42.240> them

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
sends at the same time and mix them

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
sends at the same time and mix them
together<00:01:42.810> mix<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> sounds<00:01:43.950> together<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.790> why

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
overdrive pedal and then loop those back

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
stacked on top of each other so separate

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.650 
stacked on top of each other so separate

two separate sounds and blend the sounds

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.050 
two separate sounds and blend the sounds
together<00:04:47.960> so<00:04:48.770> maybe<00:04:48.980> you<00:04:49.070> have<00:04:49.190> one<00:04:49.430> pedal

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
together so maybe you have one pedal

really brittle you can stick them

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.870 
really brittle you can stick them
together<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.350> see<00:04:54.710> how<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.920> sounds<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.760> know

together and see how the sounds you know

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.870 
together and see how the sounds you know
work<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.300> you<00:04:56.360> can<00:04:56.540> create<00:04:56.810> your<00:04:56.870> own<00:04:56.930> super
