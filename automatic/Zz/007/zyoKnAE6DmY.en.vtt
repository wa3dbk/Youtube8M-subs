00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.270
 lizard like these we are going to continue with the trend hoisted today tizado 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.740
 I want to make a list that is very classic, especially in the area 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.009

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.800
 acted that one also has a very difficult thing this is in itself we made of 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.170
 down ingredients percent but nothing very complex to get 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.590
 and what we can not get can always be replaced later is a stew that 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.740
 it is characterized because it adapts to each of them 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.470
 of the ingredients that the different countries are finding and in turn in the 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.130
 different regions of each of the countries so it's very very versatile and 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.310
 Really 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.050
 efe aunt very rich and we're going to enjoy a lot prevents it in this 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.379
 case how to use different press carmen to make it lizard 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.069
 let's see a little bit of charque jarque de carne seca dry meat with salt 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.019
 state that if we do not get everything we do not have it this way 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.470
 we can tell how it is done 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.200
 if it can be with beef with monterrey veal community a little 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.630
 of 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.140
 pork ribs 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.670
 and I can also be pork pulp any pork that can 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.030
 get and we will use gore pochi model with these three meats go 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.160
 to use vlado gudelj r protein g plus this after the garnish with 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.890
 a wide range of 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.050
 by the way the axis such as for example some pumpkin a bit of potatoes something 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.550
 of sweet potatoes something else I got a smart cassava and another in the market 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.410
 I have not learned that we can also use them to be neutralized and 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.249
 notice that in this case I have a banana and the afternoon 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:47.010
 it is highly because in some regions air also banana 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.230
 and yesterday walking in quantum silver I said 'well let's add a banana efe 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.960
 but they were absolutely optional city has a value europe is not added 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.380
 banana what it generates is that to start a little the broth there is nothing so 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.520
 sweet because it is green and it is quite fibrous in this case the banana place 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.180
 I sent it to give a banana leave but not to do it is very intense so 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.330
 well it was the most complicated of dt that tells me they were human strain bacon 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.599
 smoked the charque the charque but 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.959
 it really is very easy to do it you can do it's outside do at home 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.980
 from one week to another we can practically not start having 1 uncharted 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.630
 It is even very easy to build a team store once it is done 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.750
 alcides and the increase of 100 do so can the clot piece of meat 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.459
 that is not very tender aguirre and that it is enough both happens to be 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.120
 quickly the process of very simple salting of agoco eroski beginning 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.360
 we have to penetration as you know term we replace by a meat cut meat 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.040
 like we were going to the butcher shop and tenth in the ovifem blame what 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.920
 get cheap from Carmen 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.440
 because it's a long cooking process so if we only get in 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.760
 kforvo kfor currently baltar equal for example rabo circuses and morgado abaratÃ³ 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.710
 well we put in the other and we would have enough cooking time 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.730
 so that they close and followed in the afternoon and we have all that on the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.710
 diagnosis that we give this kind of individuals good very well so with 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.280
 a ticket that called correct strategy giaccobe how much does this make 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.070
 American food know head to see 35 with 25 of the cost for 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.240
 four portions circus lizard 8 with 81 cervelli cost was for six delegates 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.000
 and coaches and nothing exclaimed using three different types of meat what 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.749
 we have to keep in mind is that 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:41.989
 we use small portions of meat video an entire village has a kilo of 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.049
 beef or a kilo carmen sow we want small portions so that 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.339
 reach for all so that we can dary light of course that the vegetables by 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:54.589
 baroque silt pacairigua recerca tovar is a complete and convincing dish good 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.739
