00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.700
 fair this year and I know that in the uploaded 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.190
 a video writing has not come to me 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.010
 component of many problems if they 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.540
 wants in these three days I will have 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.580
 then I will be able to upload 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.130
 regularly I will have to download 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.380
 all the programs and all that but 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.569
 guys today I come to tell you the 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.839
 novelties that have surprised me so 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:28.029
 that to see from career mode that I 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.220
 love to play and with these 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.649
 updates that will have fifa 16 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.500
 it will be excellent 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.950
 so let's start good as the year 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.170
 past well updated the faces of the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.200
 premier league this year to those of the 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.970
 bundesliga then maybe this is not 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.980
 so important but for me it is something 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.320
 that I like when playing watch the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.540
 faces of the real bee so to speak 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.380
 do not 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.810
 an ugly face after kids the tournaments 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.240
 of preseason if this is something new is 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.120
 like in real life it 's like the tournament 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.750
 of preseason audi that go teams 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.240
 like roma real madrid and bayern de 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.180
 Munich and the inter or also tournaments like 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.760
 those of the USA that go like the champions 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.780
 from each country our tournaments 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.940
 Australia 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.590
 etcetera those types of preseason to the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.630
 final they will have a prize that that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.270
 prize is going 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.659
 they will be added to the money they have 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.490
 for the signings after guys this is 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.479
 something very important now they are going to put 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.030
 they will be able to train the players 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.509
 this when they come in for training like the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.209
 shots to make centers the shields of 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.340
 the goalkeepers and so on this is going to be 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.840
 will increase the ratings of the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.090
 players will also increase the 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.380
 price of the players however 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.970
 when players already have a rating 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.399
 very high he will go up very little but 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.069
 when you can train a played 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.989
 to a young promise the change is going to 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.229
 notice a lot then that's going to be 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.019
 excellent for our young promises 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.049
 What else do we have we also have something that 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.599
 I had never seen that I never heard forgiveness 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.220
 it had happened to me but the injuries now 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.790
 In the injuries can last a long time 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.829
 let's say before how I mentioned with a 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.360
 selected player last only as a 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.440
 season something like this can now last 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.080
 as 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.120
 and how can I tell you at the end of a 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.340
 season and the lesson follows the start 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.110
 of the next season I never had 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.840
 past always the players were 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.330
 recovered 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.150
 after more we have here the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.590
 locutions there are add locutions that yes 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.379
 only find information in the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.140
 English phrase that will be going to 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:50.010
 add stories to the examples teams 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.379
 if chelsea signed aa zlatan 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.540
 ibrahimÃ³vic is an example then they go to 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.230
 talk about zlatan ibrahimovic in the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.989
 chelsea convincing came in 2017 and 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.040
 He has so many goals throughout the race 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.469
 of the chase and an example like that I explain 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.109
 then that too and this is very 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.060
 important this always I wanted it to 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:15.140
 will pass the free agents now what 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.810
 they can sign free agents when they do not 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.299
 be the window of signings that is the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.750
 window tab is let's say you can sign 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.750
 the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.850
 in November I believe that they do not come not 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.830
 can sign players but in 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.090
 November the free agents are going to be 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.450
 possible to sign 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.400
 we will also be able to see the ratings 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.769
 which is something that we ask there 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.900
 there's a lot that before in career mode 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.730
 I had it but then they removed it and 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.849
 now we have that possibility of 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.440
 new and also guys the loans 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.620
 These loans are very good because 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.970
 with me I have a young promise that I know 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.280
 that I will not use much on the computer 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.819
 I like to send the loan always 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.220
 Send loans as a year in a year 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.560
 when creating what I left but now what 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.220
 we can lend for two years then 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.890
 that's going to be excellent this is going to be that 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.579
 the mo careers guys feel more like 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.579
 a real life 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.120
 so I'm very excited I do not know 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.060
 of you that young promises go to 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.310
 sign but I think all 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.340
 young promises that I know right now have 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.990
 signed by new teams and this is going 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.730
 to hurt a little because always when 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.010
 let's try to sign, he's going to say this 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.400
 just recently arrived at the club 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.280
 then you can not sign it and that's 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.740
 something that will do Korean times but of 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.780
 brawn that we're going to really enjoy this 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.520
