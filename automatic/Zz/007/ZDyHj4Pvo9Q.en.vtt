00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 hello everyone with you runoff on gasoline and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.990
 today talk a little about this 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.099
 inconspicuous on one side as tanchiki 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.620
 panzer 4 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.719
 but there would not be this video if not one 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.240
 circumstance I decided with my co 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.310
 a platoon ride in the sand from we decided 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 so buy landon and such a tanchik 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.680
 level three and we had a panzer 4 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.050
 but I played the first fight, he did 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.570
 in front of you the spoiler played well on 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.060
 warrior master after this battle google 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.309
 for the sake of interest the name of this tank 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 eat and read what they write on the forum 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.890
 just see the pictures but me 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.079
 I got a video from this fan where the author does not 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 I'll call him yourself can see 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.750
 said that this tanchik should be held for 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.730
 freedom he doesn't drag he is terrible this is the most 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.980
 worst tank on the third level with 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 the fives he is a cactus in general 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.550
 which level three tankers with fives 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.649
 feels good 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 we will not consider art 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.180
 I hope that the vouchers but I will get you more 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.300
 I will say this tank has a peculiar 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.309
 guns in the head completely unplayable 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.030
 absolutely but blasts blaspheme it just 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.580
 chic 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 until one always passes by landmine 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.270
 30 well , about 50 damage unless of course 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.860
 stand guslyu but what else do you need for a little 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 book targets you can shoot 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.770
 cumulative there breaking through 80 millimeters 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.229
 and alpha is about 100 so where is this 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
 the tank feels bad for you even more 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.900
 I will say it is free high quality 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.329
 copy of the cross tractor author of the video 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.939
 this cross tractor praised very much 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.570
 now let's compare these two stshki 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.320
 at the base of our base as recharge 4 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.850
 seconds and tractor threats 5.5 seconds and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.020
 dpm we of course higher 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.479
 attention to 450 units so who is here 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.570
 generally better okay in the strength of the keyhole 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.640
 lose 50 hp and it's weightless 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.890
 honestly weigh in about one 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.500
 shot load tractor can we reflect 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.860
 it can not spend well here but in armor 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.200
 by no means body armor is almost the same. 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.360
 forehead 14 millimeters abortions that us 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.390
 millimeters of threat a little smaller 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.910
 ports well the difference is small absolutely 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.030
 and here in the tower we have 30 millimeters under 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.250
 slopes but the threats of the tractor are the same 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.430
 14 millimeters which absolutely nobody 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.519
 does not tank and here we can tank 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.010
 pazika well as I said guns with us 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.920
 the same but the time information we have again 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.370
 better and scatter better 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.209
 the speed of the tank itself is two kilometers in 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.120
 an hour at the tongue is worse than a tractor load and 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.850
 honestly say the dynamics are not up to par 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.150
 the threat is not much 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.430
 Still, better so here on c4 and on 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.680
 my opinion yes according to everyone 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.470
 Normal players understand much 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.600
 much better tractor load do not believe 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.910
 yourself ride tanchik deserves 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.980
 your attention especially if you wanted 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.140
 yourself in the hangar cross tractor for the new year 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.630
 but for some reason his not 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.510
 bought so here so anyone on 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.459
 Do not believe the words and check everything yourself 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.049
 with you was stockton gasoline 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.049
 Good luck to everyone and see you
