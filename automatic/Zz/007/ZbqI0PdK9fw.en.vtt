00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:09.179
 during the day we can study the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:13.590
 Sharks photograph them and to push them 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.260
 when they get too close but at night 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.990
 sharks are a mystery 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.920
 nobody knows if darkness stimulates the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.080
 shark to hunt and feed because 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.660
 deep-sea sharks under the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.480
 surface when the sun sets 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.090
 nor if the sharks are more dangerous 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.280
 for the man after dark for 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.030
 discover the answers our team of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.950
 filming 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.660
 very well let's record and the experts on 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.469
 sharks dived with these 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 predators 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.649
 the night was fantastic 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.430
 using modern vision equipment 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.260
 night 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.920
 they will go where cameras never 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.520
 they were to find and film the elusive 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.520
 predator on turn 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.839
 They feel comfortable in the dark. 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.110
 many have a very good vision but 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.090
 also use the lighthouse has excellent 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.310
 and can detect tiny 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.380
 electrical impulses and vibrations such as 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.790
 our heart beats have great 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.790
 advantage to the dark coat 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.320
 we know little about sharks during 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.090
 the day is even less dark in the dark 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.460
 while you can not see anything else 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.550
 category of problem and danger of 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.190
 filming at night is extremely difficult 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.110
 but new technology such as 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.590
 night vision and vision cameras 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.540
 thermal and lots of light 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 underwater will help us to see what 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:56.890
 these animals make us sell more 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.030
 aircraft make the patient image during the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.490
 day 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.670
 we want to see if they are more dangerous 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.060
 Aggressive and staying are more at night in the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.739
 Now this is a mystery 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.640
 we started in South Africa with the shark 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.950
 White 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.370
 a shark that used to hunt in full 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.370
 daylight 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.460
 these predators have a clear view 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.650
 and use it to spot seals in the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.330
 surface triggering an attack 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.330
 fulminant from the bottom 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.970
 the team wants to find out if these attacks 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.459
 continue the night 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.860
 this shark remains active when the sun 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:46.349
 if these shark do not sleep 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.880
 in the background at night they patrol an island 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.810
 full time are always 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.540
 circulating 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.940
 the question is what do they do at night 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.180
 they hunt, they feed, nobody knows 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.270
 The only way to find out is to wait for the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.270
 dusk into the water and observe 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.380
 the fastest test 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.069
 It's our first chance to really 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.110
 see what happens 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.849
 we've spent several days actually 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.780
 A few weeks here but we never knew 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.239
 exactly what the white sharks 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.360
 make around the island at night 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.910
 we think they are hunting but who knows 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.709
 I got into the cage I was nervous 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.849
 enter the night viola with the shark 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.370
 White 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.750
 I do not know why else it seemed to me 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.110
 spooky 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.110
 the videographer marclei observes the cage 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.060
 hours pass and there is still no sign of 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.560
 sharks predators can be 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.630
 circling unseen 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.410
 suddenly a white shark passes 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:01.019
 slowly by the reflectors 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:03.420
 will see him very close the soon to prepare 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.830
 and already left came out the front 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.890
 curt curt it shows that it keeps 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.530
 active warm night dive with 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.200
 sharks 20 years ago and never witnessed 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.419
 something like 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.000
 Huge white sharks glide well 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.910
 close in the dark 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.370
 I need to set him another movie I 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.500
 I saw a huge incriminating camera 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.810
 beach sum takes the movie maybe the people 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.690
 do not have another key is fantastic 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.120
 My gosh, how was he? 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.990
 simply huge it came to seem like a 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.620
 submarine 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.150
 it is here many experts believe 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.460
 that white sharks are active 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.620
 only by day but obviously these 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.600
 animals have another facet after the 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.950
 nightfall that was never seen he is 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.820
 slowly turning the soul slowly 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.820
 let's adjust it
