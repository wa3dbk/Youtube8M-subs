your project and then go ahead and do
anything<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.020> break<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> binding

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
anything you can just break the binding

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.950 
anything you can just break the binding
break<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.730> look<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.420> then<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.629> also

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
break that they look and then you also

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020 
break that they look and then you also
wanna<00:00:49.350> remove<00:00:49.680> any<00:00:49.920> insert<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.700> come<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
wanna remove any insert that come and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
wanna remove any insert that come and
you<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.300> seems<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.079> odd<00:00:52.410> shape<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you make seems the odd shape of it and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
you make seems the odd shape of it and
the<00:00:53.789> thickness<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> paper<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:55.110> makes<00:00:55.260> it

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the thickness of the paper just makes it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.490 
the thickness of the paper just makes it
hard<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.100> referenced<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> might<00:00:58.140> also

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
hard to referenced then you might also

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.450 
hard to referenced then you might also
have<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> remove<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> front<00:00:59.910> page<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:01.680> may

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
have to remove the front page it may

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.729 
have to remove the front page it may
stick<00:01:02.730> out<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.930> might<00:01:04.559> be

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
stick out a little bit so that might be

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.710 
stick out a little bit so that might be
an<00:01:04.830> option<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.580> ended<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.119> removing<00:01:06.330> in
