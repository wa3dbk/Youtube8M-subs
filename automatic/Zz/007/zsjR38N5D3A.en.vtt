more<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.229> more<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.619> technical<00:01:50.189> areas

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
more and more in technical areas

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.139 
more and more in technical areas

I've never had any difficulties there so

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.850 
I've never had any difficulties there so
if<00:02:06.180> people<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.659> they<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.049> they<00:02:07.469> respect

you as much as anyone else and you are
very<00:02:10.259> much<00:02:10.470> taken<00:02:10.860> seriously<00:02:11.280> well<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.510> teams

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
very much taken seriously well the teams

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.750 
very much taken seriously well the teams
that<00:02:12.900> seem<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.319> win

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
that seem to win

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.550 
that seem to win
and<00:02:14.269> we're<00:02:14.510> going<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.750> see<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.080> weekend<00:02:15.409> but

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and we're going to see this weekend but

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.170 
and we're going to see this weekend but
it<00:02:15.620> seems<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.010> they're<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.280> teams<00:02:16.519> with<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
it seems like they're the teams with the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.820 
it seems like they're the teams with the
biggest<00:02:17.480> pocketbooks<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.349> you've<00:02:18.560> spoken

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
biggest pocketbooks and you've spoken

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.949 
biggest pocketbooks and you've spoken
out<00:02:19.129> about<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.790> economic<00:02:20.360> imbalance<00:02:20.870> between

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
out about the economic imbalance between

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.619 
out about the economic imbalance between
the<00:02:21.170> teams<00:02:21.470> what<00:02:22.310> do<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.519> propose<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.209> solve

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
the teams what do you propose to solve

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.869 
the teams what do you propose to solve
that<00:02:23.780> problem<00:02:24.310> well<00:02:25.310> they're<00:02:25.459> basically

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
that problem well they're basically

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.640 
that problem well they're basically
three<00:02:26.060> three<00:02:26.599> things<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:27.019> have<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.290> look<00:02:27.440> at

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
three three things we have to look at

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.559 
three three things we have to look at
first<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.069> all<00:02:28.250> we<00:02:28.519> have<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.909> look<00:02:29.209> at<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
first of all we have to look at the

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.589 
first of all we have to look at the
overall<00:02:29.930> cost<00:02:30.250> situation<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.549> think<00:02:31.849> the

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
overall cost situation and I think the

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.119 
overall cost situation and I think the
dimensions<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.379> reached<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.099> last

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
dimensions we have reached in the last

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.240 
dimensions we have reached in the last
couple<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.849> years<00:02:34.959> are<00:02:35.959> just<00:02:36.019> far<00:02:36.680> too<00:02:37.010> high

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
couple of years are just far too high

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.550 
couple of years are just far too high
for<00:02:37.610> any<00:02:37.730> company<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.870> will<00:02:39.049> always<00:02:39.200> think

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
for any company and we will always think

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.990 
for any company and we will always think
about<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.980> smaller<00:02:40.250> teams<00:02:40.610> which<00:02:40.790> might

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
about the smaller teams which might

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.789 
about the smaller teams which might
vanish<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.810> also<00:02:41.959> have<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.290> keep<00:02:42.620> in

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
vanish I think you also have to keep in

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.830 
vanish I think you also have to keep in
mind<00:02:42.829> that<00:02:43.220> big<00:02:43.819> teams<00:02:44.120> will<00:02:44.329> probably<00:02:44.659> also

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
mind that big teams will probably also

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.410 
mind that big teams will probably also
not<00:02:45.140> stay<00:02:45.379> at<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:45.769> level<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:46.310> spending<00:02:46.549> for

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
not stay at this level of spending for

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.030 
not stay at this level of spending for
years<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.019> years<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.410> come<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.829> have<00:02:48.860> to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
years and years to come you have to

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.580 
years and years to come you have to
introduce<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.760> cost<00:02:50.000> cap<00:02:50.299> which<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:50.959> favor<00:02:51.290> very

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
introduce a cost cap which we favor very

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.410 
introduce a cost cap which we favor very
much<00:02:51.829> because<00:02:52.190> we<00:02:52.310> think<00:02:52.519> that's<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.390> very

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
much because we think that's a very

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.020 
much because we think that's a very
equitable<00:02:54.170> way<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.950> bring<00:02:55.160> costs<00:02:55.579> down<00:02:55.640> and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
equitable way to bring costs down and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.970 
equitable way to bring costs down and
yet<00:02:56.209> keep<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.750> competition<00:02:57.290> alive<00:02:57.739> that

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
yet keep that competition alive that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.729 
yet keep that competition alive that
diversity<00:02:58.549> align<00:02:59.239> second<00:03:00.140> thing<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.410> have<00:03:00.590> to

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
diversity align second thing you have to

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.920 
diversity align second thing you have to
look<00:03:00.890> at<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.099> certain<00:03:01.579> disturb<00:03:01.940> it<00:03:02.090> within<00:03:02.690> the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
look at a certain disturb it within the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.140 
look at a certain disturb it within the
rules<00:03:03.140> because<00:03:03.980> we've<00:03:04.160> seen<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.519> last<00:03:04.730> years

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
rules because we've seen the last years

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.210 
rules because we've seen the last years
again<00:03:05.480> somebody<00:03:06.079> comes<00:03:06.500> up<00:03:06.680> with<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:06.980> really

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
again somebody comes up with this really

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.119 
again somebody comes up with this really
good<00:03:07.489> idea<00:03:07.849> it's<00:03:08.120> very<00:03:08.359> cost<00:03:08.720> intensive

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
good idea it's very cost intensive

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.319 
good idea it's very cost intensive
everyone<00:03:10.129> else<00:03:10.310> follows<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.120> very

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
everyone else follows that and you very

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.030 
everyone else follows that and you very
well<00:03:11.540> know<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:11.810> next<00:03:12.170> year<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.560> going<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.859> be

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
well know that next year is going to be

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.860 
well know that next year is going to be
forbidden<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:14.000> these<00:03:14.120> are<00:03:14.299> not<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.540> kind<00:03:14.780> of

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
forbidden so these are not the kind of

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.960 
forbidden so these are not the kind of
investments<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.530> should<00:03:15.769> be<00:03:15.920> doing<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
investments you should be doing and the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.460 
investments you should be doing and the
third<00:03:17.180> thing<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.569> certainly<00:03:17.959> have<00:03:18.169> to<00:03:18.290> look

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
third thing you certainly have to look

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.009 
third thing you certainly have to look
at<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.709> how<00:03:18.919> you<00:03:18.980> distribute<00:03:19.669> the<00:03:20.030> money<00:03:20.209> okay

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
at is how you distribute the money okay

first of all if you are a big team like

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.370 
first of all if you are a big team like
this<00:03:31.609> you<00:03:31.849> know<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.450> have<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:33.049> very

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
this you know you you have a very

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.809 
this you know you you have a very
different<00:03:33.680> backing<00:03:34.250> it's<00:03:34.459> not<00:03:34.639> only

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
different backing it's not only

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.970 
different backing it's not only
financial<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.720> have<00:03:35.959> different<00:03:36.410> aspects

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
financial you have different aspects

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.559

maybe<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.400> technological<00:03:37.849> things<00:03:38.329> which<00:03:38.480> a

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
maybe to technological things which a

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.180 
maybe to technological things which a
smaller<00:03:38.840> team<00:03:39.109> does<00:03:39.319> not<00:03:39.470> have<00:03:39.769> because<00:03:40.160> you

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
smaller team does not have because you

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.250 
smaller team does not have because you
can<00:03:40.730> tap<00:03:41.120> into<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.450> very<00:03:41.660> different<00:03:42.079> technology

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
can tap into a very different technology

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.620 
can tap into a very different technology
pool<00:03:42.889> particularly<00:03:43.609> with<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> manufacturer<00:03:44.450> in

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
pool particularly with a manufacturer in

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.539 
pool particularly with a manufacturer in
the<00:03:44.810> background<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.859> then<00:03:45.980> of<00:03:46.099> course<00:03:46.130> the

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
the background and then of course the

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.729 
the background and then of course the
resources<00:03:47.239> human<00:03:47.389> resources<00:03:47.599> you<00:03:48.349> have<00:03:48.590> as

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
resources human resources you have as

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.159 
resources human resources you have as
well<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:50.120> makes<00:03:50.359> it<00:03:50.480> difficult<00:03:50.540> for<00:03:51.019> a

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
well so it makes it difficult for a

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.930 
well so it makes it difficult for a
private<00:03:51.620> e<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.099> not<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.430> point<00:03:52.669> here

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
private e but it's not the point here

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.030 
private e but it's not the point here
because<00:03:53.329> you<00:03:53.840> very<00:03:54.049> much<00:03:54.260> accept<00:03:54.650> that<00:03:54.799> as<00:03:54.980> a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
because you very much accept that as a

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.589 
because you very much accept that as a
private<00:03:55.579> team<00:03:55.700> this<00:03:55.849> has<00:03:55.940> always<00:03:56.120> been<00:03:56.299> the

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
private team this has always been the

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.940 
private team this has always been the
case<00:03:56.810> if<00:03:57.019> they've<00:03:57.169> been<00:03:57.290> private<00:03:57.709> teams

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
case if they've been private teams

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.369 
case if they've been private teams
driving<00:03:58.790> against<00:03:59.209> manufacturer<00:04:00.139> teams

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379

driving against manufacturer teams
that's<00:04:00.889> not<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.340> problem<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.120> problem<00:04:02.359> is

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
that's not the problem the problem is

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.509 
that's not the problem the problem is
that<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.930> need<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.290> have<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.769> way<00:04:03.919> a<00:04:03.950> field

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
which has its limits and within that you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.159 
which has its limits and within that you
can<00:04:07.430> get<00:04:07.819> your<00:04:08.000> chance<00:04:08.299> which<00:04:08.540> we<00:04:08.690> also<00:04:08.840> had
