00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.179
 hello pretty rare unique 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.460
 opportunity to show you benchmark ares 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.920
 for the reason that firstly 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.869
 bench in the butt is already out of production and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.510
 find a new such knife to get it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.890
 the future is becoming increasingly difficult however 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.199
 they are in the secondary market 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.910
 this is a big plus a great knife 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.740
 mechanics basically enough 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.769
 classic appearance i wouldn't say 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.360
 what is something over here especially 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.190
 supernatural in appearance by 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.860
 all the characteristics I would say that it 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.620
 just such an ordinary average knife 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.980
 but it has a number of features that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.800
 he is loved for whom they buy him 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 first this is one of the best and our 10 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.309
 for the reason that he has enough 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.399
 high cutting edge length 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:58.829
 the principle of optimal such dimensions and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 champion let's immediately about them 200 is 8 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.480
 millimeters total knife length 90 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.350
 millimeters cutting edge length and such 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.689
 about the same blade length 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 according to the weight of the knife then 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.710
 there is in its dimensions it is quite so 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 currently working folding knife that can be 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.439
 perform very many tasks 120 grams 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 exactly his weight is again quite himself 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.430
 the weight that can be convenient and comfortable 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.729
 worn on the pocket even for a long time 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.189
 on a butt this knife has 2 and 8 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.450
 millimeter and our reduced very very 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.030
 subtly at least this instance 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.540
 only 0 2 millimeters but maybe 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.479
 03 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.560
 in any case, the knife is very thin and 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.710
 respectively 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.220
 his cut is quite aggressive here 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.659
 used decent steel 154 series 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.329
 and as you can see at this 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.009
 the copy uses an inscription or 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.380
 Chiva is only because the standard lost 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.750
 which is developing very interesting 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.540
 design knives tactical handles 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.149
 quite famous designer in his 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.560
 Especially it is replaced by so much in years 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.820
 he was fond of exactly 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.939
 martial arts and knows how to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.530
 knife as it developed such a let's say so 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.849
 a man who knows a lot about 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.860
 martial art on the one hand 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.129
 object side that knife is some kind of combat 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.739
 knife large 10 misfired here 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.340
 comfortable not too aggressive on him 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.980
 glove with it does not bulge from such here 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.349
 1010 lining is necessary on the copy 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.870
 made interestingly red with black 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.319
 but it is necessary to understand that the inscription 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.829
 lose and in general it is this 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.989
 copy here with a butterfly yet 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.609
 which has not changed look you mustache 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.909
 all that stuff 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.549
 this 2001 may be 2002 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.620
 however , I have already heard that from 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.010
 the owners pressed that prices glorious blade 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.400
 definitely these years on the other hand 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.109
 the handle of the knife she seems to be in those 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.480
 the years did not seem to be released there 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.459
 later it turned out that there was such 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.939
 the version that maybe the hilt was 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.790
 all the same 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.739
 or the handle covers have been replaced but I 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.349
 really don't believe somehow in this 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.780
 The version most likely is just such 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.430
 exactly the model that came out why 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.019
 because it is perfect to scold me 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.500
 I do not think that you can rearrange one 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.510
 knife on the other handle and she is so 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.220
 Sits perfectly and here absolutely nowhere 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.139
 nothing sticks out absolutely nowhere 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.159
 nothing and even here note how 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:32.409
 ests of all and is the lock pin 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.599
 there he is it turns out that's him 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.400
 extreme position on the one hand yes and 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.500
 when we squeeze it 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.190
 position in another in the other side but 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.720
 when he 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.849
 open position is somewhere 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.829
 about the middle and he has enough 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.959
 a big move on making 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.690
 that is, the knife is all the more considering 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.569
 he was the first shooting range 2 years it still as 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.060
 would serve and serve the occasion of working out not 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.609
 there is absolutely nothing about 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.709
 backlash there is no backlash can be 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.810
 the most the most minimal is i'm not here 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.540
 sure about saying what to say 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.120
 what's great here 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.740
 smoothness that is the knife falls under 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.540
 its own weight 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.540
 well it's hard right here perfect 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:18.989
 indicator yes but there shaking it then 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.989
 there is a knife under your weight here goes out and 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.040
 he has excellent mechanics 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.630
 it fits perfectly 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.190
 quietly so that's literally just 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.980
 unfolds very gently 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.990
 walks smoothly surprisingly what is not here 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.300
 it is visible that there were washers 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.860
 some kind of brass bronze so that they 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.110
 were from non-ferrous metal to impression 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.750
 that they are made of steel but not even 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.700
 you can see that they were made of PTFE 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.710
 that is surprising that here washers 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.240
 it would be nice to make out from the knife on this 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.590
 case he is not mine I still disassemble 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.450
 I will not be in this version but I think 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.560
 maybe the owner will tell more about 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.600
 what are the pucks in the end clip 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.280
 swapped to the other side for 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.420
 right-handed for left-handed our principle is completely 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.060
 symmetrically it is of course also big 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.240
 plus for left-handed what disi knife it can be 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.830
 wear and use comfortably enough 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.020
 By and large, nothing beyond 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.590
 nothing special about design 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.660
 on top of amazing just in the details 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.520
 thought out in small things right 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.880
 collected in small things correctly 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.300
 fitted know here is such a knife which 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.370
 on the one hand it does not produce 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.170
 wow effect yes it's all the same no no no 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.440
 Such a knife as here is makro so taxi 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.260
 stayed before that here immediately shaft that is 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.870
 there is a machine that is so special 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.940
 wedge yes in the form of such karambit there 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.420
 the thickness of the butt materials all that 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.570
 other 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.290
 there is no such effect here but with 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.110
 the other side 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.960
 knife exactly how everyday knife like 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.540
 working knife he is really very good 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.220
 and say that we have a lot and 10 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.860
 knives that would be so and 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.570
 balanced in their characteristics 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.000
 there is practically no such 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.360
 wonder why the bench took it off 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.390
 Model with production can be considered 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.070
 that same torrent up is like 5 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.070
 so another lock torrent I would not 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.720
 said that in this case, as it were better 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.190
 better still axis because it 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.650
 so let's say a special trick 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.470
 bench maida and she does not work much 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.990
 good very secure lock 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.140
 but it's better for me than liner 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.990
 lock and at least click on the stump 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:31.680
 than i would prefer them more 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:34.800
 brand lock here are such thoughts 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.570
 same smoothness beautiful general if 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.730
 want to buy yourself 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.490
 essay but what is really worth turning 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.280
 attention to this model and here 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.260
 it is surprising that they will have to take now 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.670
 only with hands a couple of years ago he 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.020
 released on forex sold means 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.670
 exclusive version ie latest 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.860
 such a version that is, it became steel 390 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.140
 black g10 on the hilt in general there was 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.270
 knife coated and without that there is such 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:06.000
 unlimited release was limited and 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:09.180
 already there at the end for the removal of the knife 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.280
 completely from production now stands 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.110
 now find only the term but the model 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.320
 interesting and still deserves 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.850
 your attention thank you oleg for 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.040
 giving a knife for review thanks 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.040
 Subscribers per view bye
