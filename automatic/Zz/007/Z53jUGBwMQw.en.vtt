kids<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.710> how<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> scenes<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
kids and how you go on the scenes and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.550 
kids and how you go on the scenes and
movies<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.240> things<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.380> is

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
movies and things like I think this is

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.630 
movies and things like I think this is
now<00:01:52.680> what<00:01:52.860> they're<00:01:52.979> doing<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> next

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
now what they're doing with the next

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.230 
now what they're doing with the next
studio<00:01:53.850> 10<00:01:54.390> twats<00:01:54.899> so

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
studio 10 twats so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.440 
studio 10 twats so
I<00:01:56.530> guess<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.650> what<00:01:57.770> they're<00:01:57.979> doing<00:01:58.250> now<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:59.390> two

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
I guess is what they're doing now so two

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.980 
I guess is what they're doing now so two
of<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.229> Knicks<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.070> do<00:02:01.220> towards<00:02:01.729> are<00:02:02.299> going

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
and bread which I thought was the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.389 
and bread which I thought was the
stupidest<00:02:08.750> thing<00:02:08.959> ever<00:02:08.989> seen<00:02:09.259> in<00:02:09.349> my<00:02:09.380> life<00:02:09.500> and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
stupidest thing ever seen in my life and

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.860 
stupidest thing ever seen in my life and
all<00:02:10.520> that<00:02:10.759> bread<00:02:11.000> was<00:02:11.239> wasted<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:11.690> could

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
all that bread was wasted that could

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.580 
all that bread was wasted that could
have<00:02:11.989> fed<00:02:12.230> needy<00:02:12.739> people<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.810> was<00:02:15.080> just<00:02:15.440> to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
have fed needy people and it was just to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
time I was watching it I kind of thought

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.309 
time I was watching it I kind of thought
that<00:02:24.500> my<00:02:24.800> brain<00:02:25.730> cells<00:02:26.180> were<00:02:26.480> going<00:02:26.810> down<00:02:26.840> cuz

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.780 
that my brain cells were going down cuz
I<00:02:27.380> kind<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.650> felt<00:02:27.890> stupid<00:02:28.160> or<00:02:28.400> as<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.640> was

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
I kind of felt stupid or as I was

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.900 
I kind of felt stupid or as I was
watching<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.950> meat<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.160> just<00:02:31.549> kind<00:02:31.819> of

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
watching it and the meat is just kind of

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.370 
watching it and the meat is just kind of
showed<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.420> Nick<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.720> kind<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.140> getting

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
showed that Nick is kind of getting

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.890 
showed that Nick is kind of getting
dumber<00:02:33.860> with<00:02:34.130> their<00:02:34.340> here<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.760> don't<00:02:35.690> know<00:02:35.780> if

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
dumber with their here I don't know if

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.840 
dumber with their here I don't know if
they<00:02:36.019> think<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.410> most<00:02:36.799> American<00:02:37.430> children

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
they think that most American children

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.030 
they think that most American children
are<00:02:37.940> complete<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.510> utter<00:02:38.750> idiots<00:02:39.350> are<00:02:39.709> morons

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
are complete and utter idiots are morons

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.789 
are complete and utter idiots are morons
but<00:02:40.910> that's<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.019> kind<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.319> what<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.500> felt

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
but that's the kind of what I felt

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.009 
but that's the kind of what I felt
watching<00:02:43.069> it<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.670> will<00:02:44.269> give<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.569> up<00:02:44.810> their

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
watching it I will give it up their

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.830 
watching it I will give it up their
chance<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.470> I'm<00:02:45.530> basically<00:02:46.690> judging<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.750> the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
chance but I'm basically judging it the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.800 
chance but I'm basically judging it the
same<00:02:48.019> way<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.200> did<00:02:48.290> sunjai<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:49.250> looks<00:02:49.580> spit<00:02:50.540> it
