00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 for less stay with people truth I 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.859
 I want to show this folding lantern 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.040
 from the American manufacturer 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.599
 I picked up is a candle lantern that is 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.549
 completely folding that you have now 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.680
 same closed a height of about 11 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.779
 centimeters and a diameter of about five 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.609
 centimeters and a half but interesting that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.710
 is a flashlight that we would take it out and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.570
 takes off completely getting a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.570
 height of about 16 centimeters and a half 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.320
 best 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.940
 take a practical here to a practice 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.649
 handle and a hook this flashlight comes very 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.390
 well for example we are some shelter 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.730
 any tent that the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.129
 we would place inside because it gives a 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.030
 intensity of 20 lumens and a power 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:50.989
 let's say heat of about 1920 has a 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.329
 weight of 227 grams now carries within 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.500
 a candle that is of this type of candle 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.150
 has the candle an approximate duration of 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.079
 nine hours but now the question what 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.570
 type of candle 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.489
 we are going to use although we have to use the 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.470
 candles of the manufacturer euros we will fix 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.270
 here we would take out the container 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.740
 has a characteristic of this evening 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.220
 here this candle has a capacity one 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.470
 capacity a duration of 9 hours this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.960
 it would be the same has a duration of 9 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.170
 hours but in citronella and this would be 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.060
 bee that would have an intensity of some 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.950
 12 a duration of 12 hours better done 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.659
 spinning here 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.939
 we would take out the dock 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.819
 and a plaza that would give access to the candle 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.960
 because that way the dock will always be 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:45.899
 pressing the candle and we always go to 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.440
 leave a light intensity 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.300
 constant 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.710
 with this we also get that not 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.570
 they detach us to do when turning and 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.920
 here we would leave this 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.010
 we have to do to change the shell 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.410
 with this we get that always go 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.420
 the candle pulling up that does not 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.210
 do not miss the wax and consummate 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.810
 far better to put the candle 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.810
 tour let's say 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.580
 it's a flashlight that weighs a little alone 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.350
 227 grams and to put it in our 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.690
 tent comes in handy or 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.030
 packing shelter we also have as 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.069
 spare the neoprene cover for your 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.290
 transport 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.909
 what would this accessory be for someone who 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.200
 would be what is the theme of the cover that 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.939
 It is also available on the website 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.840
 I hope the information is not series 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.840
 help greetings
