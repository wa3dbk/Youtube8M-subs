in the middle with Enzo Perez inside

in the middle with Enzo Perez inside
with<00:01:57.329> birria<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.049> mascara<00:01:58.979> no<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.369> after

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
with birria and mascara no and after

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.359 
with birria and mascara no and after
that<00:02:00.180> instead<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.689> four<00:02:01.020> four<00:02:01.320> into<00:02:01.950> attacking

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
that instead of four four into attacking

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.620 
that instead of four four into attacking
players<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:02.850> were<00:02:02.939> playing<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.390> four

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
players they were playing with four

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
players they were playing with four
three<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.829> moment<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.280> even<00:02:05.399> lost

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
three and in this moment that even lost

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.680 
three and in this moment that even lost
a<00:02:05.850> lot<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> balance<00:02:06.329> Messi<00:02:07.369> had<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.580> run<00:02:08.789> much

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a lot of balance Messi had to run much

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.859 
a lot of balance Messi had to run much
more<00:02:09.959> than<00:02:10.229> then

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
more than then

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.300 
more than then
in<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.080> beginning<00:02:11.470> was<00:02:11.680> trying<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.099> close

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
in the beginning was trying to close

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.580 
in the beginning was trying to close
some<00:02:12.489> spaces<00:02:12.940> as<00:02:13.060> well<00:02:13.090> as<00:02:13.299> you<00:02:14.049> way<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.379> and<00:02:14.530> I

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
some spaces as well as you way in and I

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.930 
some spaces as well as you way in and I
think<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.920> team<00:02:15.099> lost<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.459> little<00:02:15.640> bit<00:02:15.760> of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
think the team lost a little bit of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.960 
think the team lost a little bit of
balance<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.780> specially<00:02:17.319> energy<00:02:18.220> energy<00:02:18.459> they

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
balance and specially energy energy they

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.390 
balance and specially energy energy they
needed<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.599> extra<00:02:19.900> time<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.440> they<00:02:21.010> hadn't

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
needed in the extra time and they hadn't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.949 
needed in the extra time and they hadn't
they<00:02:21.640> hadn't<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.090> think<00:02:22.360> because<00:02:22.629> of<00:02:22.780> this

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
they hadn't I think because of this

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.500 
they hadn't I think because of this
tactical<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.680> balance<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.299> situation<00:02:25.299> and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
tactical and balance a situation and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.080 
tactical and balance a situation and
obviously<00:02:25.720> because<00:02:26.349> they<00:02:27.010> had<00:02:27.190> one<00:02:27.430> less<00:02:27.760> day

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
obviously because they had one less day

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.869 
obviously because they had one less day
to<00:02:28.150> rest<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.470> game<00:02:29.650> between<00:02:30.069> Brazil<00:02:30.849> and

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
to rest and the game between Brazil and

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.149 
to rest and the game between Brazil and
and<00:02:31.569> Germany<00:02:32.409> was<00:02:32.530> completely<00:02:33.010> different

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
and Germany was completely different

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.589 
and Germany was completely different
than<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.610> game<00:02:33.760> between<00:02:33.909> Holland<00:02:34.420> and

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
than the game between Holland and

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.290 
than the game between Holland and
Argentina
