already<00:01:51.350> getting<00:01:51.770> another<00:01:52.069> watch<00:01:52.310> now

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
already getting another watch now

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.899 
already getting another watch now
hopefully<00:01:53.649> it<00:01:54.649> will<00:01:54.799> come<00:01:55.130> with<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.340> chain<00:01:55.700> in

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
hopefully it will come with a chain in

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.179 
hopefully it will come with a chain in
the<00:01:56.000> clip<00:01:56.329> he'll<00:01:56.689> be<00:01:56.810> from<00:01:56.989> Hong<00:01:57.259> Kong<00:01:57.289> and

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
the clip he'll be from Hong Kong and

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.100 
the clip he'll be from Hong Kong and
since<00:01:58.670> I'm<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.849> only<00:01:59.030> bidder<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.569> it<00:01:59.750> ends<00:02:00.020> in

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
since I'm the only bidder and it ends in

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.460 
since I'm the only bidder and it ends in
their<00:02:00.289> bed<00:02:00.500> an<00:02:00.619> hour<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.039> a<00:02:01.099> half<00:02:02.470> I'll

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
their bed an hour and a half I'll

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.669 
their bed an hour and a half I'll
probably<00:02:04.179> be<00:02:05.179> spending<00:02:05.599> a<00:02:05.840> lot<00:02:06.020> more<00:02:06.049> on<00:02:06.470> the

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
probably be spending a lot more on the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.499 
probably be spending a lot more on the
shipping<00:02:06.979> than<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:07.520> were<00:02:07.640> on<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.909> actual<00:02:08.179> item

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
shipping than it were on the actual item

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.900 
shipping than it were on the actual item
right<00:02:08.690> now<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:09.170> only<00:02:09.289> about<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.979> dollar<00:02:10.340> u.s.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
right now it's only about a dollar u.s.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.759 
right now it's only about a dollar u.s.
like<00:02:11.269> 98<00:02:11.780> cents<00:02:12.170> or<00:02:12.380> something<00:02:12.650> like<00:02:12.709> that

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
like 98 cents or something like that

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.319 
like 98 cents or something like that
which<00:02:13.579> is<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:14.090> dollar<00:02:15.340> 15<00:02:16.340> Canadian<00:02:17.209> or

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
which is but a dollar 15 Canadian or

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.789 
which is but a dollar 15 Canadian or
something<00:02:17.569> up<00:02:17.630> there<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.230> shipping<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.650> a

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
something up there the shipping is a

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.780 
something up there the shipping is a
little<00:02:19.040> over<00:02:19.340> $10<00:02:20.739> well<00:02:21.739> when<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.340> get<00:02:22.400> that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
little over $10 well when I get that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.080 
little over $10 well when I get that
I'll<00:02:23.720> probably<00:02:24.620> end<00:02:24.829> up<00:02:24.980> using<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.400> much

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
I'll probably end up using that much

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.960 
I'll probably end up using that much
chaining<00:02:26.840> clip<00:02:27.140> on<00:02:27.349> this<00:02:27.650> watch<00:02:27.920> because<00:02:28.850> I

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
chaining clip on this watch because I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.340 
chaining clip on this watch because I
think<00:02:29.030> this<00:02:29.269> one's<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.569> little<00:02:29.690> classy<00:02:29.989> looking

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
think this one's a little classy looking

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.559 
think this one's a little classy looking
but<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> other<00:02:30.769> one<00:02:30.950> does<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.670> its<00:02:31.940> own<00:02:32.150> ace

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
but the other one does have its own ace

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.500 
but the other one does have its own ace
qualities<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.370> probably<00:02:34.760> will<00:02:35.060> be<00:02:35.120> using

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
qualities so I probably will be using

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.470 
qualities so I probably will be using
them<00:02:35.660> on<00:02:35.690> occasion<00:02:36.370> well<00:02:37.989> Tata<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:40.480> goodnight
