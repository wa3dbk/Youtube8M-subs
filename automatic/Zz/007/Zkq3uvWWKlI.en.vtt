00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it's just been really interesting how

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220 
it's just been really interesting how
this<00:00:41.129> has<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.489> worked<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.420> didn't<00:00:43.140> really

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
this has all worked out I didn't really

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.049 
this has all worked out I didn't really
anticipate<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.520> figured<00:00:45.030> that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
anticipate on it but I just figured that

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.389 
anticipate on it but I just figured that
if<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.539> ask<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.960> few<00:00:46.079> questions<00:00:46.190> it<00:00:47.190> would<00:00:47.309> be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
if I ask a few questions it would be

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.770 
if I ask a few questions it would be
kind<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> interesting<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.210> learn<00:00:48.390> about
