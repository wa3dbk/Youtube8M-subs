00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.900
 Hello my loves 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.359
 Welcome everyone 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.519
 tutorial in this video today I'll go 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.880
 giving a hint to you how to do 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.109
 shading using pastel chalk looks 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.420
 I use sic pentaho people from going through it 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.329
 Here she has 50 pure box 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.649
 I have a smaller one with the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.710
 found 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.660
 you find 1 in this box with 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.129
 several quantities then have the first 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.399
 What I bought was here. 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.039
 It's been a while since I paid her $ 8 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.270
 but she never again the expression now 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.190
 so I've used enough already have one and yield 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.460
 a lot of people but how I needed to 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.199
 other colors did not have there and support and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.580
 understanding that has a range of colors 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.040
 greater good 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.340
 so I'm going up there of you today 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.330
 shading technique with x quite 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 Good 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.210
 the first thing you will do 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.170
 to vote using these pieces here 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.600
 shadowing sessions 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.840
 You have to choose a color one tone. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.690
 above the rba you are using 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:34.160
 in case this video here I can be 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.160
 used here is this bank 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.390
 this green here 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.150
 Until that yard, I'll put this one here. 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.060
 that is very strong 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.060
 the sun appears max 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.320
 is this one here is perfect propele I like 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:00.750
 to use this caramel 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.970
 today I left it was the one for color 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.410
 stone in the yellow can be used 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.000
 orange is not orange orange 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:15.120
 with the difference of salary already here 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.320
 so whenever you're going to use it send 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.810
 always use a flower affirm a tone above 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.410
 in one or two tones above because you go 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.610
 have left 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.820
 So, how do we do it? 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:33.600
 shading let's take it out here start 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.819
 here in this head here you get the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:44.260
 jeans and you've been passing 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:44.260
 scratching the outline your record is 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.350
 the bishop 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.819
 Everyone and then you 're giving your 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.520
 or you come with your finger or you 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.380
 comes with g calinho to see the confusion 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.800
 Direct retail that flew over the other 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.989
 I can not stain the parts do not have a 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.150
 Hebe's return is to be a shadow and 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.700
 it looks like I give a smoothed 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.300
 The difference from here to here 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.300
 River 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.820
 and then we come shaded is the 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.820
 formation of these shading 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.860
 I'm going to do now here in yellowing 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.390
 this tone joe is that through the already malanje 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:42.610
 given show opens here because it is 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.610
 of so much that I have already used is already spent 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.540
 OK 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:02.510
 that way and we do the same thing 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:05.120
 here laughs gloomy smoke I do not know 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:10.060
 If there is such a word and I'm going 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.310
 Shade this smart part 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.410
 this I'm going to do something else 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.440
 beyond the shading with you today 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:21.100
 Summer too, I will not do with 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.250
 that the whole outline of the part that 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.250
 others 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.680
 ah 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.000
 psychosis this one I want to do some 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.340
 details here 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.030
 in that top band of this car but I 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.990
 I'll take a ruler and I'll position 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.169
 This rule from here looks have these 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.979
 three cable cars will call themselves that joÃ£o 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.110
 days right 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.990
 I'll get from here to here and score a 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.990
 straight line and I'll pass the judge 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.950
 little bit 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:30.710
 inside and makes me again the other's 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.710
 key is the same thing in chalk and peace 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.030
 and we'll meet you right now 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.720
 Good, so he can do shading. 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.050
 not only in the peladinhas but also in the 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.020
 on the inside, what to do 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.090
 smoothing of the same 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.910
 the same way we did ourselves 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:01.180
 other passing is to see the or the finger and there 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:08.039
 in this part here we excuse rule 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:08.039
 Brazil is the best queen. 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.120
 OK 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:18.180
 well and that 's how we do it 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.850
 shading with pastel chalk 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:25.490
 I hope you like br to the next
