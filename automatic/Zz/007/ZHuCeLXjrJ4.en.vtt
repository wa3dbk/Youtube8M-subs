00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:06.690
 olivero apples of the king 24 were 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.660
 commenting with him 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.670
 or which are in delta against 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.059
 of the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 and to see how well and well we are doing with 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.140
 that month to see objective forward 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 as we left the two here 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.000
 let's have here let's start and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.539
 we are here in this position 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.480
 we studied the barrel and again not 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.270
 exploits exploits the truth is that it is a 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.550
 hour and there you can fall calmly 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.019
 and hold on here this is very 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 important because here is it can 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:48.190
 leave one or two or even three and good 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.810
 as we marked in another chapter 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.420
 surely the r will also be and so 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.650
 having two positions to enter or 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.320
 be here that will be the axis its bearing 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.750
 here surely 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.100
 and then move on from here 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.990
 and the goal today of what to do is enter 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 at the base and as fast as possible 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.300
 and know 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.460
 there could be a waiting there like 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.740
 we have said before and here I have a lot 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.000
 There is usually a fire zone 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:31.080
 crossed this in there is very careful 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.530
 so I think that there we have the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.940
 always problem of the objective smc that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.190
 says host I have there the defensive well 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.080
 that I do not have right now but you take 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.930
 this unit now and for inside or 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:53.820
 directly from outside but it's for 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:55.490
 up the crystals and from here 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.159
 OK 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.530
 there we have the first time we have a 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.119
 feasibility we have the barrel but 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.890
 then it is complicated beginning in the end 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.500
 that has a lot of coverage and is very 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.720
 difficult to kill people once 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.970
 we are already here that we do not have to 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.459
 no enemy in this hall we have 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.030
 be careful with here and we already take flag 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.850
 always on the same side 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.880
 and I will return to change the restaurant with 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.700
 the pineapple that is everything is new but good 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.470
 here or go you are not high and I hope here 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.170
 here that historians and all 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.450
 shit was going in 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.890
 I believe that this is all they wanted to do 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.569
 an objective 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.040
 we are not going to start 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.140
 once you are in the game 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 simply 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.209
 be calm to endure in places like 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.300
 this one to kill one and for fast inside 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.100
 and always without fear go ahead 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.150
 ancient land instead of this side that 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.150
 always keep in mind 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.180
 as well as from here for the part of the 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.190
 right of loading the truth is that 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.060
 I play a lot because it's not camping 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.060
 that there is always some elite where 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.060
 sugar 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.400
 well we start here like everyone 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.470
 well the first thing that is good 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.720
 that there are quite a few ways to play and 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.370
 pretty ways to play and first thing 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.200
 what can one do is throw a daze 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.760
 wing over here to exploit the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.430
 barrels from inside and we can to those of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.010
 your team when when along the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.170
 game comes around here and possibly 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.060
 you can get one out there somewhere else out there 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.440
 It depends on the street people how can each 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.750
 one but normally this can come out 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.060
 between 1 and 2 per liter, so load and 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.690
 Beware of bits here and here 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.810
 what it puts you can kill people then the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.840
 another to er can perfectly hold 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.430
 from here back a little to those who 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.519
 go out there like you said 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.890
 before you or even come here 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.680
 with two balls and get here 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.280
 cover the center a bit or giving support 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.830
 what is the asset axis then the 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.310
 form of placement as this would be 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.889
 basically one here would stay 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.840
 back here that is how it is we depend on the 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.910
 each one's game but the clans that 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.740
 seen what they play they play basically 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.820
 one here covering what this 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.480
 Hall 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:31.380
 or hid here and the other in the 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.700
 hallway could be to see 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.090
 the staircase is that a pretty site 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.150
 good giving from here 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.820
 the coverage he smg even from here 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.540
 behind giving pillando respon you can 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.949
 have the bunker or here killing what 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.870
 I'll be him it's like more complicated than 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:54.889
 is to put you on long stairs of a 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:57.830
 it took off more complicated and then it's not 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.770
 it's quite normal right now he uses it 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.889
 many people respond well then yes 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.479
 a line in this part of the map when 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.759
 what the center looking over there for 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.340
 the left the other 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.229
 it can be or here normally 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.810
 I always believe that almost the entire screen 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.669
 you have to play I always have an uncle 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.249
 here tucked covering what is the part 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.419
 from the center of the map center over here 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.430
 looking over there 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.139
 your answer or if not when your 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.710
 team pulls flag gets here for 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.710
 yes yes backing catch what he does 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.710
 I will bring it is in the center 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.410
 and it's from here looking for the other 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.330
 air is coming through here and I will answer 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.110
 from here or as you said I think 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.930
 here not if it gets here and eats 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.880
 all the people in the mouth is basically 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.880
 the game form of this this side in 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.040
 in the role of air can change a lot of 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.720
 this side because the positions are very 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.500
 variables depends on the answer so I 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.860
 I think nothing else 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:05.770
 Well, it's being easy and it's going 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.770
 rangers and is already close to god 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.180
 CalderÃ³n this is starting a new 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.060
 series with revenge leader mulatos 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.170
 I'm the iter and we're in 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:22.530
 bad moment flag in the first 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.530
 tutorial or if tutorial can be said no
