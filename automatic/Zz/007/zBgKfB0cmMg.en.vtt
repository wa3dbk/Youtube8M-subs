this<00:00:42.239> film<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.710> impact<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.430> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
this film I think that the impact was so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.000 
this film I think that the impact was so
hard<00:00:44.670> because<00:00:45.239> when<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.140> watch<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.739> film

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
hard because when you watch that film

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.549 
hard because when you watch that film
you<00:00:47.640> may<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.090> been<00:00:48.300> Mary<00:00:48.570> Jones<00:00:48.930> watching

you may have been Mary Jones watching
yeah<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:51.270> believe<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
yeah and I really believe that if you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
yeah and I really believe that if you
are<00:00:52.410> Mary<00:00:52.710> Jones<00:00:53.010> watching<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> changes<00:00:54.270> your

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
are Mary Jones watching it changes your

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.119 
are Mary Jones watching it changes your
life<00:00:54.480> because<00:00:55.020> sometimes<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.710> don't<00:00:55.890> know

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
life because sometimes you don't know

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
life because sometimes you don't know
what<00:00:56.370> you're<00:00:56.550> doing<00:00:56.820> until<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.750> yes
