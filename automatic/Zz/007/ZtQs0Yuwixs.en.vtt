widescreen<00:00:22.769> monitor<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> monitor

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
widescreen monitor so this is a monitor

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.779 
widescreen monitor so this is a monitor
that<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.230> actually<00:00:25.439> saved<00:00:25.949> up<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.250> little<00:00:26.490> bit<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
that I actually saved up a little bit to

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.820 
that I actually saved up a little bit to
buy<00:00:26.970> myself<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.199> isn't<00:00:28.500> something<00:00:28.710> that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
buy myself so this isn't something that

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.220 
buy myself so this isn't something that
was<00:00:29.039> sent<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> me<00:00:29.429> by<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.640> company<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.090> review<00:00:30.630> so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
was sent to me by a company to review so

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.510 
was sent to me by a company to review so
this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.740> something<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.160> is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
this is going to be something that is

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.459 
this is going to be something that is
something<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.480> spent<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.200> bit<00:00:34.380> of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
something that I spent a little bit of

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.069 
something that I spent a little bit of
time<00:00:34.680> researching<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.640> order<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.360> buy<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.960> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
time researching in order to buy and I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.600 
time researching in order to buy and I
really<00:00:37.380> made<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.620> investment<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
really made the investment in it so this

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
really made the investment in it so this
is<00:00:38.670> something<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> consider<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> be<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
is something that I consider to be a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.319 
is something that I consider to be a
quality<00:00:41.040> product<00:00:41.309> before<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.730> even<00:00:41.910> take<00:00:42.210> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
quality product before I even take it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
quality product before I even take it
out<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> box<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.559> right<00:00:43.739> at<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> top<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
out of the box so right at the top you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.139 
out of the box so right at the top you
can<00:00:44.370> see<00:00:44.520> there's<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> little<00:00:44.940> bit<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
can see there's a little bit of

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
can see there's a little bit of
styrofoam<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.960> we'll<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.469> ahead<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.649> cut<00:00:46.980> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
styrofoam and we'll go ahead and cut and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.600 
styrofoam and we'll go ahead and cut and
have<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.940> styrofoam<00:00:48.420> open<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.110> moment<00:00:49.610> so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
have the styrofoam open in a moment so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.130 
have the styrofoam open in a moment so
this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.120> looks<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.390> once<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.899> get

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
this is what it looks like once you get

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.959 
this is what it looks like once you get
it<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.680> box<00:00:52.920> itself<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.760> actually

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it out of the box itself and actually

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
it out of the box itself and actually
within<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.899> box<00:00:55.289> next<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> styrofoam

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
within the box next to the styrofoam

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.950 
within the box next to the styrofoam
which<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.910> what<00:00:57.030> made<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.420> hard<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> take

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
which is what made it so hard to take

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.720 
which is what made it so hard to take
out<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> couple<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.460> other<00:00:59.640> things

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
out you get a couple of other things

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240 
out you get a couple of other things
besides<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> monitor<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.170> get<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> AC<00:01:01.800> power

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
besides the monitor you get the AC power

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.009 
besides the monitor you get the AC power
adapter<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:03.030> plug<00:01:03.059> directly<00:01:03.390> into<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> back

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
adapter to plug directly into the back

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.320 
adapter to plug directly into the back
of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.229> monitor<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.850> VGA

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
of the monitor and you get your VGA

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.800 
of the monitor and you get your VGA
cable<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.110> does<00:01:07.380> come<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.189> VGA<00:01:08.909> port<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
cable this does come with a VGA port a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.399 
cable this does come with a VGA port a
DVI<00:01:10.350> port<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:12.270> power<00:01:12.479> cable<00:01:12.810> however

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
DVI port and the power cable however

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.100 
DVI port and the power cable however
this<00:01:13.560> only<00:01:13.740> comes<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.909> cable<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.450> HDMI

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
this only comes with the cable for HDMI

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.289 
this only comes with the cable for HDMI
so<00:01:16.890> getting<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.220> into<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> monitor<00:01:17.939> itself

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
so getting right into the monitor itself

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.539 
so getting right into the monitor itself
it<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.600> pretty<00:01:19.200> nicely<00:01:19.439> packaged<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.400> can

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it is pretty nicely packaged as you can

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.910 
it is pretty nicely packaged as you can
tell<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:21.540> facedown<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> took<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.830> out

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
tell it's facedown the way I took it out

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.999 
tell it's facedown the way I took it out

stand with the rubber plating that will

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.710 
stand with the rubber plating that will
help<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.829> keep<00:01:32.579> from<00:01:32.820> sliding<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> very

heavily weighted stand that we'll have

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
heavily weighted stand that we'll have
to<00:01:36.000> attach<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> monitor<00:01:36.990> after<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.439> take

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
to attach to the monitor after we take

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
to attach to the monitor after we take
it<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> box<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> now<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.689> flip<00:01:39.990> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it out of the box so now as we flip this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.780 
it out of the box so now as we flip this
over<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.650> I'll<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.829> go<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.670> ahead
