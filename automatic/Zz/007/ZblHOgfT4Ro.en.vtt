00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hi everyone, today I am 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.520
 particularly happy to do this 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.370
 video because I want to show you how 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.750
 make in modeling paste using 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.059
 of hair conditioner 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.370
 I think it's a recipe 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.560
 excellent both because we can reuse 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.840
 the balm that we no longer use 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.279
 maybe because we found ourselves sea either 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.170
 because we can have our people play 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.750
 children with a homemade pasta 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.869
 therefore we teach him the beauty of the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.699
 recycling and DIY and in addition seen 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.669
 that we will use balsam and balms 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.100
 we are usually fragrant also 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.989
 to make a game that involves more senses 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.309
 so not only was the touch seen but 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.540
 also the sense of smell 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.059
 but let's move on to the ingredients 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 first of all we need our balm 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.460
 for hair then wheat flour 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.770
 soft corn oil that is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.199
 preferable to olive oil because not 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.250
 goes to alter the fragrance of the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.370
 balm 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.410
 finally we will need the dye I vi 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.660
 I recommend using a coloring that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.559
 go in connection with the fragrance of the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.930
 balm 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.450
 for example if the balm is strawberry 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.030
 you can use a red or six color 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.400
 balm and orange you can use the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 orange color and I would dare pink because 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840
 despite this balm is the fruits a 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.060
 a very floral fragrance then 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 I decided to use this color 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 obviously the last thing we need 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.780
 measuring cups to measure all the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.210
 quantity and a bowl mix all 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.939
 the ingredients in our content e 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.579
 let's first put 125 g of 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.850
 balsam and we are going to color it to ours 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.850
 will 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.000
 then we add 30 ml of seed oil of 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.000
 linen 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.900
 and 150 grams of flour 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.060
 no 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.570
 we have therefore obtained this 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.420
 beautiful mouldable paste that is a lot 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.160
 very light and equally soft 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.500
 perfumed plus the expense is 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.600
 really very small and we can 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.370
 do the quantity we want when 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.170
 we want is a pasta that dries 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.209
 in the air so definitely shortly 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.370
 conservation prayers than for a 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.890
 the afternoon is very fragrant 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.720
 perfect i hope this project will 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.730
 be pleased I assure you that I am 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.610
 holding back from eating by good smell 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.500
 which really would like to make you feel real 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.360
