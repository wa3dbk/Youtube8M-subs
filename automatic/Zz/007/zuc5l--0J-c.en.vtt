00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
new folder containing the character if I

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.229 
new folder containing the character if I
spin<00:00:54.290> this<00:00:54.410> open<00:00:54.800> I<00:00:54.950> find<00:00:55.730> a<00:00:55.820> folder<00:00:56.000> of

a<00:01:13.670> cube<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.450> I'm<00:01:14.780> dragging<00:01:15.619> this<00:01:15.710> animation

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
a cube that I'm dragging this animation

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.800 
a cube that I'm dragging this animation
on<00:01:16.369> there's<00:01:16.580> there's<00:01:16.970> nothing<00:01:17.240> about<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.690> that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
was prepared to be animated so if I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.639

I'll<00:01:57.470> make<00:01:57.920> sure<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.189> he<00:01:58.700> is<00:01:59.170> 0<00:02:00.170> 0<00:02:00.200> 0<00:02:00.439> looks

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
I'll make sure that he is 0 0 0 looks

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.310 
I'll make sure that he is 0 0 0 looks
pretty<00:02:01.220> good<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.610> here<00:02:02.509> we<00:02:02.630> can<00:02:02.780> see<00:02:03.020> he's

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
pretty good and here we can see he's

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.260 
pretty good and here we can see he's
already<00:02:03.799> got<00:02:04.040> all<00:02:04.310> these<00:02:04.520> animations<00:02:04.880> ready

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
already got all these animations ready

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.330 
already got all these animations ready
to<00:02:05.329> roll

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
to roll

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.040 
to roll
that's<00:02:07.579> our<00:02:07.759> character<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:09.560> if<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:09.739> press<00:02:09.950> play

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
that's our character so if we press play

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.990 
that's our character so if we press play
running<00:02:12.440> by<00:02:12.590> default<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.550> don't<00:02:13.730> want<00:02:13.850> that

I<00:02:14.180> want<00:02:14.210> him<00:02:14.450> clean<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.170> let's<00:02:15.380> look<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.310> here

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
I want him clean so let's look and here

in<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.210> animation<00:02:17.330> node<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.080> can<00:02:18.110> see<00:02:18.440> he's

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
in the animation node we can see he's

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.370 
in the animation node we can see he's
set<00:02:18.860> up<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.130> run<00:02:19.340> by<00:02:19.640> default<00:02:20.080> let's<00:02:21.080> select

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
into your scene so there we go he's

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.460 
into your scene so there we go he's
ready<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.000> roll<00:02:32.240> now<00:02:32.590> let's<00:02:33.590> set<00:02:34.190> him<00:02:34.280> up

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
I'm gonna make sure he's selected okay

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.470 
I'm gonna make sure he's selected okay
I'm<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.470> add<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> new<00:02:41.130> FSM<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.030> we<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.300> create

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
I'm gonna add a new FSM so we can create

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.960 
I'm gonna add a new FSM so we can create
our<00:02:42.570> graphs

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.820 

now<00:02:45.510> if<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.750> come<00:02:45.960> back<00:02:46.110> here<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.560> can<00:02:46.650> close

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
now if I come back here we can close

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.190 
now if I come back here we can close
prefabs<00:02:47.370> come<00:02:48.210> back<00:02:48.330> up<00:02:48.480> here<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.750> list<00:02:49.110> of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
prefabs come back up here to the list of

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.470 
prefabs come back up here to the list of
animations<00:02:49.710> if<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.950> drag<00:02:50.400> one<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:51.330> did

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
animations if I drag one on like we did

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.870 
animations if I drag one on like we did
with<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.720> cube<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:53.340> go<00:02:53.430> ahead<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.700> create

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
with the cube I can go ahead and create

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.630 
with the cube I can go ahead and create
a<00:02:54.060> play<00:02:54.270> animation<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.740> would<00:02:55.890> put

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
a play animation and that would put

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.550 
a play animation and that would put
itself<00:02:56.910> right<00:02:57.150> into<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.480> state<00:02:57.780> but<00:02:58.230> even

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
itself right into this state but even

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.500 
itself right into this state but even
cooler<00:02:58.920> what<00:02:59.580> if<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.730> wanted<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.150> whole<00:03:00.330> new

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
cooler what if I wanted a whole new

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.080 
cooler what if I wanted a whole new
state<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.590> drag<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.040> animation<00:03:02.610> into<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
state I can drag that animation into the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.570 
state I can drag that animation into the
graph<00:03:03.390> view<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.990> get<00:03:04.440> an<00:03:04.560> option<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.920> make<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.430> new

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
graph view I get an option to make a new

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.390
