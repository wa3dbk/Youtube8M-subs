any additional additional new fresh

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.010 
any additional additional new fresh
water<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> need<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> pump<00:01:15.150> air<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.810> then

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
water so you need to pump air and then

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.310 
water so you need to pump air and then
you<00:01:17.009> know<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> water<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.790> cycle<00:01:18.330> within<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you know the water or cycle within the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.390 
you know the water or cycle within the
paint<00:01:19.560> through<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> filter<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.210> back<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:22.400> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
paint through the filter and back out to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.170 
paint through the filter and back out to
the<00:01:24.390> water<00:01:24.659> supply<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.680> side<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the water supply on the right side so I

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.090 
the water supply on the right side so I
discovered<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:28.829> similar

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
discovered this is a very similar

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.990 
discovered this is a very similar
concept

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
concept

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.030 
concept
it's<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.020> need<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.799> tweaking

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it's just need a little bit of tweaking

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.870 
it's just need a little bit of tweaking
okay<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:33.979> internal<00:01:34.979> freezer<00:01:35.549> box

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
okay so this is my internal freezer box

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.069 
okay so this is my internal freezer box
with<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.810> my<00:01:36.930> fries<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.650> sight<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:39.079> couldn't

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
looking over to the babies obviously

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.690

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
pretty anxious to put in a bit about the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.920 
pretty anxious to put in a bit about the
reason<00:01:54.000> why<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:54.240> sometimes<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
reason why is because sometimes the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.440

tank which I secured using blue
rubberband<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.730> as<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.180> see<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.750> also

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
rubberband and as you can see I also

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.360 
rubberband and as you can see I also
drew<00:02:28.280> like<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.940> three<00:02:29.480> holes<00:02:29.750> on<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.860> left

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
drew like the three holes on the left

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.210 
drew like the three holes on the left
side<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.270> tank<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> tree<00:02:33.860> hole<00:02:34.040> on

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
side of the tank and on a tree hole on

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.970 
side of the tank and on a tree hole on
the<00:02:34.400> other<00:02:34.489> side<00:02:34.790> is<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:36.110> that<00:02:36.380> at<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.830> certain

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
the other side is so that at a certain

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.860 
the other side is so that at a certain
water<00:02:37.310> level<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.910> water<00:02:38.060> will<00:02:38.450> actually

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
water level the water will actually

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.229 
water level the water will actually
overflow<00:02:39.650> out<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.310> tank<00:02:40.610> without

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
overflow out of the tank without

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.710 
overflow out of the tank without
overflowing<00:02:41.690> above<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.920> cover<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.420> if

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
overflowing above this cover so that if

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.930 
overflowing above this cover so that if
not<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.200> Frog<00:02:45.440> will<00:02:45.650> not<00:02:45.769> stream<00:02:46.250> out<00:02:46.489> of<00:02:46.549> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
not the Frog will not stream out of the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.199 
not the Frog will not stream out of the
tank<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:49.280> holes<00:02:49.580> are<00:02:49.880> actually

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
tank and the holes are actually

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.990 
tank and the holes are actually
separated<00:02:50.989> by<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.170> filter<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.670> tube

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
separated by the filter and the tube

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.960 
separated by the filter and the tube
itself<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.750> covered<00:02:54.110> by<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> filter<00:02:54.920> back<00:02:55.459> so

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
itself is covered by a filter back so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.990 
itself is covered by a filter back so
that<00:02:56.150> you're<00:02:56.510> not<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.720> sucker<00:02:57.049> like<00:02:57.799> my<00:02:58.130> shrimps

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
that you're not a sucker like my shrimps

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.509 
that you're not a sucker like my shrimps

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
into the tank and what we see that's it

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.140 
into the tank and what we see that's it
