00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.410
 very well guys we finally are 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.960
 managed to print our cube 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.270
 after various adjustments here of ours 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.530
 bird obviously felt the engine that 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.540
 goes jerky 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.000
 the important thing is to regulate the best 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.220
 nozzle possible before going to 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.740
 change the potentiometer on ours 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.840
 motor driver therefore has for example 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.190
 let's loosen some bolts for 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.770
 see for a moment to make it move more 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.450
 as easily as possible this is the cube 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.640
 we can't print 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.810
 see there are still problems with me 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.970
 I will still see a picture in the 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.100
 detail of the edges that are not 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.600
 perfectly regular these problems e 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 which to san barnaba of in the beginning has 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.710
 since the ball bearings are 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.260
 practically newcomers to this 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.450
 point then we go to set the feeling 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.079
 it was according to our extruder why 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.020
 I say this 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.879
 practically the pushing part if there 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.210
 you will need to adjust it also in 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.639
 software that is I have to tell arduino 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.330
 how many steps the engine needs for 

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:08.740
 throw down an inch of plastic 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.720
 very well to perform this 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.380
 operation we would need a caliber 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.990
 and a felt-tip pen 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.060
 we take the caliber and bring it to with 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.610
 an inch 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.950
 once done I go to support him 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.130
 above and with a marker I go to 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.960
 make a mark on the wire made here 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.750
 mark with the marker I say to the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.750
 printer with prof. forehead e 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 go to exclude 10 mm 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.880
 ok in this case the extrusion is already 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.310
 set by right but first instead of 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.580
 print me 10 mm had printed me 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.500
 only 7 mm so we'll have to do 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.840
 a small operation to go to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.750
 change the number of steps per 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.369
 destroy right 10 mm very well 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.790
 at this point we open ours 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.850
 hardware our river with arduino 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.760
 let's go to configuration h us that I have 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.959
 already underlined the 700 steps of the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.670
 structures 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.010
 we find it precisely on configuration h 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.560
 more or less it is the third sector 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.720
 then after configurations 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.989
 of electronics for a moment of the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.630
 resistance we find that precisely that 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.480
 I go to decide how many steps for the 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.380
 giulia simi eyes we have 80 steps 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.360
 to move one centimeter of the left 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.340
 in the yz axis 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.770
 we have this other number of steps here 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.890
 and ultimately for himself that ours 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.340
 we have an instructor here 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.209
 this is what we have the 700 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.330
 steps 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:59.690
 we excluded 8.5 mm then or do 700 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.430
 divided by 8.5 which makes this beautiful number le 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.829
 here 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.459
 this big number here for the report here 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.950
 below I do it for linen multiply by 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.900
 ten mine the hole in this the figure can 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.329
 obviously rounded off by the bible in 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.500
 down is not that I take this number 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:21.519
 here the couple and I go to copy to 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.799
 place of the eighteenth century I put 823 to this 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.340
 point I have nothing left to reload 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.340
 freeware 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.400
 very well guys we finally have 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.570
 finished building our printer 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.290
 of God 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.090
 now before you start printing 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.230
 actually it is less so comb 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.570
 some time will pass 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.820
 you have to start migrations and 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.170
 your plans to check a moment 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.380
 how you built the printer 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.940
 fasten and release the bolts e 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.500
 so on up to the point 12 a 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.490
 support a resolution anyway 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.020
 optimal 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.060
 so nothing for this little chain 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.830
 video tutorial is all I hope there is 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.380
 may serve precisely what can I say 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.450
 your printer of or at least still 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.100
 to better understand what it is made up of 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.080
 printed in all the work you can 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.140
 being behind and video professors is 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.030
 I hope everything can be useful in 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.360
 I'll see you next time, bye bye 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.360
 all
