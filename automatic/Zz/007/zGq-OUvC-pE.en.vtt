00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.109
 Hello tell you about options 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.090
 jumpers i have possible consequences in 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.460
 for the last two days while riding in 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.710
 ake began to feel light but unpleasant 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.859
 the smell of highly heated electrical insulation 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.449
 plastic after it was 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.189
 finally mark the option that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.720
 literally each traveling ahead 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.880
 machine the same problems with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.570
 wiring , it was decided to diagnose 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.550
 source of smell own car 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.980
 as soon as I looked under the torpedo to the left of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.850
 the steering column immediately saw a small 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.899
 bright light 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.059
 scarlet glow on the fuse box 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.510
 glowed red hot 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.360
 solid wire 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.750
 tie bars lintels which were tightened 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.190
 two adjacent contact pins 9 sockets and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.120
 10 wire turned within 1 millimeter 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.780
 if not less 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 it seems 09 no wonder big 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.440
 currents flowing only through this live 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.510
 began to warm her poor you are red 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.979
 due to the heating of the plastic contacts nearby 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.010
 with them began to melt when turned off 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 low beam headlights on calgary jumpers 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.880
 immediately subsided when you turn on the front 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.189
 the wiper core lived again 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.670
 red-hot not to mention trying 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.770
 turn on the rear window heater 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.350
 a little background at first everything was 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.869
 ok but with time either tension 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 this twisted wire weakened then 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.310
 either there was some sort of raid on us 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.970
 mating surfaces retracted 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 conclusions but the fact that the contact on the findings 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.210
 got worse it's a fact of going over my 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.250
 drive cautiously pads taxes ical 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.030
 practiced three or four years ago one 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.460
 automaster last spring I put myself 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.610
 my vologda pad 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.040
 good friend but used in advance 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.640
 cooked jumpers with terminals on 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.250
 ends like this by the way this 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.439
 jumper two twisted in the middle 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.739
 short thick wires with terminals on 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.810
 the ends helped after the 10 minute kolda 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.930
 continue under torpedoes then 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.620
 the movement the next day I soldered 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.260
 twist 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.569
 put on a regular rubber insulation on 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.470
 terminals and decided to leave this jumper 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.340
 how the workers after this case sealed 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.700
 slightly also 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.970
 and the conclusions of other contacts so strapped 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.150
 same 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.730
 single core wire due to the fact that 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.160
 Volkovsky pad fuse has 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.190
 3 nests more than regular shackles 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.790
 and it gave the opportunity to get out of this 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.860
 situations pretty quickly 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.209
 wires 9 and 10 sockets 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.290
 transferred to unused spare sockets 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.290
 in one of the nest there 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.750
 due to the heating of the plastic near 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.580
 contact with the tenth a little bit as they say 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.989
 swam 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:09.810
 so the carry forward went to 12 and 13 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:13.610
 jacks based on the length of the wires 9 socket 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.790
 moved to 13 last a 10 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.739
 respectively at 12 what's use in 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.590
 as a gadget single wire 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.959
 for screed contacts I consider extremely 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.959
 unwanted luck everyone
