00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
back asleep so I decided to experiment

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.089 
back asleep so I decided to experiment
today<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.400> it's<00:00:26.840> minus<00:00:27.840> 25<00:00:28.140> today<00:00:28.710> except

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
today so it's minus 25 today except

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.310 
today so it's minus 25 today except
degree<00:00:29.400> Celsius<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> windchill<00:00:31.080> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
degree Celsius but with the windchill it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.740 
degree Celsius but with the windchill it
feels<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:32.040> advice<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.730> me<00:00:32.910> degree<00:00:33.239> Celsius

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
feels like advice for me degree Celsius

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.420 
feels like advice for me degree Celsius
which<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:33.989> actually<00:00:34.559> minus<00:00:34.860> 40<00:00:35.100> degrees
