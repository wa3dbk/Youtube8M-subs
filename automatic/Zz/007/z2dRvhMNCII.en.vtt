 Hello, thank you so much for visiting. 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.840
 to my channel of ariel and beloved occasion what 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.779
 What I want to show you is how to make a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.640
 Napolitano plan will be doing 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:40.210
 other flavors such as corn and peach 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.750
 yogurt and well I hope you do not 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.580
 lose later on here I have the 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.720
 eggs I'm going to bring them to liquefy 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:53.060
 I have eggs milk evaporated milk 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.760
 condensed cream cheese 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.420
 I also have vanilla here I have my 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.880
 candy for what is the Neapolitan 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.610
 a lot and had put a little 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.850
 d 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:13.210
 the video that I made for this candy 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.780
 so they know how to do it go see 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.479
 a special video then there I'll go 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.290
 several tips to see how to have a 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.290
 good candy 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 and its different once I have my 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.549
 mold we are going to 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.100
 asia from the area a little bit so that 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.659
 spread the candy with the edges if 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.310
 is that he likes but nothing else so that 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.439
 have the part of leads doing the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.570
 blender only I need what is 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.340
 the vanilla and well then remember that 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.740
 as in all my videos always the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.890
 list of ingredients I leave at the end 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.590
 of the video then to be seen 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.950
 complete and do not remain with doubts 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.659
 I'm going to liquefy all this, look at me 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.299
 I had put everything in the blender 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.670
 I showed but I want to mention something 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.110
 very important they can do it like this in 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.689
 that way as I put everything in the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.429
 blender but something very important if 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.649
 you do not want your plan to come out like this 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.319
 as with eyes and this my sister of 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.269
 anticrisis javi that he has in his channel me 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.000
 he said it barely if they do not want it to come out 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.459
 with those work 2 that just does not taste bad 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.739
 everything is stirred and it tastes good too 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.090
 but if they want it as well as we believe milestone 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.329
 and well legal okay soft 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.360
 do so first fly what is the 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.610
 cheese and the rest leave until the last 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.079
 what are the eggs I took it out if I 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.510
 I separated because I like what I wanted if 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.280
 we believe milestone 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.519
 so it's not because what makes 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.010
 It's like that foam on the eggs 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.459
 with the games with which they vanish 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.500
 so here I have cream cheese and 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.909
 rest of the ingredients I reached 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.450
 save them 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:54.299
 I already have the ingredients already liquefied 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.620
 then I tell them they can do it all 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.659
 together 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.280
 not here I am going to empty what are the 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.560
 eggs 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.330
 then already once I put the eggs 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.800
 then I will not grind much longer 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.170
 it's going to liquefy so much because I do not want 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.630
 make a lot of foam as I tell you in the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.690
 my case god I'm ready explaining the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.989
 difference of textures depending on 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.360
 how it liquefies in solana was 10 seconds 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.790
 no more if you continue and when you 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.400
 is going to make a lot of foam then in this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.770
 case as it takes cheese the one that has 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.989
 that he told me well, well, liquefied because 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.800
 If not then come cheese boys and 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.200
 I'm here to do my mold previously 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.350
 already caramelized and I already have here too 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.320
 a fountain where I'm going to sew in the plan 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.269
 special I'll do it in listening what 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.120
 can do in the oven and if you change them 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.560
 much the flavor but like this one I am 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.780
 doing for those who do not have an oven 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.090
 then it is destroying more videos of 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.340
 other plans and the oven is not ok 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.470
 We will cover it with the child 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.180
 well well covered well 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.180
 Look, I put it in the casserole at 50, not what 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.430
 go to put it in the water bath and always 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.710
 that the water after the texture has no 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.530
 in half your system give us from my house 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.240
 nor above, because if not what 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.650
 it's going to happen that when it starts to boil and 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.510
 more when modern so so high starts 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.260
 to boil and what's going to happen they're going 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.020
 to put the water then do not exceed 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.750
 in water I've got it right and what 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.950
 I'm going to do is cover it with the 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.950
 cover of the shell 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.650
 here is going to keep all the steam and not 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.140
 will come out on the sides then you should 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.030
 sew receive us then neither has 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.440
 neglected a time be as senza more 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.290
 fast on the stove also that in the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.150
 oven if they put it in the oven put the 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.730
 305 375 degrees fahrenheit beatriz of 35 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.320
 40 minutes until they put a knife 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.560
 and go out to be with fiat and I just 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.720
 Check has already gone 25 minutes 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.260
 and I tell them it's faster than in the 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:10.040
 oven because in the oven if it takes from 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:13.250
 30 to 40 minutes then they will put the 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.270
 knife and they would come out that clean 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.430
 it is because it is already 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.560
 and we have to let it cool we take it out 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.660
 of operating rooms gets worse if it was temperature 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.300
 environment a little bit and then we put it 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.280
 to the amateur and it's only 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.560
 then we will be able to unmold it 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.230
 otherwise if they try to unmold 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.230
 with looking warm they are hurt sanxenxo 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.750
 and in the mold, well, it's been a while since I 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.340
 I always leave it overnight in the 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.640
 refrigerator so as not to rush 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.370
 of it getting cold or like that and it's really good 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.370
 but that is well cold well something else 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.620
 what I am going to tell you is that when 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.110
 they take us out of the oven as soon as they pass 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.720
 ten minutes and have it at temperature 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.290
 environment happens on a stick around 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.930
 so that they will not be beaten by 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.750
 If the doubts stick well, we will 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.350
 unmold not here I have a tray 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.350
 so 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.550
 in only turn 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.050
 Y 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.880
 here is the flan then depending 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:33.010
 the candy also that both leave it 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.870
 of this color is how they will be if 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.550
 they leave it darker because they will be left 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.729
 darker but also sometimes bitter 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.830
 a little bit 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.969
 Well, I'm showing you here a 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:48.089
 little bit with fruit when the candy 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:50.550
 decoration today is already you say it is 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:53.370
 because I was taking the pictures of 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.069
 presentation but look at everything 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.469
 can do with this candy I hope 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:01.199
 who can see the video and well to 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:03.919
 request of several people I have to 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:06.120
 do the hard work that is to prove it 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:08.389
 they have been telling me that I have to 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.080
 try the food or because I do not 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.080
 then you have to prove it 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.010
 it's not because I've done it but it's 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.410
 rich in this Neapolitan plan I like 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:25.410
 much my mom did not do it but with 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.510
 cottage cheese this I put cream cheese what 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.280
 can do without cream cheese also the 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:34.050
 You can upload other videos from 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.509
 other flavors like peach mocha 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.120
 mommy there are several there are many 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:40.919
 so I hope you are aware 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.389
 that you can see them then if you liked it 

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.940
 my life please a little finger up 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:47.310
 I always ask you please and so 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.810
