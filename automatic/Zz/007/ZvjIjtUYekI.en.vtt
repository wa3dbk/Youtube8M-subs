moment drawing on their but feeling what

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.870

you know it is working or not or what

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.280 
you know it is working or not or what
have<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:16.119> think<00:01:16.270> that's<00:01:16.540> where<00:01:16.840> tattooing

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
have you I think that's where tattooing

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
have you I think that's where tattooing
becomes<00:01:17.650> a<00:01:18.299> real<00:01:19.299> art<00:01:19.600> form

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.050 

I<00:01:27.149> think<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.649> tattooing<00:01:29.189> has

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
I think that I think the tattooing has

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
I think that I think the tattooing has
got<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> unique<00:01:30.689> place<00:01:31.110> now<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:32.399> I<00:01:32.520> think

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
got a unique place now because I think

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.480 
got a unique place now because I think
that<00:01:32.909> many<00:01:33.240> people<00:01:33.560> possibly<00:01:34.560> most<00:01:34.920> people<00:01:35.369> in

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that many people possibly most people in

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.910 
that many people possibly most people in
modern<00:01:35.700> Western<00:01:36.030> society<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.110> largely

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
modern Western society a largely

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.779 
modern Western society a largely
surrounded<00:01:38.610> by<00:01:38.789> machine<00:01:39.270> made<00:01:40.789> mass-produced

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
surrounded by machine made mass-produced

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.149 
surrounded by machine made mass-produced
objects<00:01:42.479> whether<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> food<00:01:43.679> day<00:01:43.920> buy

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
objects whether it's the food day buy

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.520 
objects whether it's the food day buy
from<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> supermarket<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.659> furniture<00:01:46.350> they

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
from the supermarket the furniture they

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.789 
from the supermarket the furniture they
sit<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.700> films<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.630> watch<00:01:48.929> they<00:01:49.500> know

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
sit on the films they watch they know

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
sit on the films they watch they know
that<00:01:50.159> all<00:01:50.280> these<00:01:50.520> things<00:01:50.820> many<00:01:51.420> other<00:01:51.659> people

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that all these things many other people

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.779 
that all these things many other people
are<00:01:51.990> consuming<00:01:52.560> exactly<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> same<00:01:53.280> thing

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
are consuming exactly the same thing

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.819 
are consuming exactly the same thing
I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.360> tattooing<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> chance<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.710> people

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
I think tattooing is a chance for people

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.319 
I think tattooing is a chance for people
to<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.280> something<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.970> is<00:01:57.060> actually

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
to have something that is actually

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.440 
to have something that is actually
unique<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.409> them<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.159> not<00:01:59.670> only<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.179> but

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
unique for them and not only that but

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
unique for them and not only that but
they<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.990> very<00:02:01.350> personal<00:02:01.709> intimate

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
they are in very personal intimate

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.070 
they are in very personal intimate
contact<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.179> person<00:02:03.539> that's<00:02:03.600> doing<00:02:03.720> it

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
contact with the person that's doing it

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.559 
contact with the person that's doing it
for<00:02:04.350> them<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> tattoo<00:02:05.670> artist<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.240> I

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
for them as in the tattoo artist so I

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.100 
for them as in the tattoo artist so I
think<00:02:06.689> there<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.090> reason<00:02:09.090> why<00:02:09.479> doing

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
think there is a is a reason why doing

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.430 
think there is a is a reason why doing
is<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.400> popular<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.090> well<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.959> charge<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
is is so popular now well the charge of

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.940 
is is so popular now well the charge of
tattooing<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.019> handmade<00:02:16.319> object

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
tattooing is that it's a handmade object

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.150 
tattooing is that it's a handmade object
and<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.900> don't<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:19.799> they<00:02:19.860> will<00:02:19.950> ever

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
and and and I don't think they will ever

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.580 
and and and I don't think they will ever
be<00:02:20.370> away<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.269> put<00:02:21.510> your<00:02:21.630> arm<00:02:21.840> into<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.290> kind
