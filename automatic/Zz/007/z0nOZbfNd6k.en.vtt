that this one has just a few more paint
apps<00:03:30.680> on<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.270> but<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.390> desert<00:03:32.780> recolor<00:03:33.290> looks

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
apps on it but the desert recolor looks

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.990 
apps on it but the desert recolor looks
once<00:03:34.340> again

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
once again

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.650 
once again
a<00:03:35.030> little<00:03:35.570> more<00:03:35.750> vibrant<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:37.250> it's<00:03:38.150> still<00:03:38.570> good

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
a little more vibrant so it's still good

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.930 
a little more vibrant so it's still good

joined<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.100> list<00:04:10.250> of<00:04:10.430> fans<00:04:10.730> who<00:04:10.940> wondered<00:04:11.390> why

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
joined the list of fans who wondered why

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.050 
joined the list of fans who wondered why
this<00:04:11.930> wasn't<00:04:12.170> fixed<00:04:12.770> to<00:04:12.920> begin<00:04:13.280> with<00:04:16.060> but

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
this wasn't fixed to begin with but

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.080 
this wasn't fixed to begin with but
seriously<00:04:17.739> this<00:04:18.739> not<00:04:19.010> only<00:04:19.310> improves<00:04:19.820> the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
seriously this not only improves the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.810 
seriously this not only improves the
stability<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.930> robot<00:04:21.350> mode<00:04:21.700> but<00:04:22.700> it

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
stability of the robot mode but it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.700 
stability of the robot mode but it
increases<00:04:23.270> my<00:04:23.660> overall<00:04:24.200> opinion<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.890> this<00:04:25.070> toy

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
increases my overall opinion of this toy

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.400 
increases my overall opinion of this toy
as<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.919> said<00:04:28.190> earlier<00:04:28.580> this<00:04:29.419> was<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:29.720> potentially

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
as I said earlier this was a potentially

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.940 
as I said earlier this was a potentially
good<00:04:30.560> figure<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.250> now<00:04:32.230> that<00:04:33.230> potential<00:04:33.830> has

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
good figure and now that potential has

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.400 
good figure and now that potential has
been<00:04:33.980> reached<00:04:36.640> overall<00:04:37.780> while<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.990> desert

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
been reached overall while the desert

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.190 
been reached overall while the desert
color<00:04:39.620> scheme<00:04:40.010> looks<00:04:40.280> more<00:04:40.580> dynamic<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.930> best

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
color scheme looks more dynamic the best

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.810 
color scheme looks more dynamic the best
thing<00:04:42.470> about<00:04:42.500> this<00:04:42.980> version<00:04:43.250> is<00:04:43.580> that<00:04:43.760> the

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
thing about this version is that the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.620 
thing about this version is that the
shoulders<00:04:44.540> have<00:04:44.720> finally<00:04:45.410> been<00:04:45.560> fixed<00:04:46.630> so

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
shoulders have finally been fixed so

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.420 
shoulders have finally been fixed so
it's<00:04:47.780> worth<00:04:47.990> getting<00:04:48.020> even<00:04:48.830> if<00:04:48.919> you<00:04:49.040> have<00:04:49.250> the

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
it's worth getting even if you have the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.070 
it's worth getting even if you have the
original<00:04:51.730> next<00:04:52.730> I'm<00:04:52.880> reviewing<00:04:53.210> star<00:04:53.810> wars
