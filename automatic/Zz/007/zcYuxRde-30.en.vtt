decided<00:00:01.889> to<00:00:01.949> take<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.070> video<00:00:02.400> of<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:02.640> Bitcoin

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:02.910 
decided to take a video of this Bitcoin

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.639 
decided to take a video of this Bitcoin
miner<00:00:03.330> so<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:03.570> can<00:00:03.750> show<00:00:03.900> some<00:00:04.109> of<00:00:04.229> the<00:00:04.290> parts<00:00:04.529> in

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:04.649 
miner so I can show some of the parts in

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.549 
miner so I can show some of the parts in
more<00:00:04.830> detail<00:00:05.220> so<00:00:05.970> say<00:00:06.180> for<00:00:06.209> you<00:00:06.689> rackmount

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:07.559 
more detail so say for you rackmount

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:13.370 
more detail so say for you rackmount
case<00:00:08.720> it's<00:00:09.720> got<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.520> 360<00:00:11.810> radiator<00:00:12.810> in<00:00:13.050> here

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
case it's got a 360 radiator in here

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.940 
case it's got a 360 radiator in here
with<00:00:13.770> there's<00:00:14.640> the<00:00:14.730> ultra<00:00:15.150> k's<00:00:15.590> fans<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.860> the

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
with there's the ultra k's fans on the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.800 
with there's the ultra k's fans on the
front<00:00:17.190> there's<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.640> fan<00:00:18.030> controller<00:00:18.450> so<00:00:18.750> I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
front there's the fan controller so I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.540 
front there's the fan controller so I
can<00:00:19.020> turn<00:00:19.830> them<00:00:19.950> down<00:00:19.980> when<00:00:20.280> I<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
can turn them down when I have a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.260 
can turn them down when I have a
conference<00:00:20.910> call<00:00:21.140> something<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.260> that

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
conference call something like that

conference call something like that
accumulates<00:00:24.270> dust<00:00:24.510> pretty<00:00:24.750> quickly<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.140> just

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
accumulates dust pretty quickly I just

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.220 
accumulates dust pretty quickly I just
cleaned<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.940> about<00:00:26.940> a<00:00:27.000> week<00:00:27.240> ago<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.750> need<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
cleaned this about a week ago I need to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.490 
cleaned this about a week ago I need to
clean<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:28.619> again<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.160> today<00:00:30.350> here's<00:00:31.350> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
clean out again here today here's the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.740 
clean out again here today here's the
Supplemental<00:00:32.070> 450<00:00:32.610> watt<00:00:32.759> power<00:00:32.970> supply<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
Supplemental 450 watt power supply it is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.750 
Supplemental 450 watt power supply it is
being<00:00:33.989> fed<00:00:34.320> exhaust<00:00:34.770> from<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> radiator<00:00:35.399> as

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
being fed exhaust from the radiator as

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.630 
being fed exhaust from the radiator as
its<00:00:35.940> input<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.780> good<00:00:37.309> but<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.489> far

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
its input which is not good but so far

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.290 
its input which is not good but so far
it's<00:00:38.790> surviving<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:40.790> reservoir<00:00:42.590> and<00:00:44.300> these

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it's surviving the reservoir and these

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.970 
it's surviving the reservoir and these
tubes<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.440> worried<00:00:46.680> i'm<00:00:46.770> getting

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
tubes you know I was worried i'm getting

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
tubes you know I was worried i'm getting
algae<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.489> i<00:00:47.550> think<00:00:47.790> it<00:00:47.910> might<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.180> be

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
algae but i think it might actually be

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.610 
algae but i think it might actually be
corrosion<00:00:48.960> from<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.670> copper<00:00:50.670> water<00:00:50.850> blocks

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
corrosion from the copper water blocks

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.880 
corrosion from the copper water blocks
also<00:00:52.620> not<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:54.230> mostly<00:00:55.230> haven't<00:00:55.800> had

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
also not good but mostly haven't had

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069 
also not good but mostly haven't had
time<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.100> suss<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.700> a<00:00:56.969> gig<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.750> ram<00:00:57.780> is

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
time to suss it out a gig of ram is

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.750 
time to suss it out a gig of ram is
because<00:00:58.289> i<00:00:58.350> actually<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.190> run<00:00:59.520> some

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
because i actually use this to run some

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.799 
because i actually use this to run some
music<00:01:00.180> cpu<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.690> run<00:01:00.870> some<00:01:01.050> other<00:01:01.170> stuff<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.809> see

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
music cpu to run some other stuff I see

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.800 
music cpu to run some other stuff I see
coolermaster<00:01:04.549> thousand<00:01:05.549> watt<00:01:05.729> psu<00:01:06.119> which<00:01:06.690> is

coolermaster thousand watt psu which is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
coolermaster thousand watt psu which is
getting<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> heck<00:01:07.290> abused<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
getting the heck abused out of it the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.280 
getting the heck abused out of it the
reason<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.270> today<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:09.960> put<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
reason it's out today is I just put in a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.090 
reason it's out today is I just put in a
couple<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:11.659> kala<00:01:12.659> flow<00:01:12.960> exhaust<00:01:13.290> fans<00:01:13.860> those

couple of kala flow exhaust fans those

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700 
couple of kala flow exhaust fans those
in<00:01:14.280> getting<00:01:14.549> good<00:01:15.150> enough<00:01:15.330> exhaust<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.560> get

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
in getting good enough exhaust you get

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.679 
in getting good enough exhaust you get
better<00:01:16.799> airflow<00:01:17.010> with<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
better airflow with that and here the

processor again now usually doing much
of<00:01:53.970> anything<00:01:54.150> so<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.650> a<00:01:55.770> mess<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> works

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
of anything so it's a mess but it works

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.120 
of anything so it's a mess but it works
and<00:01:56.970> it's<00:01:57.390> already<00:01:58.020> paid<00:01:58.170> itself<00:01:58.530> off<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.040> you

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and it's already paid itself off and you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.889 
and it's already paid itself off and you
can<00:01:59.189> use<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.640> generate<00:01:59.790> bitcoins<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.570> me<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
can use to generate bitcoins for me and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.929 
can use to generate bitcoins for me and
economically<00:02:01.579> hopefully<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:02.700> all<00:02:02.790> this

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
economically hopefully with all this

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969 
economically hopefully with all this
abuse<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> hardware<00:02:03.810> will<00:02:03.960> hold<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
abuse the hardware will hold up for a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.399 
abuse the hardware will hold up for a
little<00:02:05.100> bit<00:02:05.250> longer
