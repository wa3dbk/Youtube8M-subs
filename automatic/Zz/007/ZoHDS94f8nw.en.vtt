the<00:00:02.560> best<00:00:02.800> thing<00:00:03.010> about<00:00:03.040> biology<00:00:03.460> is<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:05.230> we

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
the best thing about biology is that we

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.160 
the best thing about biology is that we
is<00:00:05.620> that<00:00:06.249> as<00:00:06.339> a<00:00:06.370> study<00:00:06.669> of<00:00:06.819> life<00:00:07.120> and<00:00:07.479> we<00:00:07.930> still

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
is that as a study of life and we still

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.940 
is that as a study of life and we still
don't<00:00:08.260> know<00:00:08.380> what<00:00:08.559> that<00:00:08.590> is

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950 
don't know what that is

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.910 
don't know what that is
the<00:00:09.460> the<00:00:10.320> fundamental<00:00:11.320> difference<00:00:11.830> between

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
the the fundamental difference between

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.890 
the the fundamental difference between
things<00:00:12.759> that<00:00:12.820> are<00:00:12.910> alive<00:00:13.269> and<00:00:13.599> things<00:00:13.809> that

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
things that are alive and things that

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.849 
things that are alive and things that
are<00:00:14.080> not<00:00:14.110> alive<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:16.120> a<00:00:16.299> mystery<00:00:16.780> we<00:00:17.260> we<00:00:17.680> know<00:00:17.830> a

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:17.859 
are not alive is a mystery we we know a

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.849 
are not alive is a mystery we we know a
lot<00:00:18.100> about<00:00:18.130> living<00:00:18.910> things<00:00:19.449> but<00:00:19.840> we<00:00:20.680> don't

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
lot about living things but we don't

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.029 
lot about living things but we don't
know<00:00:21.240> exactly<00:00:22.240> what<00:00:23.109> it<00:00:23.230> is<00:00:23.380> that<00:00:23.619> makes<00:00:23.800> them

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
know exactly what it is that makes them

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.400 
know exactly what it is that makes them
living<00:00:24.250> and<00:00:24.939> that's<00:00:25.330> by<00:00:25.630> sure<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.929> best<00:00:26.140> part

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
living and that's by sure the best part

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.410 
living and that's by sure the best part
that's<00:00:26.650> that's<00:00:27.070> this<00:00:27.340> fundamental<00:00:28.000> mystery

00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:57.219 
changes in the structure of your brain

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.810 
changes in the structure of your brain
and<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:59.500> feels<00:00:59.949> like<00:01:00.129> I<00:01:00.250> should<00:01:00.280> warn<00:01:00.730> people

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
and it feels like I should warn people

and it feels like I should warn people
about<00:01:01.239> that<00:01:01.449> I<00:01:01.510> never<00:01:01.840> actually<00:01:02.260> went<00:01:02.530> out<00:01:02.620> and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
got a t-shirt before but if someone

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.500 
got a t-shirt before but if someone
walked<00:01:05.800> into<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.100> room<00:01:06.370> and<00:01:06.610> said<00:01:06.880> I'm<00:01:07.330> gonna

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
walked into a room and said I'm gonna

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.480 
walked into a room and said I'm gonna
change<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.900> structure<00:01:08.260> of<00:01:08.350> your<00:01:08.410> brain<00:01:08.530> you

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
change the structure of your brain you

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.370 
change the structure of your brain you
might<00:01:09.670> be<00:01:09.880> concerned<00:01:10.450> about<00:01:10.660> that<00:01:10.840> you<00:01:11.200> might

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.470 
might be concerned about that you might
want<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:11.920> take<00:01:12.280> some<00:01:12.310> precautions<00:01:12.610> if<00:01:13.300> you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
want to take some precautions if you

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.390 
want to take some precautions if you
like<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.500> way<00:01:14.590> your<00:01:14.770> brain<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.130> structured

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
like the way your brain is structured

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.000 
like the way your brain is structured
already<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.170> my<00:01:17.290> class<00:01:17.530> on<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.830> first

already and and in my class on the first
day<00:01:18.190> I<00:01:18.570> play<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.750> old<00:01:19.900> REM<00:01:20.410> song<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.790> end<00:01:21.820> of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.200 
day I play that old REM song the end of
the<00:01:22.240> world<00:01:22.450> as<00:01:22.780> you<00:01:22.930> know<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:25.180> I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
the world as you know it and because I

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.940 
the world as you know it and because I
like<00:01:25.480> people<00:01:25.660> to<00:01:25.870> start<00:01:26.110> thinking<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.740> now

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
like people to start thinking that now

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.440 
like people to start thinking that now
it's<00:01:27.160> going<00:01:27.370> to<00:01:27.400> be<00:01:27.550> all<00:01:27.670> different<00:01:27.940> now

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
it's going to be all different now

it's going to be all different now
you're<00:01:28.570> at<00:01:28.660> university<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.680> end<00:01:29.800> of<00:01:29.980> it's

my<00:01:33.130> class<00:01:33.460> I<00:01:33.670> teach<00:01:33.730> biology<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:37.210> literally

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
my class I teach biology so it literally

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.620 
my class I teach biology so it literally
is<00:01:38.140> going<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.800> be<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.190> end<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.940> world<00:01:40.210> as

is going to be the end of the world as
they<00:01:41.230> know<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.470> in<00:01:42.160> in<00:01:42.880> biology<00:01:43.540> things<00:01:43.780> change

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
they know it in in biology things change

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.960 
they know it in in biology things change
really<00:01:44.410> quickly<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:45.370> this<00:01:45.550> is<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.730> really

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
really quickly and this is a really

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.630

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
nature or science some paper might come

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.800 
nature or science some paper might come
out<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.650> changes<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:58.150> curriculum<00:01:58.630> and

first<00:01:59.470> year<00:01:59.620> biology<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.850> happened<00:02:01.540> two<00:02:02.080> weeks

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
first year biology it happened two weeks

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.420 
first year biology it happened two weeks
ago<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.400> guy<00:02:03.580> Venter<00:02:04.110> he's<00:02:05.310> created<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
ago so this guy Venter he's created the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.900 
ago so this guy Venter he's created the
first<00:02:06.700> cell<00:02:07.150> ever<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:09.190> doesn't<00:02:09.729> have<00:02:09.850> a

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
first cell ever that doesn't have a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.130 
first cell ever that doesn't have a
parent

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
parent

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.040

every<00:02:12.130> every<00:02:12.970> cell<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> universe<00:02:13.720> comes

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
every every cell in the universe comes

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.960 
every every cell in the universe comes
from<00:02:14.260> another<00:02:14.680> cell<00:02:14.920> except<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.580> new

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
from another cell except this new

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.120 
from another cell except this new
brand-new<00:02:16.450> one<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:16.930> he<00:02:17.620> named<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.480> Cynthia<00:02:20.130> so

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
brand-new one and he named it Cynthia so

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.970 
brand-new one and he named it Cynthia so
we<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> synthetic<00:02:21.850> cell<00:02:22.060> now<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.650> world

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
we have a synthetic cell now the world

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.760 
we have a synthetic cell now the world
is<00:02:24.160> different<00:02:24.430> my<00:02:25.180> students<00:02:26.140> who<00:02:26.200> come<00:02:26.440> in

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
is different my students who come in

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.860 
is different my students who come in
September<00:02:27.280> are<00:02:27.880> coming<00:02:28.240> into<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.450> different

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
September are coming into a different

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.690 
September are coming into a different
world<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.380> biology<00:02:29.560> than<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.220> ones<00:02:30.400> who<00:02:30.490> came

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
world of biology than the ones who came

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.000 
world of biology than the ones who came
last<00:02:30.910> year<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:34.110> my<00:02:35.110> students<00:02:35.530> are<00:02:35.620> taking

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
last year so my students are taking

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.040 
last year so my students are taking
biology<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.870> physics<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.500> chemistry<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:40.050> in

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
biology and physics and chemistry and in

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.570 
biology and physics and chemistry and in
physics<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.470> chemistry<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:41.980> are<00:02:42.070> problems

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
physics in chemistry there are problems

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.210 
physics in chemistry there are problems
-<00:02:42.760> do<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.080> can<00:02:44.230> sort<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.500> test<00:02:44.800> how<00:02:45.190> well

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
- do you you can sort of test how well

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.460 
- do you you can sort of test how well
you<00:02:45.550> understand<00:02:46.150> if<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.630> can<00:02:46.840> do<00:02:47.320> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
you understand if you can do the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.199 
you understand if you can do the
problems<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:48.850> on<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.380> bio<00:02:51.209> there

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
problems and so on but in bio there

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.110 
problems and so on but in bio there
aren't<00:02:52.510> there<00:02:53.290> aren't<00:02:53.500> these<00:02:53.620> kinds<00:02:53.980> of

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
aren't there aren't these kinds of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.620 
aren't there aren't these kinds of
problems<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.209> can<00:02:55.390> work<00:02:55.570> through<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:57.630> you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
problems you can work through so you

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.130 
problems you can work through so you
have<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.200> find<00:02:59.470> some<00:02:59.800> other<00:03:00.070> way<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:01.140> figure

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
have to find some other way to figure

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.490 
have to find some other way to figure
out<00:03:02.320> if<00:03:02.470> you're<00:03:02.620> learning<00:03:03.100> or<00:03:03.430> or<00:03:03.940> not<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:05.050> I

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
out if you're learning or or not and I

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.890 
out if you're learning or or not and I
find<00:03:06.070> this<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.300> big<00:03:07.480> challenge<00:03:07.690> for

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
find this is this is a big challenge for

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.479 
find this is this is a big challenge for
my<00:03:08.230> students<00:03:08.739> they<00:03:08.860> come<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.160> say<00:03:09.280> oh<00:03:09.310> I'm

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
my students they come and say oh I'm

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.040 
my students they come and say oh I'm
doing<00:03:09.730> great<00:03:09.850> in<00:03:10.060> chemistry<00:03:10.510> but<00:03:10.720> I'm

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
doing great in chemistry but I'm

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.240 
doing great in chemistry but I'm
struggling<00:03:11.470> in<00:03:11.650> biology<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.590> think<00:03:14.830> one<00:03:15.160> of

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
struggling in biology and I think one of

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.370 
struggling in biology and I think one of
the<00:03:15.310> reasons<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:16.450> problem-based

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
the reasons is this this problem-based

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.410 
the reasons is this this problem-based
thing<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.680> recommend<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.220> them<00:03:21.459> that

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
thing so so I recommend to them that

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.640 
thing so so I recommend to them that
they<00:03:22.540> make<00:03:22.690> study<00:03:22.930> groups<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.380> they<00:03:23.500> get

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
they make study groups that they get

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.070 
they make study groups that they get
together<00:03:23.769> they<00:03:24.040> talk<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.430> each<00:03:24.459> other<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:25.750> try

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
together they talk to each other to try

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.070 
together they talk to each other to try
to<00:03:26.459> get<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.489> sense<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:31.090> call<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.750> being

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
to get a sense of I I call it being

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.420 
to get a sense of I I call it being
whacked<00:03:32.590> if<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.780> if<00:03:35.140> your<00:03:35.890> understanding

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
whacked if if you if your understanding

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.320 
whacked if if you if your understanding
of<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.640> world<00:03:36.880> is<00:03:37.420> upside<00:03:38.380> down<00:03:38.410> or<00:03:38.980> backwards

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
of the world is upside down or backwards

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.720 
of the world is upside down or backwards
that's<00:03:40.330> what<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.510> call<00:03:40.840> being<00:03:41.049> whacked<00:03:41.610> but<00:03:42.610> you

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
that's what I call being whacked but you

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.390 
that's what I call being whacked but you
don't<00:03:42.910> often<00:03:43.600> even<00:03:43.810> know<00:03:44.049> if<00:03:44.860> you're<00:03:45.040> whacked

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
don't often even know if you're whacked

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.460 
don't often even know if you're whacked
you<00:03:45.760> you<00:03:46.450> may<00:03:46.570> have<00:03:46.690> learned<00:03:46.989> how

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
you you may have learned how

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.740 
you you may have learned how
photosynthesis<00:03:48.370> works<00:03:48.670> or<00:03:48.910> something<00:03:49.360> in<00:03:49.660> a

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
photosynthesis works or something in a

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.320 
photosynthesis works or something in a
particular<00:03:50.049> way<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.799> if<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.940> don't<00:03:52.120> ever

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
particular way and if you don't ever

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.100 
particular way and if you don't ever
check<00:03:52.690> that<00:03:52.989> with<00:03:53.470> your<00:03:53.650> friends<00:03:54.220> or<00:03:54.400> with<00:03:54.430> me

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
check that with your friends or with me

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.720 
check that with your friends or with me
then<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.260> go<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.590> exam<00:03:56.860> whacked<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.430> you

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
then you go to the exam whacked and you

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.240 
then you go to the exam whacked and you
get<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.600> answers<00:03:58.930> wrong<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.410> then<00:03:59.920> you

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
get the answers wrong and then you

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.900 
get the answers wrong and then you
discover<00:04:00.519> but<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.630> didn't<00:04:01.870> understand<00:04:02.320> so

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
discover but you didn't understand so

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.330 
discover but you didn't understand so
this<00:04:03.910> kind<00:04:04.180> of<00:04:04.299> feedback<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.830> in<00:04:06.130> studying

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
this kind of feedback and in studying

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.170 
this kind of feedback and in studying
biology<00:04:06.730> seems<00:04:08.160> absolutely<00:04:09.160> essential<00:04:09.670> to

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
biology seems absolutely essential to

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.350 
biology seems absolutely essential to
get<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.829> one<00:04:12.100> of<00:04:12.190> the<00:04:12.250> best<00:04:12.700> ways<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:12.940> do<00:04:13.209> it<00:04:13.239> is

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
get and one of the best ways to do it is

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.300 
get and one of the best ways to do it is
