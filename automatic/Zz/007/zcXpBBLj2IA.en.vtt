00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.260 

what<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.680> understand<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.430> costing<00:03:46.850> more<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.060> get

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
what I understand it costing more to get

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.590 
what I understand it costing more to get
it<00:03:47.420> home<00:03:47.600> than<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:47.930> cost<00:03:48.110> him<00:03:48.320> to<00:03:48.440> buy<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:49.600> and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
it home than it cost him to buy it and

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.960 
it home than it cost him to buy it and
then<00:03:50.780> that's<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.110> way<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:51.380> always<00:03:51.530> is

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
then that's the way it always is

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:08.090 
then that's the way it always is
purchase<00:03:54.660> price<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.260> only<00:03:55.440> part<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.830> it

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.120 

let<00:04:08.280> her<00:04:08.400> set<00:04:08.670> their<00:04:08.910> idle<00:04:09.360> for<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.600> little<00:04:09.870> bit

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
let her set their idle for a little bit

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.940 
let her set their idle for a little bit
that's<00:04:11.490> a<00:04:11.610> good<00:04:11.760> idea<00:04:12.290> that's<00:04:13.290> pretty<00:04:13.620> slick

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
that's a good idea that's pretty slick

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.860 
that's a good idea that's pretty slick
