 the four travelers followed their path 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.150
 and when you get to the edge of the forest 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.619
 finally it is convenient to go with large rocks 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.009
 it will not be easy to climb it said the scarecrow 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.009
 but we have no other choice if we want to get to the other side 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.770
 the scarecrow opened the march 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.789
 and the others will even 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.810
 that they had reached the first rock when they heard a voice shouting back 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.339
 this hill is our 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.339
 and we will not let anyone try for her 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.879
 appeared behind the rock what is not strange 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.690
 that travelers had never seen 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.100
 very short and chubby with the big head another 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.930
 if it is on the top supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.580
 it did not have fresh 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.010
 the scarecrow advanced today said 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.260

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.360
 we will climb your hill 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.769
 and fast as lightning 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.140
 the man stretched his head forward and knocked down the 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:57.320
 scarecrow 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 as fast as it had shot forward 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.840
 he went back to his place 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.300
 it's not as simple as press 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.520
 said the man 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.700
 steering roughly 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.500
 immediately the laughter sounded 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.640
 and they appeared behind the rocks 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.400
 hundreds of individuals with heads like hammers under devoid of graz 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.700

 it happened to the bad winged 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.740
 said the tin man 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.220

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.240
 the orders will be complicated 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.290
 said the rev 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.050
 and the monkeys took the travelers in their arms and transported them on bacon 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.769
 the hammer heads so called enraged and they stretched their heads towards 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.910
 up trying to reach the bonuses 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.969

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:20.920

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:44.199
 whose copious tears endangered his joints before the 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.939
 possibility of them rusting again 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:48.029

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.039
 flight through the desert 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.130
