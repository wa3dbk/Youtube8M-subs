15<00:01:56.869> not<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> bad<00:01:58.079> jump<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:59.719> it's<00:02:00.719> expensive

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
15 not a bad jump but it's expensive

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.570 
15 not a bad jump but it's expensive
like<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.530> said

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.100 

if<00:02:04.730> you<00:02:05.330> have<00:02:05.900> access<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.680> lots<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.400> gold<00:02:08.110> like

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
if you have access to lots of gold like

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.420 
if you have access to lots of gold like
a<00:02:09.280> smartphone<00:02:10.280> or<00:02:10.580> two<00:02:11.090> then<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.280> be

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
a smartphone or two then it can be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.850 
a smartphone or two then it can be
profitable<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:15.260> can't<00:02:15.500> lose<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.800> many

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
profitable but you can't lose that many

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.470 
profitable but you can't lose that many
dragons<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.490> wait<00:02:16.640> time<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:17.030> friggin
