and<00:03:21.810> let<00:03:22.379> this<00:03:22.590> cook<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.430> ratio<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.060> this

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
and let this cook the ratio is like this

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.330 
and let this cook the ratio is like this
if<00:03:24.510> using<00:03:24.930> 1<00:03:25.140> cup<00:03:25.349> of<00:03:25.440> rice<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.950> will<00:03:26.010> add<00:03:26.129> 2

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
if using 1 cup of rice you will add 2

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.400 
if using 1 cup of rice you will add 2
cups<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.670> water<00:03:26.910> but<00:03:27.599> in<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:27.870> case<00:03:28.140> is

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
cups of water but in this case is

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.530 
cups of water but in this case is
chicken<00:03:28.680> mince<00:03:28.950> as<00:03:29.160> well<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.610> it's<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.329> pull

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
chicken mince as well and it's so pull

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.089 
chicken mince as well and it's so pull
out<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.989> don't<00:03:31.200> need<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.560> rice<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.980> be

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
out so you don't need the rice to be

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.330 
out so you don't need the rice to be
overcooked<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:33.000> we<00:03:33.150> may<00:03:33.269> add<00:03:33.450> about<00:03:33.930> 2<00:03:34.739> cups<00:03:34.769> or

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
overcooked so we may add about 2 cups or

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.129 
overcooked so we may add about 2 cups or
we<00:03:35.459> could<00:03:35.609> even<00:03:35.760> go<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> little<00:03:36.389> lesser<00:03:36.630> because

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
we could even go a little lesser because

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.319 
we could even go a little lesser because
the<00:03:37.319> chicken<00:03:37.680> will<00:03:37.829> also<00:03:38.190> leave<00:03:38.370> its<00:03:38.549> moisture

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
the chicken will also leave its moisture

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.569 
the chicken will also leave its moisture
we've<00:03:39.510> also<00:03:39.690> added<00:03:39.900> yogurt<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.220> amount<00:03:41.489> of

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
we've also added yogurt so the amount of

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.250 
we've also added yogurt so the amount of
water<00:03:41.850> will<00:03:42.090> be<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> little<00:03:42.690> less<00:03:42.989> than<00:03:43.319> 2<00:03:43.799> cups

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
water will be a little less than 2 cups

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.650 
water will be a little less than 2 cups
that's<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.560> we'll<00:03:46.980> place<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.430> lid<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.849> this

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
that's it we'll place the lid and this

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.629 
that's it we'll place the lid and this
will<00:03:48.840> take<00:03:49.019> anywhere<00:03:49.500> around<00:03:49.620> 10<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.250> 15

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
will take anywhere around 10 to 15

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.330 
will take anywhere around 10 to 15
minutes<00:03:50.970> on<00:03:51.150> medium<00:03:51.480> heat<00:03:51.950> initially<00:03:52.950> keep

minutes on medium heat initially keep

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.150 
minutes on medium heat initially keep
the<00:03:53.489> heat<00:03:53.700> high<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:55.560> starts<00:03:55.950> boiling

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
the heat high so that it starts boiling

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.699 
the heat high so that it starts boiling
and<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:57.030> minute<00:03:57.299> this<00:03:57.660> comes<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.139> boil<00:03:58.440> put

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
and the minute this comes to a boil put

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.150 
and the minute this comes to a boil put
it<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.519> medium<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.120> after<00:04:01.049> 5<00:04:01.319> minutes<00:04:01.590> you<00:04:01.980> can

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160
