 after having put this operator 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 in the computer because we take these 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.290
 precise cables that we have here in 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.860
 the floor that are from the playstation 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.930
 well this questions then now we 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.300
 let's go to the computer 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.940
 and it's worth with this 40 stv catcher 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.760
 because we are coming a disc 'on with 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.640
 this already we have got installed voucher and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.530
 with which the same inside depends 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.140
 a program that is empty of the ring by 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.780
 director voucher is easy to install voucher 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.000
 do not worry, it's not complicated 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.920
 what we do then we will have the cyberlink 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.920
 if they gave him to open 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.230
 good guys how do you see this is the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.090
 program program and berlin power 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.770
 director and now and this is where we can 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.540
 lay our videos now that what 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.340
 will have to make some adjustments for 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.280
 what good when we are inside the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.500
 Program 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.720
 when when we will be inside the 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.900
 program is worth what is going to see is going to 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.340
 be nothing but if we go let's think now 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.200
 capture and we will not see anything why 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.170
 this happens because our full has been 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.250
 configured so you can see it here 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.040
 then what we are going to do is going to be 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.680
 shots to the playstation okay and we 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:10.260
 we go to screen settings that is 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.840

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.140

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.960
 seconds we have you in hd email we passed 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.940
 here already as a terminal component 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.850
 we are going to change 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.070
 and now you see the black screen and we 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.780
 we go here to ai where will be the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 screen see how you see now you see 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.290
 our playstation but it looks nano 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.700
 people what they buy then we 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.790
 explains is so that it can be seen in the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.430
 screen and that puts quite time 20 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.900
 19 seconds we give it to you so that you do not 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.840

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:59.190
 we were safe here let's accept 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.360
 we go to configuration settings and 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.670
 audio output so you can 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.050
 listen to the sound on our computer 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.690

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.930

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.060
 we accept 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.000

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.069
