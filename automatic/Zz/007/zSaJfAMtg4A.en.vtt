some of the bark beginning to exfoliate
and<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:46.739> thinking<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.219> putting<00:00:47.430> this

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
and where I'm thinking of putting this

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.150 
and where I'm thinking of putting this
is<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.329> had<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> huge<00:00:48.989> tree<00:00:49.350> taken<00:00:49.739> down<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.070> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
is I had a huge tree taken down in this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
is I had a huge tree taken down in this
stump<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.329> stump<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.289> to

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
stump here and the stump is not going to

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
stump here and the stump is not going to
be<00:00:52.500> ground<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:53.039> know<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.480> we're

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
be ground I know that so what we're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.700 
be ground I know that so what we're
going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> we're<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> put<00:00:55.559> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
going to do is we're going to put this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.420 
going to do is we're going to put this
just<00:00:55.980> behind<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.579> stump<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.510> Sun<00:00:57.840> will<00:00:58.050> hit

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
just behind the stump the Sun will hit

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.610 
just behind the stump the Sun will hit
the<00:00:59.430> plant<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.059> I'm<00:01:00.690> hoping<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.379> plant

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the plant and I'm hoping that the plant

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
the plant and I'm hoping that the plant
kind<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.980> grows<00:01:02.160> over<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.969> stump<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.329> sort<00:01:03.960> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
kind of grows over the stump and sort of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
kind of grows over the stump and sort of
hides<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:04.830> bit<00:01:05.040> later<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.850> also

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
hides it a little bit later on it also

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270 
hides it a little bit later on it also
makes<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.570> almost<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.260> nice<00:01:07.470> platform<00:01:07.860> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
makes for almost a nice platform in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.770 
makes for almost a nice platform in
front<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:08.790> plant<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.630> how

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510 
front of this plant you can see how
beautiful<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> plant<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> structure<00:01:11.400> of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
beautiful the plant is the structure of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.210 
beautiful the plant is the structure of
it<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.600> straight<00:01:13.290> ahead<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:14.040> my
