without intros so you might see an intro

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.510 
without intros so you might see an intro
on<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.559> side<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.070> video<00:00:14.929> but<00:00:15.929> I'm<00:00:16.049> just

on the side of this video but I'm just

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.310 
on the side of this video but I'm just
it<00:00:17.520> will<00:00:17.670> be<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> final<00:00:18.090> product<00:00:18.510> but<00:00:18.869> it's

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
it will be the final product but it's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.279 
it will be the final product but it's
just<00:00:19.910> techniques<00:00:20.910> getting<00:00:21.330> together<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.689> for

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
just techniques getting together for for

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
just techniques getting together for for
what<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.470> envisage<00:00:22.800> eventually<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:24.050> I'm

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
what I envisage eventually to have I'm

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.019 
what I envisage eventually to have I'm
at<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> place<00:00:25.320> called<00:00:25.410> liffey<00:00:25.830> bridge<00:00:27.740> which<00:00:28.740> is

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
at a place called liffey bridge which is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.370 
at a place called liffey bridge which is
where<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> car<00:00:30.390> crashed<00:00:32.809> use<00:00:33.809> come<00:00:34.020> down<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
where the car crashed use come down that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.850 
where the car crashed use come down that
road<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:38.570> ya<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:39.840> ya<00:00:40.140> I've<00:00:40.440> come<00:00:40.680> down<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
road and ya when ya I've come down a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.959 
road and ya when ya I've come down a
couple<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> times<00:00:41.489> today<00:00:41.840> Dustin<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:43.079> mm

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
couple of times today Dustin about mm

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.510 
couple of times today Dustin about mm
when<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.210> come<00:00:45.420> down<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.809> road<00:00:46.309> you<00:00:47.309> do

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
when you do come down that road you do

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.610 
when you do come down that road you do
see<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.960> road<00:00:49.730> just<00:00:50.730> bit<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:52.440> like

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
see that road just bit here it's like

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.990 
see that road just bit here it's like
move<00:00:54.920> it's<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> dip<00:00:56.370> does<00:00:56.640> come<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:56.850> with

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
move it's in the dip does come up with

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.490 
move it's in the dip does come up with
you<00:00:57.059> quite<00:00:57.270> quick<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:57.780> there's<00:00:58.020> there's<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
you quite quick but there's there's a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.470 
you quite quick but there's there's a
couple<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.859> science<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> back

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
couple of science you can see the back

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.640 
couple of science you can see the back
of<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> first<00:01:03.690> sign<00:01:03.930> has<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> big<00:01:04.409> z

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
of them so the first sign has a big z

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.920 
of them so the first sign has a big z
donnish<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.430> share<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.090> share<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.600> jungle

donnish for share to share of jungle
turns<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> next<00:01:08.490> ones<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
turns and then the next ones like a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.810 
turns and then the next ones like a
danger<00:01:09.720> single<00:01:10.080> lane<00:01:10.260> bridge<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
danger single lane bridge and it's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.039 
danger single lane bridge and it's
basically<00:01:12.000> telling<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.570> bridge<00:01:12.869> isn't

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
basically telling you this bridge isn't

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
basically telling you this bridge isn't
wide<00:01:13.290> enough<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.530> two<00:01:13.710> cars<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:15.000> not

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
wide enough for two cars and it's not

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.899 
wide enough for two cars and it's not
really<00:01:15.619> as<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> might<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
really as you might see in one of the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.570 
really as you might see in one of the
introverts<00:01:18.680> but<00:01:19.680> anyway<00:01:19.920> when<00:01:20.100> he<00:01:20.159> crashed<00:01:20.400> he

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
introverts but anyway when he crashed he

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.630 
introverts but anyway when he crashed he
came<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:22.799> believe<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.400> truck

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
came down here and I believe that truck

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.649 
came down here and I believe that truck
might<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.880> his<00:01:24.290> he<00:01:25.290> missed<00:01:25.650> these<00:01:26.159> rocks<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:27.479> be

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
might be his he missed these rocks it be

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.690 
might be his he missed these rocks it be
moved<00:01:27.900> slightly<00:01:28.200> since<00:01:28.619> eem<00:01:29.040> had<00:01:29.549> his

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
moved slightly since eem had his

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.149 
moved slightly since eem had his
incidents<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> he<00:01:31.829> came<00:01:32.009> down<00:01:32.479> down<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:34.159> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
incidents so he came down down here and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.340 
incidents so he came down down here and
I<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:36.270> he<00:01:36.329> might<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.540> clipped<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> rock

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I think he might have clipped the rock

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.770 
I think he might have clipped the rock
actually<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.790> way<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.119> frame<00:01:39.570> got

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
actually because the way is frame got

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.649 
actually because the way is frame got
bent<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> forks<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.770> stuff<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.610> he<00:01:41.670> went<00:01:42.210> all

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
bent and forks and stuff and he went all

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.130 
bent and forks and stuff and he went all
the<00:01:42.899> way<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.170> there<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.030> he<00:01:45.030> landed<00:01:45.780> were<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the way in there and he landed were that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.910 
the way in there and he landed were that
big<00:01:46.350> puddle<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.000> in<00:01:48.000> fact<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.600> where<00:01:48.780> that

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
big puddle is in fact you see where that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.670 
big puddle is in fact you see where that
that<00:01:49.920> polar<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:51.720> where<00:01:52.350> his

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
that polar there is that's where his

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.520 
that polar there is that's where his
back<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.579> his<00:01:53.790> head<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.180> like

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
back was so his head was like

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.880 
back was so his head was like
