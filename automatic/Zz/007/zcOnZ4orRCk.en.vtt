 good that such welcome to a mobile and police 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:14.059
 we bring you in the cat sprint according to a double tuner that 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 connect mouth our network will provide 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.429
 So much with his equipment is something very nice 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.759
 comaco s 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.759
 as for our iphone to our country television tac 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.099
 thanks to the double tuner we will be able to visualize 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.609
 2 - equipment 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.620
 different channels ie a tuner 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.300
 tuning point to the floor and visualize that channel while on other equipment 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.200
 We can visualize by making any other post 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.310
 this ac who does not depend on a jaguar connected to our team 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.210
 incidents 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.210
 to the connection 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.820
 and we object to the device either by ethernet the most advisable is that 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.500
 this is together have wi-fi connection 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.260
 percent we will connect our customers 30 the different computers 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.300
 or by cable 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.080
 retina 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.380
 as you can see 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 the device 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 it is not very large it is light 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.480
 easy to install 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.540
 connection to our youth our access point we play travase airport 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.890
 extreme 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.480
 antenna collection 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.980
 possibility to stop it clarified on the wall next to the cost pity 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.250
 is included 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.320
 an antenna 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.500
 Laptop according 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.980
 to tune in 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.190
 in any situation and we also have b two licenses of the program 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.190
 ntv to tune 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.010
 the channels 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.870
 in our equipment 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.690
 for the iphone or the ipad it is only required to download the available application 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.590
 in the itunes store late text 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.460
 we would proceed to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.500
 use this device the installation of this device is 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.740
 simple let's go 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.819
 to explain what we are going to do we are going to connect the shot before the general 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.209
 and in this case our case we have several phases to teams we are going to connect 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.469
 join pass by stern in our house so that the signal can be 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.349
 wired for all devices 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.919
 anyway we have different configuration possibilities in this 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.489
 case we opted for this 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.679
 to connect our device 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.510
 and then we will see how it works and we will configure 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.510
 percent a team for what the ais 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.519
 this test works on how to tune the channels 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.189
 and what possibilities the desserts 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.709
 in this case 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.799
 as we can see we have 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.999
 a recent survey 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.479
 we have placed the tuner 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:01.479
 on top 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.239
 and we have 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.719
 they made the connections 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.729
 morals and this we have already installed our 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.190
 at the feast 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.380
 we have commented 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.030
 ana tomÃ¡s antenna and in turn released one of the bases yesterday to be 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:24.389
 we have several fall to be in Portugal at home with which we are going 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.810
 they will pay for track 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.780
 that our connection and the wireless with the months of drive to the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.529
 perfection, wherever we are 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:37.279
 we count because it's a wireless connection but that you know 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:39.579
 that you can 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.730
 there will be payments from non-payments to the needs 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.890
 why combine 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.600
 and your intimates that you connect I saw two months ago for example the teams that 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.979
 you have to encourage them 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.279
 by cable 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.129
 if they are so well connected to the network 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.069
 where is located in the enclosure 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.139
 well, also 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.659
 it will work 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.259
 if you have a device like the iphone as the ipad 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.930
 interesting love is that the 20 is investigated at least connected to a 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.930
 device that offers a wall 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.839
 a wireless connection 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.720
 I remember although there are several possibilities im 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.159
 many configurations 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.979
 If you have any doubt if you want we will comment on your particular 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.960
 you can leave your comment and with pleasure corresponds 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.580
 once 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.729
 installed times examples we have since forgotten the device 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.830
 we went some of our equipment 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:40.830
 to be continue 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.830
 with the installation to learn how it works 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.559
 we proceed to installation 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:48.999
 we drag 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.349
 and let's go 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.400
 according to the applications folder 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.189
 once started 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.430
 the program 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.430
 will launch configuration assistant the room 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.979
 we begin accept the license terms 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.819
 we choose the country where it is used 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.259
 automatically 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.719
 we see 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.249
 that she detects us what device we're using that we could 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:24.770
 choose any other 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.569
 we introduce 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.400
 our key 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.400
 remember that we have two licenses 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.809
 near the end the Caribbean of the sre 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.259
 in an interview on the chain be 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:40.839
 as you can see here 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.289
 we follow 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.650
 completing our configuration already automatically without having to perform 

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:50.330
 no action we have 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.319
 connected 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.339
 we are going to show television and we are going to complete the assistant 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:00.100
 here we see the device agreement tells us for a hundred 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.479
 in this case what we were talking about 2 110 trees 1 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.309
 which is available in the screaming states and one that is ongoing in 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:11.099
 this order to concretely on the screen what we observe 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.809
 we click on next 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:16.569
 remember that with the products 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.870
 of the data we have the possibility of creating a free account 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:21.740
 in 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.180
 kilic that helps us to have 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.749
 the in the program listed 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:28.710
 during 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.740
 a whole year of agreement we can at that moment create our account 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:38.369
 we can count that step 

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:41.649
 registered processes we have completed the configuration 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.770
 the expense of quality controls 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:55.310
 automatically 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.649
 if there is an update that needs to be installed 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:01.909
 the assistant is going to save us we can leave it for later 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.369
 as our case for 

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:08.099
 explain us a little 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.379
 the device works 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.529
 and how can you read 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:15.529
 we have no problem to full screen 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.649
 we handle 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:19.789
 our 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:22.699
 you put imperfectly that we have 

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:24.460
 the channels 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.680
 bush for is to conserve 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.389
 everything that has detected our duty 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:32.360
 agreement 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.690
 in an agile wire way as we are doing we can 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.330
 are watching our forecast 

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.960
 in this case 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.649
 in an imac 

00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:48.649
 and as you can see 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:55.300
 it works ee device very well even offers the possibility because it is 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.339
 watching television while we work while enjoying 

00:07:58.339 --> 00:07:59.199
 our team 

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:02.149
 i have the possibility to use 

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:05.090
 as you well know with it other tuner 

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.110
 the television in another device
