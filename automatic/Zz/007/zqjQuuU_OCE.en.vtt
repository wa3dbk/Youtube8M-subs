this<00:00:55.399> right<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.500> there's<00:00:58.500> two<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:01.559> lots<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.859> 12

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
this right so there's two to lots of 12

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
this right so there's two to lots of 12
bars<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.000> first<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.840> first<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> all

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
bars there the first the first of all

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.859 
bars there the first the first of all
bars<00:01:04.500> he<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.979> plays<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.549> same<00:01:06.290> same<00:01:07.290> riff

bars he just plays the same same riff

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:16.910 
bars he just plays the same same riff
over<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.140> over<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:15.080> he<00:01:16.080> does<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> four<00:01:16.650> times

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
over and over so he does that four times

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.960 
over and over so he does that four times
so<00:01:17.850> let's<00:01:18.060> draw<00:01:18.270> two<00:01:19.159> then<00:01:20.159> draw<00:01:20.610> three<00:01:20.939> draw

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so let's draw two then draw three draw

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.480 
so let's draw two then draw three draw
four<00:01:23.750> he<00:01:24.750> uses<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> little<00:01:25.439> vamp<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.070> technique

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490

four he uses a little vamp in technique
on<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> draw<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:32.119> there's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> link<00:01:33.479> I'll<00:01:33.840> put<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
on the draw to there's a link I'll put a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.590 
on the draw to there's a link I'll put a
link<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> top<00:01:34.619> corner<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.250> add<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
link in the top corner to add I know a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.319 
link in the top corner to add I know a

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
video on how to do the vamping but I'm

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.640 
video on how to do the vamping but I'm
not<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.500> it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
not going to go into that now so it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:49.219 
not going to go into that now so it's
draw<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.240> two<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.299> three<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.860> same<00:01:47.070> again<00:01:48.229> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
draw to two or three the same again and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.840 
draw to two or three the same again and
blow<00:01:49.590> 4<00:01:49.920> draw<00:01:50.299> three<00:01:51.299> draw<00:01:51.890> -<00:01:53.030> draw<00:01:54.030> -<00:01:54.390> again<00:01:55.850> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
blow 4 draw three draw - draw - again to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.200 
blow 4 draw three draw - draw - again to
a<00:01:56.939> three<00:01:57.270> bend<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> half<00:01:57.810> step<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.939> draw<00:01:59.939> free

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
a three bend the half step and draw free

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.219 
a three bend the half step and draw free
natural

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.369 

and<00:02:06.799> if<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.369> add<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.700> thumping<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:09.110> to

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
and if you add that thumping and to

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:29.620 
and if you add that thumping and to
swing<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.709> bit<00:02:09.890> more<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:29.150> it's<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.599> same

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
swing a bit more so it's just the same

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.520 
swing a bit more so it's just the same
the<00:02:30.410> same<00:02:30.670> riff<00:02:31.670> four<00:02:32.450> times<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.140> that's<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
the same riff four times and that's the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.550 
the same riff four times and that's the
first<00:02:33.769> 12<00:02:34.040> bars<00:02:34.280> covered<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.900> next<00:02:36.019> 12<00:02:36.319> bars

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
first 12 bars covered the next 12 bars

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.339 
first 12 bars covered the next 12 bars
is<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.190> little<00:02:37.640> bit<00:02:37.760> trickier<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:38.870> again<00:02:39.140> he's

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
is a little bit trickier but again he's

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:53.009 
is a little bit trickier but again he's
been<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> same<00:02:40.250> thing<00:02:40.519> for<00:02:40.700> most<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.209> says

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.910 

so<00:02:54.019> those<00:02:54.200> first<00:02:54.440> four<00:02:54.769> links<00:02:55.040> again<00:02:56.829> three<00:02:57.829> of

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
so those first four links again three of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.530 
so those first four links again three of
them<00:02:58.069> are<00:02:58.220> exactly<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.000> same

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
them are exactly the same

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.710 
them are exactly the same
the<00:02:59.780> third<00:03:00.049> one<00:03:00.400> he's<00:03:01.400> per<00:03:01.610> slight<00:03:01.970> Bend<00:03:02.360> on<00:03:02.569> it

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
the third one he's per slight Bend on it

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.550 
the third one he's per slight Bend on it
so<00:03:03.590> these<00:03:03.769> are<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.010> notes<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.459> true<00:03:04.670> one

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
so these are the notes it's true one

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.800 
so these are the notes it's true one
blow<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:07.060> draw<00:03:08.060> two<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:11.000> three<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.510> four

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:40.449 
just move down to draw tune hey I'm back
to<00:03:30.799> three<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:31.100> four<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:35.889> repeat<00:03:39.250> then<00:03:40.250> the

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.000 
to three and four in repeat then the
third<00:03:40.700> one<00:03:40.910> he<00:03:41.150> bends<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:42.319> three<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.739> four

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
third one he bends the three and four

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.800 
third one he bends the three and four
when<00:03:43.250> he<00:03:43.280> plays<00:03:43.549> it<00:03:46.420> been<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.600> turn<00:03:47.780> a

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
when he plays it been to turn a

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.530 
when he plays it been to turn a
half-step<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:49.130> fourth<00:03:49.400> one<00:03:49.639> is<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.970> same<00:03:50.239> as

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
half-step the fourth one is the same as

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:09.400 
half-step the fourth one is the same as
as<00:03:51.019> before<00:03:51.500> without<00:03:51.859> the<00:03:51.920> bend<00:03:55.630> together<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
as before without the bend together and

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.059 
as before without the bend together and
the<00:04:09.620> next<00:04:09.859> one<00:04:10.040> starts<00:04:10.340> off<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.419> same<00:04:12.069> and

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
the next one starts off the same and

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.140 
the next one starts off the same and
then<00:04:13.250> goes<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.459> blow<00:04:13.819> four

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
then goes to blow four

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.180 
then goes to blow four
or<00:04:16.660> bloat<00:04:17.079> 1<00:04:17.350> &amp;<00:04:17.560> 4<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.919> an<00:04:18.070> octave<00:04:18.340> if<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.639> want

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
or bloat 1 &amp; 4 is an octave if you want

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.940 
or bloat 1 &amp; 4 is an octave if you want
and<00:04:21.690> then<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.840> last<00:04:23.050> part<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.590> turnaround

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
and then the last part of the turnaround

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.900 
and then the last part of the turnaround
