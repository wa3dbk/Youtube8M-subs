Championship<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.790> couple<00:02:57.030> years<00:02:57.180> ago<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.420> was

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
Championship a couple years ago that was

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.770 
Championship a couple years ago that was
1437<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:59.220> during<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.730> suti<00:03:00.120> era<00:03:00.239> by<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.599> way

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
1437 it during the suti era by the way

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.770 
1437 it during the suti era by the way
and<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:02.459> next<00:03:02.730> two<00:03:02.909> times<00:03:03.090> come<00:03:03.450> from<00:03:03.659> moose

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and the next two times come from moose

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.009 
and the next two times come from moose
in<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.379> studio<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.400> think<00:03:06.180> soon-young<00:03:06.810> has

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
in that studio so I think soon-young has

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.710 
in that studio so I think soon-young has
a<00:03:07.049> great<00:03:07.440> shot<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.920> be<00:03:08.069> at<00:03:08.160> least<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:09.450> third

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
a great shot to be at least the third

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.100 
a great shot to be at least the third
fastest<00:03:10.230> swim<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.769> history<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.930> is

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
fastest swim in history and this is

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.020 
fastest swim in history and this is
going<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.319> be<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> huge<00:03:14.040> sign<00:03:14.370> right<00:03:14.640> here<00:03:14.790> what

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
going to be a huge sign right here what

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.530 
going to be a huge sign right here what
