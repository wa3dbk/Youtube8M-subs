00:00:00.743 --> 00:00:03.917
The second part of autumn takes the outdoor-terraces mood away a little

00:00:04.288 --> 00:00:07.783
so this week we get ready for fun indoor activities!

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.332
Boardgames!

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:24.798
Every evening, boardgame enthusiasts gather for a few hours of strategy, fighting and stories at the Tabiet Teahouse!

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:27.728
I asked Mihnea which are the most popular board games.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.162
The most popular games: Colonists of Catan, Dixit, Activity, Saboteur and Ticket to ride.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.615
Small World is one of the favorite games here at Tabiet

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:46.606
It's a strategy game of medium difficulty and highly interactive!

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.828
Even from the first round there's interaction between players

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:57.880
It's scalable, meaning that it can be played by 2 up to 5 players

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:05.316
The game objective is that you have to collect as many victory points at the end of each round

00:01:05.668 --> 00:01:15.203
You collect victory points by conquering territories on the map using a series of unique races and special powers!

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:18.138
Saboteur: is one of the most played games

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:20.599
It can be played by three to a maximum of ten players

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:22.705
The more players there are, the game becomes more beautiful to play!

00:01:23.028 --> 00:01:27.533
Game basics: there are 2 teams, the gold seekers and the saboteurs

00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:31.236
The game builds as you play

00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:34.500
The seekers will display the tunnel cards

00:01:35.358 --> 00:01:38.533
hoping to join the mine entrance with the gold nugget

00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:42.868
The saboteurs are interested in blocking the construction of the tunnel

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.450
so as the seekers won't reach the golden nugget.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.909
Thus each team wins a certain number of victory points!

00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.042
GO players gather at the teahouse every Wednesday

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:59.237
and on Saturday, Professional GO player Catalin Taranu hosts a GO lesson!

00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:01.971
Next stop: CLOCKS

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:04.430
A rather recently opened pub near the University.

00:02:18.582 --> 00:02:21.669
This coming weekend we have theater, film and Halloween!

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.213
Friday, The National Theatre Festival begins at Bucharest's National Theatre,

00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:28.964
with "D’ale noastre" show, directed by Gigi Căciuleanu.

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.848
The evening may continue at The Ghika Palace on Ellen Allien's rhythms,

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:36.893
in Control Club at Origami Sound Night

00:02:36.893 --> 00:02:39.458
or at the Hard Rock Café at Freddie Mercury Tribute!

00:02:39.937 --> 00:02:46.110
Saturday, I suggest you watch some films running at the Kinofest Digital Film Festival

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.725
either at Cinema Europa, Instituto Cervantes or Energiea Pub.

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.863
If you like Halloween and costumes, there are several options for you:

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.447
Bragadiru Palace's "Halloween or not ... we party"

00:02:59.447 --> 00:03:02.056
or you can go to Open Pub's "Halloween Biker Party"!

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:07.622
Also for Halloween, at the Polyvalent Hall, "The White Rabbit and the black magic" party with music,

00:03:07.622 --> 00:03:11.109
film screenings and dubstep, hip hop and drum'n'bass concerts!

00:03:11.582 --> 00:03:13.877
For Gianni Morandi's fans, good news!

00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:15.759
His concert is at the Palace Hall on Saturday!

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:20.106
There's BZN's concert, Sunday at the Palace Hall

00:03:20.106 --> 00:03:26.479
Even if you are in the mood for hot wine, Sunday you can go to Bucharest's National Theatre for "A Midsummer Night's Dream", directed by Radu Afrim!

00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:28.633
I wish you an inspired weekend!
