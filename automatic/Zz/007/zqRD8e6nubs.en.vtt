00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.660 
different screens get rid of the the big
rocks<00:00:43.200> after<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.739> take<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> look<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
rocks after you take a look at it and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.080 
rocks after you take a look at it and
make<00:00:44.820> sure<00:00:44.850> there's<00:00:45.210> no<00:00:45.390> gold<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
screen it through at least two or three

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.490 
screen it through at least two or three
screens<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.280> down<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.329> very<00:00:52.170> fine

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
screens to get down to the very fine

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
screens to get down to the very fine
material<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.180> then<00:00:57.180> after<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.260> take

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
material and then after that you take

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.500 
material and then after that you take
that<00:00:58.710> material<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> let's<00:01:00.090> say<00:01:00.270> your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that material back to let's say your

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
that material back to let's say your
campsite<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.980> you're<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
campsite and there you're going to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
campsite and there you're going to
actually<00:01:02.579> pan<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.500> see

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
actually pan it out now here you can see

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.340 
actually pan it out now here you can see
we're<00:01:04.890> looking<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.970> dry<00:01:06.689> wash<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
we're looking at the dry wash and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
we're looking at the dry wash and
there's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> bedrock<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:11.240> what<00:01:12.240> we're

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
there's a lot of bedrock and what we're

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.200 
there's a lot of bedrock and what we're
doing<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.200> cleaning<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.340> some<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
doing here is cleaning out some of this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.550 
doing here is cleaning out some of this
bedrock<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.049> side<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.650> we've<00:01:16.830> moved<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:18.560> or

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
bedrock to side of it we've moved out or

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
bedrock to side of it we've moved out or
crack<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> rocks<00:01:20.850> they<00:01:21.299> had<00:01:21.330> cracks

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
crack some of the rocks they had cracks

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.310 
crack some of the rocks they had cracks
we<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.409> put<00:01:22.970> put<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> pry<00:01:24.299> bar<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
we just put put a pry bar in there and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.070 
we just put put a pry bar in there and
opened<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> material<00:01:27.900> out

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
opened it up and get the material out

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.859 
opened it up and get the material out
there<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.650> usually<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.820> gold<00:01:30.150> ends<00:01:30.720> up

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
there because usually the gold ends up

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.999 
there because usually the gold ends up
going<00:01:31.350> down<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.009> dry<00:01:32.490> washes<00:01:33.799> and<00:01:34.799> then

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
going down to the dry washes and then

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.940 
going down to the dry washes and then
the<00:01:35.159> water<00:01:35.400> carries<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> down<00:01:36.439> down<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.740> wash

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the water carries it down down the wash

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.060 
the water carries it down down the wash
and<00:01:37.979> big<00:01:38.520> rains<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.240> thunderstorms<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.320> it's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and big rains and thunderstorms and it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.120 
and big rains and thunderstorms and it's
kind<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:42.020> collected<00:01:43.020> by<00:01:43.170> mother<00:01:43.439> nature<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
kind of collected by mother nature so to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.730 
kind of collected by mother nature so to
speak<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.700> falls<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.049> gold<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.500> heavy

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
speak it falls in because gold is heavy

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.270 
speak it falls in because gold is heavy
into<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.520> cracks<00:01:47.909> between<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.689> rocks<00:01:49.280> over

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
into the cracks between the rocks over

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.510 
into the cracks between the rocks over
you<00:01:50.579> know<00:01:50.700> years<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.750> centuries<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:53.310> if

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you know years the centuries and then if

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.780 
you know years the centuries and then if
you<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:53.820> there<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.450> screen<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.110> out

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
you go there and you screen that out

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.550 
you go there and you screen that out
you're<00:01:56.790> basically<00:01:57.320> classifying<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you're basically classifying the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.940 
you're basically classifying the
material<00:01:59.689> get<00:02:00.689> rid<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.110> big<00:02:01.290> stuff<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
material get rid of the big stuff and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.859 
material get rid of the big stuff and
then<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.189> got<00:02:02.369> finer<00:02:02.700> stuff<00:02:03.090> they're<00:02:03.329> sitting

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
then you got finer stuff they're sitting

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660 
then you got finer stuff they're sitting
in<00:02:03.930> another<00:02:04.259> screen<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.250> there<00:02:05.460> now

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
in another screen you can see there now

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.910 
in another screen you can see there now
and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> bottom<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.990> gold<00:02:07.350> pan<00:02:07.649> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and then in the bottom is a gold pan and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.130 
and then in the bottom is a gold pan and
