00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.100
 friends are welcome and 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.520
 welcome to the shakespeare channel pc 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.679
 tutorials for pc in Spanish the day of 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.379
 today I come to teach you an excellent 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.079
 wonderful brought almost almost by the 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.580
 very god video tutorial in which 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:20.060
 I'm going to show you how you can 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.030
 Decrease considerably up to 50% 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.950
 the temperature of the processor and your pc 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.500
 in general why do I make this video 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.990
 tutorial very, very simple to many 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.599
 people pass them this problem that 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.340
 your pc starts to be guided crash and the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.350
 programs usually because because the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.690
 processor is too hot or 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.850
 they need to lower the temperature of the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.860
 we will do it without a processor 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.170
 need to install junk programs 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.390
 no need to install fans 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.950
 in our pc although it really is a tip 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.540
 kerr 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.730
 what can I give you so that your pc is 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.280
 operating at 100% that you install a 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.559
 good fan now if you have a 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.149
 desktop pc a laptop a laptop 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.730
 of the government and so on a mini laptop 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.129
 this video is going to serve you 100% and 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.290
 guaranteed the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.750
 is to go to the start menu and open 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.540
 the control panel let's go to the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.880
 system and security and then to options 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.800
 of energy let's choose one of the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.890
 plans that we most want in this 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.930
 case I have configuring forgiveness 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.820
 configured on my pc for high 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.890
 performance since I use it to play 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.870
 to work to schedule and so on 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.050
 What you are going to do is choose the 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.340
 plan that you want if you want a 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.160
 fast computer but without being 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.080
 pay both games obviously because 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.270
 they will consume at the speed of 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.040
 processor will choose the high 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.830
 performance like me if they want it from 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.810
 flat that your pc is fast fluid but 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.030
 that the processor is completely 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.570
 cold which we are going to do in this video 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.710
 I recommend the balanced good 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.540
 what we are going to do now 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.880
 then to lower the speed the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.920
 temperature forgiveness of the processor is 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.450
 change the configuration of the plan 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.820
 we click here to change the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.190
 configuration and we change the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.830
 Advanced energy configuration 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.050
 we click and now we can close 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.420
 this window here back what we're going 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.010
 to do basically here will be to leave 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.799
 directly up 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.260
 down we're going to lower this bar and we're going to 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.689
 direct us to energy management 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.150
 of the processor we are going to click here 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.680
 in that symbol of more remember that here 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.720
 are watching the zoom and we're going to 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.239
 direct us to maximum state of 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.269
 processor here is one thing that good 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.700
 I highly recommend you consider 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.709
 Processor speed and quality 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.870
 of the processor to decrease the 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.530
 percentage here you are going to have it 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.750
 100% and I'm putting now 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.530
 100% everything and what you are going to do 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.690
 is to lower it to 80 percent energy 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.400
 they're going to put 80 percent and now 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.409
 many people will say here that 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.319
 surely you are reducing life 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.000
 useful processor and not what you're 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.639
 doing is really making the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.230
 processor does not spend that much energy 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:06.680
 really but to continue with the same 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.459
 power to be used well here are you going to 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.470
 put 80 and 80 if you can put 70 is 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.099
 and your decision of you but most 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.470
 recommended by me is 80 percent you 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.840
 they are going to give a click on apply verifying 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.750
 they already have 88 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.510
 and then accept what they have left 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.540
 do is go to start go to this arrow of 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.220
 here and restart your pc are going to notice 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.440
 continuation when the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.300
 computer that your processor will be 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.730
 faster than your pc is going to cool 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.560
 too much and it's going to be very, very, very 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.180
 fast and good friends
