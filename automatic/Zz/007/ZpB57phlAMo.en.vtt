00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
want to choose different you know a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.370 
want to choose different you know a
different<00:01:06.180> machine<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.140> different

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
different machine and different

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.800 
different machine and different
exercises<00:01:07.590> completely<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.909> generally<00:01:09.750> if

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
exercises completely so generally if

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
exercises completely so generally if
you're<00:01:09.900> doing<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.110> pulldown<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you're doing a pulldown like this you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
you're doing a pulldown like this you
should<00:01:12.000> probably<00:01:12.180> do<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.810> lats<00:01:13.020> but

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
should probably do it for the lats but

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.179 
should probably do it for the lats but
really<00:01:14.430> honestly<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:16.560> pretty<00:01:16.770> simple<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
really honestly it's pretty simple you

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
really honestly it's pretty simple you
don't<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.460> want<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> sway<00:01:18.090> too<00:01:18.150> much<00:01:18.509> when

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
don't really want to sway too much when

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.260 
don't really want to sway too much when
you're<00:01:18.810> doing<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:19.080> pull<00:01:19.320> downs<00:01:19.530> otherwise

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
you're doing these pull downs otherwise

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.249 
you're doing these pull downs otherwise
you're<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.360> gonna<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.600> isolating<00:01:22.110> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you're not gonna be isolating this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
you're not gonna be isolating this
specific<00:01:23.159> muscle<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.729> want<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.119> be

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
specific muscle that you want to be

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.390 
specific muscle that you want to be

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
really got to keep up that back arch

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.690 
really got to keep up that back arch
when<00:01:36.270> you're<00:01:36.420> doing<00:01:36.689> pulled<00:01:36.960> outs<00:01:37.140> because

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
when you're doing pulled outs because

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.399 
when you're doing pulled outs because
otherwise<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.479> start<00:01:39.750> putting<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.200> other

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
otherwise you start putting in other

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.719 
otherwise you start putting in other
muscle<00:01:40.770> groups<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.070> you're<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.340> trying<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
muscle groups that you're not trying to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.600 
muscle groups that you're not trying to
hit<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.689> lats<00:01:42.930> started<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.399> get

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
hit the lats started to you know get

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.069 
hit the lats started to you know get
taken<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> equation<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.720> keep<00:01:45.960> them

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
taken out of the equation and keep them

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
taken out of the equation and keep them
in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> equation<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.340> important<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
in the equation it's really important to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.359 
in the equation it's really important to
keep<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.909> chest<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.170> back<00:01:49.409> nice<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
keep that chest up and the back nice and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
keep that chest up and the back nice and
tight<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> arched<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
tight and arched back like this the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.090 
tight and arched back like this the
upper<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.649> okay<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.920> how<00:01:56.040> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
upper back okay so this is not how you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.350 
upper back okay so this is not how you
want<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.430> when<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.000> pull<00:01:57.180> downs

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
want to be when you do these pull downs

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.090 
want to be when you do these pull downs
like<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.469> definitely<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.950> stay

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
like this you definitely want to stay

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.060 
like this you definitely want to stay
more<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.610> where<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> upper<00:02:00.840> back

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
more like this where that upper back

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.770 
more like this where that upper back
just<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> arch<00:02:02.460> back<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.000> when<00:02:03.689> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
just kind of arch back like this when it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
just kind of arch back like this when it
starts<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> go<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.579> see<00:02:05.790> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
starts to go like this you can see you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.460 
starts to go like this you can see you
can<00:02:06.030> literally<00:02:06.360> feel<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.750> activation<00:02:10.379> of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
can literally feel the the activation of

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.520 
can literally feel the the activation of
the<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.810> lats<00:02:12.810> kind<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
the of your of your lats kind of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.830 
the of your of your lats kind of
starting<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> disappear<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.340> start<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.450> gain

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
starting to disappear you start to gain

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.730 
starting to disappear you start to gain
strength<00:02:16.640> because<00:02:18.319> you're<00:02:19.319> not<00:02:19.380> using<00:02:19.560> your

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
strength because you're not using your

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.230 
strength because you're not using your
lats<00:02:19.920> you're<00:02:20.310> using<00:02:20.490> other<00:02:20.700> muscles<00:02:21.030> at<00:02:21.120> that

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
lats you're using other muscles at that

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.270 
lats you're using other muscles at that
point<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.319> why<00:02:22.530> you'll<00:02:22.920> start<00:02:23.130> you'll

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
point so that's why you'll start you'll

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.940 
point so that's why you'll start you'll
see<00:02:23.459> people<00:02:23.760> be<00:02:24.480> able<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.750> do<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> first<00:02:25.590> five

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
see people be able to do the first five

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.180 
see people be able to do the first five
reps<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.459> set<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.840> then<00:02:28.709> it

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
reps of a set like this and then it

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.420 
reps of a set like this and then it
starts<00:02:29.580> getting<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:31.100> because<00:02:32.100> their

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
starts getting like this because their

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
starts getting like this because their
last<00:02:32.610> started<00:02:32.940> get<00:02:33.060> tired<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:33.510> definitely

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
last started get tired but definitely

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.320 
last started get tired but definitely
try<00:02:34.440> your<00:02:34.650> best<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.220> keep<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.970> upper<00:02:36.090> back

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
try your best to keep the upper back

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.410 
try your best to keep the upper back
like<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.800> just<00:02:37.910> keeping<00:02:38.910> at<00:02:39.030> an<00:02:39.090> angle<00:02:39.300> it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
like that just keeping at an angle it's

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.449 
like that just keeping at an angle it's
kind<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.989> as<00:02:40.319> you're<00:02:41.160> doing<00:02:41.280> it

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
kind of like this as you're doing it

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.729 
kind of like this as you're doing it
pulling<00:02:42.000> towards<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.720> last<00:02:42.930> left<00:02:43.290> right<00:02:43.530> here

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
pulling towards the last left right here

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.520 
pulling towards the last left right here
so<00:02:44.310> pulling<00:02:44.640> towards<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.270> lats<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:46.410> like

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
so pulling towards the lats just like

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.060 
so pulling towards the lats just like
that<00:02:46.739> from<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> elbow<00:02:48.650> pulling<00:02:49.650> down<00:02:49.920> like

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
that from the elbow pulling down like

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.990 
that from the elbow pulling down like
this<00:02:51.620> should<00:02:52.620> use<00:02:52.830> straps<00:02:53.190> it's<00:02:53.610> up<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.910> you

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
this should use straps it's up to you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.240 
this should use straps it's up to you
it's<00:02:54.060> up<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.330> your<00:02:54.450> preference<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:55.100> lot<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.190> the

these hundred pound dumbbells as I did

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
know two years ago back then I was kind

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.000 
know two years ago back then I was kind
of<00:04:09.630> lugging<00:04:10.019> them<00:04:10.140> around<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.530> little<00:04:10.620> bit<00:04:10.769> more

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
of lugging them around a little bit more

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.210 
of lugging them around a little bit more
how<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.700> was<00:04:11.910> even<00:04:12.180> doing<00:04:12.209> 20<00:04:12.720> reps<00:04:12.750> sets<00:04:13.109> but<00:04:14.010> I

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
how I was even doing 20 reps sets but I

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.580 
how I was even doing 20 reps sets but I
mean<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:15.750> time<00:04:15.989> under<00:04:16.140> tension<00:04:16.229> was

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
mean the the time under tension was

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.520 
mean the the time under tension was
probably<00:04:17.419> here<00:04:18.419> less<00:04:18.660> than<00:04:18.690> what<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.140> was<00:04:19.260> now

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
probably here less than what it was now

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.409 
probably here less than what it was now
