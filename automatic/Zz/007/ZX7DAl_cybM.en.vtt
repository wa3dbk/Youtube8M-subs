no<00:01:10.890> longer<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> worry<00:01:11.580> about<00:01:11.850> getting<00:01:12.090> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
no longer have to worry about getting it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850 
no longer have to worry about getting it
and<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.720> was<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> only<00:01:13.110> boss<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> needed

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and it was the only boss that I needed

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.230 
and it was the only boss that I needed
to<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.280> hundred<00:01:14.490> kills<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.000> pretty

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
to get to a hundred kills from pretty

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
to get to a hundred kills from pretty
much<00:01:15.360> zero<00:01:15.420> since<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.409> pets<00:01:16.560> were<00:01:16.680> released

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
much zero since the pets were released

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
much zero since the pets were released
so<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:17.820> hoping<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.270> receive<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
so I was really hoping to receive it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
so I was really hoping to receive it
during<00:01:18.750> final<00:01:19.170> boss<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.710> did<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.640> drop
