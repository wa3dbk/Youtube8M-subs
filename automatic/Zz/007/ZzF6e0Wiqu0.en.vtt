it's<00:03:31.459> charging<00:03:31.879> obviously<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:32.629> is<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
it's charging obviously this is the

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.380 
it's charging obviously this is the
charger<00:03:33.590> but<00:03:33.860> when<00:03:33.950> it<00:03:34.040> gets<00:03:34.189> to<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.579> end<00:03:35.120> when

charger but when it gets to the end when

the<00:03:35.510> part<00:03:35.659> the<00:03:35.780> battery<00:03:36.079> is<00:03:36.170> actually<00:03:36.319> charged

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
the part the battery is actually charged

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.599 
the part the battery is actually charged
it<00:03:39.109> it'll<00:03:39.890> go<00:03:40.010> up<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.280> down<00:03:40.430> like<00:03:42.219> like<00:03:43.219> a<00:03:43.340> wave

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
it it'll go up and down like like a wave

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.500 
it it'll go up and down like like a wave
I<00:03:44.620> think<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.709> goes<00:03:46.250> up<00:03:46.489> and<00:03:46.640> down<00:03:46.790> by<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.000> few

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
I think it goes up and down by a few

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.270 
I think it goes up and down by a few
percent<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.260> think<00:03:48.439> I<00:03:48.709> think<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:48.950> was<00:03:49.040> just<00:03:49.129> to

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
percent I think I think I was just to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.819 
percent I think I think I was just to
keep<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.579> battery<00:03:50.000> levels<00:03:50.829> fluctuating

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
keep the battery levels fluctuating

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.449 
keep the battery levels fluctuating
rather<00:03:52.250> than<00:03:52.519> staying<00:03:53.060> at<00:03:53.180> one<00:03:53.390> constant

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
rather than staying at one constant

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.830 
rather than staying at one constant
because<00:03:55.459> battery<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.000> batteries<00:03:56.359> have<00:03:56.389> a

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
because battery the batteries have a

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.979 
because battery the batteries have a
memory<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.799> say<00:03:58.099> if<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.489> save<00:03:59.389> you<00:03:59.540> battery

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
memory so say if you save you battery

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.270

you<00:04:04.340> charge<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:04.700> your<00:04:04.730> phone<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.299> you<00:04:05.780> only

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
you charge in your phone if you only

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:13.780 
you charge in your phone if you only
ever<00:04:06.400> let<00:04:07.400> your<00:04:07.549> phone<00:04:09.069> get<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.340> 80%<00:04:12.790> charged

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
ever let your phone get to 80% charged

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.439 
ever let your phone get to 80% charged
and<00:04:14.230> take<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.319> off<00:04:15.489> next<00:04:16.489> day<00:04:16.759> eight<00:04:17.030> percent

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
and take it off next day eight percent

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.110 
and take it off next day eight percent
charge<00:04:17.630> take<00:04:18.259> it<00:04:18.410> off<00:04:18.530> charge<00:04:19.310> take<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.000> off

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
charge take it off charge take it off

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.920 
charge take it off charge take it off
then<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.380> battery<00:04:22.419> struggles<00:04:23.419> they<00:04:23.630> go<00:04:23.720> past

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
then the battery struggles they go past

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.719 
then the battery struggles they go past
80<00:04:24.289> percent<00:04:24.770> after<00:04:25.280> you've<00:04:25.430> done<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.699> couple

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
80 percent after you've done it a couple

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.820 
80 percent after you've done it a couple
of<00:04:25.970> times<00:04:26.590> so<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.620> think<00:04:27.740> that's<00:04:28.039> why<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.509> has

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
of times so I think that's why it has

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.219 
of times so I think that's why it has
this<00:04:30.830> fluctuation<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:32.599> amps<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.169> the

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
this fluctuation and the amps and the

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.480 
this fluctuation and the amps and the
watts<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:35.409> it<00:04:36.409> takes<00:04:36.620> seven<00:04:36.889> hours<00:04:37.099> to<00:04:37.280> charge

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
watts and it takes seven hours to charge

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.810 
watts and it takes seven hours to charge
a<00:04:37.610> bike<00:04:37.760> with<00:04:38.240> this

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
a bike with this

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:49.820 
a bike with this
and<00:04:41.460> yeah<00:04:42.900> so<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.110> is<00:04:45.120> cost<00:04:46.120> me<00:04:47.910> 28<00:04:48.910> pound

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
and yeah so that it is cost me 28 pound

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.720 
and yeah so that it is cost me 28 pound
in<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.430> sales<00:04:51.640> I<00:04:51.910> think<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:52.120> 40<00:04:52.650> 40<00:04:53.650> 47<00:04:54.430> I

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730
