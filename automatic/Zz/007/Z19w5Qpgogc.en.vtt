00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.180 
a little bit hard to reach a final
thought<00:05:21.570> with<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.690> figure<00:05:22.900> like<00:05:23.020> this<00:05:23.199> is<00:05:23.740> that

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
thought with a figure like this is that

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.740 
thought with a figure like this is that
he's<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.370> really<00:05:24.669> nice<00:05:24.850> figure<00:05:25.330> i<00:05:25.360> mean<00:05:25.600> he's

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
he's a really nice figure i mean he's

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.020 
he's a really nice figure i mean he's
just<00:05:25.810> a<00:05:26.050> good<00:05:26.320> standard<00:05:27.190> fig<00:05:27.580> yard<00:05:27.820> like<00:05:28.000> this

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
just a good standard fig yard like this

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.339 
just a good standard fig yard like this
what<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.300> think<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:28.510> was<00:05:28.599> a<00:05:28.660> good<00:05:28.780> example<00:05:29.200> of<00:05:29.229> a

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
what I think it was a good example of a

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.930 
what I think it was a good example of a
standard<00:05:29.650> figure<00:05:30.039> for<00:05:30.610> what<00:05:30.700> he's<00:05:30.820> supposed

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
standard figure for what he's supposed

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.580 
standard figure for what he's supposed
to<00:05:31.210> be<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.510> details<00:05:31.870> look<00:05:32.080> really<00:05:32.349> good<00:05:32.530> and

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
to be the details look really good and

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.879 
to be the details look really good and
he's<00:05:32.830> a<00:05:33.510> he's<00:05:34.510> got<00:05:34.720> nice<00:05:34.990> tight<00:05:35.410> joints<00:05:35.770> no

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
he's a he's got nice tight joints no

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.800 
he's a he's got nice tight joints no
loose<00:05:36.099> problems<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.610> I'll<00:05:36.669> QC<00:05:37.030> problems<00:05:37.419> he

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
loose problems and I'll QC problems he

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.170 
loose problems and I'll QC problems he
just<00:05:37.930> a<00:05:38.050> really<00:05:38.289> solid<00:05:39.160> figure<00:05:39.639> it<00:05:39.789> likes<00:05:40.090> to

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
just a really solid figure it likes to

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.300 
just a really solid figure it likes to
fall<00:05:40.419> over<00:05:40.450> when<00:05:40.720> I<00:05:40.840> knocked<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.200> table<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:42.160> if

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
fall over when I knocked the table so if

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.310 
fall over when I knocked the table so if
you<00:05:42.460> like<00:05:42.700> G<00:05:43.030> dunno<00:05:43.330> either<00:05:43.599> the<00:05:43.930> design<00:05:44.289> of

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
you like G dunno either the design of

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.379 
you like G dunno either the design of
the<00:05:44.620> character<00:05:45.099> but<00:05:45.700> I<00:05:45.760> think<00:05:45.970> he's<00:05:46.090> worth<00:05:46.270> a

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
the character but I think he's worth a

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.150 
the character but I think he's worth a
pickup<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:46.930> if<00:05:47.050> just<00:05:47.410> a<00:05:47.500> fan<00:05:47.680> of<00:05:47.710> Dino<00:05:47.979> in

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
pickup and if just a fan of Dino in

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.260 
pickup and if just a fan of Dino in
general<00:05:48.460> I<00:05:48.490> think<00:05:48.550> he's<00:05:48.789> a<00:05:48.820> really<00:05:48.910> nice

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
general I think he's a really nice

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.290 
general I think he's a really nice
figure<00:05:49.780> I<00:05:50.020> mean<00:05:50.740> can<00:05:50.860> be<00:05:51.010> pricey<00:05:51.310> but<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:51.940> think

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
figure I mean can be pricey but I think

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.520 
figure I mean can be pricey but I think
he's<00:05:52.449> really<00:05:53.080> neat<00:05:53.470> and<00:05:53.680> um<00:05:54.280> I<00:05:55.050> just<00:05:56.050> like<00:05:56.500> a
