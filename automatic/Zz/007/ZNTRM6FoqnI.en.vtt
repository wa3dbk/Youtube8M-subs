00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Hello, how about this time? 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.339
 We can teach how to put music in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.109
 the trick achievement the only thing you have 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.210
 to do the first thing you have to do 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.250
 because not in all versions grabs 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.190
 what music is coming 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.839
 You must see that your version is 1.2 as 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.830
 you are going to see the version because here it says to you 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.990
 you can not also go to options 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.200
 you can go to controls because many 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.110
 they say what is the key and all that 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.320
 no pardon is here on keyboard and here 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.020
 you'll find here says look towards towards 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.940
 so right and so you must 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.940
 search where the radio says 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.600
 to sound player sorry 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.940
 sound player should say ro the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.820
 letter that you have that you must squeeze 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.400
 then I'll tell you when 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.470
 we continue to the second part good and 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.600
 we continue in the second part as we see 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.190
 if you already have version 1.1 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.290
 you can download only the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.580
 program that I will leave you with the name a 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.170
 this then put a different name but 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.650
 the file is called peru 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.430
 point euro point you do not know to convert 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.570
 the music and pass it on to you this the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.150
 another and good 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.850
 if you do not have the version and maybe not 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.650
 do not serve or try, I 'll say what 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.050
 try and if it does not work for you 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.800
 download the euro trick is if an editor 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.600
 with version 1.1 2 sorry that is the 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.910
 I'm going to give you the link here that weighs 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.050
 122 negage already comes with the program 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.180
 installed good and does not need translation 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.070
 the doctor or simulator you can put it in 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.770
 Spanish but since you have a download 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.530
 file in this case I'll show you if 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.509
 you install the euro program that I'm going 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.490
 to leave yet for there is a link what downloads 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.020
 that is another part but now all 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.270
 will teach how to pass music to 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.920
 open the program called is whitson 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.080
 file convert it you will open from the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.940
 folder only the icon will come out 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.560
 this and you will double click 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.080
 it's the only thing you have to do since 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.240
 already comes to say so preinstalled no 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.640
 no installation is needed is better than 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.890
 they hope this is going to take as long as it is not 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.830
 installed it took a bit good first thing 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.840
 what we should do is where saft says 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.570
 folder is where you are going to save in that 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.830
 folder is going to save which folder you 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.140
 let's give here 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.140
 bruce and let's go to libraries 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.450
 documents my documents and they will search 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.510
 here where it says euros and purse that 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.450
 they are more open the tab just you 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.250
 des going to be here where it says the music 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.950
 you are going to mark and you are going to accept 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.650
 put to have this only go to 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.080
 they will move to drag the song that 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.090
 want here they can drag 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.700
 simultaneously some songs some 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.860
 10 or one by one in this case in the 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.350
 first that is here we are going to put it 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.030
 so that you do not give them error they must 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.100
 check that the songs do not have 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.260
 accent since when they have an accent 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.540
 commonly the program does not accept them 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.070
 but already this let's say that this one has 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.320
 accent whether the changes will remove the 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.510
 name now what they're going to go here where 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.260
 says the format 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.620
 and they are going to change to where he says oh je je 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.450
 After that they will mark the song 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.849
 already going to be marked will give 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.010
 convert and good is already already when you 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.780
 come out the little arrow is that if it's okay to 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.120
 Sometimes you will leave something blue I think 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.640
 is that it is not confirmed or something like that 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.950
 it seems to me that it will not serve you equally 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.290
 they come out in tacha is that I do not affect them 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.890
 for some reason or another this is a 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.629
 effect 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.940
 remember that it may take some 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.129
 songs depends on your weight of the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.959
 extension of how long this is 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.329
 program is portable so it's not 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.730
 installed if it's going to take a little bit in 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.579
 convert the songs for example this 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.280
 late song I think two minutes already when 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.680
 have this already the song is already going to 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.799
 appear as I said to them a little while ago and 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.900
 you had to look in options and keyboard 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.840
 what was your letter to open the 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.569
 audio player player in 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.280
 you the other most of the time 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.709
 commonly the radio player is 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.260
 open with the letter r there are many people 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.329
 that have it configured differently or not 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.430
 I do not know why it does not come out but because 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.440
 I tell him to go, I'll be 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.590
 put so they do what I tell them 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.130
 to go 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.440
 to options later to keyboard and search in 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.139
 a good audio or rap product place 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.880

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.130
