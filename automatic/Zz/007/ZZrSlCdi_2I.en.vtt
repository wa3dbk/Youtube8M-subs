00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.860
For me the whole album was quite an adventure. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
I just wanted to write music with other artists

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.620
and thought this only makes sense when you are really open minded about it.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.500
Just get together and see what happens.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.400
I liked working with people that have an understanding of jazz

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.680
 -&nbsp;actually for most of them jazz is part of their background -  

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.780
but who now mostly play in a different field musically. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.220
For me, there are several meanings to „UP“. 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.940
For one the whole process of generating ideas,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.980
writing the music and being in the studio had a great driving energy to it. 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.160
But it´s also the vibe of the music: to me a lot of it is very uplifting,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.180
but there are also a couple of melancholic pieces as well. 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.480
But that's not necessarily a contradiction in my book.
