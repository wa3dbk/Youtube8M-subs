agile<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.780> think<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:14.040> most<00:02:15.000> important

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
agile I think one of the most important

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.800 
agile I think one of the most important
things<00:02:15.780> he<00:02:16.019> teaches<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:17.370> be<00:02:17.489> an<00:02:17.610> athlete

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810

things he teaches is to be an athlete
you<00:02:18.810> can't<00:02:19.049> just<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.379> good<00:02:19.530> at<00:02:19.680> one<00:02:19.709> thing<00:02:19.890> you
