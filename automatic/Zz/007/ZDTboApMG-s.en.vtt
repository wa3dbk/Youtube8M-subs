another<00:00:15.389> angle<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.960> attack<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.440> those<00:00:16.680> mutis

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
another angle to attack with those mutis

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
another angle to attack with those mutis
and<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:18.300> know<00:00:18.390> another<00:00:18.750> arc<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.140> being<00:00:19.380> made

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and you know another arc on being made

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.340 
and you know another arc on being made
by<00:00:19.710> pea<00:00:19.770> soup<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.400> again<00:00:20.850> those<00:00:21.660> are<00:00:21.869> cons<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
by pea soup but again those are cons it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.480 
by pea soup but again those are cons it
doesn't<00:00:22.529> matter<00:00:22.710> how<00:00:22.800> well<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:22.980> control<00:00:23.400> them

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
doesn't matter how well you control them

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
it's up to the ZURB to decide whether

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.689 
it's up to the ZURB to decide whether
you're<00:00:25.560> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.769> work<00:00:25.890> or<00:00:26.039> not<00:00:26.099> yeah<00:00:26.640> you

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
you're going to work or not yeah you

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.220 
you're going to work or not yeah you
could<00:00:26.970> trade<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.269> few<00:00:27.480> fakie<00:00:27.750> maneuvers

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
could trade you a few fakie maneuvers

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.810 
could trade you a few fakie maneuvers
with<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:28.859> most<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> time<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.519> just<00:00:29.580> not

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
with it but most the time it's just not

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.690 
with it but most the time it's just not
going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> work<00:00:30.090> he<00:00:30.960> did<00:00:31.170> make<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.250> best<00:00:32.489> he

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
going to work he did make the best he

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.430 
going to work he did make the best he
could<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.360> others<00:00:33.660> Vandenberg<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.200> do

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
could with that others Vandenberg I do

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.240 
could with that others Vandenberg I do
the<00:00:34.559> best<00:00:34.590> he<00:00:34.890> possibly<00:00:35.100> could<00:00:36.980> if<00:00:37.980> you're

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the best he possibly could if you're

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.440 
the best he possibly could if you're
taking<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.610> drones<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.390> not

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
taking on drones but it's just not

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.030 
taking on drones but it's just not
enough<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.140> what's<00:00:40.350> interesting<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.860> he<00:00:40.920> made

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
enough but what's interesting is he made

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680 
enough but what's interesting is he made
the<00:00:41.160> second<00:00:41.640> arc<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.149> don't<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.540> that's

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the second arc on I don't know if that's

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
the second arc on I don't know if that's
a<00:00:42.840> good<00:00:42.870> mood<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.219> ain't<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.670> go

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a good mood because I ain't going to go

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
a good mood because I ain't going to go
well<00:00:45.329> he's<00:00:45.660> trying<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> flank<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.770> bit

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
well he's trying to flank a little bit

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.200 
well he's trying to flank a little bit
and<00:00:47.070> he<00:00:47.160> knows<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.700> hour<00:00:47.850> con<00:00:48.030> maybe

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and he knows that one hour con maybe

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
and he knows that one hour con maybe
dies<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> little<00:00:48.719> easier<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.920> he<00:00:50.039> does<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
dies a little easier but he does have a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.830 
dies a little easier but he does have a
couple<00:00:50.700> Corsairs<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.329> long<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.629> he<00:00:51.690> doesn't

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
couple Corsairs as long as he doesn't

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680 
couple Corsairs as long as he doesn't
let<00:00:51.960> them<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.230> slowly<00:00:52.530> oh<00:00:53.250> very<00:00:54.059> close<00:00:54.449> right

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
let them get slowly oh very close right

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.959 
let them get slowly oh very close right
there<00:00:54.980> our<00:00:55.980> current<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.550> caught<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
there our current like you caught that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.610 
there our current like you caught that
with<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> baseball<00:00:57.360> glove<00:01:00.199> but<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.320> know<00:01:01.440> if

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
with a baseball glove but you know if

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
with a baseball glove but you know if
you<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> couple<00:01:02.340> Corsairs<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:02.969> your

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
you have a couple Corsairs with your

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.700 
you have a couple Corsairs with your
archons<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.719> suddenly<00:01:04.049> becomes<00:01:04.229> very<00:01:04.500> good

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
archons it suddenly becomes very good

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
archons it suddenly becomes very good
against<00:01:04.920> commuters<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.090> they

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
against commuters because they just they

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
against commuters because they just they
obviously<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> ranged<00:01:07.710> attack<00:01:07.979> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
obviously have the ranged attack that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.890 
obviously have the ranged attack that
can<00:01:08.280> hit<00:01:08.400> those<00:01:08.549> mutants<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.720> pull

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
can hit those mutants and you just pull

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.539 
can hit those mutants and you just pull
back<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> archons<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.890> one-shot<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
back and the archons can one-shot the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.600 
back and the archons can one-shot the
scourge<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.500> combination<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.310> quite

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
scourge so that combination is quite

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.340 
scourge so that combination is quite
useful<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.939> speedos<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.630> looks<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.960> Jay

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
useful in speedos and it looks like Jay

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
useful in speedos and it looks like Jay
