00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
like a normal tall boot you can show in

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.860 
like a normal tall boot you can show in
these<00:03:01.410> boots<00:03:01.620> because<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.130> field<00:03:02.400> boot

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
these boots because it's a field boot

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.630 
these boots because it's a field boot
and<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.110> like<00:03:04.290> all<00:03:04.530> leather<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.280> outside

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
and it's like all leather on the outside

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.010 
and it's like all leather on the outside
so<00:03:05.820> they<00:03:05.910> won't<00:03:06.120> even<00:03:06.180> see<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.600> wave<00:03:06.810> front

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
so they won't even see this wave front

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.270 
so they won't even see this wave front
of<00:03:07.170> them<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.380> done<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.710> they<00:03:07.770> don't<00:03:08.010> see<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
of them is done and they don't see the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.180 
of them is done and they don't see the
purple<00:03:08.640> on<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.850> inside<00:03:09.210> so<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.620> boot<00:03:10.860> is

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
purple on the inside so this boot is

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.580 
purple on the inside so this boot is
great<00:03:11.730> if<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.360> are<00:03:12.630> into<00:03:12.990> showing<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.470> the
