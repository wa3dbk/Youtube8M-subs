00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
this little package so let's plug it in

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.440 
this little package so let's plug it in
and<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:41.050> what<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.260> sounds<00:02:41.380> like

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.320 

okay<00:02:47.450> we're<00:02:48.080> all<00:02:48.200> set<00:02:48.440> up<00:02:48.620> here<00:02:49.210> using<00:02:50.210> a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
okay we're all set up here using a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.920 
okay we're all set up here using a
Stratocaster<00:02:55.930> that's<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.230> clean<00:02:57.830> dry<00:02:58.070> signal

have the volumes set to equity gain so

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.570 
have the volumes set to equity gain so
