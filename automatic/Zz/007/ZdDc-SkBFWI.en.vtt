00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
something different now you might have

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.590 
something different now you might have
seen<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.590> tutorial<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.850> notepad<00:01:42.390> plus

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
seen in my tutorial that my notepad plus

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.319 
seen in my tutorial that my notepad plus
plus<00:01:42.630> shows<00:01:43.079> colors<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.180> am

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
plus shows colors this is because I am

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.130 
plus shows colors this is because I am
using<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:46.200> language<00:01:47.180> view<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.869> call

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
using a language view as they call

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740 
using a language view as they call
because<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:50.189> c-sharp<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.329> orange

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
because for c-sharp you see these orange

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.560 
because for c-sharp you see these orange
colors<00:01:52.110> green<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.979> gray<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.610> brown<00:01:53.729> well

this<00:03:19.800> this<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.580> c-sharp<00:03:21.510> style<00:03:22.410> programming

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
this this is a c-sharp style programming

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.580 
this this is a c-sharp style programming
well<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.240> could<00:03:24.390> also<00:03:24.510> pick<00:03:24.840> other<00:03:25.020> styles

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
well you could also pick other styles

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.090 
well you could also pick other styles
but<00:03:25.770> c-sharp<00:03:26.430> gets<00:03:26.910> most<00:03:27.300> closest<00:03:28.100> also

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
but c-sharp gets most closest also
