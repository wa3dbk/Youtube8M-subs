00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 simple cars parked in the street 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.700
 no money that sleeps that's what 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.139
 include more and more 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.059
 of motorists who when they 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.920
 do not use their own flesh rent it 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.630
 to other individuals via internet 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.669
 for a day a weekend or 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.349
 more for renters it's a good 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.599
 way to lighten their car budget 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.490
 and for the tenants it is the insurance 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.909
 to find cheap vehicles near 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.070
 from their house 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.199
 a win-win system that can 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.300
 also include deciphering traps 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.960
 it suits me well because it is 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.660
 easy in fact of two of exchanged with 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.109
 the person who will lend us his 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.719
 car 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.690
 in the end there are only a few exchanges 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.590
 of mails the good discount is enough 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.190
 simple a priori 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.050
 and then it's definitely cheaper 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.820
 that go through to the sncf to get 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.300
 move the economic argument has 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.339
 Verry much 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.829
 awarded in fact in my choice I rent it 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.230
 25 euros a day were a quarter 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.370
 hour by appointment in the morning and the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.410
 evening if you want to rent for a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.510
 day only french not the law at 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.490
 time and I'm delighted because it's a 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.130
 vehicle that served me strictly to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.869
 nothing fabian is part of 26000 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.600
 individuals who put their car in 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.759
 rental on driver leader of the sector in 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.020
 average 3000 of these cars take the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.610
 road every weekend he went 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.140
 extremely public so this is 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 quite difficult to train to train a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 robot portrait on the tenant side 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.619
 it's more young urban workers who 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.869
 those who can do without cars 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.280
 who even decided to do without 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.340
 car unions a lot in the east 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.290
 in the big cities and because 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.299
 it is he considers that the more used 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.710
 practice that possession and for the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.700
 owners it's a little bit 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.149
 more people who live in the periphery 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.280
 who can have one or two cars 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.020
 and who have who are in the waters to say 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.890
 in the middle classes is who and who 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.390
 seeks to repay shadow the price 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.979
 maintenance of their car we have 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.549
 continuously improved the offer 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.039
 insurance 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.149
 we have strengthened our customer service we have 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.659
 strengthened our role as a third party 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.909
 trust 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.409
 a very well- honed system to the point that 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.899
 some individuals make it a 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.149
 real small business like this man 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.920
 which has three cars including two 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.480
 who bought it new with a contract 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.379
 maintenance for purposes only 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.940
 leasable 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.140
 we are sure of a damping logic 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.849
 I buy cars to cushion them 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.769
 and that's from there actually 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.099
 that I benefit from it but there is 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.670
 no profits the end of the year between 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.959
 the costs between shots and is that 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.230
 report cars we can not say 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.390
 that's because there is a dynamic 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.460
 of acquisitions that there is a gain that is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.190
 does what makes that 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.360
 if the taxes you want to watch from 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.050
 close if there are profits they 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.280
 could not prove it 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.740
 so for now it's very marginal 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.050
 that represents about 3% of 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.730
 vehicles among the 26,000 that are 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.860
 allocated on drzewiecki are dedicated to the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.970
 location or it's more just a logic 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.810
 sharing costs but it is a 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.210
 logic of 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.000
 microenterprises and we think that's going 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.380
 to grow as on a lot of place 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.540
 market be it ebay same airbnb it 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.770
 can there be segments that get 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.440
 professionalize and we count 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.360
 clearly encouraged that concretely 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.070
 our interlocutor will tell us that 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.410
 one year his first new bought car 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.420
 14000 euros will have brought him back a little 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.660
 more than 5000 euros and that the second 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.340
 buy 17500 euros brought him 3 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.870
 thousand euros in six months on the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.420
 weekends there is no vacation you 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.240
 are at 100 euros income per car 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.140
 100 110 120 on the rental side 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.970
 professional 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.590
 we recognize closely observed emergence 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.330
 of this unbridled competition 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.680
 these societies there must be treated of the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.780
 same way as skipping them from the crate 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.770
 by car at the legal administrative level 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.310
 and tax which is not the case 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.650
 today 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.600
 so that's a problem we're trying to 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.370
 obvious lover to solve without going so 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.530
 quickly and there is no question of the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.940
 aggressively protect our meadow 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.100
 square everyone has the right to work 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.620
 Thursday even long live the competition none 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.330
 problem with that but with rules 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.440
 identical which is not the case so 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.060
 it's a problem we're going to fix 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.410
 we are in the process of settling that the 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.990
 Ministry of Economy and Finance 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.820
 and with the dgcrf on the other hand if you 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.340
 are tempted attention despite everything to 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.230
 insurance problems the general wall is 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.910
 still to go through a society that 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.970
 will make you finally subscribe 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.680
 a specific contract for the duration of 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.420
 this rental that will eventually take 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.799
 this supports three parts of his 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.640
 service at that time you are 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.380
 cutlery 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.870
 if not actually your own sister 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.060
 risk of decline and in case of accident 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.750
 in case of disaster you are not 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.670
 cutlery 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.790
 according to the INSEE car budget 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.260
 annual average amounts to 4300 euros for 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.000
 that he did not panic too much at the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.460
 simple idea to lend his dear car 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.290
 renting between individuals is a 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.330
 an enticing solution provided 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.410
 go through serious organizations and 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.420
 do not play with questions 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.190
 insurance in any event these 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.840
 new uses shows that the automobile 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.360
 is not dead but reinvents itself without 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.360
