abdul-jabbar<00:01:35.840> MJ<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> apparently<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
abdul-jabbar MJ so apparently this is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.440 
abdul-jabbar MJ so apparently this is
like<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:40.500> my<00:01:40.920> player<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> legends
