00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.660
 we are long 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.560
 my 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.500
 I 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.850
 with 250 thousand copies per rouen 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.520
 already the roads of europe 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.770
 li x35 exceeded the hopes that had 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.470
 place and hyundai in his vehicle when 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.850
 its launch in 2010 this model created 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.160
 specifically for the European market 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.600
 do not fall asleep on his laurels he sees 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.270
 today arrived his first 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.450
 evolutions, however, he keeps his design 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.530
 and his identity 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.730
 if hyundai we have a design 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.550
 how to all our vehicles that we 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 call the fluidic sculpture this is a 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.310
 design that combines dynamism and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.360
 fluidity and that is inspired by the forces 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.680
 of nature 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.720
 it's a modern design that applies 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.370
 today the set of designers on 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.479
 all of our two new models 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.100
 and that's what makes it a 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.400
 specific peculiarity of our 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.400
 Mark 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.010
 we can hardly speak of facelift 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.440
 in stylistic changes are 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.880
 minors looking good we will distinguish 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.110
 on the front side the new lights to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.110
 led or bi xenon 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.050
 the taillights betray more 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.600
 easily the new model with 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.130
 slightly modified locations thanks to 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.130
 new to LED technology 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.360
 new wheels also make their 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.770
 appearance all this will not have what 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.420
 make jealous the owners of the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.420
 previous generation on 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.579
 a recurrent criticism of the version 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.390
 previous issue concerned suspensions 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.460
 little hard 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.439
 a bernatas of the account since the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.869
 new ix35 has suspensions 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.329
 less firm the engine volunteers 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.920
 is associated with a casting that 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.670
 fits well to these high vehicles 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.189
 on legs 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.030
 management has also been reviewed for 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.030
 be less blurry 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.170
 one can easily find one's position 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.120
 conduct de fact we trace the road 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.040
 easily with a gearbox 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.960
 responding to all our requests 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.700
 the accelerator has a detent 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.160
 in his race that will encourage you to 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.510
 economic driving or a surplus 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.960
 of energy if you ignore her 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.960
 presence 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.010
 the engine 2 liters crd of 136 horses of 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.990
 our test allows us to extricate ourselves 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.180
 quickly from low traffic 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.870
 diet and remains speed-conscious 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.000
 cruising 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.709
 we will just blame him for a loudness 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.709
 still a little present in the habitat 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.450
 note that the engines were 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.160
 worked on the ecological aspect m 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.590
 motorization in its 2-wheel version 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.989
 motor is now given for 141 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.610
 grams of co2 per kilometer which we 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.970
 leads to look at version 4 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.970
 drive wheels 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.090
 like all vehicles of this 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.810
 segment that is called the segment of its 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.850
 suv 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.100
 these are vehicles that are 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.750
 basically sold in two wheels 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.300
 driving 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.900
 70% of vehicles are sold in two 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.580
 30% wheels in four wheels we follow 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.350
 the market trend with results 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.700
 substantially equivalent commercials us 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.140
 have tried this version on the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.800
 steep paths in the hinterland 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.050
 Var 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.990
 the ton vehicle this mop 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.240
 easily on pebbles lee x35 did 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.710
 not a daily vocation of 4.4 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.340
 but he is doing quite well 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.830
 correctly 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.180
 as often we will use it first 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.220
 to go to a point of spades 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.920
 away from a crowded rest area 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.330
 in addition to the choice of traction mode 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.800
 ix35 also offers various engines 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.630
 it is available with a motorisation 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:03.060
 gasoline 1 6 and 2 diesel engines 17 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:07.140
 cents or 2 liters of 1700 does 117 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:11.120
 horses and 2 liters makes 135 horses or 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:14.250
 well 186 horses in automatic transmission 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.560
 with this new ix35 the Korean brand 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.780
 fits with long strides to 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.489
 expectations of Europeans 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.710
 the vehicle does not undergo a revolution 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.020
 but many developments in phase with 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.460
 customer requests and those 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.200
 do not hesitate today to make a 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.580
 detour by a concession one since then 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.440
 of a purchase 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.710
 competition is now on alert
