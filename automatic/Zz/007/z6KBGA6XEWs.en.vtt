00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.250
 so today how to read a plan 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.170
 architectural 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.540
 and then especially what information is going 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.060
 find on this architectural plot so 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 here it's interesting we have the plan the 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.550
 cell behind 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.310
 what do we find on this plane 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.189
 first here in black all the walls as well 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.699
 that the partitions of the cell is located 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.069
 behind you a little bit further here 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.980
 on the left we can see the window 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.980
 this window is found on this plane 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.010
 here we see something that 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.370
 looks like a lan that looks like a 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.769
 bright point with a friend certainly here a 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.359
 little particular bit that fits 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.059
 simply to the symbols on this plane 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.489
 a projector and its projectors 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.440
 find them position here in 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.129
 background on the cell so we 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.879
 found on the left 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.879
 they say here is right she 11 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.140
 what do we find as other 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.210
 symbol this symbol is the symbol 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.660
 a power outlet 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.060
 so we have another one here it's believe 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.940
 so we saw earlier points 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.110
 bright who do not have the niger khl all 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.260
 simply because they are not 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.240
 spotlights here a bright spot posed 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.540
 along a wall is called a point 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.060
 luminous applied here ceiling in the 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.130
 center of the room a man that a point 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.210
 luminous in ceiling central mounting 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.550
 other important information to 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.280
 remarks on this plan we find full 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.000
 dotted it's dotted 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 simply represents who's commanding 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.310
 which is to say each luminous point 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.259
 by which device it is controlled if I 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:02.860
 take the example of l2 he is linked with 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.509
 dotted at es5 and here a 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.180
 5 ignition switch which so 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.830
 say that this lamp l2 will turn on or 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:16.060
 extinguish stifle this switch s16 I 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.180
 look at the bright spot in the east center 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.549
 so we realize that it is linked to two 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.230
 switches that are here the symbols 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.200
 switches back and forth since 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.820
 to control a bright spot of two 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.970
 places to use electricity 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:36.190
 the assembly goes back and forth small circuit a 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.030
 a little more complex we notice 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.209
 that besides there are a lot of 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:45.400
 dotted it's in the hallway of 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:50.709
 this cell where we find the point 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.260
 bright s7 and the bright dot l8 which 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.030
 are well linked together by 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.310
 dotted gifts that will be lit and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.010
 is a set but they are related 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.079
 also we see several of 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.209
 these symbols here two alain circles in 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.910
 the host that correspond to pimples 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.610
 some pushers have a cross to 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.170
 inside others do not have cross 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.160
 when they have a cross inside that 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.139
 simply means that there is a 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.940
 seeing on this push button which 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.820
 will for example simply 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.280
 when it's dark to find this point 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.329
 order and last thing important 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.930
 we are still connected in the sheath 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.359
 housing technique named gtl where 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.389
 all the electricity and where all that 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:37.570
 is running low telly a phone is going 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.730
 pass will end up we realize 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.769
 we have a small rectangle with like 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.079
 a stair step that corresponds to 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.739
 remote control so to order l 7 and 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.250
 n 8 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.600
 we will use such a breaker why 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.760
 simply because we 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.040
 1 2 3 4 5 push button controls 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.280
 and electricity to order by 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.900
 more than two command points a point 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.829
 bright we are obliged to use a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.370
 last assembly mounting 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:14.560
 interesting is for the control of the 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.760
 10 and they 11 if we follow them well 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.340
 dotted they are well connected 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.070
 together so ordered together 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.449
 also by pushbuttons but 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.180
 this time we realize that in the 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.419
 gtl we have a small device in a 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.400
 rectangle with a little tea that 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.720
 corresponds to a timer all 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.190
 simply because outside in 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.160
 general what we will use as 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.229
 circuit we will want to turn on before 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.850
 leave the house 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.010
 and when we go home we 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.330
 wish this lan go out 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.690
 automatically after a certain 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.340
 time 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.919
 this is the principle of mounting the 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.570
 timer there are other information 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.810
 which are very important on a plane 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.970
 especially for example the scale 1 then 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.130
 actually the information anyway 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.880
 the most important one we will want 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.440
 use this plan there is the scale so 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.810
 here scale 1 25th 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.280
 so we just split the 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.680
 actual quotes from this cell by 25 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.539
 so if I take my master here exo 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.059
 measured 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:21.709
 I take something that corresponds to 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:25.129
 its 100 cm so 100 cm to m well I 

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:27.199
 divides a master by 25 and on my plan 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.959
 I will find the quotation 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.069
 i will get how much then i will get 

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:36.589
 this length so on my plan it's 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.550
 a m how am I going to do to be able 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.649
 find them 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.269
 I will use this kind of rules 

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:43.039
 so what is this 

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:44.300
 rule then it's settled the interesting 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.519
 because it allows to have a reading 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.889
 direct on the plane according to 

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:50.629
 the scale of the plans so here we can 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.369
 read a plan only at a scale 1 100th 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:57.829
 go on here I'll use it's 

00:05:52.369 --> 00:06:00.279
 graduation or the scale 1 25th at this 

00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:03.050
 moment I will use it's graduation 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:05.839
 if I return this rule I realize 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.300
 that I still have other scales of 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:11.119
 available and for example here I 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.219
 found the scale 1 25th that corresponds 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:14.779
 well at the scale of my plan then 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.610
 let's see what it would be one meter 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.860
 about cats so if I worried wants 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.689
 measure here the 1 m 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.249
 I position here so I put it in 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:27.079
 the other way to be better I'm going 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:32.169
 from here from the angle to the heroes here and 

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:36.349
 I find here 50 cm is here at m 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:38.300
 so you find some put here 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.089
 if I take a pencil here we can 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.829
 make a little mark that's what 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:44.300
 match well we realize well 

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:47.300
 here they will have to measure to what we have 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.099
 measured but earlier this is it 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.029
 simply put / that we 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.739
 will have fun to take a 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.300
 calculator see how many centimeters 

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:55.039
 it may be an exercise that you 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.209
 will have the opportunity to make it possible 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.639
 and how does one know how high 

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:59.809
 should we put the components then that 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.699
 it's information in general that we 

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:03.379
 go find out you have to go read the 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.819
 description of the specifications and the 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:06.199
 most of the time in the description of the 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.519
 specifications you have these 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:10.309
 information so here we for 

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:13.249
 simplify it we have it we have it 

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:14.959
 noted directly on the plan and so we 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:16.909
 find for us for example the 

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:21.759
 height of the outlets that will be 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:21.759
 positioned here at 1 m 30 from accor 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:28.420
 between other information well 

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.420
 thank you very much it is cushy
