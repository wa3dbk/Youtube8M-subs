00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
lead the NBA and points in the paint on

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.170 
lead the NBA and points in the paint on
a<00:02:58.900> game<00:02:59.350> basis<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.550> for<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.880> Warriors

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
a game basis so I think for the Warriors

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.540 
a game basis so I think for the Warriors
it's<00:03:01.360> up<00:03:01.570> tempo<00:03:01.990> be<00:03:02.590> smart<00:03:02.950> don't<00:03:03.280> fuel

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
it's up tempo be smart don't fuel

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.460 
it's up tempo be smart don't fuel
turnovers<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.330> shoot<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.990> ball<00:03:05.110> well<00:03:05.350> you

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
turnovers and shoot the ball well you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.110 
turnovers and shoot the ball well you
know<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.650> Warriors<00:03:05.830> having<00:03:06.160> had<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.670> really

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
know the Warriors having had a really

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
know the Warriors having had a really
good<00:03:07.240> shooting<00:03:07.660> night<00:03:07.810> since<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.770> all-star

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
good shooting night since the all-star

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.400 
good shooting night since the all-star
break<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.300> this<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.990> one<00:03:11.140> where<00:03:11.290> they're

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
break and so this is one where they're

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.990 
break and so this is one where they're
winning<00:03:11.560> with<00:03:11.740> defense<00:03:12.070> which<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.340> great<00:03:12.580> but

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
winning with defense which is great but

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.220 
winning with defense which is great but
I'd<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.270> to<00:03:13.390> see<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.570> word<00:03:13.690> hit<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> bunch<00:03:14.140> of
