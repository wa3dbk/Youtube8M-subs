below<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.790> mentioned<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.899> prior<00:01:55.290> video

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
below I mentioned that in a prior video

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.940 
below I mentioned that in a prior video
but<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.030> want<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> give<00:01:57.899> them<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.350> good

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
but I do want to give them a good

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.429

thoughts<00:02:01.770> along<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.759> thoughts<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
thoughts along with my thoughts in the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.840 
thoughts along with my thoughts in the
video<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.380> how<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.619> game<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.310> perfectly

video for how the game can be perfectly

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
video for how the game can be perfectly
balanced<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> know<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.049> virtually

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
balanced I know it's virtually

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.109 
balanced I know it's virtually
impossible<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> perfect

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
impossible to get a perfect

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.890 
impossible to get a perfect

Cybertron<00:02:41.250> demo<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.790> am<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.120> Titan<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:42.989> are

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
Cybertron demo I am the Titan and we are

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.880 
Cybertron demo I am the Titan and we are
playing<00:02:43.470> an<00:02:43.799> array<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:46.230> Titan<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.739> this

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
playing an array so the Titan in this

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.059 
playing an array so the Titan in this
game<00:02:47.220> he<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:47.940> my<00:02:48.269> biggest<00:02:48.750> learning<00:02:49.170> curve<00:02:49.440> so

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
game he was my biggest learning curve so

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.460 
game he was my biggest learning curve so
far<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.700> I'm<00:02:51.030> yet<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.269> really<00:02:51.599> like<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.349> an

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
far and I'm yet to really like have an

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.160 
far and I'm yet to really like have an
outstanding<00:02:53.099> game<00:02:53.909> with<00:02:54.150> him<00:02:54.359> which<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.810> very

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
outstanding game with him which is very

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.800 
outstanding game with him which is very
surprising<00:02:55.890> because<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.599> transformers<00:02:57.599> war

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
surprising because in transformers war

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.720 
surprising because in transformers war
for<00:02:57.989> Cybertron<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.890> could<00:02:59.040> argue<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> my

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
for Cybertron you could argue that my

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.599 
for Cybertron you could argue that my
best<00:03:00.030> class<00:03:00.390> was<00:03:00.629> easily<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.230> soldier<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:02.069> I

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
best class was easily the soldier and I

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.339 
best class was easily the soldier and I
would<00:03:02.849> throw<00:03:03.030> up<00:03:03.120> some<00:03:03.269> pretty<00:03:03.569> huge<00:03:03.930> games

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
would throw up some pretty huge games

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.399 
would throw up some pretty huge games
with<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.709> soldier<00:03:05.159> at<00:03:05.280> times<00:03:05.609> and<00:03:06.019> he<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
with the soldier at times and he is a

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.309 
with the soldier at times and he is a
very<00:03:07.920> different<00:03:08.700> soldier<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:09.659> this<00:03:09.870> game<00:03:10.079> or<00:03:10.290> a

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
very different soldier in this game or a

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.190 
very different soldier in this game or a
Titan<00:03:10.829> in<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.220> game<00:03:11.459> he's<00:03:11.879> very<00:03:12.150> large<00:03:12.510> he's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
Titan in this game he's very large he's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.220 
Titan in this game he's very large he's
not<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.620> fast<00:03:13.950> he<00:03:14.519> does<00:03:14.760> provide<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.569> weapon

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
not that fast he does provide a weapon

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.920 
not that fast he does provide a weapon
with<00:03:16.919> the<00:03:17.099> Scrat<00:03:17.430> maker<00:03:17.669> for<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.000> distance<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
with the Scrat maker for a distance to a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.259 
with the Scrat maker for a distance to a
medium<00:03:19.349> range<00:03:19.500> gun<00:03:19.889> and<00:03:20.130> also<00:03:20.700> an<00:03:20.790> Energon

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
medium range gun and also an Energon

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.479 
medium range gun and also an Energon
harvester<00:03:21.840> which<00:03:22.319> is<00:03:22.500> very<00:03:22.769> cool<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.250> takes

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
harvester which is very cool it takes

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.879 
harvester which is very cool it takes
away<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.209> enemy's<00:03:24.750> health<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.500> gives<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.859> to

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
away the enemy's health and gives it to

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.619 
away the enemy's health and gives it to
you<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:26.250> it's<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.459> shotgun<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:27.510> a

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
you and it's a shotgun and it's a

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.869 
you and it's a shotgun and it's a
close-range<00:03:28.169> shotgun<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.919> it<00:03:29.129> acts<00:03:29.400> exactly

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
close-range shotgun so it acts exactly

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.479 
close-range shotgun so it acts exactly
like<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.629> would<00:03:30.959> think<00:03:31.319> a<00:03:31.530> shotgun<00:03:32.010> would<00:03:32.190> act

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
like I would think a shotgun would act

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.300 
like I would think a shotgun would act
so<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.000> got<00:03:33.209> really<00:03:33.450> no<00:03:33.750> problems<00:03:34.260> with<00:03:34.769> the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
so I got really no problems with the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.729 
so I got really no problems with the
Titans<00:03:35.790> guns<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.510> far<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.049> think<00:03:37.230> they're<00:03:37.590> all

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
Titans guns so far I think they're all

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.589 
Titans guns so far I think they're all
very<00:03:37.949> cool<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.370> they<00:03:38.430> fit<00:03:38.730> him<00:03:38.879> pretty<00:03:39.060> well<00:03:39.150> I

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
very cool and they fit him pretty well I

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.400 
very cool and they fit him pretty well I
also<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:41.160> his<00:03:41.819> whirlwind<00:03:42.629> does<00:03:43.079> do<00:03:43.379> a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
also think that his whirlwind does do a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.140 
also think that his whirlwind does do a
pretty<00:03:43.530> good<00:03:43.919> job<00:03:44.129> when<00:03:44.340> you're<00:03:44.489> right<00:03:44.819> next

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
pretty good job when you're right next

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.030 
pretty good job when you're right next
to<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.389> person<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.109> only<00:03:46.230> problem<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:46.799> the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
to the person the only problem with the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.309 
to the person the only problem with the
whorl<00:03:47.280> one<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:48.359> everybody<00:03:48.870> has<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.049> -

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
whorl one is that everybody has a -

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.229 
whorl one is that everybody has a -
ability<00:03:49.829> so<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.129> can<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.489> dash<00:03:50.699> away<00:03:51.030> from

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
ability so you can just dash away from

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.789 
ability so you can just dash away from
it<00:03:51.359> and<00:03:51.510> you're<00:03:51.629> basically<00:03:51.959> just<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.379> sitting

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
it and you're basically just a sitting

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.039 
it and you're basically just a sitting
duck<00:03:52.829> in<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.519> whirlwind<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.810> my<00:03:54.930> opinion

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
duck in the whirlwind so in my opinion

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.770 
duck in the whirlwind so in my opinion
the<00:03:56.040> world<00:03:56.280> 1<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.609> can<00:03:56.760> use<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.389> use<00:03:57.629> it

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the world 1 you can use it and use it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.289 
the world 1 you can use it and use it
good<00:03:58.049> if<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.889> can<00:03:59.220> sneak<00:03:59.549> up<00:03:59.730> on<00:03:59.849> somebody<00:04:00.239> and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
get right next to them and use it but if

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.770 
get right next to them and use it but if
they<00:04:01.799> see<00:04:01.859> you<00:04:02.250> throw<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.419> like<00:04:03.599> Oh

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:13.199 
think that could help him out quite a

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:15.559 
think that could help him out quite a
bit<00:04:13.470> but<00:04:13.919> overall<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.370> still<00:04:14.489> love<00:04:15.060> using<00:04:15.329> it

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
bit but overall I still love using it

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.180 
bit but overall I still love using it
it's<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.870> hilarious<00:04:16.260> way<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.799> kill<00:04:17.070> your

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.219 
it's a hilarious way to kill your
enemies<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:17.849> thoroughly<00:04:18.390> enjoy<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.109> new

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229

animation<00:04:19.919> with<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.219> sword<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:20.820> going

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.550 
animation with the sword just going
crazy<00:04:21.719> on<00:04:22.079> it

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
crazy on it

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.510 
crazy on it
I<00:04:22.590> think<00:04:22.800> it'd<00:04:22.889> be<00:04:22.950> kind<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.160> cool<00:04:23.280> if<00:04:23.430> you

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
I think it'd be kind of cool if you

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.060 
I think it'd be kind of cool if you
could<00:04:23.669> pick<00:04:23.880> what<00:04:24.570> weapon<00:04:25.080> your<00:04:25.260> guy<00:04:25.740> held

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
could pick what weapon your guy held

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.810 
could pick what weapon your guy held
like<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.340> club<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.300> sword<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:28.169> hammer<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.980> axe<00:04:29.610> I

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
like a club a sword a hammer and axe I

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.860 
like a club a sword a hammer and axe I
think<00:04:30.000> that'd<00:04:30.090> be<00:04:30.120> cool<00:04:30.330> if<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:30.510> could<00:04:30.630> kind

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
think that'd be cool if you could kind

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.170 
think that'd be cool if you could kind
of<00:04:30.960> pick<00:04:31.169> what<00:04:31.950> your<00:04:32.100> soldier<00:04:32.520> had<00:04:32.700> so<00:04:32.970> if<00:04:33.060> they

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
of pick what your soldier had so if they

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.460 
of pick what your soldier had so if they
could<00:04:33.330> add<00:04:33.480> that<00:04:33.510> in<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.960> think<00:04:34.139> that'd<00:04:34.260> be<00:04:34.290> a

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
could add that in I think that'd be a

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.790 
could add that in I think that'd be a
really<00:04:34.800> sweet<00:04:35.190> feature<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.930> also<00:04:37.080> really

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
really sweet feature and I also really

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.040 
really sweet feature and I also really
like<00:04:38.070> how<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.370> Titan<00:04:38.850> transforms<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:39.690> looks

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
like how the Titan transforms and looks

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.620 
like how the Titan transforms and looks
and<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.889> lot<00:04:41.040> of<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.160> guys<00:04:41.250> know<00:04:41.330> from<00:04:42.330> my<00:04:42.480> war

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.350 
have a larger shield or just more health
he<00:05:16.410> dies<00:05:16.620> pretty<00:05:17.040> quickly<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.729> he<00:05:17.910> has<00:05:18.030> really

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
he dies pretty quickly and he has really

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.659 
he dies pretty quickly and he has really
no<00:05:18.690> way<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.020> escape<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.919> feel<00:05:20.400> like<00:05:20.520> he's<00:05:20.639> the

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
no way to escape I feel like he's the

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.070 
no way to escape I feel like he's the
type<00:05:20.880> of<00:05:20.940> guy<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.120> you<00:05:21.389> should<00:05:21.419> be<00:05:21.900> able<00:05:21.960> to

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
type of guy that you should be able to

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.050 
type of guy that you should be able to
jump<00:05:22.410> into<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.680> battle<00:05:23.130> and<00:05:23.370> really<00:05:23.669> just<00:05:23.880> cause

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
jump into a battle and really just cause

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.670 
jump into a battle and really just cause
a<00:05:24.090> ruckus<00:05:24.540> with<00:05:24.930> your<00:05:25.110> weapons<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.620> your

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
a ruckus with your weapons and your

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.219 
a ruckus with your weapons and your
destruction<00:05:26.130> and<00:05:26.460> your<00:05:26.850> fists<00:05:27.330> so<00:05:27.840> I'd<00:05:27.990> also

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
destruction and your fists so I'd also

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.370 
destruction and your fists so I'd also
like<00:05:28.530> to<00:05:28.680> see<00:05:28.890> possibly<00:05:29.850> his<00:05:30.240> melee<00:05:30.960> up<00:05:31.169> a

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
like to see possibly his melee up a

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.529 
like to see possibly his melee up a
little<00:05:31.560> bit<00:05:31.800> because<00:05:32.340> sometimes<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.150> feel<00:05:33.360> like

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
little bit because sometimes I feel like

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.320 
little bit because sometimes I feel like
I<00:05:33.630> still<00:05:33.990> lose<00:05:34.320> that<00:05:34.620> battle<00:05:34.950> against<00:05:35.760> a<00:05:35.880> scout

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
I still lose that battle against a scout

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.480 
I still lose that battle against a scout
when<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:36.900> am<00:05:37.140> a<00:05:37.229> Titan<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:38.220> kind<00:05:38.430> of

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
when I am a Titan and that kind of

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.370 
when I am a Titan and that kind of
frustrates<00:05:38.970> me<00:05:39.120> because<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:39.510> am<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.780> big<00:05:40.169> guy

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
frustrates me because I am the big guy

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.200 
frustrates me because I am the big guy
I'm<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:40.650> brawler<00:05:41.130> I<00:05:41.400> should<00:05:41.669> be<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.850> one<00:05:42.000> that

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
I'm the brawler I should be the one that

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.969 
I'm the brawler I should be the one that
wins<00:05:42.360> those<00:05:42.600> in<00:05:42.720> melee<00:05:43.050> battles<00:05:43.440> if<00:05:43.590> we<00:05:43.770> both

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
wins those in melee battles if we both

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.430 
wins those in melee battles if we both
have<00:05:44.250> full<00:05:44.550> health<00:05:44.880> and<00:05:45.090> are<00:05:45.570> both<00:05:45.720> one-on-one

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
have full health and are both one-on-one

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.820 
have full health and are both one-on-one
so<00:05:47.430> those<00:05:48.150> are<00:05:48.300> my<00:05:48.390> overall<00:05:49.110> just<00:05:49.500> brief

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
so those are my overall just brief

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.219 
so those are my overall just brief
thoughts<00:05:50.250> from<00:05:50.760> playing<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.450> Titan<00:05:51.810> so<00:05:52.020> far

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
thoughts from playing the Titan so far

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.400 
thoughts from playing the Titan so far
in<00:05:52.410> this<00:05:52.560> demo<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.190> as<00:05:53.850> you<00:05:53.970> can<00:05:54.090> see<00:05:54.270> I<00:05:54.570> do<00:05:54.900> use

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
in this demo and as you can see I do use

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.050 
in this demo and as you can see I do use
a<00:05:55.440> shotgun<00:05:55.770> a<00:05:55.950> couple<00:05:56.160> times<00:05:56.340> in<00:05:56.520> this<00:05:56.669> game<00:05:56.760> I

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
a shotgun a couple times in this game I

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.570 
a shotgun a couple times in this game I
do<00:05:57.150> like<00:05:57.960> the<00:05:58.169> new<00:05:58.200> range<00:05:58.650> on<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:58.950> shotgun<00:05:59.400> and

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
do like the new range on the shotgun and

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.219 
do like the new range on the shotgun and
for<00:06:00.000> the<00:06:00.090> Energon<00:06:00.450> harvester<00:06:00.840> the<00:06:00.930> scatter

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
for the Energon harvester the scatter

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.050 
for the Energon harvester the scatter
blaster<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.650> think<00:06:01.979> it's<00:06:02.370> too<00:06:02.580> far<00:06:02.789> away<00:06:03.000> but

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
blaster I think it's too far away but

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.029 
blaster I think it's too far away but
the<00:06:03.240> Energon<00:06:03.630> harvester<00:06:04.169> you<00:06:04.680> have<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:04.950> be

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
the Energon harvester you have to be

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.379 
the Energon harvester you have to be
pretty<00:06:05.220> close<00:06:05.400> to<00:06:05.460> use<00:06:05.760> it<00:06:05.940> so<00:06:06.060> that's<00:06:06.270> a<00:06:06.360> good

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
pretty close to use it so that's a good

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.740 
pretty close to use it so that's a good
thing<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.050> also<00:06:08.039> I<00:06:08.280> think<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:08.970> Titan<00:06:09.360> when<00:06:09.600> he

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
thing and also I think the Titan when he

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.650 
thing and also I think the Titan when he
rolls<00:06:10.050> when<00:06:10.350> he's<00:06:10.470> shooting<00:06:11.090> he's<00:06:12.090> really

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
rolls when he's shooting he's really

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.860 
rolls when he's shooting he's really
really<00:06:13.260> really<00:06:13.560> slow<00:06:13.979> I<00:06:14.430> think<00:06:15.120> that<00:06:15.539> it's

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
really really slow I think that it's

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.600 
really really slow I think that it's
kind<00:06:16.169> of<00:06:16.200> unnecessary<00:06:16.889> for<00:06:17.070> him<00:06:17.160> to<00:06:17.250> be<00:06:17.340> that

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
kind of unnecessary for him to be that

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.490 
kind of unnecessary for him to be that
slow<00:06:18.030> when<00:06:18.570> he's<00:06:18.720> kind<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.050> turning<00:06:19.350> you're

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
slow when he's kind of turning you're

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.900 
slow when he's kind of turning you're
already<00:06:19.710> slow<00:06:19.979> enough<00:06:20.280> and<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:20.550> big<00:06:20.789> enough

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
already slow enough and a big enough

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.779 
already slow enough and a big enough
target<00:06:21.270> as<00:06:21.690> it<00:06:21.900> is<00:06:22.200> so<00:06:22.800> I<00:06:22.830> don't<00:06:22.919> think<00:06:23.430> that

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
target as it is so I don't think that

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.879 
target as it is so I don't think that
that<00:06:24.300> slowdown<00:06:24.870> on<00:06:25.080> his<00:06:25.320> gun<00:06:25.560> while<00:06:25.740> you're

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
that slowdown on his gun while you're

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:27.529 
that slowdown on his gun while you're
doing<00:06:26.130> a<00:06:26.250> barrel<00:06:26.520> roll<00:06:26.639> is<00:06:26.850> completely

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
doing a barrel roll is completely

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.120 
doing a barrel roll is completely
necessary<00:06:28.970> but<00:06:29.970> like<00:06:30.450> I<00:06:30.539> said<00:06:30.750> before<00:06:31.130> before

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
necessary but like I said before before

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.800 
necessary but like I said before before
this<00:06:32.250> video<00:06:32.460> is<00:06:32.700> over<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:33.030> want<00:06:33.360> to<00:06:33.450> remind<00:06:33.630> you

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:39.499 
feedback on the game thus far I want to

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.019 
feedback on the game thus far I want to
know<00:06:39.619> from<00:06:39.860> everybody<00:06:40.369> there<00:06:40.580> thought<00:06:40.789> so<00:06:40.969> I

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029 
know from everybody there thought so I

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:42.249 
know from everybody there thought so I
can<00:06:41.210> look<00:06:41.300> it<00:06:41.449> over<00:06:41.539> and<00:06:41.809> see<00:06:42.050> what<00:06:42.169> the

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
can look it over and see what the

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:43.809 
can look it over and see what the
majority<00:06:42.800> is<00:06:42.889> thinking<00:06:43.279> and<00:06:43.399> I<00:06:43.460> can<00:06:43.639> make<00:06:43.789> a

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:43.819 
majority is thinking and I can make a

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.869 
majority is thinking and I can make a
video<00:06:44.089> on<00:06:44.479> balancing<00:06:45.409> and<00:06:45.589> feedback<00:06:46.399> that<00:06:46.699> I

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:46.879 
video on balancing and feedback that I

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.249 
video on balancing and feedback that I
can<00:06:47.149> hopefully<00:06:47.330> give<00:06:47.719> to<00:06:47.869> high<00:06:48.020> Moon<00:06:48.229> Studios

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
can hopefully give to high Moon Studios

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.439 
can hopefully give to high Moon Studios
they<00:06:48.860> can<00:06:49.039> take<00:06:49.219> a<00:06:49.249> look<00:06:49.550> at<00:06:49.699> it<00:06:49.879> and<00:06:49.999> maybe

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
they can take a look at it and maybe

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.269 
they can take a look at it and maybe
make<00:06:50.689> some<00:06:50.899> adjustments<00:06:51.529> to<00:06:51.649> improve<00:06:51.800> the

00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:52.279 
make some adjustments to improve the

that<00:07:04.339> I<00:07:04.369> kind<00:07:04.580> of<00:07:04.729> just<00:07:05.029> made<00:07:05.449> a<00:07:05.479> lot<00:07:05.719> of

00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:05.839 
that I kind of just made a lot of

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:07.779 
that I kind of just made a lot of
arguments<00:07:06.319> to<00:07:06.349> make<00:07:06.589> the<00:07:06.830> Titans<00:07:07.219> stronger

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:07.789 
arguments to make the Titans stronger

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.079 
arguments to make the Titans stronger
but<00:07:08.330> not<00:07:09.080> necessarily<00:07:09.740> from<00:07:09.949> all<00:07:10.219> distances<00:07:10.669> I

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.089 
but not necessarily from all distances I

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:14.049 
but not necessarily from all distances I
just<00:07:11.360> feel<00:07:11.629> that<00:07:11.930> up<00:07:12.469> close<00:07:12.800> and<00:07:13.159> personal<00:07:13.699> the

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:14.059 
just feel that up close and personal the

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:15.999 
just feel that up close and personal the
Titans<00:07:14.509> should<00:07:14.749> be<00:07:14.869> the<00:07:15.020> one<00:07:15.229> if<00:07:15.680> you're<00:07:15.919> gonna

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:16.009 
Titans should be the one if you're gonna

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.480 
Titans should be the one if you're gonna
go<00:07:16.249> toe-to-toe<00:07:16.689> fist<00:07:17.689> to<00:07:18.229> fist<00:07:18.259> the<00:07:19.009> Titans

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
go toe-to-toe fist to fist the Titans

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.519 
go toe-to-toe fist to fist the Titans
should<00:07:19.669> be<00:07:19.789> the<00:07:19.909> stronger<00:07:20.479> of<00:07:20.659> the<00:07:20.689> other

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:21.529 
should be the stronger of the other

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:23.469 
should be the stronger of the other
classes<00:07:22.069> you<00:07:22.580> should<00:07:22.849> be<00:07:23.089> close<00:07:23.270> to<00:07:23.300> the

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 
classes you should be close to the

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:25.659 
classes you should be close to the
destroyer<00:07:24.139> I<00:07:24.259> would<00:07:24.499> think<00:07:24.680> but<00:07:25.309> he<00:07:25.490> should

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:25.669 
destroyer I would think but he should

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:27.730 
destroyer I would think but he should
make<00:07:25.819> the<00:07:26.089> scientists<00:07:26.719> and<00:07:26.869> the<00:07:26.990> scouts<00:07:27.289> think

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
make the scientists and the scouts think

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.829 
make the scientists and the scouts think
twice<00:07:28.099> about<00:07:28.129> coming<00:07:28.789> up<00:07:28.879> and<00:07:29.119> having<00:07:29.779> a

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:29.839 
twice about coming up and having a

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.439 
twice about coming up and having a
little<00:07:30.050> melee<00:07:30.499> battle<00:07:30.919> with<00:07:31.039> him<00:07:31.279> so<00:07:32.209> I<00:07:32.240> hope

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:32.449
