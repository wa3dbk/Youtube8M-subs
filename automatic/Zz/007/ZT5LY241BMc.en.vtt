I need to give you a little bit of an
advanced<00:00:12.240> warning<00:00:12.720> here<00:00:12.990> because<00:00:13.770> we're

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
advanced warning here because we're

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.340 
advanced warning here because we're
about<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.370> dig<00:00:14.790> into<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.210> complicated<00:00:15.990> topic

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
about to dig into a complicated topic

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.230 
about to dig into a complicated topic
we're<00:00:17.190> gonna<00:00:17.279> take<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.820> at<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
we're gonna take a look at the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.230 
we're gonna take a look at the
foundation<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:19.080> digital<00:00:19.590> imaging<00:00:20.099> pixels<00:00:21.000> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
foundation of digital imaging pixels and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.510 
foundation of digital imaging pixels and
bit<00:00:21.570> dub<00:00:21.840> yet<00:00:22.529> we're<00:00:22.680> gonna<00:00:22.800> take<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.099> look<00:00:23.369> at

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
bit dub yet we're gonna take a look at

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.400 
bit dub yet we're gonna take a look at
this<00:00:23.640> complicated<00:00:24.119> topic<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.050> see<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.290> we

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
this complicated topic and see if we

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.200 
this complicated topic and see if we
can't<00:00:25.650> make<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> simple<00:00:26.579> and<00:00:26.610> understandable

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
can't make it simple and understandable

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.440 
can't make it simple and understandable
so<00:00:28.169> why<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.470> pixels<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.430> bit<00:00:29.730> depth<00:00:30.000> really

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
so why do pixels in bit depth really

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.690 
so why do pixels in bit depth really
matter<00:00:30.660> well<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.739> can<00:00:31.890> understand<00:00:32.489> these

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
matter well if we can understand these

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.370 
matter well if we can understand these
topics<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.630> help<00:00:33.870> us<00:00:34.020> create<00:00:34.230> better

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
topics it can help us create better

topics it can help us create better
images<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.790> also<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.239> help<00:00:36.270> us<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.780> more

images it also can help us have more

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.510 
images it also can help us have more
control<00:00:37.470> when<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:38.010> working<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.460> our

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
control when we're working on our

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330 
control when we're working on our
photographs<00:00:39.149> inside<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.750> Photoshop<00:00:40.350> well<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
photographs inside a Photoshop well to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.070 
photographs inside a Photoshop well to
really<00:00:41.640> understand<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.360> topics<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
really understand these topics what I

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.020 
really understand these topics what I
think<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.410> need<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.650> do<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.310> go<00:00:44.520> back<00:00:44.790> in

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
think we need to do is to go back in

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.210 
think we need to do is to go back in
time<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.630> a<00:00:45.690> moment<00:00:46.050> James<00:00:46.830> Clerk<00:00:47.190> Maxwell

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
time for a moment James Clerk Maxwell

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.520 
time for a moment James Clerk Maxwell
was<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> person<00:00:48.450> who<00:00:48.540> discovered<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.350> what

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
was a person who discovered that what

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
was a person who discovered that what
you<00:00:49.650> could<00:00:49.860> do<00:00:50.040> is<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.580> could<00:00:50.730> create<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.210> color

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
you could do is you could create a color

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.110 
you could do is you could create a color
image<00:00:51.990> with<00:00:52.530> three<00:00:52.830> different<00:00:53.010> colors<00:00:53.640> red

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
image with three different colors red

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720 
image with three different colors red
green<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.990> blue<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.520> really

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
green and blue and it's a really

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.610 
green and blue and it's a really
fascinating<00:00:57.480> story<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.930> you're<00:00:58.020> interested

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
fascinating story if you're interested

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.960 
fascinating story if you're interested
in<00:00:58.710> photography<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.520> history<00:00:59.940> of

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
in photography in the history of

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.060 
in photography in the history of
photography<00:01:00.200> but<00:01:01.200> basically<00:01:01.650> what<00:01:01.980> he

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
photography but basically what he

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.890 
photography but basically what he
discovered<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.910> he<00:01:03.240> could<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.630> these

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
discovered is that he could have these

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.109 
discovered is that he could have these
three<00:01:04.320> different<00:01:04.559> negatives<00:01:05.220> he<00:01:05.759> could<00:01:05.970> then

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
three different negatives he could then

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
three different negatives he could then
shine<00:01:06.540> light<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:06.869> these<00:01:07.259> negatives<00:01:07.740> with

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
shine light through these negatives with

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.609 
shine light through these negatives with
a<00:01:08.250> red<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.939> green<00:01:09.060> filter<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.990> each<00:01:10.259> of<00:01:10.470> these

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
a red or a green filter on each of these

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.580 
a red or a green filter on each of these
well<00:01:11.400> together<00:01:11.759> these<00:01:12.540> would<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:12.960> create<00:01:13.259> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
well together these would then create a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.309 
well together these would then create a
color<00:01:14.009> photograph<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.179> was<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:15.990> really

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:16.319 
color photograph it was actually really

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.649 
color photograph it was actually really
just<00:01:16.710> amazing<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.609> was<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> discovery<00:01:18.569> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
just amazing it was the discovery of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.469 
just amazing it was the discovery of
color<00:01:19.049> photography<00:01:19.490> well<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.819> day<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
color photography well to this day the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
color photography well to this day the
same<00:01:21.749> way<00:01:21.899> that<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.200> view<00:01:22.229> images<00:01:22.979> when

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
same way that we view images when

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.399 
same way that we view images when
they're<00:01:23.310> created<00:01:23.789> via<00:01:23.999> light<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:25.229> these

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
they're created via light is with these

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
they're created via light is with these
three<00:01:25.679> channels<00:01:26.130> red<00:01:26.549> green<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.329> blue<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
three channels red green and blue and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080 
three channels red green and blue and
let's<00:01:28.979> say<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> color<00:01:29.969> for

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
let's say that we have a color for

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.840 
let's say that we have a color for
example<00:01:30.329> orange<00:01:31.159> well<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.429> to<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
example orange well just to kind of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.429 
example orange well just to kind of
create<00:01:33.060> something<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.899> try<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> illustrate

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
create something to try to illustrate

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.919 
create something to try to illustrate
this<00:01:35.039> we<00:01:35.249> could<00:01:35.789> say<00:01:35.969> that<00:01:35.999> this<00:01:36.299> orange<00:01:36.749> is

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
this we could say that this orange is

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.669 
this we could say that this orange is
made<00:01:37.109> up<00:01:37.289> of<00:01:37.439> 240<00:01:38.159> red<00:01:38.399> 12<00:01:39.240> green<00:01:39.569> and<00:01:39.840> 15<00:01:40.350> blue

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
made up of 240 red 12 green and 15 blue

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.160 
made up of 240 red 12 green and 15 blue
in<00:01:41.069> other<00:01:41.549> words<00:01:41.789> it's<00:01:42.030> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.359> like<00:01:42.569> mixing

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
in other words it's kind of like mixing

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.260 
in other words it's kind of like mixing
paint<00:01:43.469> together<00:01:43.859> and<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.819> you<00:01:44.939> need<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
paint together and all that you need is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.179 
paint together and all that you need is
to<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.479> able<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> mix<00:01:46.139> together<00:01:46.380> these<00:01:46.799> three

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
to be able to mix together these three

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.819 
to be able to mix together these three
colors<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.819> it<00:01:48.389> can<00:01:48.539> give<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> huge<00:01:49.200> range

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
colors and it can give you a huge range

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.029 
colors and it can give you a huge range
of<00:01:50.100> different<00:01:50.459> options<00:01:50.609> well<00:01:51.569> how<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.990> that

pixels<00:01:55.529> in<00:01:55.770> bit<00:01:56.159> depth<00:01:56.459> let's<00:01:57.179> take<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.359> look<00:01:57.569> at

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
pixels in bit depth let's take a look at

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
pixels in bit depth let's take a look at
a<00:01:57.749> photograph<00:01:57.959> for<00:01:58.439> example<00:01:58.889> well<00:01:59.639> here<00:01:59.789> we

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
a photograph for example well here we

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
a photograph for example well here we
have<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.090> image<00:02:00.209> and<00:02:00.569> if<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.810> zoom<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.409> an

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
have an image and if we zoom in on an

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.529 
have an image and if we zoom in on an
area<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.249> photograph<00:02:02.789> we<00:02:03.029> can<00:02:03.060> see<00:02:03.389> that

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
area of this photograph we can see that

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.999 
area of this photograph we can see that
it's<00:02:03.689> made<00:02:03.959> up<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.350> all<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> these<00:02:04.950> different

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
it's made up of all of these different

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's made up of all of these different
little<00:02:05.880> pixels<00:02:06.450> well<00:02:07.289> what<00:02:07.499> is<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> pixel<00:02:08.340> well

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
little pixels well what is a pixel well

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.480 
little pixels well what is a pixel well
the<00:02:09.270> word<00:02:09.450> pixel<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> concatenation<00:02:10.800> or

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
the word pixel is a concatenation or

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.330 
the word pixel is a concatenation or
combination<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.390> two<00:02:12.840> words<00:02:13.080> picture<00:02:14.040> and

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
combination of two words picture and

element at its base it's the small
little<00:02:17.490> picture<00:02:18.030> elements<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:19.380> really

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
little picture elements and if really

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.710 
little picture elements and if really
really<00:02:20.070> getting<00:02:20.310> close<00:02:20.760> into<00:02:21.150> one<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.540> these

what<00:02:23.400> we'll<00:02:23.520> discover<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.840> these<00:02:25.080> are

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
what we'll discover is that these are

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.280 
what we'll discover is that these are
made<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.800> bits<00:02:26.370> now<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.390> word<00:02:27.630> bit<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.200> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
made up of bits now the word bit is a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.650 
made up of bits now the word bit is a
combination<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.160> these<00:02:29.400> two<00:02:29.670> words<00:02:29.880> binary

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
combination of these two words binary

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.710 
combination of these two words binary
and<00:02:31.040> digit<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.910> know<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.240> sounds<00:02:33.630> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
and digit and I know this sounds a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.690 
and digit and I know this sounds a
little<00:02:33.959> bit<00:02:34.110> abstract<00:02:34.530> here<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.250> let's<00:02:35.430> dig

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
little bit abstract here but let's dig

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.809 
little bit abstract here but let's dig
deeper<00:02:36.090> into<00:02:36.209> what<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.780> bit<00:02:37.080> actually<00:02:37.830> is<00:02:38.069> what

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
deeper into what a bit actually is what

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.410 
deeper into what a bit actually is what
is<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> pixel<00:02:39.510> made<00:02:39.810> up<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.290> well<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> bit<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.120> some

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
is a pixel made up of well a bit is some

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.930 
is a pixel made up of well a bit is some
information<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.319> we<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> certain

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
information and we can have a certain

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.990 
information and we can have a certain
kind<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.720> depth<00:02:46.170> if<00:02:46.470> we<00:02:47.280> have<00:02:47.459> bit<00:02:47.670> depth

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
kind of bit depth if we have bit depth

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.090 
kind of bit depth if we have bit depth
you<00:02:48.209> can<00:02:48.390> see<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.750> as<00:02:48.870> we<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.410> more<00:02:49.739> bits

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
you can see that as we have more bits

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.790 
you can see that as we have more bits
while<00:02:50.459> we<00:02:50.610> have<00:02:50.850> larger<00:02:51.630> file<00:02:51.930> size<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.560> have

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
while we have larger file size we have

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.910 
while we have larger file size we have
more<00:02:53.130> info<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.989> bits<00:02:54.989> are<00:02:55.200> made<00:02:55.410> up<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.739> this

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
more info and bits are made up of this

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.620 
more info and bits are made up of this
whole<00:02:56.100> concept<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.940> can<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.300> something

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
whole concept of you can have something

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.190 
whole concept of you can have something
which<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:57.959> either<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.680> or<00:02:59.160> off<00:02:59.300> its<00:03:00.300> binary<00:03:00.690> we

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
which is either on or off its binary we

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.370 
which is either on or off its binary we
have<00:03:01.410> two<00:03:01.709> options<00:03:02.269> well<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.510> more<00:03:03.780> options

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
have two options well the more options

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.890 
have two options well the more options
that<00:03:04.560> we<00:03:04.739> have<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.730> more<00:03:06.000> colors<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.720> more

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
that we have the more colors the more

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.870 
that we have the more colors the more
tonality<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.620> more<00:03:07.920> smoothness<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.610> we

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
tonality the more smoothness that we

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.640 
tonality the more smoothness that we
have<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.239> an<00:03:09.330> image<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.050> looks<00:03:10.380> like<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
have in an image so that it looks like a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.370 
have in an image so that it looks like a
photorealistic<00:03:11.459> picture<00:03:12.360> let<00:03:12.989> me<00:03:13.080> explain

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
photorealistic picture let me explain

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.800 
photorealistic picture let me explain
this<00:03:13.620> well<00:03:14.489> here<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.760> can<00:03:14.940> see<00:03:15.150> we<00:03:15.300> have<00:03:15.540> one

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
this well here you can see we have one

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.809 
this well here you can see we have one
bit<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.680> either<00:03:16.800> be<00:03:16.920> black<00:03:17.370> or<00:03:17.610> white

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
bit this can either be black or white

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.330 
bit this can either be black or white
two<00:03:18.180> bit<00:03:18.420> we<00:03:18.630> can<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:19.019> black<00:03:19.380> or<00:03:19.709> different

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
two bit we can have black or different

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.809 
two bit we can have black or different
shades<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.970> gray<00:03:21.330> as<00:03:21.630> we<00:03:22.470> get<00:03:22.650> up<00:03:22.800> to<00:03:23.040> 8<00:03:23.340> bit<00:03:23.640> or

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
shades of gray as we get up to 8 bit or

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.390 
shades of gray as we get up to 8 bit or
higher<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.200> sudden<00:03:25.530> we<00:03:25.709> have<00:03:25.980> enough

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
higher all of a sudden we have enough

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.229 
higher all of a sudden we have enough
variation<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.560> looks<00:03:28.950> like

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
variation so that it looks like

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.120 
variation so that it looks like
continuous<00:03:30.239> tone<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.739> really<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
continuous tone and this is really the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.490 
continuous tone and this is really the
basis<00:03:32.519> for<00:03:32.549> how<00:03:32.910> our<00:03:33.209> digital<00:03:33.840> images<00:03:34.350> are

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
basis for how our digital images are

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.620 
basis for how our digital images are
made<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:35.220> other<00:03:35.579> words<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.329> know<00:03:36.420> when<00:03:36.540> you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
made in other words you know when you

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.720 
made in other words you know when you
zoom<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.049> close<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.769> can<00:03:37.950> see<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.519> is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
zoom in close you can see that this is

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.910 
zoom in close you can see that this is
pixelated<00:03:39.180> you're<00:03:39.660> seeing<00:03:39.930> all<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.350> corners

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
pixelated you're seeing all the corners

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.490 
pixelated you're seeing all the corners
of<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.250> pixels<00:03:41.700> yet<00:03:42.630> when<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.200> enough

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
of the pixels yet when you have enough

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.470 
of the pixels yet when you have enough
information<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.579> see<00:03:44.820> an<00:03:44.970> image<00:03:45.150> as

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
information you see an image as

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.770 
information you see an image as
continuous<00:03:46.440> tone<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.100> in<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.850> RGB<00:03:48.329> color

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
continuous tone and in the RGB color

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.949 
continuous tone and in the RGB color
space<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.190> these<00:03:50.430> eight<00:03:50.670> bits<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.329> red<00:03:51.600> of

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
space we have these eight bits of red of

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.310 
space we have these eight bits of red of
green<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.650> also<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:53.400> blue<00:03:53.870> each<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.170> these

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
green and also of blue each of these

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.880 
green and also of blue each of these
channels<00:03:55.769> give<00:03:56.250> us<00:03:56.459> 256<00:03:57.620> possibilities<00:03:58.620> in

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
channels give us 256 possibilities in

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.979 
channels give us 256 possibilities in
other<00:03:59.549> words<00:03:59.820> as<00:04:00.000> we<00:04:00.299> combine<00:04:00.750> these

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
other words as we combine these

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.800 
other words as we combine these
different<00:04:01.470> colors<00:04:01.920> or<00:04:02.130> tones<00:04:02.400> together<00:04:02.970> this

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
different colors or tones together this

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.620 
different colors or tones together this
gives<00:04:04.170> us<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.500> chance<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.920> create<00:04:05.250> 16<00:04:06.180> million

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
gives us a chance to create 16 million

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.860 
gives us a chance to create 16 million
colors<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.890> this<00:04:08.489> is<00:04:08.700> all<00:04:08.880> because<00:04:09.329> of<00:04:09.359> bit

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
colors and this is all because of bit

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.020 
colors and this is all because of bit
depth<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:11.070> when<00:04:11.190> we<00:04:11.310> go<00:04:11.489> back<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.730> our

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
depth so when we go back to our

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.599 
depth so when we go back to our
photograph<00:04:12.660> really<00:04:12.989> we're<00:04:13.410> able<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:14.010> see<00:04:14.310> this

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
different channels together and as I

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.550 
different channels together and as I
mentioned<00:05:27.600> in<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.780> beginning<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.230> this<00:05:28.320> movie

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
mentioned in the beginning of this movie

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.800 
mentioned in the beginning of this movie
I<00:05:28.890> know<00:05:29.190> that<00:05:29.490> this<00:05:29.640> concept<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.300> little<00:05:30.630> bit

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
I know that this concept is a little bit

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.050 
I know that this concept is a little bit
complicated<00:05:31.290> yet<00:05:32.220> I<00:05:32.310> want<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.580> share<00:05:32.880> this

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
complicated yet I want to share this

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.850 
complicated yet I want to share this
topic<00:05:33.570> with<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:33.930> because<00:05:34.290> this<00:05:34.500> really<00:05:34.740> is

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
topic with you because this really is

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.490 
topic with you because this really is
the<00:05:35.280> foundation<00:05:35.460> for<00:05:36.000> our<00:05:36.300> digital<00:05:36.720> images

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
the foundation for our digital images

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.010 
the foundation for our digital images
it's<00:05:38.100> really<00:05:38.400> all<00:05:38.580> about<00:05:38.610> how<00:05:39.180> we<00:05:39.240> have<00:05:39.540> pixels

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
it's really all about how we have pixels

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.900 
it's really all about how we have pixels
and<00:05:40.230> bit<00:05:40.410> depth<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.920> if<00:05:41.400> we<00:05:41.550> can<00:05:41.730> have

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
and bit depth and if we can have

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.240 
and bit depth and if we can have
somewhat<00:05:42.450> of<00:05:42.480> a<00:05:42.690> working<00:05:43.200> understanding<00:05:43.530> of

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
somewhat of a working understanding of

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.660 
somewhat of a working understanding of
how<00:05:45.000> our<00:05:45.030> digital<00:05:45.810> images<00:05:46.350> are<00:05:46.530> made<00:05:46.740> well<00:05:47.550> it
