primary stages of it it's not fully done
yet<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> line<00:00:39.480> work

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
yet it's just pretty much the line work

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.990 
yet it's just pretty much the line work
and<00:00:40.110> they'll<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.129> shading<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.820> all<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280

other good stuff so I guess it's a bit
of<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.430> update<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:45.000> probably<00:00:45.719> won't<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:46.020> getting

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079

the shading done for like another week
or<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.750> you

or so but here it is this is it as you
can<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.530> it's<00:00:55.530> actually<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.399> bit

here<00:02:21.120> that's<00:02:21.330> beside<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.140> zombies<00:02:22.530> actually

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
here that's beside the zombies actually

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.600 
here that's beside the zombies actually
going<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.190> be<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.459> blue<00:02:23.700> for<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.370> virus<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
going to be the blue for the virus and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.150 
going to be the blue for the virus and
the<00:02:27.510> blue<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.900> probably<00:02:28.230> going<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> cover<00:02:28.860> like

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
the blue is probably going to cover like

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.980 
the blue is probably going to cover like
around<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.730> zombie<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.209> stuff<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.720> then<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
around the zombie and stuff and then the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.590 
around the zombie and stuff and then the
other<00:02:31.170> one<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.160> here<00:02:32.550> is<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
other one that's on the back here is the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.740 
other one that's on the back here is the
the<00:02:33.959> vaccine<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.890> one's<00:02:35.100> going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> be

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
the vaccine so that one's going to be

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.480 
the vaccine so that one's going to be
green<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.110> then<00:02:38.010> there's<00:02:38.220> going<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.430> a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
green and then there's going to be a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.740 
green and then there's going to be a
bunch<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.700> other<00:02:38.820> colors<00:02:39.120> that's<00:02:39.390> mixed<00:02:39.660> in

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
bunch of other colors that's mixed in

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.840 
bunch of other colors that's mixed in
there<00:02:39.989> but<00:02:40.290> that's<00:02:40.800> pretty<00:02:41.040> much<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.610> general

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
there but that's pretty much the general

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.090 
there but that's pretty much the general
gist<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.590> I'm<00:02:43.590> trying<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.860> think<00:02:43.950> if

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
gist of it I'm trying to think if

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.470 
gist of it I'm trying to think if
there's<00:02:44.130> anything<00:02:44.340> else<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.450> can

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
there's anything else that I can

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.520 
there's anything else that I can
remember<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.930> lot<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.170> people<00:02:46.350> have<00:02:46.440> been

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
remember a lot of people have been

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.470 
remember a lot of people have been
asking<00:02:46.709> me<00:02:47.010> about<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:47.370> two<00:02:47.430> million<00:02:47.820> special

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
asking me about my two million special

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.610 
asking me about my two million special
thing<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.590> item<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.640> daya<00:02:51.200> was<00:02:52.200> starting<00:02:52.590> to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
thing the item that daya was starting to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.370 
thing the item that daya was starting to
get<00:02:52.769> done<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:54.000> quite<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> process<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:55.290> a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
get done and it's quite a process it's a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.870 
get done and it's quite a process it's a
longer<00:02:55.890> process<00:02:56.130> than<00:02:56.370> what<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.640> thought<00:02:56.820> it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
longer process than what I thought it

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.120 
longer process than what I thought it
would<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.269> I<00:02:57.510> had<00:02:57.930> predicted<00:02:58.170> three<00:02:58.739> months

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
would be I had predicted three months

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.190 
would be I had predicted three months
because<00:02:59.459> that's<00:02:59.640> what<00:02:59.790> they<00:02:59.910> estimated<00:03:00.200> but

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
because that's what they estimated but

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.220 
because that's what they estimated but
like<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.760> hasn't<00:03:03.150> even<00:03:03.239> gotten<00:03:03.510> started<00:03:03.600> yet

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
like it hasn't even gotten started yet

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.930 
like it hasn't even gotten started yet
like<00:03:04.410> it's<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:04.890> such<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> back-and-forth

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
like it's it's such a back-and-forth

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.320 
like it's it's such a back-and-forth
process<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:08.070> item<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.790> said<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.300> I

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
process so the item that I said that I

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.060 
process so the item that I said that I
would<00:03:09.570> do<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.200> tooth<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.920> two

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
would do in the tooth and the two

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.280 
would do in the tooth and the two
million<00:03:11.420> subscriber<00:03:12.420> video<00:03:12.720> will<00:03:12.989> probably

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
million subscriber video will probably

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.220 
million subscriber video will probably
still<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.620> done<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.190> I'll<00:03:14.310> probably<00:03:14.489> just

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
still be done and I'll probably just

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.380 
still be done and I'll probably just
show<00:03:16.230> people<00:03:16.410> once<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.950> gets<00:03:17.100> done<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.970> dog<00:03:18.209> is

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
show people once it gets done the dog is

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.530 
show people once it gets done the dog is
running<00:03:19.019> around<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.410> circles<00:03:19.829> again<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:24.299> fuck
