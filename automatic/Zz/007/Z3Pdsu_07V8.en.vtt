had<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> start<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.400> here<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.970> what

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
had to start with this one here is what

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
had to start with this one here is what
you<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.659> staff<00:01:36.930> bits<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.560> pieces<00:01:37.920> various

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you do you staff bits and pieces various

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.149 
you do you staff bits and pieces various
panels<00:01:38.490> from<00:01:38.729> each<00:01:38.939> car<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:40.040> what<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.130> going

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
panels from each car and what I'm going

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.160 
panels from each car and what I'm going
to<00:01:41.310> show<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.689> hundred<00:01:42.810> dollar

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
to show you here is one hundred dollar

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.920 
to show you here is one hundred dollar
project<00:01:44.090> while<00:01:45.090> i'll<00:01:45.210> call<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
project while i'll call it that is

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.780 
project while i'll call it that is
because<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.649> purchased<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> top

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
because it actually purchased the top

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.870 
because it actually purchased the top
for<00:01:48.390> 100<00:01:48.750> bucks<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> Caliph<00:01:50.490> had<00:01:50.670> for

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
for 100 bucks this is the Caliph had for

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.990 
for 100 bucks this is the Caliph had for
years<00:01:51.259> very<00:01:52.259> rusted<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.860> thin<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> top<00:01:53.700> so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
years very rusted and thin on the top so

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
years very rusted and thin on the top so
I<00:01:54.030> nearly<00:01:54.540> wasn't<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> use<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.320> for

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I nearly wasn't going to use it for

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010 
I nearly wasn't going to use it for
anything<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.549> came<00:01:56.790> across<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.600> atlas

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
anything but I came across this atlas

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.499 
anything but I came across this atlas
for<00:01:58.200> tonight<00:01:58.500> paid<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> hundred<00:01:59.610> bucks<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
for tonight paid a hundred bucks for and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.249 
for tonight paid a hundred bucks for and
it<00:02:00.719> was<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.990> excellent<00:02:01.469> condition<00:02:02.100> no<00:02:02.790> rust

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
it was in excellent condition no rust

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.359 
it was in excellent condition no rust
except<00:02:04.259> I've<00:02:04.439> actually<00:02:04.680> dipped<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.310> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
except I've actually dipped it in a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.219 
except I've actually dipped it in a
solution<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> remove<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.299> surface<00:02:06.719> rust<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
solution to remove the surface rust and

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.469 
solution to remove the surface rust and
what<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> did<00:02:08.039> there<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> actually<00:02:08.489> sandblasted

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
what I did there I actually sandblasted

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.300 
what I did there I actually sandblasted
all<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> areas<00:02:10.110> which<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.440> won't<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> once

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
all the areas which I won't get to once

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.920 
all the areas which I won't get to once
i<00:02:11.430> put<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.760> together

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
i put it together

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.740 
i put it together
first<00:02:13.799> we<00:02:14.040> must<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.519> drill<00:02:15.000> all<00:02:15.299> spot

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
first we must actually drill all spot

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.619 
first we must actually drill all spot
welds<00:02:16.109> out<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.859> start<00:02:17.129> removing<00:02:17.519> this<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.450> can

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
welds out to start removing this you can

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.300 
welds out to start removing this you can
see<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:18.900> I've<00:02:18.989> done<00:02:19.140> finally<00:02:19.739> removed<00:02:20.099> it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
see what I've done finally removed it

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.789 
see what I've done finally removed it
those<00:02:20.790> actual<00:02:21.299> side<00:02:21.569> panels<00:02:22.109> there<00:02:22.319> they<00:02:22.620> were

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
those actual side panels there they were

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.709 
those actual side panels there they were
a<00:02:22.829> bit<00:02:23.010> tricky<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> get<00:02:23.579> off<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.299> generally

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
a bit tricky to get off but generally

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.050 
a bit tricky to get off but generally
they're<00:02:24.900> very<00:02:25.200> thin<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.769> weak<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.819> still

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
they're very thin and weak so I still

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.179 
they're very thin and weak so I still
had<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.299> be<00:02:27.420> careful<00:02:27.870> again<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.769> can<00:02:28.799> see<00:02:28.920> I've

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
had to be careful again you can see I've

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.009 
had to be careful again you can see I've
drilled<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.879> spot<00:02:30.120> welds<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.719> remove

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
drilled the spot welds out to remove

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.830 
drilled the spot welds out to remove
them<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.670> top<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:33.120> had<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.659> actually

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
them now with the top I had to actually

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020 
them now with the top I had to actually
drill<00:02:34.680> new<00:02:34.920> holes<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.579> song<00:02:35.849> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
drill new holes in that song and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.259 
drill new holes in that song and
actually<00:02:36.510> spot<00:02:37.409> weld<00:02:37.709> them<00:02:37.920> now<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.909> can<00:02:39.120> see

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
actually spot weld them now you can see

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.729 
actually spot weld them now you can see
all<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.450> new<00:02:39.599> holes<00:02:39.840> there<00:02:40.139> I'm<00:02:40.409> gonna

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
all the new holes there I'm gonna

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.800 
all the new holes there I'm gonna
actually<00:02:40.920> weld<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.719> the<00:02:42.870> bottom

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
actually weld that to it to the bottom

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.210 
actually weld that to it to the bottom
exerted<00:02:45.810> set<00:02:46.019> set<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.470> position<00:02:46.889> now<00:02:47.010> on

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
exerted set set in the position now on

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.520 
exerted set set in the position now on
the<00:02:47.340> actual<00:02:47.579> side<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:48.870> generally<00:02:49.260> spot

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
the actual side the generally spot

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.289 
the actual side the generally spot
welded<00:02:49.919> but<00:02:50.069> I'm<00:02:50.189> showing<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:50.790> there<00:02:51.060> where

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
welded but I'm showing you there where

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.089 
welded but I'm showing you there where
I've<00:02:51.419> actually<00:02:51.569> seen<00:02:52.019> welded<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.560> down<00:02:52.829> both

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
I've actually seen welded it down both

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.979 
I've actually seen welded it down both
sides<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:54.239> me<00:02:54.389> it's<00:02:54.540> going<00:02:54.659> to<00:02:54.720> make<00:02:54.810> it

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
sides to me it's going to make it

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.690 
sides to me it's going to make it
stronger<00:02:55.260> because<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:55.919> older<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.370> it's

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
stronger because it is older and it's

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.740 
stronger because it is older and it's
probably<00:02:56.849> a<00:02:57.030> little<00:02:57.120> bit<00:02:57.329> thinner<00:02:57.599> than

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
probably a little bit thinner than

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.440 
probably a little bit thinner than
originally<00:02:58.400> but<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.669> neat<00:02:59.849> finish<00:03:00.090> nail

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
originally but it's a neat finish nail

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.390 
originally but it's a neat finish nail
just<00:03:00.659> put<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.930> probably<00:03:01.530> grind<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.189> down<00:03:02.219> a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
just put it probably grind it down a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.759 
just put it probably grind it down a
little<00:03:02.639> bit<00:03:02.819> further<00:03:03.090> put<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> bit<00:03:04.169> of<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.349> V<00:03:04.560> into

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
little bit further put a bit of a V into

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.379 
little bit further put a bit of a V into
it<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.069> just<00:03:05.219> a<00:03:05.370> large<00:03:05.669> scheme<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.180> body

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
it and just a large scheme of body

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.440 
it and just a large scheme of body
filler<00:03:06.629> to<00:03:06.959> finish<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.439> off<00:03:08.030> but<00:03:09.030> there<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.359> is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
filler to finish it off but there it is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.229 
filler to finish it off but there it is
completed<00:03:10.079> now<00:03:10.109> all<00:03:10.560> done<00:03:11.099> primered<00:03:11.879> ready

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
completed now all done primered ready

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.690 
completed now all done primered ready
for<00:03:12.629> my<00:03:12.930> next<00:03:12.959> project<00:03:13.439> so<00:03:14.069> thank<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.519> for
