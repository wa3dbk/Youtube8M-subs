then the game after that I just had a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.770 
then the game after that I just had a
really<00:03:04.100> laggy<00:03:04.490> game<00:03:04.820> ended<00:03:05.090> up<00:03:05.180> quitting<00:03:05.480> it

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
really laggy game ended up quitting it

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.140 
really laggy game ended up quitting it
um<00:03:05.960> so<00:03:06.710> I've<00:03:07.010> already<00:03:07.160> played<00:03:07.400> four<00:03:07.850> games

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
bit desperate and then my opponent

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.950 
bit desperate and then my opponent
started<00:03:31.280> getting<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.820> game<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.030> bit<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.570> I

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
started getting to the game a bit and I

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.840 
started getting to the game a bit and I
thought<00:03:33.200> with<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.440> defense<00:03:33.890> i<00:03:34.100> had<00:03:34.340> i<00:03:34.370> really

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
thought with the defense i had i really

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.610 
thought with the defense i had i really
would<00:03:35.030> be<00:03:35.210> troubled<00:03:35.630> at<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.810> back<00:03:35.990> much<00:03:36.260> bud

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
would be troubled at the back much bud

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.220 
would be troubled at the back much bud
and<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.370> game<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.300> kind<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.810> just<00:03:38.990> broke

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
and this game is the kind of just broke

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.980 
and this game is the kind of just broke
right<00:03:39.530> 3<00:03:39.800> i'll<00:03:40.400> lucia<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:40.940> bars<00:03:41.300> a<00:03:41.540> glee<00:03:41.810> who

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
right 3 i'll lucia and bars a glee who

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.930 
right 3 i'll lucia and bars a glee who
i'd<00:03:42.320> have<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.620> say<00:03:42.890> were<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.130> weak<00:03:43.400> links<00:03:43.820> of

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
i'd have to say were the weak links of

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.690 
i'd have to say were the weak links of
this<00:03:44.510> team<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.530> wasn't<00:03:45.950> for<00:03:46.070> Buffon<00:03:46.460> and

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
this team and it wasn't for Buffon and

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.280 
this team and it wasn't for Buffon and
Chiellini<00:03:47.210> act<00:03:47.660> could<00:03:47.930> have<00:03:48.050> been<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.200> lot

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
Chiellini act could have been a lot

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.100 
Chiellini act could have been a lot
worse<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.860> game<00:03:49.070> Nasri<00:03:50.030> didn't<00:03:50.450> really<00:03:50.840> fire

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
worse that game Nasri didn't really fire

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.560 
worse that game Nasri didn't really fire
felt<00:03:51.590> Nasri<00:03:52.130> was<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.520> key<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.060> squad<00:03:53.360> but

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
felt Nasri was the key to the squad but

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.780 
felt Nasri was the key to the squad but
when<00:03:54.140> he<00:03:54.320> was<00:03:54.500> playing<00:03:54.680> well<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.340> team<00:03:55.580> was

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
when he was playing well the team was

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.520 
when he was playing well the team was
playing<00:03:55.940> well<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:56.450> i<00:03:56.570> played<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:57.080> few
