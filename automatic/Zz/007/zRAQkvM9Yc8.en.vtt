 rises on the ceiling prefabricated-monolithic 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.760
 overlap after this insulation 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.700
 thickness of 15 to 30 centimeters of them 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 razuklonku made on the floor 20 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.730

 Effectively such insulation and what will be 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.019
 heating costs of this building because 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.420
 that the creation will only be heated 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.120
 heat pumps on electricity 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.730
 no fireplaces stoves burzhuek here
