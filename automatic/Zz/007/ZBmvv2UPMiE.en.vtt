I think the interactive aspect of the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.349 
I think the interactive aspect of the

augmented reality which is the piece
that<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.539> worked<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.900> when<00:00:25.560> people<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:26.250> it's

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
that I worked on when people see it's

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.670 
that I worked on when people see it's
more<00:00:27.090> intuitive<00:00:27.359> than<00:00:27.779> maybe<00:00:27.930> they<00:00:28.140> expected

it to be there are a lot of things that
human<00:00:31.260> brains<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.579> hard<00:00:32.850> for

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120

through vision we like to think that
