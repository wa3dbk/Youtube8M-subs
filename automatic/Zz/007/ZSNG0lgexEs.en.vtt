the head of the IRS during the scandal

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.079 
the head of the IRS during the scandal
happening<00:00:12.509> was<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> bush<00:00:13.320> appointee<00:00:14.089> apush

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
happening was a bush appointee apush

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.120 
happening was a bush appointee apush
appointee<00:00:15.780> that's<00:00:16.260> important<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.010> should

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
appointee that's important you should

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.189 
appointee that's important you should
that<00:00:17.430> should<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.789> blown<00:00:18.090> caps<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:19.140> bold

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
that should be in blown caps in bold

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
that should be in blown caps in bold
just<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.310> my<00:00:20.580> paper<00:00:20.850> right<00:00:21.240> here

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
just like it is at my paper right here

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.380 
just like it is at my paper right here
it<00:00:21.930> says<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.439> bush<00:00:22.769> appointee<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:24.210> it's

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it says a bush appointee so it's

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.810 
it says a bush appointee so it's
unlikely<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
unlikely that this was a really a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.240 
unlikely that this was a really a
political<00:00:27.359> hit<00:00:27.660> job<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.170> both<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.949> brock

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
political hit job that both by brock

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.730 
political hit job that both by brock
obama<00:00:29.580> quick<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.119> seems<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.750> seems<00:00:31.349> fairly

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
unlikely that that that Obama could talk

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.420 
unlikely that that that Obama could talk
that<00:00:33.899> guy<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.680> as<00:00:34.860> political<00:00:35.280> dirty

that guy to do it as political dirty
work<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.880> also<00:00:36.210> think<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.750> hindsight<00:00:36.930> with

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
work I also think now in hindsight with

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.740 
work I also think now in hindsight with
this<00:00:37.530> sort<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.829> idea<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.090> punish<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
this sort of idea that you punish the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
this sort of idea that you punish the
guy<00:00:40.050> after<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> guy<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:41.070> should<00:00:41.370> have

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
