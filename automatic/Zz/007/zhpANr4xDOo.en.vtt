let's see last hm in this area in the
region<00:00:58.760> I'm<00:00:59.760> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.629> replace<00:01:01.230> from<00:01:02.160> finish

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
region I'm going to replace from finish

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.320

actually<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.659> problem<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.140> me<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> often<00:01:16.560> I'm<00:01:17.360> i

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
actually a problem for me I often I'm i

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.080 
actually a problem for me I often I'm i
often<00:01:19.380> am<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.740> trouble<00:01:20.159> getting<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.729> ice

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
often am more trouble getting out of ice

often am more trouble getting out of ice
buzzes<00:01:21.540> than<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.380> getting<00:01:23.369> through<00:01:23.939> them

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
buzzes than I do getting through them

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.010 
buzzes than I do getting through them
that<00:01:25.619> makes<00:01:25.799> any<00:01:25.920> sense<00:01:26.600> like<00:01:27.600> getting<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that makes any sense like getting to a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
that makes any sense like getting to a
place<00:01:28.200> getting<00:01:28.740> back<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.130> often<00:01:29.490> harder<00:01:29.820> for

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
place getting back is often harder for

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.380 
place getting back is often harder for
me<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:32.210> pushing<00:01:33.210> boulders<00:01:33.829> puzzle

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
me now this is a pushing boulders puzzle

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.770 
me now this is a pushing boulders puzzle

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
no member of seafoam back in campo so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.960 
no member of seafoam back in campo so
let's<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:41.299> do<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:45.110> we<00:01:46.110> might<00:01:46.290> actually

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
let's have we do this we might actually

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.130 
let's have we do this we might actually
like<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:50.180> yeah<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:53.630> hey<00:01:54.630> max

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
like that yeah that's right hey max

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.289 
like that yeah that's right hey max
repel<00:01:55.500> Donna<00:01:55.939> somewhere<00:01:56.939> down<00:01:57.469> yeah<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.670> this

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
repel Donna somewhere down yeah and this

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.700 
repel Donna somewhere down yeah and this
is<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.479> easier<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.229> without<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
is actually easier to do without the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.030 
is actually easier to do without the
bike<00:02:02.329> just<00:02:03.329> gets<00:02:03.570> good<00:02:03.869> more<00:02:04.049> control<00:02:04.320> easier

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
bike just gets good more control easier

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.310 
bike just gets good more control easier
to<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.280> when<00:02:05.310> you're<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.990> mega

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to do when you're not going to like mega

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.420 
to do when you're not going to like mega
speed<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.920> hang<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.629> know<00:02:10.430> just

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
speed like hang on but you know just

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.610 
speed like hang on but you know just
this<00:02:11.819> way

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
this way

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.990 
this way
you<00:02:14.620> don't<00:02:14.890> want<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.160> shove<00:02:15.310> into<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:15.610> corner

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
you don't want to shove into a corner

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.760 
you don't want to shove into a corner
like<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.210> place<00:02:16.690> or<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.320> place<00:02:17.500> right<00:02:17.710> there

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
like this place or the place right there

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.650 
like this place or the place right there
like<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.970> don't<00:02:19.060> want<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.300> have<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.480> here

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
like you don't want to have it here

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.120 
like you don't want to have it here
because<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.260> can't<00:02:20.470> get<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.710> out<00:02:20.770> basically

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
because you can't get it out basically

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.900 
because you can't get it out basically
and<00:02:22.030> now<00:02:22.120> we<00:02:22.180> do<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:23.070> on<00:02:24.070> purpose<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.610> pushing

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
and now we do that on purpose of pushing

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.940 
and now we do that on purpose of pushing
these<00:02:25.000> boulders<00:02:25.450> will<00:02:26.080> be<00:02:26.380> revealed<00:02:26.710> very

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
these boulders will be revealed very

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.270 
these boulders will be revealed very

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
RPGs when there is a boulder you push it

RPGs when there is a boulder you push it
always<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:38.760> there<00:02:39.870> around<00:02:41.940> then<00:02:42.940> get<00:02:43.330> that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
always and there around then get that

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.520 
always and there around then get that
one<00:02:43.720> here<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.230> we<00:02:44.470> couldn't<00:02:44.770> push<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.280> before

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
one here that we couldn't push it before

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.680 
one here that we couldn't push it before
actually<00:02:47.530> probably<00:02:47.710> cut<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:47.950> bad<00:02:48.130> enough<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
actually probably cut a bad enough and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.060 
actually probably cut a bad enough and
item<00:02:52.690> over<00:02:52.930> here<00:02:53.200> I'll<00:02:53.830> might<00:02:54.550> use<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> pinch
