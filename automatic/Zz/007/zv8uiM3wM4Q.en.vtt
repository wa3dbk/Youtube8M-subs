in issue be dealers today I'm gonna show

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.160 
in issue be dealers today I'm gonna show
you<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.259> draw<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.799> clone<00:00:05.520> real<00:00:06.359> easy<00:00:06.810> well

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
you how to draw a clone real easy well

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.070 
you how to draw a clone real easy well
it's<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.189> world<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:09.150> little<00:00:09.450> plinth<00:00:09.750> thing

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
it's the world on a little plinth thing

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.140 
it's the world on a little plinth thing
isn't<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.160> world<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.550> round<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.030> you

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
isn't it so the world is round so you

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150 
isn't it so the world is round so you
need<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> draw<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> circle<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.320> you're<00:00:14.009> going

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
need to draw a circle and you're going

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.129 
need to draw a circle and you're going
to<00:00:14.190> have<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:15.210> North<00:00:15.480> Pole<00:00:15.750> because<00:00:15.870> it's

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
to have the North Pole because it's

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.779 
to have the North Pole because it's
tilted<00:00:16.619> isn't<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.160> if<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.340> imagined<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
tilted isn't it so if you imagined the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.500 
tilted isn't it so if you imagined the
axis<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.920> it's<00:00:19.920> kind<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> running<00:00:20.490> there<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
axis but it's kind of running there and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.120 
axis but it's kind of running there and
then<00:00:21.630> maybe<00:00:21.810> you're<00:00:21.990> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.500> kind<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
then maybe you're going to see kind of a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.009 
then maybe you're going to see kind of a
South<00:00:23.460> Pole<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.300> maybe<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.630> bit<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
South Pole there and maybe a bit of the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.259 
South Pole there and maybe a bit of the
North<00:00:25.230> Pole<00:00:25.500> at<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> top<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.119> you're

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
North Pole at the top and then you're

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.859 
North Pole at the top and then you're
going<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:27.800> you're<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.160> one

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
going to get you're going to get one

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.209 
going to get you're going to get one
kind<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.170> coming<00:00:31.410> straight<00:00:31.740> down<00:00:31.800> like

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
kind of like coming straight down like

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.959 
kind of like coming straight down like
that<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:33.510> they're<00:00:33.719> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.020> start

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
that and then they're going to start

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.650 
that and then they're going to start
kind<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.079> getting<00:00:37.969> like<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.329> aren't<00:00:39.570> they

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
kind of getting like that aren't they

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200 
kind of getting like that aren't they
can<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> melon<00:00:40.440> slices<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:41.910> doing<00:00:42.030> this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
can the melon slices so I'm doing this

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.400 
can the melon slices so I'm doing this
really<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.750> quickly

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
really really quickly

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.430 
really really quickly
and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:44.520> again<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.629> you're<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.350> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
and then again here you're not going to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.630 
and then again here you're not going to
get<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.829> straight<00:00:47.129> across<00:00:47.250> because

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
get one going straight across because

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
get one going straight across because
but<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.570> kind<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.840> in

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
but you're going to get one kind of in

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.299 
but you're going to get one kind of in
the<00:00:49.079> middle<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.860> will<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the middle and so this will be the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.700 
the middle and so this will be the
equator<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.170> tilted<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
equator and because it's tilted that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.580 
equator and because it's tilted that
will<00:00:53.100> be<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:54.300> an<00:00:54.449> angle<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.320> so

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
will be going at an angle like that so

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.170 
will be going at an angle like that so
though<00:00:55.800> these<00:00:56.100> those<00:00:56.460> these<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> lines

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
though these those these are the lines

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.000 
though these those these are the lines
of<00:00:57.329> latitude<00:00:57.449> only<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.410> right<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.859> they

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
of latitude only that's right so they

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.689 
of latitude only that's right so they
will<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.340> going<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.489> these<00:01:02.489> will

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
will be going like that and these will

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.479 
will be going like that and these will
be<00:01:02.730> coming<00:01:03.090> more<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.329> more<00:01:04.280> kind<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
be coming more and more kind of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.100 
be coming more and more kind of
elliptical<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.540> come<00:01:06.720> down<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
elliptical as you come down to the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.109 
elliptical as you come down to the
bottom<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:08.070> means<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.670> you're<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.030> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
bottom which means then you're going to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.960 
bottom which means then you're going to
have<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> bit<00:01:09.510> sticking<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:10.020> there<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.790> it's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
have a bit sticking out there and it's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
have a bit sticking out there and it's
kind<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> kind<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.420> come<00:01:12.630> around<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.560> back

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
kind of kind of come around the back

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.429 
kind of kind of come around the back
there<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.030> imagine<00:01:15.330> them<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.200> can't

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
there so you can imagine them you can't

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
there so you can imagine them you can't
roll<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.920> way<00:01:17.100> through<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> bit

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
roll all the way through this is the bit

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.710 
roll all the way through this is the bit
that<00:01:18.240> sort<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> holes<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> whole<00:01:19.229> thing<00:01:19.439> on

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
that sort of holes the whole thing on

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.200 
that sort of holes the whole thing on
and<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.869> will<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.290> more<00:01:23.009> solid<00:01:23.490> there<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and that will be more solid there and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
and that will be more solid there and
you'll<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.720> end<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.850> there's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
you'll see the end of it there there's

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
you'll see the end of it there there's
the<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.570> sticks<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.560> here's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the bit that it all sticks on and here's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
the bit that it all sticks on and here's
a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.220> bit<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:31.970> that<00:01:32.970> holds<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.390> onto

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
a little bit that it that holds it onto

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.740 
a little bit that it that holds it onto
the<00:01:33.750> table<00:01:36.049> now<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.470> live<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> UK<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:39.240> you

there
we're<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:48.840> United<00:01:49.290> States<00:01:49.500> of

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
we're going to get United States of

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.860 
we're going to get United States of
America<00:01:50.190> or<00:01:50.280> South<00:01:50.460> America<00:01:51.060> showing<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.570> like

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
America or South America showing up like

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.230 
America or South America showing up like
that<00:01:52.110> there<00:01:52.650> I<00:01:53.040> always<00:01:53.610> say<00:01:53.790> what's<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that there I always say what's the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.550 
that there I always say what's the
nearest<00:01:54.510> thing<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:54.720> me<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.230> think<00:01:55.290> it's

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
nearest thing to me and I think it's

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.990 
nearest thing to me and I think it's
going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.010> little<00:01:56.220> bit<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.760> which

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
going to be that little bit there which

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.770 
going to be that little bit there which
will<00:01:57.270> then<00:01:57.450> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.350> go<00:01:58.530> off<00:01:58.760> there<00:01:59.760> and<00:02:00.120> then

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
will then kind of go off there and then

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.720 
will then kind of go off there and then
I<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.050> put<00:02:01.440> in<00:02:01.620> the<00:02:01.740> little<00:02:01.950> pin<00:02:02.190> which<00:02:02.370> holds

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
I can put in the little pin which holds

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.800 
I can put in the little pin which holds
the<00:02:02.850> globe<00:02:03.120> into<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:04.110> South<00:02:04.440> Pole<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.570> then<00:02:06.570> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the globe into the South Pole and then I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.410 
the globe into the South Pole and then I
can<00:02:06.990> go<00:02:07.140> around<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.650> draw<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.630> globe<00:02:11.420> not

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
can go around and draw the globe not

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.710 
can go around and draw the globe not
very<00:02:12.690> round<00:02:12.990> as<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.740> quite<00:02:13.950> hard<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.720> to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
very round as it is is quite hard to to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.620 
very round as it is is quite hard to to
draw<00:02:15.930> from<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> angle<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.710> I'm<00:02:17.390> sitting<00:02:18.390> it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
draw from the angle that I'm sitting it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.930 
draw from the angle that I'm sitting it
because<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.320> can't<00:02:20.010> actually<00:02:20.220> look<00:02:20.580> right

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
because I I can't actually look right

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.870 
because I I can't actually look right
over<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.540> top<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.780> my<00:02:22.050> drawing<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:23.100> then<00:02:23.520> from

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
over the top of my drawing and then from

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.100 
over the top of my drawing and then from
that<00:02:23.910> point<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.600> you're<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:24.870> going<00:02:25.050> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that point then you're just going to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.820 
that point then you're just going to
keep<00:02:25.320> drawing<00:02:25.590> these<00:02:27.170> curves<00:02:28.170> these<00:02:28.500> kind<00:02:28.740> of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
keep drawing these curves these kind of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.620 
keep drawing these curves these kind of
melon<00:02:29.310> slices<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> world<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.580> they<00:02:33.210> get<00:02:33.450> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
melon slices on the world and they get a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.040 
melon slices on the world and they get a
little<00:02:33.750> bigger<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.350> bigger<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.710> bigger<00:02:36.050> and

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
little bigger and bigger and bigger and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.130 
little bigger and bigger and bigger and
one<00:02:37.350> more<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.730> which<00:02:39.540> means<00:02:39.720> then<00:02:39.960> that

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
one more like that which means then that

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.530 
one more like that which means then that
this<00:02:40.650> can<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.130> curve<00:02:41.670> around<00:02:41.880> there<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.480> you

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
this can then curve around there and you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.850 
this can then curve around there and you
will<00:02:42.750> want<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.930> see<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.110> little<00:02:43.230> bit<00:02:43.470> coming

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
will want to see a little bit coming

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.640 
will want to see a little bit coming
down<00:02:44.130> there<00:02:44.400> now<00:02:45.300> on<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.050> top<00:02:46.290> you've<00:02:46.500> got<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
down there now on the top you've got a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.220 
down there now on the top you've got a
similar<00:02:47.040> thing<00:02:47.310> happening<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.240> that<00:02:48.900> will<00:02:49.080> go

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
similar thing happening and that will go

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.380 
similar thing happening and that will go
down<00:02:49.440> there<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.250> will<00:02:50.490> go<00:02:50.670> down<00:02:51.060> there

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
down there and that will go down there

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.699 
down there and that will go down there
and<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.930> want<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.110> see<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> little<00:02:52.470> bit

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
and then you want to see a little bit

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.790 
and then you want to see a little bit
because<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.780> pin<00:02:55.020> will<00:02:55.230> come<00:02:55.410> up<00:02:55.560> there

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
because that the pin will come up there

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.620 
because that the pin will come up there
and<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.220> will<00:02:56.340> see<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.970> little<00:02:57.209> bit<00:02:57.330> like<00:02:57.450> that

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
and you will see a little bit like that

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.520 
and you will see a little bit like that
which<00:02:57.780> kind<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.050> slides<00:02:58.320> down<00:02:58.590> there<00:03:00.530> but

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
which kind of slides down there but

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.750 
which kind of slides down there but
sticks<00:03:01.860> into<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.340> little<00:03:02.790> stand<00:03:04.520> which<00:03:05.520> will

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
sticks into the little stand which will

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.470 
sticks into the little stand which will
look<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.150> that<00:03:06.920> on<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.340> table<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:09.000> then<00:03:09.360> we

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
look like that on the table and then we

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.400 
look like that on the table and then we
want<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.720> put<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.170> lines<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.620> latitude<00:03:10.770> in<00:03:12.410> and

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
want to put the lines of latitude in and

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.710 
want to put the lines of latitude in and
you<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.770> take<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:13.980> lot<00:03:14.520> more<00:03:14.580> time<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.209> carry

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
you can take a lot more time and carry

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.640 
you can take a lot more time and carry
over<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:18.150> maybe<00:03:18.530> show<00:03:19.530> me
