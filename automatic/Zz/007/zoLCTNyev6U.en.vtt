which<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.990> up<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.710> coming<00:00:11.059> and<00:00:12.080> expected<00:00:13.080> that

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
which is up and coming and expected that

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.220 
which is up and coming and expected that
the<00:00:13.500> twenty<00:00:13.920> first<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.400> May<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.420> there<00:00:16.170> are

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
the twenty first of May and there are

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.260 
the twenty first of May and there are
some<00:00:16.379> major<00:00:16.560> changes<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:17.490> PvP<00:00:17.970> players

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
some major changes for PvP players

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.279 
some major changes for PvP players
probably<00:00:18.869> also<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.939> DVD<00:00:20.939> players<00:00:21.210> but<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.779> know

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
probably also for DVD players but I know

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
probably also for DVD players but I know
crap<00:00:22.560> about<00:00:22.619> PvE<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> let's<00:00:24.090> move<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.779> to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
crap about PvE so and let's move on to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.970 
crap about PvE so and let's move on to
PvP<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:26.779> first<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:28.019> that's<00:00:28.170> important<00:00:28.830> is

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
PvP and first thing that's important is

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.849 
PvP and first thing that's important is
the<00:00:29.189> base<00:00:29.460> resilience<00:00:30.240> all<00:00:30.840> players<00:00:31.289> will<00:00:31.650> get

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the base resilience all players will get

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.220 
the base resilience all players will get
a<00:00:32.070> base<00:00:32.460> resilience<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.149> sixty-five<00:00:33.899> percent

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
a base resilience of sixty-five percent

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.000 
a base resilience of sixty-five percent
and<00:00:34.800> all<00:00:35.550> gear<00:00:35.960> or<00:00:36.960> all<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.380> resilience<00:00:37.829> on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and all gear or all the resilience on

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.860 
and all gear or all the resilience on
Okia<00:00:38.399> will<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.910> removed<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.570> would

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
Okia will be removed and so you would

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
Okia will be removed and so you would
say<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.829> could<00:00:44.040> jam<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:44.670> extra

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
say well you could jam some extra

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.020 
say well you could jam some extra
resilience<00:00:45.750> or<00:00:46.020> maybe<00:00:46.590> pvp<00:00:47.160> power<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
resilience or maybe pvp power and to

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.389 
resilience or maybe pvp power and to
compensate<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.950> problem<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
compensate for this and the problem is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.900 
compensate for this and the problem is
all<00:00:51.120> gems<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.899> people<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.559> found<00:00:52.910> or

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
all gems that have people be found or

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.170 
all gems that have people be found or
PvP<00:00:54.570> resilience<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.649> reduced<00:00:56.160> by<00:00:56.370> fifty

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
PvP resilience will be reduced by fifty

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.709 
PvP resilience will be reduced by fifty
percent<00:00:57.510> yes<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.859> quite<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.609> bit<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
percent yes that's quite a bit so if you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.460 
percent yes that's quite a bit so if you
usually<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> gem<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:03.149> 140<00:01:03.989> resilience

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
usually have a gem to 140 resilience

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.840 
usually have a gem to 140 resilience
it's<00:01:04.769> now<00:01:05.510> 120<00:01:06.510> resilience<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:08.460> when<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it's now 120 resilience that is when the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's now 120 resilience that is when the
patch<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> same<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.799> true<00:01:11.520> form<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:12.030> pvp

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
patch is the same is for true form a pvp

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.580 
patch is the same is for true form a pvp
power<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.470> jammed<00:01:13.950> full<00:01:14.250> pvp<00:01:14.640> power

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
power so if you jammed full pvp power

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
power so if you jammed full pvp power
you<00:01:16.590> will<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:17.070> surprised<00:01:17.520> how<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.090> damage

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you will be surprised how little damage

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
you will be surprised how little damage
you<00:01:18.750> will<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.060> thought<00:01:21.650> why<00:01:22.650> not<00:01:22.710> do

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
you will do and so I thought why not do

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.690 
you will do and so I thought why not do
some<00:01:23.250> number<00:01:23.640> crunching<00:01:24.500> on<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> public<00:01:26.369> test

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
some number crunching on a public test

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.300 
some number crunching on a public test
room<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.299> that's<00:01:27.540> where<00:01:27.900> i<00:01:27.930> am<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.189> can

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
room so that's where i am now as you can

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
room so that's where i am now as you can
see<00:01:29.369> some<00:01:29.579> stuff<00:01:30.240> changed<00:01:30.750> already<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:31.350> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
but you get loads of money by just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.310 
but you get loads of money by just

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
creating a kak but only don't get to all

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.550 
creating a kak but only don't get to all
kinds<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.710> gems<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:00.380> essences<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.610> dusts<00:02:03.560> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
kinds of gems and essences and dusts to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.150 
kinds of gems and essences and dusts to
test<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:05.100> what's<00:02:05.460> pack<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.939> good<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.509> and

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
test out what's pack is good for you and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.059 
test out what's pack is good for you and
if<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.280> need<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> reforge<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.300> job

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
if you need to reforge your job

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.790 
if you need to reforge your job
literally<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:12.630> it's<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.959> little<00:02:12.989> girl<00:02:13.440> what<00:02:13.650> on

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
literally so it's a little girl what on

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.289 
literally so it's a little girl what on
it<00:02:15.019> didn't<00:02:16.019> take<00:02:16.200> very<00:02:16.230> long<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:18.269> that

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
it didn't take very long and to see that

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.050 
it didn't take very long and to see that
jamming<00:02:19.260> pvp<00:02:19.830> power<00:02:19.860> or<00:02:20.340> resilience<00:02:20.730> is

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
jamming pvp power or resilience is

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.220 
jamming pvp power or resilience is
extremely<00:02:22.019> expensive<00:02:22.440> now<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.900> did

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
extremely expensive now and so I did

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.800 
extremely expensive now and so I did
something<00:02:25.620> different<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:26.310> use<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.180> wear<00:02:27.480> gem

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
something different I use you wear gem

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.630 
something different I use you wear gem
quite<00:02:28.170> some<00:02:28.380> resilience<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.519> I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730

here<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:30.310> isn't<00:03:30.670> 250<00:03:31.630> resilience<00:03:32.080> anymore

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.970 
and then there are the blue sockets and
I've<00:04:14.350> put<00:04:14.709> this<00:04:15.160> jamming<00:04:15.670> it<00:04:15.790> will<00:04:16.090> hit<00:04:16.390> and

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
I've put this jamming it will hit and

I've put this jamming it will hit and
this<00:04:17.980> may<00:04:18.220> be<00:04:18.940> weird<00:04:19.480> and<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.080> might<00:04:20.560> see<00:04:21.220> this

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
purple one sooo so I went for this maybe

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.250 
purple one sooo so I went for this maybe
even<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.790> green<00:04:34.000> ones<00:04:34.240> my<00:04:34.660> blue<00:04:34.870> green<00:04:35.080> ones

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
even the green ones my blue green ones

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.050 
even the green ones my blue green ones
can<00:04:35.470> fit<00:04:35.680> in<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:35.950> but<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.310> checked<00:04:36.640> them<00:04:36.880> and

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
can fit in it but I checked them and

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.970 
can fit in it but I checked them and
they<00:04:37.150> also<00:04:37.330> suck<00:04:38.040> this<00:04:39.040> was<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.310> only<00:04:39.460> one

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
they also suck this was the only one

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.000 
they also suck this was the only one
without<00:04:41.980> any<00:04:42.370> job<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:42.940> would<00:04:43.480> choose<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:44.010> go

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
without any job I would choose to go

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.010 
without any job I would choose to go
into<00:04:45.190> a<00:04:45.310> blue<00:04:45.580> soft<00:04:45.910> I've<00:04:46.330> three<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.840> them

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
into a blue soft I've three of them

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.570 
into a blue soft I've three of them
every<00:04:47.950> PvP<00:04:48.460> sat<00:04:48.730> has<00:04:48.970> three<00:04:49.420> blue<00:04:49.690> sockets<00:04:50.140> and

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
every PvP sat has three blue sockets and

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.180 
every PvP sat has three blue sockets and
this<00:04:51.580> allows<00:04:51.850> me<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.180> following<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:53.160> get<00:04:54.160> a

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
this allows me the following I get a

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.480 
this allows me the following I get a
nice<00:04:54.490> six<00:04:55.180> point<00:04:55.720> seven<00:04:56.320> percent<00:04:56.890> six<00:04:57.190> point

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
nice six point seven percent six point

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.730 
nice six point seven percent six point
zero<00:04:57.580> seven<00:04:58.120> percent<00:04:58.660> hit<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.140> it's<00:04:59.410> pretty

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
zero seven percent hit and it's pretty

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.159 
zero seven percent hit and it's pretty
much<00:04:59.860> yeah<00:05:00.160> well<00:05:00.610> does<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.000> get<00:05:01.210> better<00:05:01.480> than

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
much yeah well does it get better than

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.970

reforged from craigs to eat a mastery or
haste<00:05:31.999> depending<00:05:32.999> on<00:05:32.999> what's<00:05:33.749> that<00:05:34.019> is<00:05:34.199> on<00:05:34.349> the

gear so if I can reforge the wall street
I<00:05:36.869> go<00:05:37.199> to<00:05:37.259> mastery<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:37.889> else<00:05:38.189> I<00:05:38.399> go<00:05:38.669> to<00:05:38.729> haste

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
I go to mastery and else I go to haste

fifty percent and as a frost bombs back
that<00:05:53.429> really<00:05:53.999> hurts<00:05:54.179> people<00:05:54.709> may<00:05:55.709> geez<00:05:55.949> do<00:05:56.159> get

that really hurts people may geez do get

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:59.779 
that really hurts people may geez do get

what you had done again to jump PB power
the<00:06:27.899> same<00:06:28.139> is<00:06:28.169> true<00:06:28.319> for<00:06:28.469> resilience<00:06:29.099> it's<00:06:29.309> so

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
the same is true for resilience it's so

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.029 
the same is true for resilience it's so
expensive<00:06:30.029> right<00:06:30.659> I'd<00:06:30.959> rather<00:06:31.199> go<00:06:31.469> go<00:06:31.800> for

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
expensive right I'd rather go go for

expensive right I'd rather go go for
some<00:06:32.309> more<00:06:32.490> damaged<00:06:32.939> out<00:06:33.149> and<00:06:33.449> then<00:06:33.990> Gophers

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:34.679 
some more damaged out and then Gophers

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:38.170 
some more damaged out and then Gophers

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.540 

because<00:06:38.810> I<00:06:39.020> don't<00:06:39.500> think<00:06:39.680> it's<00:06:39.800> worth<00:06:40.070> it<00:06:40.250> but

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
because I don't think it's worth it but

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.800 
because I don't think it's worth it but
then<00:06:40.789> you<00:06:40.970> have<00:06:41.060> to<00:06:41.120> check<00:06:41.389> it<00:06:41.509> out<00:06:41.630> yourself

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
then you have to check it out yourself

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.050 
then you have to check it out yourself
at<00:06:42.590> least<00:06:42.650> for<00:06:43.009> a<00:06:43.039> false<00:06:43.310> marriage<00:06:43.580> is<00:06:43.910> the

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
at least for a false marriage is the

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.960 
at least for a false marriage is the
first<00:06:44.419> problems<00:06:44.810> back<00:06:45.080> this<00:06:45.740> is<00:06:45.919> how<00:06:46.430> I<00:06:46.460> will

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
first problems back this is how I will

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.080 
first problems back this is how I will
do<00:06:47.120> it<00:06:47.830> and<00:06:48.830> if<00:06:49.130> I<00:06:49.250> get<00:06:49.400> slaughtered<00:06:49.699> I

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
do it and if I get slaughtered I

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.200 
do it and if I get slaughtered I
probably<00:06:50.449> go<00:06:50.780> for<00:06:50.960> resilience<00:06:51.470> again<00:06:51.740> but<00:06:52.210> for

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
probably go for resilience again but for

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.150 
probably go for resilience again but for
the<00:06:53.300> moment<00:06:53.330> it<00:06:54.199> doesn't<00:06:54.410> look<00:06:54.650> like<00:06:54.710> it<00:06:55.130> will

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
the moment it doesn't look like it will

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.300 
the moment it doesn't look like it will
be<00:06:55.550> like<00:06:55.729> that<00:06:56.500> alright<00:06:57.500> see<00:06:57.979> you<00:06:58.039> around<00:06:58.100> guys
