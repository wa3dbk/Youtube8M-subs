all Parcells like violent being two
floors<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.210> we<00:02:24.390> thought<00:02:24.570> last<00:02:24.960> no<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.620> a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
floors here we thought last no it's a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.380 
floors here we thought last no it's a
castle<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.550> got<00:02:26.700> rid<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> floor<00:02:27.180> here

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
castle so we got rid of the floor here

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.080

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
maybe just one big room feels a bit more

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.330 
maybe just one big room feels a bit more
like<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> castle<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.930> feels<00:02:31.200> much<00:02:31.530> better<00:02:31.770> yeah
