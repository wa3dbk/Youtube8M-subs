carries a limited number of misses no so

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.390 
carries a limited number of misses no so
oh<00:01:07.990> that's<00:01:08.990> pretty<00:01:09.170> fast<00:01:09.590> but<00:01:09.770> still<00:01:10.130> sucks

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
oh that's pretty fast but still sucks

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.950 
oh that's pretty fast but still sucks
anyway<00:01:11.270> here's<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.990> why<00:01:12.320> way<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:14.420> y-wing<00:01:14.930> is

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
anyway here's the why way the y-wing is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.080 
anyway here's the why way the y-wing is
the<00:01:15.230> workhorse<00:01:15.470> of<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.950> rebel<00:01:16.220> fleet<00:01:16.430> it's

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
the workhorse of the rebel fleet it's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.000 
the workhorse of the rebel fleet it's
not<00:01:17.330> quick<00:01:17.630> or<00:01:17.840> flashy<00:01:18.110> but<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.560> gets<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.890> job

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
not quick or flashy but it gets the job

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.910 
not quick or flashy but it gets the job
done<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:20.300> earner<00:01:20.479> on<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.930> ship<00:01:21.200> is<00:01:21.350> extensive

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
done the earner on the ship is extensive

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.500 
done the earner on the ship is extensive
and<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.340> shields<00:01:22.729> will<00:01:22.880> protect<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.360> from

just about anything which is good

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.940 
just about anything which is good
because<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.479> won't<00:01:26.660> be<00:01:26.810> going<00:01:26.990> anywhere<00:01:27.260> fast
