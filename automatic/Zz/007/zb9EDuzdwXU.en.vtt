basically designed for m2ts files or
m2ts<00:01:46.259> files<00:01:46.290> yes<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> yeah<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:48.750> probably

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
m2ts files yes so yeah that's probably

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.980 
m2ts files yes so yeah that's probably
one<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> front<00:01:51.149> most<00:01:51.360> frustrating<00:01:51.810> things

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
one of the front most frustrating things

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.389 
one of the front most frustrating things
that's<00:01:52.140> ever<00:01:52.200> happened<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.649> me<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.310> the

that's ever happened to me but at the
same<00:01:53.610> time<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.149> probably<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> easiest

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
same time as it was probably the easiest

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.469 
same time as it was probably the easiest
things<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> fix<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:56.430> yeah<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> problem<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.180> you

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
was the end of the game but yeah what I

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.140 
was the end of the game but yeah what I
mean<00:05:27.889> I<00:05:28.009> joined<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.400> game<00:05:28.580> and<00:05:28.819> that's<00:05:28.940> how<00:05:29.120> i

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
mean I joined the game and that's how i

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.809 
mean I joined the game and that's how i
did<00:05:29.330> it<00:05:29.479> i<00:05:29.719> got<00:05:30.469> i<00:05:30.529> think<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.889> quick<00:05:31.130> seven<00:05:31.550> kills

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
did it i got i think a quick seven kills

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.629 
did it i got i think a quick seven kills
and<00:05:32.590> that's<00:05:33.590> how<00:05:33.770> i<00:05:33.800> feel<00:05:34.099> you<00:05:34.250> should<00:05:34.430> start

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
and that's how i feel you should start

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.629 
and that's how i feel you should start
off<00:05:34.729> every<00:05:35.060> game<00:05:35.240> i<00:05:35.800> immediately<00:05:36.800> got<00:05:36.979> my<00:05:37.250> UAV

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
off every game i immediately got my UAV

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.800 
off every game i immediately got my UAV
put<00:05:37.909> it<00:05:38.000> up<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.300> then<00:05:38.389> I<00:05:38.479> got<00:05:38.630> my<00:05:38.840> chopper<00:05:39.620> I

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
put it up and then I got my chopper I

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.050 
put it up and then I got my chopper I
found<00:05:41.810> that<00:05:42.380> that's<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.099> style<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.819> that's

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
found that that's the style and that's

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.980 
found that that's the style and that's
the<00:05:44.840> tattoo<00:05:45.050> so<00:05:45.349> i'm<00:05:45.440> going<00:05:45.529> to<00:05:45.620> use<00:05:45.740> on<00:05:45.889> summit

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
the tattoo so i'm going to use on summit

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.140 
the tattoo so i'm going to use on summit
44<00:05:47.990> first<00:05:48.229> of<00:05:48.349> all<00:05:48.500> like<00:05:48.650> i'm<00:05:49.340> sure<00:05:49.550> other<00:05:49.880> maps

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
44 first of all like i'm sure other maps

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.730 
44 first of all like i'm sure other maps
have<00:05:50.389> different<00:05:50.659> strategies<00:05:51.080> but<00:05:51.259> on<00:05:51.380> summit

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
have different strategies but on summit

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.709 
have different strategies but on summit
that's<00:05:51.860> how<00:05:52.069> i<00:05:52.099> find<00:05:52.490> that<00:05:52.639> it<00:05:52.759> works<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.659> then

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
that's how i find that it works and then

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.610 
that's how i find that it works and then
this<00:05:54.440> gameplay<00:05:54.680> here<00:05:55.250> is<00:05:55.569> on<00:05:56.569> what<00:05:57.319> the<00:05:57.440> hell

scoreboard this is because I found it

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.129

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.119 
button has jump or something adjust it
it's<00:06:23.569> an<00:06:23.750> awkward<00:06:24.080> position<00:06:24.379> for<00:06:24.889> it<00:06:24.949> to<00:06:25.039> be

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
it's an awkward position for it to be

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.939 
it's an awkward position for it to be
jump<00:06:25.400> but<00:06:26.210> since<00:06:26.419> I<00:06:26.569> do<00:06:26.629> play<00:06:26.960> on<00:06:27.080> tactical<00:06:27.620> and

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
jump but since I do play on tactical and

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.159 
jump but since I do play on tactical and
I<00:06:28.460> do<00:06:28.520> have<00:06:28.759> to<00:06:28.819> let<00:06:29.029> go<00:06:29.090> the<00:06:29.389> analog<00:06:29.779> stick<00:06:29.810> to

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 
I do have to let go the analog stick to

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.010 
I do have to let go the analog stick to
press<00:06:30.349> B<00:06:30.529> to<00:06:30.560> knife<00:06:30.860> I<00:06:31.190> found<00:06:31.879> that<00:06:32.210> this<00:06:32.719> way<00:06:32.990> I

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
press B to knife I found that this way I

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.680 
press B to knife I found that this way I
can<00:06:33.680> I<00:06:34.099> don't<00:06:34.820> have<00:06:34.909> to<00:06:35.029> take<00:06:35.180> my<00:06:35.360> finger<00:06:35.659> off

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
can I don't have to take my finger off

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.340 
can I don't have to take my finger off

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
the joystick to be able to knife someone

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.860 
the joystick to be able to knife someone
so<00:06:39.250> yeah<00:06:39.400> it's<00:06:39.580> helped<00:06:39.790> me<00:06:39.820> out<00:06:39.880> a<00:06:39.970> lot<00:06:40.060> I<00:06:40.480> do

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
so yeah it's helped me out a lot I do

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.210 
so yeah it's helped me out a lot I do
have<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:41.260> get<00:06:41.440> used<00:06:41.590> to<00:06:41.740> the<00:06:41.830> controller

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
have to get used to the controller

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.940 
have to get used to the controller
because<00:06:42.820> it's<00:06:43.270> it's<00:06:43.660> a<00:06:43.780> lot<00:06:44.080> different<00:06:44.260> iced

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
because it's it's a lot different iced

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.970 
because it's it's a lot different iced
teas<00:06:45.250> FPS<00:06:45.790> freeks<00:06:46.120> on<00:06:46.300> the<00:06:46.390> Xbox<00:06:46.870> but<00:06:47.830> with

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
teas FPS freeks on the Xbox but with

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.530 
teas FPS freeks on the Xbox but with
this<00:06:48.100> controller<00:06:48.550> I<00:06:48.640> don't<00:06:48.880> find<00:06:49.210> that<00:06:49.300> you

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
this controller I don't find that you

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.360 
this controller I don't find that you
need<00:06:50.020> it<00:06:50.200> because<00:06:50.410> you<00:06:50.680> have<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:50.920> adjustable

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
need it because you have the adjustable

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.010 
need it because you have the adjustable
sensitivity<00:06:51.580> on<00:06:52.090> the<00:06:52.300> controller<00:06:52.660> sticks

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
sensitivity on the controller sticks

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.020 
sensitivity on the controller sticks
which<00:06:53.920> is<00:06:54.130> probably<00:06:54.490> one<00:06:54.700> of<00:06:54.730> the<00:06:54.850> best

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
which is probably one of the best

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.700 
which is probably one of the best
features<00:06:55.240> i<00:06:55.540> think<00:06:55.840> i<00:06:55.960> play<00:06:56.170> on<00:06:56.260> the<00:06:56.380> loosest

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
features i think i play on the loosest

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.610 
features i think i play on the loosest
sensitivity<00:06:57.340> you<00:06:57.460> can<00:06:57.610> get<00:06:57.960> and<00:06:58.960> just<00:06:59.200> the<00:06:59.470> way

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
sensitivity you can get and just the way

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.160 
sensitivity you can get and just the way
I<00:06:59.650> that's<00:07:00.340> the<00:07:00.460> way<00:07:00.580> I<00:07:00.610> play<00:07:00.940> I<00:07:01.210> need<00:07:01.900> to<00:07:02.050> be

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.170 
I that's the way I play I need to be
