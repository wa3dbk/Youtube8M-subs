into that match coming into that match

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.460 
into that match coming into that match
it<00:00:14.490> kind<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.299> like<00:00:15.450> when<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.139> play

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
it kind of was just like when we play

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.170 
it kind of was just like when we play
we're<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.920> not<00:00:17.430> really<00:00:17.789> getting<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.060> hang

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
we're just not really getting the hang

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.700 
we're just not really getting the hang
of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> games<00:00:18.720> like<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.109> don't<00:00:19.230> play<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:19.590> well

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
of the games like we don't play as well

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.500 
of the games like we don't play as well
as<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:19.949> used<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.490> we're<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:20.820> well<00:00:21.420> this

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
as we used to so we're like well this

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.939 
as we used to so we're like well this
isn't<00:00:21.720> good<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.560> pretty<00:00:22.740> much

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
isn't good and then it was pretty much

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
isn't good and then it was pretty much
we<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:23.789> needed<00:00:24.029> more<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.750> playtime<00:00:25.109> I

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
we just needed more like playtime I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.900 
we just needed more like playtime I
guess<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:26.010> were<00:00:26.099> gonna<00:00:26.220> pretty<00:00:26.490> much<00:00:26.580> just

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
guess so we were gonna pretty much just

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.099 
guess so we were gonna pretty much just
say<00:00:27.060> hey<00:00:27.240> let's<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.599> take<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.810> day<00:00:27.930> off<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
say hey let's not take a day off and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.779 
say hey let's not take a day off and
let's<00:00:28.410> continue<00:00:28.680> by<00:00:29.070> if<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.279> did<00:00:29.460> lose<00:00:29.609> this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
let's continue by if we did lose this

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.089 
let's continue by if we did lose this
match<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.420> guess<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.349> pumped<00:00:31.830> everyone

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
match so I guess I like pumped everyone

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.150 
match so I guess I like pumped everyone
up<00:00:32.219> when<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.460> played<00:00:32.610> even<00:00:32.880> harder<00:00:33.149> today<00:00:34.160> so

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
up when we played even harder today so

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.590 
up when we played even harder today so
it's<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> noticed<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.390> like

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it's like what have you noticed as like

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360 
it's like what have you noticed as like
the<00:00:36.750> big<00:00:36.930> change<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.469> say<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.710> feel<00:00:38.160> off

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the big change like you say you feel off

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.590 
the big change like you say you feel off
like<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:38.790> playing<00:00:39.000> up<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> par<00:00:39.270> like

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
like you're not playing up to par like

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900 
like you're not playing up to par like
what's<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.200> wrong<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.800> feel<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.760> our

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
what's going wrong I feel like our

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.360 
what's going wrong I feel like our
biggest<00:00:42.180> strength<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.899> last<00:00:43.440> foot<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.950> we

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
biggest strength in a last foot was we

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.580 
biggest strength in a last foot was we
knew<00:00:44.579> how<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> meta<00:00:45.300> works<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> uh<00:00:45.840> like<00:00:46.440> what

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
knew how the meta works and uh like what

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.920 
knew how the meta works and uh like what
heroes<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.149> knew<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.690> could

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
heroes we we got we knew like it could

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.049 
heroes we we got we knew like it could
beat<00:00:49.050> anything<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.100> meta<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.579> think

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
beat anything and then this meta I think

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.119 
beat anything and then this meta I think
if<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> look<00:00:51.629> down<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.410> more<00:00:52.980> than

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
if you look down to it like more than

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.560 
if you look down to it like more than
plays<00:00:53.340> actually<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.059> pick<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> band

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
plays actually just like pick the band

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
plays actually just like pick the band
phase<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.960> think<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.739> accelerated

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
phase I think that's what we accelerated

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.650 
phase I think that's what we accelerated
at<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.579> now<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.210> we're<00:00:57.449> still

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
at and now going into this we're still

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.779 
at and now going into this we're still
learning<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.020> lot<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.500> our<00:00:58.739> pic<00:00:59.340> bands<00:00:59.579> are

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
learning a lot so our pic bands are

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
learning a lot so our pic bands are
really<00:01:00.329> shaky<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.750> moment<00:01:01.079> yeah<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
really shaky at the moment yeah and we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.840 
really shaky at the moment yeah and we
actually<00:01:01.890> haven't<00:01:02.160> gotten<00:01:02.340> much<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> chance

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
actually haven't gotten much of a chance

mid<00:01:20.340> late<00:01:20.520> game<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.119> could<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
mid late game we just could not in the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.350 
mid late game we just could not in the
game<00:01:21.990> right<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.650> we<00:01:23.130> decided<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> roll<00:01:23.820> swap<00:01:24.060> so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
game right so we decided to roll swap so

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.120 
game right so we decided to roll swap so
we<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:24.810> end<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> game<00:01:25.619> mid<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.979> late

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
we can actually end the game mid to late

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
we can actually end the game mid to late
game<00:01:26.310> which<00:01:26.939> has<00:01:27.090> been<00:01:27.240> playing<00:01:27.450> out<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
game which has been playing out but the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
game which has been playing out but the
problem<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.560> though<00:01:28.770> even<00:01:28.950> though<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.310> could

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
problem is though even though we could

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.940 
problem is though even though we could
improve<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.390> area<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.860> when<00:01:31.860> we

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
improve in that one area are when we

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.929 
improve in that one area are when we
first<00:01:32.130> started<00:01:32.220> playing<00:01:32.549> together<00:01:32.670> our

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
first started playing together our

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
first started playing together our
weakest<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.630> our<00:01:33.780> beginning<00:01:33.990> our<00:01:34.320> early<00:01:34.619> game

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
weakest was our beginning our early game

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
weakest was our beginning our early game
and<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.579> we've<00:01:35.759> been<00:01:35.880> lacking<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and now we've been lacking on that and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.780 
and now we've been lacking on that and
then<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.020> new<00:01:37.290> medic<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.650> min<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.009> we're<00:01:38.520> thinking

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
then a new medic a min so we're thinking

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.370 
then a new medic a min so we're thinking
about<00:01:38.850> what<00:01:39.150> heroes<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> play<00:01:40.170> our

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
about what heroes we like to play our

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
about what heroes we like to play our
champions<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:40.979> bed<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.490> we're<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.240> okay<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
champions my bed and we're like okay so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.210 
champions my bed and we're like okay so
what<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.290> want<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.590> play<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.950> then<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.189> just

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
what do we want to play and then we just

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.560 
what do we want to play and then we just
kept<00:01:44.670> picking<00:01:44.790> heroes<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.329> we're<00:01:45.479> like

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
kept picking heroes and then we're like

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
kept picking heroes and then we're like
well<00:01:46.049> they're<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.350> synergizing<00:01:47.040> while<00:01:47.159> at

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
well they're not synergizing while at

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.859 
well they're not synergizing while at
all<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.579> now<00:01:47.880> we're<00:01:48.090> playing<00:01:48.390> heroes<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.840> are

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
all so now we're playing heroes that are

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
all so now we're playing heroes that are
a<00:01:48.960> lot<00:01:49.079> stronger<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.799> synergizing<00:01:50.700> wall

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
a lot stronger and synergizing wall

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.550 
a lot stronger and synergizing wall
together<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.659> guys<00:01:51.810> consider<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.409> all

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
together have you guys consider that all

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.230 
together have you guys consider that all
may<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.040> swapping<00:01:53.340> back<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.790> 80<00:01:53.939> carrying

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
may be swapping back to 80 carrying

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.270 
may be swapping back to 80 carrying
jungle<00:01:54.570> or<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.200> better<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.979> way<00:01:56.159> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
jungle or is it just better this way in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.940 
jungle or is it just better this way in
the<00:01:56.340> long<00:01:56.490> run<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:57.290> believe<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.530> better<00:01:58.799> than

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the long run I believe it's better than

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.350 
the long run I believe it's better than
like<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> long<00:01:59.640> run<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.060> doubt

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
like this in the long run so I doubt

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389 
like this in the long run so I doubt
we'll<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.570> switching<00:02:00.930> back<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:01.409> anything<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
we'll be switching back if anything and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.649 
we'll be switching back if anything and
you<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:02.670> spoke<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> synergy<00:02:03.420> with

I know during the summer split Smith you
man<00:02:09.000> cloud<00:02:09.239> did<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.569> well<00:02:09.629> man<00:02:09.959> clad<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.319> a

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
man cloud did really well man clad was a

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.110 
man cloud did really well man clad was a
record<00:02:10.590> setter<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.099> kills<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.580> he's<00:02:11.670> having<00:02:11.849> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
record setter in kills and he's having a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.550 
record setter in kills and he's having a
much<00:02:12.629> worse<00:02:12.660> time

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
much worse time

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
much worse time
this<00:02:13.650> time<00:02:13.860> around<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.550> because

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
this time around is that just because

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.220 
this time around is that just because
you<00:02:15.209> work<00:02:15.360> better<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:15.690> Benny<00:02:15.930> or<00:02:16.080> what's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you work better with Benny or what's

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.470 
you work better with Benny or what's
going<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.739> your<00:02:17.099> mid<00:02:17.250> lane<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.640> well<00:02:18.239> i

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
going on in your mid lane here well i

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.150 
going on in your mid lane here well i
would<00:02:18.720> say<00:02:18.750> last<00:02:19.200> foot<00:02:19.470> come<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:19.950> one

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
would say last foot come here this one

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.339 
would say last foot come here this one
too<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.819> with<00:02:21.569> lots<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.870> tubers<00:02:22.170> one's

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
too is that a with lots of tubers one's

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.220 
too is that a with lots of tubers one's
going<00:02:22.739> down<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.400> would<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.780> couldn't

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
going down it would be you couldn't

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.660 
going down it would be you couldn't
really<00:02:25.349> help<00:02:25.500> MIT<00:02:25.739> it<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> wondrous<00:02:26.400> one<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
really help MIT it be a wondrous one and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.770 
really help MIT it be a wondrous one and
then<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.849> could<00:02:26.970> send<00:02:27.209> your<00:02:27.300> jungler<00:02:27.540> there

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
then you could send your jungler there

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.300 
then you could send your jungler there
if<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.959> ever<00:02:28.050> got<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.290> free<00:02:28.440> time<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.800> that's

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
if you ever got a free time and that's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.589 
if you ever got a free time and that's
where<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.550> usually<00:02:29.730> put<00:02:30.000> our<00:02:30.120> jungler<00:02:30.390> jungler

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
where we usually put our jungler jungler

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.420 
where we usually put our jungler jungler
because<00:02:31.290> cloud<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.769> type<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.010> character

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
because cloud is a type of character

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.160 
because cloud is a type of character
that<00:02:32.459> like<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:32.940> he<00:02:33.300> gets<00:02:33.480> killed<00:02:33.660> early<00:02:33.930> he<00:02:34.050> can

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
that like if he gets killed early he can

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.380 
that like if he gets killed early he can
carry<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.500> game<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.430> we<00:02:35.580> try<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.910> focus

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
carry the game and then we try to focus

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.259 
carry the game and then we try to focus
on<00:02:36.660> up<00:02:36.959> top<00:02:37.290> or<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.620> bottom<00:02:37.769> more<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.700> instead

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
on up top or on bottom more like instead

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.089 
on up top or on bottom more like instead
of<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.569> putting<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.050> cloud<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.560> it

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
of just putting it on cloud and it

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.530 
of just putting it on cloud and it
wasn't<00:02:41.430> really<00:02:41.610> paying<00:02:41.730> off<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.209> then<00:02:42.300> that

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
wasn't really paying off and then that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.150 
wasn't really paying off and then that
with<00:02:42.720> our<00:02:42.750> picks<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.470> wasn't<00:02:44.040> working

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
with our picks it just wasn't working

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.580 
with our picks it just wasn't working
too<00:02:44.370> well<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:45.060> game<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.569> focus<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.470> lot

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
too well so this game we I focus a lot

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.920 
too well so this game we I focus a lot
on<00:02:46.650> mid<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.519> not<00:02:47.970> even<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.330> make<00:02:48.510> sure<00:02:48.630> he<00:02:48.810> got

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
on mid just not even to make sure he got

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.150 
on mid just not even to make sure he got
kills<00:02:49.200> but<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.650> make<00:02:49.769> sure<00:02:49.799> he's<00:02:50.040> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
kills but just to make sure he's the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.699 
kills but just to make sure he's the
head<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.940> worked<00:02:51.660> pretty<00:02:51.780> well<00:02:52.019> yeah<00:02:52.530> and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
the second flash I saw Benny going in

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.460 
the second flash I saw Benny going in
and<00:03:09.299> Benny's<00:03:09.510> pretty<00:03:09.810> much<00:03:09.930> unkillable<00:03:10.230> and

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
and Benny's pretty much unkillable and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.320 
and Benny's pretty much unkillable and
doing<00:03:10.620> lots<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.950> damage<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.489> he<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.030> going<00:03:12.239> on

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
doing lots of damage so he was going on

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.640 
doing lots of damage so he was going on
both<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.630> them<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:12.989> knew<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.470> couldn't

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
both of them and we knew you couldn't

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.259 
both of them and we knew you couldn't
die<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.069> we're<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.340> just<00:03:14.549> going<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.970> go<00:03:15.090> and

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
die so we're like just going just go and

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.610 
die so we're like just going just go and
just<00:03:15.420> doesn't<00:03:15.870> matter<00:03:15.989> just<00:03:16.110> keep<00:03:16.290> going<00:03:16.500> in

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
just doesn't matter just keep going in

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.110 
just doesn't matter just keep going in
and<00:03:16.739> then<00:03:16.830> once<00:03:17.340> we<00:03:17.459> got<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.670> kill<00:03:17.820> we're<00:03:17.970> like

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
and then once we got the kill we're like

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.569 
and then once we got the kill we're like
okay<00:03:18.720> we're<00:03:19.620> probably<00:03:19.950> we're<00:03:20.340> about<00:03:20.519> even

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
okay we're probably we're about even

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.250 
okay we're probably we're about even
during<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.269> fight<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.630> now<00:03:21.870> we're<00:03:22.079> really

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
during that fight and now we're really

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.990 
during that fight and now we're really
strong<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.620> all<00:03:23.190> we<00:03:23.370> have<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.519> do<00:03:23.670> is<00:03:23.700> make<00:03:23.970> sure

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
strong so all we have to do is make sure

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.880 
strong so all we have to do is make sure
we<00:03:24.209> catch<00:03:24.359> them<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.720> we'll<00:03:25.019> go<00:03:25.140> ahead<00:03:25.260> yeah

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
we catch them and we'll go ahead yeah

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.039 
we catch them and we'll go ahead yeah
and<00:03:26.130> what<00:03:26.670> really<00:03:26.940> led<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.480> opportunity

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
and what really led to the opportunity

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.539 
and what really led to the opportunity
there<00:03:28.200> like<00:03:28.320> why<00:03:28.530> do<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.739> think<00:03:28.890> CLG<00:03:29.280> was<00:03:29.400> so

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
there like why do you think CLG was so

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.309 
there like why do you think CLG was so
pushed<00:03:29.760> up<00:03:29.940> versus<00:03:30.299> what<00:03:30.810> why<00:03:30.959> was<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.170> an

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
pushed up versus what why was that an

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.900 
pushed up versus what why was that an
easy<00:03:31.440> far<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:31.799> you<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:31.890> find<00:03:32.130> well<00:03:32.700> pretty

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.039 
game of the day which is gonna be cloud
nine<00:03:53.489> vs<00:03:53.819> TSM<00:03:54.209> how<00:03:54.510> do<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.660> like<00:03:54.750> these<00:03:54.870> two

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
nine vs TSM how do you like these two

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.720 
nine vs TSM how do you like these two
teams<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.500> think<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:56.549> they're

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
teams I think right now they're

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.309 
teams I think right now they're
definitely<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.150> strongest<00:03:57.359> two<00:03:57.900> teams<00:03:58.109> than

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
definitely the strongest two teams than

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.740 
definitely the strongest two teams than
na<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:59.100> think<00:03:59.609> cloud<00:03:59.850> nine<00:04:00.060> will<00:04:00.269> be<00:04:00.389> TSM

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
na and I think cloud nine will be TSM

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.059 
na and I think cloud nine will be TSM
because<00:04:00.930> I<00:04:01.019> don't<00:04:01.170> think<00:04:01.230> TSM<00:04:01.620> pulled<00:04:01.859> a<00:04:01.950> game

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
because I don't think TSM pulled a game

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.830 
because I don't think TSM pulled a game
off<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.280> them<00:04:02.489> yet<00:04:02.670> yeah<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:03.540> you've<00:04:03.630> played

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
off of them yet yeah and you've played

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.090 
off of them yet yeah and you've played
against<00:04:04.170> both<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.350> junglers<00:04:04.859> in<00:04:04.980> that

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
against both the junglers in that

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.620 
against both the junglers in that
matchup<00:04:05.340> who<00:04:05.970> would<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.209> think<00:04:06.359> have<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
matchup who would you think have the

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.970 
matchup who would you think have the
edge<00:04:06.750> between<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.079> medias<00:04:07.380> inaud<00:04:07.650> one<00:04:07.799> because

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
edge between a medias inaud one because

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.050 
edge between a medias inaud one because
