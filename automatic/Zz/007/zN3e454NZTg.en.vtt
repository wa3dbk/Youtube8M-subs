quite<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> while<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.420> phantom<00:00:22.230> mode<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.740> so<00:00:23.340> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
quite a while in phantom mode and so we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.340 
quite a while in phantom mode and so we
figured<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:23.939> would<00:00:24.090> show<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.779> way<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> go

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
in NASA M

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610 
in NASA M
so<00:02:14.450> very<00:02:15.450> important<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.080> had<00:02:16.230> turned<00:02:16.500> on

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
so very important that you had turned on

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.040 
so very important that you had turned on
your<00:02:16.830> transmitter<00:02:17.280> first<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.750> we<00:02:18.900> can

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
your transmitter first so that we can

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.720 
your transmitter first so that we can
see<00:02:19.320> what<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> switches<00:02:20.010> are<00:02:20.160> doing<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
see what the switches are doing in the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.050 
see what the switches are doing in the
software<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.750> any<00:02:25.320> changes<00:02:25.800> there<00:02:26.070> we'll<00:02:26.910> go

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
software so any changes there we'll go

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.750 
software so any changes there we'll go
ahead<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.300> go<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.370> see<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.670> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
ahead and go to and you can see on the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.320 
ahead and go to and you can see on the
main<00:02:29.910> screen<00:02:30.210> where<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.570> says<00:02:30.710> IOC<00:02:31.710> here<00:02:32.330> IOC

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
main screen where it says IOC here IOC

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.820 
main screen where it says IOC here IOC
is<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.660> we're<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.020> activate<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
is what we're going to activate and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.470 
is what we're going to activate and
that's<00:02:35.190> your<00:02:35.340> intelligent<00:02:35.880> orientation

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
that's your intelligent orientation

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.990 
that's your intelligent orientation
control<00:02:36.630> right<00:02:37.380> now<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.770> says<00:02:37.980> off<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.850> what

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
control right now it says off but what

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.220 
control right now it says off but what
we're<00:02:39.090> going<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.270> do<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.720> we're<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.020> go

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
we're going to do is we're going to go

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.650 
we're going to do is we're going to go
into<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.710> advanced<00:02:41.190> menu<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:44.220> IOC<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.030> we're

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
into the advanced menu to IOC and we're

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.750 
into the advanced menu to IOC and we're
going<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> activate<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.590> right<00:02:47.370> now<00:02:47.520> it's

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
going to activate that right now it's

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.630 
going to activate that right now it's
not<00:02:47.820> activated<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:49.440> doesn't<00:02:49.830> come<00:02:49.980> activated

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
not activated it doesn't come activated

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.170 
not activated it doesn't come activated
when<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.120> switch<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.750> NASA<00:02:52.290> M<00:02:52.560> mode<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.970> do

when you switch on NASA M mode to do

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.660 
when you switch on NASA M mode to do
that<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.810> go<00:02:54.930> here<00:02:55.880> click<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.209> button<00:02:57.560> and

now<00:02:59.670> you'll<00:02:59.910> be<00:03:00.500> activated<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.620> IOC<00:03:02.250> which

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
now you'll be activated for IOC which

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.510 
now you'll be activated for IOC which
will<00:03:03.030> give<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.360> two<00:03:03.930> new<00:03:04.110> features<00:03:04.350> on<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.070> s2

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
will give you two new features on the s2

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.580 
will give you two new features on the s2
switch<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.540> if<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.780> reach<00:03:06.959> over<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.380> grab

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
switch so if you reach over and you grab

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.210 
switch so if you reach over and you grab

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
your transmitter s to switch you flip it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.820 
your transmitter s to switch you flip it
to<00:03:11.520> middle<00:03:12.380> that's<00:03:13.380> going<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.590> give<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:13.800> a

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
you click on RC or C standing for remote

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.110 
you click on RC or C standing for remote
control<00:03:45.739> very<00:03:46.739> s1<00:03:47.280> switch<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.910> now<00:03:47.970> you'll

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
control very s1 switch and now you'll

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.570 
control very s1 switch and now you'll
see<00:03:48.300> the<00:03:48.450> very<00:03:48.660> top<00:03:48.720> most<00:03:49.260> position<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:50.010> going

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
see the very top most position is going

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.900 
see the very top most position is going
to<00:03:50.640> be<00:03:50.700> GPS<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.860> middle<00:03:53.160> position<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.760> going

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
to be GPS the middle position is going

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.880 
to be GPS the middle position is going
to<00:03:53.970> be<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> D<00:03:54.300> now<00:03:54.930> you'll<00:03:55.080> be<00:03:55.110> flying<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.830> D

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
to be a D now you'll be flying and a D

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.310 
to be a D now you'll be flying and a D
which<00:03:56.190> means<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.120> will<00:03:57.180> drift<00:03:57.510> left-right

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.199 
which means it will drift left-right
backwards<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.010> forwards<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.910> will<00:04:00.030> maintain

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.550 
backwards and forwards it will maintain
its<00:04:00.450> altitude<00:04:01.080> but<00:04:01.290> it'll<00:04:01.590> drift<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:04.350> last

experience flying a phantom in manual

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.050 
experience flying a phantom in manual
mode<00:04:47.350> because<00:04:47.860> what<00:04:48.400> happens<00:04:48.730> when<00:04:48.880> you're<00:04:49.030> in

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.180 
mode because what happens when you're in
manual<00:04:49.330> mode<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.680> takes<00:04:50.890> away<00:04:51.160> all

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
manual mode is that it takes away all

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.170 
manual mode is that it takes away all
the<00:04:51.450> stabilization<00:04:52.450> so<00:04:52.750> any<00:04:53.410> horizontal

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
the stabilization so any horizontal

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.400 
the stabilization so any horizontal
stabilization<00:04:55.180> will<00:04:55.510> be<00:04:55.630> gone<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.140> you'll<00:04:56.290> be

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
stabilization will be gone so you'll be

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.860 
stabilization will be gone so you'll be

flying in complete manual mode so be

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.180 
flying in complete manual mode so be
aware<00:04:58.960> of<00:04:59.170> that<00:05:02.460> and<00:05:03.460> we'll<00:05:04.060> go<00:05:04.210> back<00:05:04.480> up<00:05:04.720> to

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
it on your transmitter somehow we would
