00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.350
 The electric bicycle or e-bike is still unbelievably popular in the Netherlands. 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.149
 We get a lot of questions about that. 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.299
 We will go into the engines a little further, of which systems are there ... 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:17.470
 ... and what are the pros and cons. 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.759
 The technical development of the e-bike mainly started with the front-wheel motor. 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.230
 The main advantages of a front wheel motor are that it is a cheap system ... 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.689
 ... that it requires little maintenance and that without support you still ... 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.810
 ... light can cycle. A front-wheel motor also has some disadvantages. The most important thing is that you ... 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.900
 need more power to steer, because the front is a bit heavier. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.679
 The engine needs more power to accelerate ... 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.329
 The entire system is less efficient. The most important thing is ... 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.810
 ... it seems very often that that bike wants to run away with you. 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.590
 If the engine is in the rear wheel then it is often a somewhat quieter engine ... 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.970
 ... and you have better steering behavior. This also has a few drawbacks ... 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.760
 The most important thing is that you can only have a derailleur and not a hub gear. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.179
 So it needs more maintenance ... 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.190
 And of course you also have an open chain case, because of course it cannot go in a closed chain case. 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.050
 Another point of interest with a hub gear, you can switch to a standstill and with a derailleur you can't. 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.490
 The trend of recent years is definitely the mid-engine. The best-known manufacturer ... 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.740
 Bosch is one of them. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.520
 Why do more and more people choose a bike with a mid-engine? 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.060
 That's because it feels a lot natural. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.730
 The engine is also lower in the frame, so it has a low center of gravity. 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.800
 And the third is, it works over the pedals and gears so it works very efficiently. 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.820
 And also very handy with a mid-engine is natural; sticking and changing the tires ... 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.350
 much simpler. 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.659
 The mid-engine also has certain disadvantages ... 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.369
 Firstly it is of course also a more expensive system and secondly, all the forces that come on the ... 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.410
 ... chains and gear systems, so everything has to be made heavier ... 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.580
 and the third is ... 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.240
 ... it makes a bit more noise because it contains gear systems. 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.620
 In addition to the Bosch mid-engine, there are of course many more manufacturers that ... 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.600
 .... offering, and one of them is Impuls, which is used among other things ... 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.440
 in one of us tested ... 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.020
 ... the Gazelle C7 and the Kalkhoff Tasman and there is a special story to it. 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.689
 This impulse motor is very quiet and has an extra function, the so-called boost ... 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.420
 position. 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.570
 As a result, he has an extra boost ... 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.990
 ... under severe circumstances of 70 newton to pull with, that's really a lot. 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.650
 So if you go up a heavy slope, for example, you go up much easier but it ... 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.349
 ... naturally consumes energy. 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.560
 In our test, the boost function is striking remarkably often because we ... 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.509
 ... have a very tough test route. 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.949
 Then we also hear from users that they find the boost function incredibly rough ... 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.289
 ... come in. 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.489
 The dealer can make that milder with a software update and therefore come ... 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.029
 ... of course you go a lot further. 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.189
 Normally I'm only talking about the engine, but of course I know it's a complete system of ... 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:35.769
 ... all... 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.449
 ... parts and that is all perfectly matched. 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.309
 That is just purchased from all manufacturers and we are talking about a system of ... 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.389
 ... battery, control unit, motor and sensors. 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.599
 When purchasing an e-bike, it is important that you not only pay attention to the motorcycle ... 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.549
 ... but also the battery because that is a very expensive part. 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.229
 We have seen prices for replacing € 300 to € 1000 to ... 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:00.229
 That is our tip right away, take an extended warranty, because then you know for sure that those costs are not for you ... 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.579
 Very often a system of batteries is also offered, this is for example bronze, 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.099
 ... silver, gold and platinum. It is then about the size of the batteries ... 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.529
 ... then choose a battery that fits your use. If you only want short ... 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:12.459
 ... cycling distances ... 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.669
 ... then you choose a small battery and if you cycle a lot of long distances you choose a large battery. 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.719
 After the publication of the latest test data, people are rather shocked by the small action radius, 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.000
 ... we say ... 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.949
 ... our test procedure is very tough with a tough test trail with many hills ... 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.189
 ... and we measure the strength of the support ... 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.679
 so only use those figures to compare your bike ... 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:42.679
 If you go cycling yourself with less support on a normal course ... 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:44.199
 ... then you will go much further.
