Winsor Newton has a variety of al
convenience<00:00:08.000> called<00:00:08.299> wiggling<00:00:08.690> which<00:00:08.900> are

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
convenience called wiggling which are

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.720 
convenience called wiggling which are
made<00:00:09.200> by<00:00:09.230> taking<00:00:09.769> a<00:00:09.830> naturally<00:00:10.219> drive<00:00:10.490> oil

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
made by taking a naturally drive oil

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.150 
made by taking a naturally drive oil
like<00:00:11.059> linseed<00:00:11.510> oil<00:00:11.600> or<00:00:11.930> soy<00:00:12.469> oil<00:00:12.799> and

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
like linseed oil or soy oil and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.220 
like linseed oil or soy oil and
chemically<00:00:13.639> treating<00:00:14.059> it<00:00:14.210> with<00:00:14.360> alcohol<00:00:15.019> and

chemically treating it with alcohol and
acid<00:00:15.620> which<00:00:15.769> is<00:00:15.799> where<00:00:16.070> the<00:00:16.129> name<00:00:16.250> comes<00:00:16.460> from

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
acid which is where the name comes from

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.640 
acid which is where the name comes from
to<00:00:17.180> take<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.450> first<00:00:17.630> part<00:00:17.869> of<00:00:17.900> alcohol<00:00:18.349> and

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
to take the first part of alcohol and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.080 
to take the first part of alcohol and
the<00:00:18.770> last<00:00:18.950> part<00:00:19.220> of<00:00:19.250> acid<00:00:19.669> you<00:00:19.730> get<00:00:19.849> the<00:00:19.939> word

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
the last part of acid you get the word

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.540 
the last part of acid you get the word
out<00:00:20.330> kit<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:20.990> what<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:21.740> alkanes<00:00:22.039> do<00:00:22.279> is<00:00:22.430> they

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
out kit and what the alkanes do is they

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.460 
out kit and what the alkanes do is they
speed<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:23.119> drying<00:00:23.359> rate<00:00:23.660> of<00:00:23.930> a<00:00:24.019> conventional

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
speed the drying rate of a conventional

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.910 
speed the drying rate of a conventional
oil<00:00:24.789> by<00:00:25.789> about<00:00:25.970> 50<00:00:26.240> percent<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:26.750> if<00:00:27.199> you<00:00:27.380> if<00:00:27.830> you

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
oil by about 50 percent so if you if you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.650 
oil by about 50 percent so if you if you
take<00:00:28.070> them<00:00:28.250> they'll<00:00:28.400> dry<00:00:28.580> in<00:00:28.640> about<00:00:28.730> 2<00:00:29.269> to<00:00:29.420> 12

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
take them they'll dry in about 2 to 12

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.810 
take them they'll dry in about 2 to 12
days<00:00:29.869> oils<00:00:30.380> normally<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.189> I'll<00:00:31.279> take<00:00:31.670> that

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
days oils normally and I'll take that

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.000 
days oils normally and I'll take that
time<00:00:32.059> down<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:32.449> about<00:00:32.629> 1<00:00:32.900> to<00:00:33.080> 6<00:00:33.350> days<00:00:33.650> depending

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
time down to about 1 to 6 days depending

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.770 
time down to about 1 to 6 days depending
on<00:00:34.280> upon<00:00:34.400> the<00:00:34.670> pigment<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.180> you<00:00:35.570> have<00:00:35.690> to

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
on upon the pigment and you have to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.389 
on upon the pigment and you have to
remember<00:00:35.900> that's<00:00:36.110> touch<00:00:36.440> dry<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.010> you<00:00:37.100> still

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
remember that's touch dry so you still

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.250 
remember that's touch dry so you still
want<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.670> wait<00:00:37.850> about<00:00:38.180> 6<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.629> 12<00:00:38.870> months

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
want to wait about 6 to 12 months

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.139 
want to wait about 6 to 12 months
depending<00:00:39.530> upon<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:40.100> thickness<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.700> your

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
depending upon the thickness of your

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.490 
depending upon the thickness of your
paint<00:00:41.360> later<00:00:41.540> before<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.020> put<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.200> final

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
paint later before you put that final

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.650 
paint later before you put that final
varnish<00:00:42.950> on<00:00:43.129> liquid<00:00:43.910> originally<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.480> the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
varnish on liquid originally is the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.650 
varnish on liquid originally is the
first<00:00:45.079> liquid<00:00:45.559> produced<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:47.390> can<00:00:47.450> see

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
first liquid produced and you can see

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.779 
first liquid produced and you can see
that<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:47.930> quite<00:00:48.110> fluid<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:48.770> what<00:00:49.579> I'm<00:00:49.640> going

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
that it's quite fluid and what I'm going

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.040 
that it's quite fluid and what I'm going
to<00:00:49.820> do<00:00:49.940> is<00:00:50.059> I'm<00:00:50.120> going<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.300> take<00:00:50.420> a<00:00:50.449> proportion

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
to do is I'm going to take a proportion

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.240 
to do is I'm going to take a proportion
of<00:00:51.230> about<00:00:51.829> 2<00:00:52.340> parts<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.940> oil<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:54.680> one<00:00:55.219> part

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
of about 2 parts of oil to one part

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.250 
of about 2 parts of oil to one part
liquid<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.390> what<00:00:56.539> that's<00:00:56.750> going<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:56.960> do<00:00:57.109> is

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
liquid and what that's going to do is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.380 
liquid and what that's going to do is
going<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.590> reduce<00:00:57.710> its<00:00:58.100> consistency<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:58.969> look

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
going to reduce its consistency and look

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.150 
going to reduce its consistency and look
how<00:00:59.539> fluid<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.170> gets<00:01:00.410> gets<00:01:00.649> nice<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:00.859> fluid

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
how fluid that gets gets nice and fluid

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.210 
how fluid that gets gets nice and fluid
it's<00:01:01.520> very<00:01:01.760> very<00:01:01.969> rich<00:01:02.210> color<00:01:03.039> improves<00:01:04.039> the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
it's very very rich color improves the

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.300 
it's very very rich color improves the
flow<00:01:05.320> they'll<00:01:06.320> also<00:01:06.619> increase<00:01:06.920> film

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
flow they'll also increase film

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.180 
flow they'll also increase film
durability<00:01:08.050> so<00:01:09.050> when<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.229> apply<00:01:09.649> it<00:01:09.709> onto<00:01:09.979> the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
durability so when I apply it onto the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.859 
durability so when I apply it onto the
canvas<00:01:10.369> it's<00:01:10.759> going<00:01:10.910> to<00:01:10.970> make<00:01:11.179> it<00:01:11.360> more

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
canvas it's going to make it more

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.050 
canvas it's going to make it more
durable<00:01:12.140> if<00:01:12.920> your<00:01:13.250> even<00:01:13.429> better

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
durable if your even better

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.109 
durable if your even better
crease<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.020> flexibility<00:01:15.709> and<00:01:16.580> give<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:17.060> a

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
crease the flexibility and give it a

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.460 
crease the flexibility and give it a
semi<00:01:17.890> semi-gloss<00:01:18.890> finish<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:20.360> it<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.690> it

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
semi semi-gloss finish to it and it

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.109 
semi semi-gloss finish to it and it
would<00:01:21.590> be<00:01:21.709> similar<00:01:22.099> to<00:01:22.160> we<00:01:22.610> were<00:01:22.700> dealing<00:01:23.090> with

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
would be similar to we were dealing with

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.540 
would be similar to we were dealing with
drying<00:01:23.990> oils<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.860> would<00:01:24.979> be<00:01:25.069> similar<00:01:25.369> to<00:01:25.429> a

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
drying oils it would be similar to a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.710 
drying oils it would be similar to a
linseed<00:01:26.000> oil<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.300> would<00:01:26.360> have<00:01:26.509> all<00:01:26.630> those

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
linseed oil it would have all those

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.430 
linseed oil it would have all those
great<00:01:26.929> properties<00:01:27.500> but<00:01:27.709> it<00:01:27.740> would<00:01:27.920> dry<00:01:28.130> faster

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
great properties but it would dry faster

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.870 
great properties but it would dry faster
this<00:01:30.440> painting<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:30.890> used<00:01:31.099> liquid<00:01:31.459> original

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
this painting I used liquid original

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.190 
this painting I used liquid original
because<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.179> want<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.390> get<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.569> paint<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.899> foam

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
because I want to get the paint a foam

wanted to do is work very quickly from
his<00:01:42.410> live<00:01:42.679> setting<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.399> work<00:01:44.060> went<00:01:44.420> into<00:01:44.569> wet

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
his live setting and work went into wet

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.690 
his live setting and work went into wet
so<00:01:45.289> it<00:01:45.590> took<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:46.069> original<00:01:46.459> stiff

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
so it took that original stiff

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.460 
so it took that original stiff
consistency<00:01:46.849> and<00:01:47.450> loosen<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:47.869> up<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.289> can

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
consistency and loosen that up so I can

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.650 
consistency and loosen that up so I can
really<00:01:48.619> move<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.069> paint<00:01:49.310> around<00:01:49.580> quickly<00:01:49.910> get

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
really move the paint around quickly get

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.389 
really move the paint around quickly get
these<00:01:50.810> very<00:01:51.050> simple<00:01:51.319> abstract<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.130> shapes

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
these very simple abstract and shapes

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.410 
these very simple abstract and shapes
and<00:01:52.640> get<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.179> desired<00:01:53.509> effect<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.110> wanted

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
and get the desired effect that I wanted

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.300 
and get the desired effect that I wanted
liquid<00:01:56.420> fine<00:01:56.599> detail<00:01:57.050> as<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.380> name<00:01:57.560> suggests

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
liquid fine detail as the name suggests

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.540 
liquid fine detail as the name suggests
is<00:01:59.209> for<00:01:59.660> fine<00:01:59.899> detail<00:02:00.229> work<00:02:00.470> and<00:02:01.069> it's<00:02:01.280> more

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
is for fine detail work and it's more

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.119 
is for fine detail work and it's more
fluid<00:02:01.819> than<00:02:02.179> liquid<00:02:02.750> original<00:02:03.229> quite<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.950> bit

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:04.129 
fluid than liquid original quite a bit

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.040 
fluid than liquid original quite a bit
more<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.399> can<00:02:04.429> see<00:02:04.550> that<00:02:04.910> and<00:02:05.119> it's<00:02:05.539> going<00:02:05.750> to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
more you can see that and it's going to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.809 
more you can see that and it's going to
increase<00:02:06.410> transparency<00:02:06.830> it's<00:02:07.429> going<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.640> dry

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
increase transparency it's going to dry

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.779 
increase transparency it's going to dry
to<00:02:07.879> a<00:02:08.090> gloss<00:02:08.690> finish<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.379> it'll<00:02:10.220> level<00:02:10.580> your

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
to a gloss finish and it'll level your

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.550 
to a gloss finish and it'll level your
brush<00:02:11.030> strokes<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:12.020> when<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.230> want<00:02:12.379> to<00:02:12.410> get

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
brush strokes so when you want to get

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.020 
brush strokes so when you want to get
into<00:02:12.970> detail<00:02:13.970> work<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:16.640> don't<00:02:16.790> want<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
into detail work and you don't want the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
into detail work and you don't want the
brush<00:02:17.240> strokes<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.690> show

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
brush strokes to show

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.290 
brush strokes to show
this<00:02:18.740> is<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.950> really<00:02:19.280> great<00:02:19.550> choice<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.210> in

of little tiny fine details that I

part of the bag I also had a lot of
glazing<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.720> wanted<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.110> do<00:02:45.230> with<00:02:45.560> the

liquid fine detail is ideal for speeding
the<00:02:50.450> drawing<00:02:50.720> rate<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.140> being<00:02:51.320> able<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> do

is<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> gel<00:02:54.920> medium<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.970> I'm<00:02:56.030> actually<00:02:56.120> gonna

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
is a gel medium so I'm actually gonna

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.210 
is a gel medium so I'm actually gonna
use<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.540> palette<00:02:56.870> knife<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.050> get<00:02:57.290> some<00:02:57.560> out<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.100> a

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
use a palette knife to get some out of a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.140 
use a palette knife to get some out of a
bottle<00:02:58.520> right<00:02:58.610> there<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:58.940> can<00:02:59.030> see<00:02:59.120> very

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
bottle right there and you can see very

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.170 
bottle right there and you can see very
easily<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.840> it's<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.020> lot<00:03:00.200> thicker<00:03:01.100> than<00:03:01.460> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
easily that it's a lot thicker than the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.430 
easily that it's a lot thicker than the
other<00:03:02.390> two<00:03:02.600> mediums<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:02.990> I<00:03:03.050> just<00:03:03.230> showed<00:03:03.410> you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
other two mediums that I just showed you

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.900 
other two mediums that I just showed you
and<00:03:03.770> I'm<00:03:03.830> gonna<00:03:03.950> take<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.190> some<00:03:04.700> paint

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
and I'm gonna take a some paint

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.700 
and I'm gonna take a some paint
brightener<00:03:05.330> cool<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.810> mix<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.380> with<00:03:06.560> this

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
brightener cool and mix it in with this

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.320 
brightener cool and mix it in with this
and<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.520> what<00:03:07.670> we'd<00:03:07.790> call<00:03:07.970> thixotropic

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
and it's what we'd call thixotropic

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.140 
and it's what we'd call thixotropic
which<00:03:09.080> is<00:03:09.500> really<00:03:10.220> just<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.460> big<00:03:10.610> word<00:03:10.820> for

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
which is really just a big word for

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.030 
which is really just a big word for
saying<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.570> starts<00:03:11.960> out<00:03:12.140> very<00:03:12.200> gel<00:03:12.800> light

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
saying that it starts out very gel light

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.430 
saying that it starts out very gel light
but<00:03:13.310> as<00:03:13.520> I<00:03:13.910> push<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.270> around<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:14.900> manipulate

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
but as I push it around and I manipulate

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.260 
but as I push it around and I manipulate
it<00:03:15.590> here<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.160> starts<00:03:16.460> to<00:03:16.520> become<00:03:16.610> much<00:03:17.060> much

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
it here it starts to become much much

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.050 
it here it starts to become much much
more<00:03:17.390> fluid<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.370> that's<00:03:19.370> kind<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.820> nice

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
more fluid and that's kind of nice

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.250 
more fluid and that's kind of nice
because<00:03:20.750> when<00:03:21.740> I'm<00:03:21.890> brushing<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.580> out<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.260> I

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
because when I'm brushing it out and I

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.710 
because when I'm brushing it out and I
have<00:03:24.470> my<00:03:24.650> canvas<00:03:25.070> vertically<00:03:25.730> what<00:03:26.570> will

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
have my canvas vertically what will

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.080 
have my canvas vertically what will
happen<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.710> won't<00:03:27.860> drip<00:03:28.160> down<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.460> surface

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
happen is it won't drip down the surface

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.630 
happen is it won't drip down the surface
so<00:03:29.390> I<00:03:29.660> can<00:03:30.020> take<00:03:30.200> this<00:03:30.410> here<00:03:30.710> brush<00:03:31.310> out<00:03:31.460> some

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
so I can take this here brush out some

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.180 
so I can take this here brush out some
beautiful<00:03:31.760> marks<00:03:32.330> here<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:33.740> can<00:03:33.860> get<00:03:33.980> into

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
beautiful marks here and I can get into

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.730 
beautiful marks here and I can get into
a<00:03:34.220> lot<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.460> blending<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.510> glazing<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.260> it'll

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
a lot of blending and glazing and it'll

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.620 
a lot of blending and glazing and it'll
dry<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.160> very<00:03:37.400> nice<00:03:37.550> gloss<00:03:37.850> finish<00:03:38.240> the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
dry to a very nice gloss finish the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.330 
dry to a very nice gloss finish the
other<00:03:38.750> thing<00:03:38.960> I<00:03:39.050> should<00:03:39.110> mention<00:03:39.260> as<00:03:39.710> well<00:03:39.950> is

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
other thing I should mention as well is

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.790 
other thing I should mention as well is
that<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:41.210> liquid<00:03:41.690> family<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.290> mediums<00:03:42.620> now

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
that the liquid family of mediums now

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.920 
that the liquid family of mediums now
comes<00:03:43.040> in<00:03:43.220> plastic<00:03:43.490> bottles<00:03:44.030> which<00:03:44.600> is<00:03:44.720> great

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
comes in plastic bottles which is great

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.110 
comes in plastic bottles which is great
particularly<00:03:45.350> for<00:03:45.530> colleges<00:03:46.010> where<00:03:47.000> they

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
particularly for colleges where they

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.060 
particularly for colleges where they
don't<00:03:47.240> want<00:03:47.360> breakage<00:03:47.960> in<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.230> studio<00:03:48.590> with

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
don't want breakage in the studio with

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.990 
don't want breakage in the studio with
the<00:03:49.280> old<00:03:49.580> glass<00:03:49.850> bottles<00:03:51.580> liquid<00:03:52.580> light<00:03:52.730> gel

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
the old glass bottles liquid light gel

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.840 
the old glass bottles liquid light gel
is<00:03:53.210> similar<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.840> liquid<00:03:54.230> fine<00:03:54.440> detail<00:03:54.980> but

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
is similar to liquid fine detail but

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.000 
is similar to liquid fine detail but
it's<00:03:56.360> obviously<00:03:57.080> a<00:03:57.140> gel<00:03:57.620> like<00:03:57.830> consistency

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
it's obviously a gel like consistency

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.890 
it's obviously a gel like consistency
and<00:03:58.730> that's<00:03:58.940> nice<00:03:59.120> because<00:03:59.300> I<00:03:59.480> have<00:03:59.570> so<00:03:59.780> many

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
and that's nice because I have so many

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.840 
and that's nice because I have so many
subtle<00:04:00.230> passages<00:04:00.980> in<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:01.250> portrait<00:04:01.730> of

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
subtle passages in this portrait of

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.520 
subtle passages in this portrait of
different<00:04:02.210> colors<00:04:02.570> that<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:02.840> wanted<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.290> blend

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
different colors that I wanted to blend

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.320 
different colors that I wanted to blend
wet<00:04:03.830> ends<00:04:03.980> wet<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.940> gel<00:04:05.150> like

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
wet ends wet and the gel like

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.630 
wet ends wet and the gel like
consistency<00:04:05.510> keeps<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.530> from<00:04:06.770> running<00:04:07.460> or

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
consistency keeps it from running or

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.830 
consistency keeps it from running or
dripping<00:04:07.910> down<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.210> painting<00:04:08.630> as<00:04:08.720> I'm

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
dripping down the painting as I'm

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.530 
dripping down the painting as I'm
working<00:04:09.230> liquid<00:04:10.070> impasto<00:04:10.580> has<00:04:10.790> a<00:04:10.820> very<00:04:11.300> stiff

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
working liquid impasto has a very stiff

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.970 
working liquid impasto has a very stiff
consistency<00:04:11.690> which<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.290> why<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.590> comes<00:04:12.800> in<00:04:12.920> a

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
consistency which is why it comes in a

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.310 
consistency which is why it comes in a
tube<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.520> can<00:04:13.610> be<00:04:13.700> squeezed<00:04:14.030> out<00:04:14.270> and<00:04:14.540> it'll

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
tube so it can be squeezed out and it'll

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.990 
tube so it can be squeezed out and it'll
retain<00:04:15.620> its<00:04:15.800> texture<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:16.790> brush

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
retain its texture and it's brush

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.699 
retain its texture and it's brush
strokes<00:04:17.330> as<00:04:17.480> well<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.260> brush<00:04:18.440> strokes

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
strokes as well and the brush strokes

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.729 
strokes as well and the brush strokes
were<00:04:18.950> retain<00:04:19.280> these<00:04:20.060> crisp<00:04:20.480> high<00:04:20.810> peaks<00:04:21.260> so<00:04:21.680> I

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
were retain these crisp high peaks so I

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.370 
were retain these crisp high peaks so I
can<00:04:21.920> take<00:04:22.160> a<00:04:22.220> take<00:04:23.000> some<00:04:23.150> paint<00:04:23.390> here<00:04:23.510> some

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
can take a take some paint here some

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.000 
can take a take some paint here some
color<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:25.300> mix<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.540> right<00:04:26.870> into<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.890> can

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
color and mix that right into it you can

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.279 
color and mix that right into it you can
see<00:04:28.160> already<00:04:28.280> how<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:28.820> adds

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
see already how that adds

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.619 
see already how that adds
volumes<00:04:29.559> of<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.800> pain<00:04:30.039> and<00:04:30.309> it<00:04:31.089> also<00:04:31.240> state

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
volumes of the pain and it also state

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.929 
volumes of the pain and it also state
workable<00:04:32.110> for<00:04:32.469> several<00:04:32.919> hours<00:04:33.069> but<00:04:33.490> what's

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
workable for several hours but what's

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.149 
workable for several hours but what's
amazing<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.569> me<00:04:34.719> about<00:04:34.749> it<00:04:35.229> is<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.009> can

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
amazing to me about it is that you can

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.089 
amazing to me about it is that you can
see<00:04:36.430> how<00:04:36.999> very<00:04:37.240> very<00:04:37.479> thick<00:04:37.719> it<00:04:37.869> is<00:04:38.020> yet<00:04:38.800> it'll

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
see how very very thick it is yet it'll

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.619 
see how very very thick it is yet it'll
start<00:04:39.339> set<00:04:39.639> up<00:04:39.789> within<00:04:40.719> a<00:04:40.869> day<00:04:41.020> or<00:04:41.050> so

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
start set up within a day or so

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.999 
start set up within a day or so
liquid<00:04:43.629> impasto<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.169> great<00:04:44.469> when<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:44.770> want<00:04:44.800> to

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
liquid impasto is great when you want to

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.279 
liquid impasto is great when you want to
achieve<00:04:45.099> thick<00:04:45.819> rich<00:04:46.059> impasto<00:04:46.659> brush<00:04:46.930> marks

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
achieve thick rich impasto brush marks

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.519 
achieve thick rich impasto brush marks
they<00:04:47.469> keep<00:04:47.649> their<00:04:47.800> crisp<00:04:48.069> texture<00:04:52.529> liquid

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:53.529 
they keep their crisp texture liquid

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:55.559 
they keep their crisp texture liquid
only<00:04:53.619> Oh<00:04:53.770> pasta<00:04:54.339> also<00:04:54.610> comes<00:04:54.969> in<00:04:55.119> a<00:04:55.210> tube<00:04:55.389> and

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
only Oh pasta also comes in a tube and

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.839 
only Oh pasta also comes in a tube and
it<00:04:55.689> looks<00:04:55.869> similar<00:04:56.379> however<00:04:57.099> the<00:04:57.430> difference

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
it looks similar however the difference

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.279 
it looks similar however the difference
is<00:04:57.999> that<00:04:58.210> it's<00:04:58.360> going<00:04:58.509> to<00:04:58.629> drive<00:04:58.809> to<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:58.990> semi

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
is that it's going to drive to a semi

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.010 
is that it's going to drive to a semi
matte<00:04:59.559> finish<00:05:00.119> and<00:05:01.119> I'll<00:05:01.240> mix<00:05:01.479> in<00:05:01.689> the<00:05:01.779> color

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
matte finish and I'll mix in the color

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.929 
matte finish and I'll mix in the color
here<00:05:02.259> again<00:05:02.469> a<00:05:02.499> little<00:05:02.709> bit<00:05:02.949> and<00:05:03.789> that's

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 
here again a little bit and that's

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.850 
here again a little bit and that's
different<00:05:04.419> than<00:05:04.959> the<00:05:04.990> other<00:05:05.080> liquid<00:05:05.499> medium

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
different than the other liquid medium

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.070 
different than the other liquid medium
it's<00:05:06.159> going<00:05:06.279> to<00:05:06.339> dry<00:05:06.520> more<00:05:06.819> quickly<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.569> it's

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
it's going to dry more quickly and it's

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.920 
it's going to dry more quickly and it's
gonna<00:05:08.229> thicken<00:05:08.529> rapidly<00:05:09.339> and<00:05:09.629> the<00:05:10.629> brush

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
gonna thicken rapidly and the brush

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.510 
gonna thicken rapidly and the brush
strokes<00:05:12.869> although<00:05:13.869> very<00:05:14.139> thick<00:05:14.559> will<00:05:15.129> level

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
strokes although very thick will level

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.089 
strokes although very thick will level
out<00:05:15.669> and<00:05:16.059> that's<00:05:16.629> different<00:05:16.990> than<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.499> liquid

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
out and that's different than the liquid

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.279 
out and that's different than the liquid
and<00:05:18.309> pasta<00:05:18.849> whereas<00:05:19.209> the<00:05:19.389> liquid<00:05:19.749> and<00:05:19.809> pasta

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
and pasta whereas the liquid and pasta

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.389 
and pasta whereas the liquid and pasta
is<00:05:20.649> going<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:20.949> retain<00:05:21.279> the<00:05:21.520> crisp<00:05:21.939> high<00:05:22.869> peaks

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:23.399 
is going to retain the crisp high peaks

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.829 
is going to retain the crisp high peaks
they<00:05:24.399> look<00:05:24.520> an<00:05:24.610> oligo<00:05:24.909> pasta<00:05:25.330> will<00:05:25.449> level<00:05:25.749> out

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:25.839 
they look an oligo pasta will level out

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.769 
they look an oligo pasta will level out
a<00:05:25.899> bit<00:05:26.169> more<00:05:26.999> still<00:05:27.999> have<00:05:28.149> this<00:05:28.300> beautiful

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:28.779 
a bit more still have this beautiful

thick texture liquid oil pasta is

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.980 
thick texture liquid oil pasta is
similar<00:05:33.550> to<00:05:33.699> liquid<00:05:33.999> and<00:05:34.059> pasta<00:05:34.509> and<00:05:34.749> that'll

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
similar to liquid and pasta and that'll

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.439
