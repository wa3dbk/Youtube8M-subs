00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.270 
same route am going to go ahead and add
the<00:04:28.190> remaining<00:04:28.430> water<00:04:28.730> that<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.030> had<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:31.130> you

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
the remaining water that I had and you

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.560 
the remaining water that I had and you
know<00:04:31.370> I'll<00:04:31.430> keep<00:04:31.610> an<00:04:31.730> eye<00:04:31.820> on<00:04:31.850> this<00:04:32.120> every<00:04:32.420> two

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
know I'll keep an eye on this every two

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.310 
know I'll keep an eye on this every two
or<00:04:32.720> three<00:04:32.750> days<00:04:34.150> because<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.300> starts<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:36.080> dry

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
or three days because it starts to dry

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.410 
or three days because it starts to dry
out<00:04:36.520> that's<00:04:37.520> how<00:04:37.730> I<00:04:37.760> water<00:04:37.970> my<00:04:38.200> my<00:04:39.200> seedlings<00:04:39.470> I

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
out that's how I water my my seedlings I

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.550 
out that's how I water my my seedlings I
think<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.510> most<00:04:41.660> important<00:04:42.170> part<00:04:42.380> is<00:04:42.530> just

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
think the most important part is just

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.140 
think the most important part is just
making<00:04:42.770> sure<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.430> take<00:04:43.640> care<00:04:43.670> of<00:04:43.970> these

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
making sure you take care of these

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.010 
making sure you take care of these
little<00:04:44.420> girls<00:04:44.660> from<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.870> beginning<00:04:47.020> call
