00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.110
 here 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 hi bullet receipt girls and in this 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.199
 part of you asking me how to look 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.180
 Chic and blame quality with friends 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.820
 on weekends since I have a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.770
 question many claim that women 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.770
 we dress for other women 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.239
 and I think that in particular I 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:43.110
 It makes me like to see myself in the mirror 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.320
 see my combinations my prints that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.180
 maybe only I understand but it 's the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.440
 way in which I express myself the way 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.390
 in which I have seen myself so I 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.369
 I feel comfortable with myself that's what 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.290
 that to me men for example to little 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.390
 do not hear you can come with your hair 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.970
 cute red is my love you like my new 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.110

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.110
 and special 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.040
 some do not leave us a single detail 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.720
 so that's why I 'm not 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.750
 arranging to go to an event a 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.750
 party 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.690
 very good but I think we see 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.640
 dress for ourselves to 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.980
 feel good to feel 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.840
 comfortable with our image and in this 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.900
 episode I'm going to share with you 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.030
 some super sic looks and blame 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.370
 remove spectacular at the exit by 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 friends during the weekend or the 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.270
 Annoy not to forget that we have a kit 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 surprise that is amazing and all the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.230
 Blonde mega are going to want to have it 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.390
 please make this episode height 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.020
 so you know how you can take it 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.020
 to home 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.880
 the secret to speak super chic and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.950
 blame your departure on weekends 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.259
 with friends is to learn to combine 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.240
 garments in an unusual or little way 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.270
 traditional and also learn to use 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.370
 We will give you the right accessories 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.620
 some of the looks and I have a first 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.990
 dress that is a typical cocktail dress 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.430
 of eyes that the short but we're not going to 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.590
 wear a closed-heeled shoes 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.620
 elegant but we're going to use it with 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.570
 some booties with a retro touch a bit 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.010
 more I want them to give a touch 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.010
 casual to the whole logo 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.470
 Another tip is that you wear dresses very 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.960
 women who have lace or 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.540
 sequins like these but then no 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.180
 you're going to end up with a garment with a 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.300
 touch more dramatic as jacket 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.310
 leather to give it a very urban touch and 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.040
 You can also do it using a 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.640
 blazer with a masculine cut to create 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.640
 contrast 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.450
 and through wearing a garment like this 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.570
 or it can also be a blouse with a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.540
 unusual print a little more striking 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.970
 but that yes be careful because if by 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.530
 example you have a part of your body 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.690
 but if you have big bust or hips 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.730
 big there is not to place the print 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.080
 striking there only come garments a 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.080
 little darker 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.960
 and finally you can add to your looks 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.730
 some accessories with prints or with 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.560
 eye-catching details like this this 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.690
 I love it seems super cool with this 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.790
 detail in rhinestones these shoes that 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.130
 they are very special I love this 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.560
 stamping you can also use an animal 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.890
 fritz and it will give a super chic touch to 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.390
 your night looks 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.760
 good if you're here in the looks that 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.180
 just presented what was the favorite 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.220
 good all so incredible staying me 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.040
 loved it today but it caused me a conflict 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.440
 because you go to the shops they serve many 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.300
 different types of prints and all 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.390
 the mini flowers and a super flower 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.520
 cute which is the one that comes to me or by 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.900
 example a person who is overweight 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.300
 which is the pattern that comes most 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.310
 big good the print be 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.900
 proportional to the size for example a 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.340
 person who is overweight can not 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.750
 use our bed so tiny but 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.000
 not a very big one either because it's going to 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.890
 be of much bigger damn monkey 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.440
 times for example 'the infidel' shortly 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.940
 use a smaller print and someone 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.130
 which is very high then a stamping 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.390
 larger or than the median stamped 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.370
 medial is simply that it be 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.020
 proportional to the story where the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.500
 large print is good for 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.500
 tall girls 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.189
 I like all obviously me 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:52.080

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.080
