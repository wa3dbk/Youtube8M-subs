00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello how am I younger and good today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.410
 I come to explain why the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.639
 creation of the new master degree in him 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.650
 I'm going to let's get down to business 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.920
 directly good usually the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.929
 servers dns and so on there's a lot 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.090
 people trapped in diamond one with 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.699
 ninety or more and always finished 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.800
 earning zero points thus no 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.050
 they could go up to charlene I want to go through 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.170
 at least the joke here in the usually happens 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 that at least at the moment I do not 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.880
 I experienced neither my friends that 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.890
 be close to that good league you create the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.559
 teacher grade because a lot of people 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.809
 in challenguer is active and inactive 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 and every once in a while he played only one 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.250
 departure to not download this link ero 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 I think several of his friends that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.390
 They will have people who are making them 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.969
 this same thing about roman I did it for you 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.500
 did not allow anyone else to climb or be 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.460
 the people who are in diamond one 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 with 90 more points they had to have a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.469
 almost impossible to enter 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 in promo and from there to win I repeat them 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.930
 this happens a lot in the servers of 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.410
 enea 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.180
 it's like it says rays in the email 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.060
 this behavior makes a team or 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.400
 player can accumulate a lot lp and have 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
 long periods of ignite inactivity and 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.330
 then play only one game near the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.890
 end of the season to earn a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.950
 place and win the prizes of the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.690
 riot season creates this master grade 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.670
 to promote competitiveness and 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.680
 activity therefore if a player or 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.920
 team becomes inactive 10 days 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.650
 they will receive a lp penalty 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.290
 when they see their lp reduced to zero 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.460
 will be immediately taken down to diamond 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.800
 one with 50 of slight wow with 50 of lepe 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.229
 imagine when you simply this degree 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.850
 master riot is going to restart the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.160
 inactivity counters 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.259
 only teams only 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.720
 I repeat the teams but not just 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.680
 that follows the air 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.960
 when added 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.060
 to the people that are in the dry grass that 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.580
 play enough and put the batteries 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.080
 guys and do not stay active and that was 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.210
 more than anything of any doubt if 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.590
 they have leave it in the comments like this 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.270
 that I repeat that was for everyone 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.040
 those who have doubts about this degree 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.480
 teacher any question leave it at 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.580
