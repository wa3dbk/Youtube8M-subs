 hello everybody is that the owner of the site dn 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.540
 dot com 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.559
 and I'm going to show you this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.420
 application that i did in java is to be 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.670
 to communicate with the printer this 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 my teacher little time that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.650
 this application works here I have the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.920
 serial ports available on your computer 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 because in my case you only have one session in the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.430
 which ports the printer's speed 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.820
 19,200 standard click Connect 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.079
 connected 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.510
 here I am going to dictate our pec 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:48.320
 incriminate printer anything is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:54.809
 to send a button down send 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:01:00.300
 predicted only one advance the advance of the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:05.100
 paper and predicted it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:09.630
 He's a guy who's going to stay, is he? 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.960
 already put a must fill what he 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.580
 Does it break if time 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 for example a very extensive test and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.400
 break according to the columns that have 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.400
 on the printer 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.510
 You can not even see he printed that the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.510
 people put it there 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.350
 good it's a very simple project yes secret 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.180
 which simply communicates another 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.450
 way to see in the previous video I 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.550
 I showed that the one connected by the cut 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 but then that's what I did I came 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.750
 saturation actor but that's what to format 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.810
 Our text is good 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.229
 for now it's only doubt can 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.050
