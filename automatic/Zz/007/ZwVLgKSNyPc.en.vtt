 our new design in the kitchen with 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.939
 boss 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.220
 starting with the recipe very easy to 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:46.460
 dumpling with tomato sauce 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:56.170
 I hope you enjoy a visit to the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:58.790
 famous from the north 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.520
 First we'll cut the onion. 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.979
 so the chili strips us too 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.960
 can put strips or squares 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.539
 how it gets better 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.440
 frying pan with olive oil to 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.420
 people will revoke the onion and the 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.259
 while you are reshaping the onion 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.060
 and the chili 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:25.270
 We're going to prepare ground beef now. 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.780
 with 12 years egg salt and ground pepper 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.330
 mixing well 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.280

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.530
 well today and then just make the balls 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.899
 one with a lot of patience and a lot of 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.970
 tranquility 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.690
 Meanwhile the onion the sweet pepper 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.700
 are saffron 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.080
 in the same pan we made the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.020
 onion and chili 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.280
 We now add coins with a 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.190
 car and a spoon 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.440
 You can circling slowly 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.840
 lasting each side of the americas 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.780
 then we put the onion and the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.780
 peppers to braise all together 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.780
 we keep braising a little bit 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.180
 more and then just add the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.820
 tomato sauce that in this case people 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.950

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.040
 a little salt and sugar in it 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.640
 amount to break the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:38.510
 the acidity of the tomato that we will leave 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.590
