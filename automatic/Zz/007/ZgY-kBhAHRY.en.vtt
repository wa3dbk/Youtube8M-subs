00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.370
 When was the last time you ate? 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.800
 Are you sure? 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.600
 Enjoy your meal 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.330
 From the director of Mean Girls 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.700
 Thank you 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.800
 What are friends for? 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.990
 based on the best-selling novel 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.500
 I should probably emphasize the fact that 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.800
 my best friend, Lissa Dragomir 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.800
 is a member of the royal family of an ancient race 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.460
 and yes, like most fang creatures 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.500
 they live on blood 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.930
 My name is Rose Hathaway 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.900
 and I promised to protect the royal lineage with my life 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.550
 Wake up! 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.400
 Rose Hathaway is wild 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 dangerous 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.550
 undisciplined 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
 right here, people, right here 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.900
 I heard you are good at making two guys at one time 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.670
 This is the Vampire Academy 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.300
 please don't say Academy of Vampires 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.200

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.300

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.250
 get away whore, it's mine now 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.800
 God, I hate high school 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.250
 Lissa is a possible heir to the throne 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 you should know it now with us weird don't start covering it 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.100
 OMG 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.990
 I don't know what will happen tonight 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 at this point I cannot remember who loves us and who hates us 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.300
 let's do it tonight 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.000
 Their 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.350
 suck 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.200
 at school 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.700
 There are the biggest threats out there 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.450
 Let's keep our heads down and stay off the radar 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 Is the "off the radar" plan working, height? 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 Not much 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.050
 What are you thinking about? Trust me, you don't want to have a broken nose in Montana 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.750
 A woman, especially one who does not live by blood and magic, 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.750
 is about to have his mood swings 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.800
 everyone saw that I tried to take the good step ... more or less
