00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 Hello everyone today mt 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.809
 0 cell I would like continue to here of vehicle introduction 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.320
 Hmm 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:26.590
 First, to the words Let's look at the whole this is the engine 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.990
 It is three cylinders of 689 cc 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:36.239
 Fuel tank capacity 13 guitar melodies 1 24 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.239
 The family has become a running each 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:56.240
 New Paipanu feel the era Beuve length specific Oh from this 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:01.450
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.210
 I think that you can understand those who have seen md 00, but some shrin is an impression 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.619
 It is an ordinary impression 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:13.350
 In next year as a polisher also at zero nine is fine 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:18.550
 The turbo-like handle is a little closer than before even if it looks like a little 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 Has become a position, such as was good until I do not anymore a little natural now 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.900
 It is more than I I guess punk 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.880
 But it is in a new form of love that is shaped 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.829
 And here is the point of China a little 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.829
 It's a heavy here 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:41.909
 By making the area narrow and narrow, I also made a degree of footsteps more often . 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.060
 And let's go back tail lamp 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.490
 It is nowadays the design has become a new feeling of design 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.720
 It was 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.720
 Put a little , 23 e 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:01.510
 I do application of this kind of feeling of the tail 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:06.370
 Following I know accommodated now comes with, but first here to the net folder 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.430
 Since this is already a well-known Yamaha car's Met Holder, I will omit the explanation 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.910
 I am 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.819
 And there is one more key here and the king is so 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.749
 There is a sheet behind 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.749
 It is such a form 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.660
 There is the person highest peak storage space here 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.660
 Please take a look at this 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:31.710
 I would like to put ec This is jrm 11 most major thing 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.710
 It looks like it can be stored in this way 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:41.480
 It looks like this when you install etc 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.480
 It is a little bit wider than mt 0, but it looks a little bit wider as space 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.200
 It is the back of the seat, but with this feeling Kofu comes with a little driver and hexagon 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.250
 It is a wrench 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.100
 There is a band here, but by opening this 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.700
 Good luck with motorcycles 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.840
 In the form say yeah make it easier to live it is a luggage 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.840
 It will be an image that comes out 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:13.650
 of a of very size it's 18 round Bo Bo 17 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:15.090
 There comes to this behind This is the same size and say mt 0 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.420
 correct 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.300
 The air pressure is completely different, but the back is 2.7 k 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.970
 I will enter in the front with the a m key 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:30.430
 Here is a little flame hand No. function also good behind even such a place since become the standard 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.950
 I think you're playing because the previous character is next 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.950
 Then let's spend a little ad 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.490
 Turn on the key 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.230
 In this state it is the same as mt 0, by lowering this kill switch 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.230
 ag can be applied 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.820
 rar 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.370
 goo 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.170
 uh 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.220
 ni 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.220
 It seems very easy to ride 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.820
 So want to be a description of the meter do you think when the key in on 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:28.389
 It meter will have action here 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:32.969
 In it is the first this fuel system fuel gauge watch 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:36.360
 But then it has become a gear position indicator Now this one 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:38.560
 It looks like this is a neutral Newtown lamp lights up 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.990
 a now it is -4 u 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.750
 In place to put the gear is 12 volumes or 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:49.230
 Then there were nine people who were speedometers 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:54.450
 Please pay attention to this first 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:58.639
 If you press this button, it is an odometer from now, but if you press it once 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:03.560
 Polyp 1 will be a trick to press once more 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:07.250
 And if it pushes once more, it will become an instant fuel consumption meter 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:12.080
 And one more time I will be fit average 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.920
 I think that this is hold painter because you are running how much oil was from the 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.880
 Press again one time a 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.969
 This 40 degrees made by you, but the sound It is a water temperature gauge by 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.740
 a 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:30.810
 If you press it again, it will be an air thermometer quick clock, yes 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.810
 And it has become a form such that the meter in such form's maiden go around 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:38.550
 What everyone like how 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:42.009
 mt 0 sheet mt 0 7 I still think that there are more cases in the number of buyers 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:47.139
 I think that there is the charm of me me cell that you can push meg 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:51.810
 Please come to see by all means feel free to so you can also test drive in the way of shops 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.810
 Well then again in the next video
