we got this big boy hole here and but I

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.800 
we got this big boy hole here and but I
went<00:06:44.090> through<00:06:44.240> the<00:06:44.330> bellows<00:06:44.690> to<00:06:44.930> find<00:06:45.710> my<00:06:45.830> tag

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
went through the bellows to find my tag

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.510 
went through the bellows to find my tag
I<00:06:47.810> saw<00:06:48.200> right<00:06:48.410> away<00:06:48.470> that<00:06:48.680> the<00:06:49.040> last<00:06:49.280> two

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
I saw right away that the last two

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.709 
I saw right away that the last two
digits<00:06:49.970> of<00:06:50.150> the<00:06:50.210> tag<00:06:50.600> number<00:06:51.050> was

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:51.719 
digits of the tag number was

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:53.570 
digits of the tag number was
date<00:06:51.959> so<00:06:52.319> I<00:06:52.559> kind<00:06:52.860> of<00:06:52.919> had<00:06:53.039> a<00:06:53.069> feeling<00:06:53.309> that

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
date so I kind of had a feeling that

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.059 
date so I kind of had a feeling that
might<00:06:53.849> just<00:06:54.179> be<00:06:54.330> a<00:06:54.360> good<00:06:54.449> omen<00:06:54.860> once<00:06:55.860> in<00:06:56.009> a

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.069 
might just be a good omen once in a

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.469 
might just be a good omen once in a
while<00:06:56.219> good<00:06:56.429> luck<00:06:56.669> does<00:06:56.909> come<00:06:57.149> my<00:06:57.299> way<00:06:57.330> and

00:06:59.469 --> 00:06:59.479 
while good luck does come my way and

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:09.470 
while good luck does come my way and
thanks<00:07:00.479> again<00:07:00.629> guys
