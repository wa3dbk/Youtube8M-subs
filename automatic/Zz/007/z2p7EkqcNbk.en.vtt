00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:14.480
 Good morning morning wonder if about 10 hours ago 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:21.369
 Before I go back to Japan, I thought it would be nice to take a beach 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.369
 I can not see this night at all, but it looks like this in the daytime 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.840
 It is a good Toko really 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.890
 Why is this beach on the beach 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.890
 And zoom 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.570
 Only the people of the hotel are here 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.570
 It is a beauty that I can not use 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.179
 Everybody wants to think 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.720
 I enjoy my vacation 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.570
 Even if this is a person who has people on the beach now 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.210
 Hmmm 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.100
 But there will be no 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.000
 It looks like it's from 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.170
 It is an image 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.170
 Even though this seems to be quite 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.940
 Not a little weather Unfortunately today 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.680
 Does cloudy 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.370
 So it kinda does the weather 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.150
 But maybe the company is about 30 degrees like that 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.150
 Yeah pretty hot 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.160
 To the main school 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.170
 The other side of the mountain is good 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.370
 Maybe there is a loan on this mountain top 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.760
 Was it a view point 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:09.880
 A cross over the mountain at Karon's view point is a pro and it's in full bloom 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.880
 It is the southernmost tip of Phuket Island 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:20.030
 It's amazing It's amazing because the horizon is wrong 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.020
 The other side of this 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.150
 It's like Sri Lanka or Sri Lanka or Indian Ocean. 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.290
 Sorry a little blur 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.290
 I was not in focus 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.600
 The bottom of the unko is 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.600
 This is the 3rd floor 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.560
 It stands this but Bakri 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.470
 I'm preparing to change it a little, so leave it here 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.470
 See you soon
