00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:13.260
 Hello Andrew Tkachev 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:17.890
 August 9 settled settled our 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.349
 prospectors we are on July 23 ie there are eight 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.730
 days in July and nine days in August 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:27.130
 that is, you waited we all got here 17 days 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.519
 that's how it is supposed to be two weeks so he and 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.439
 full so we make it like this she 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.309
 everything looks like that is everything is covered for me 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.480
 that the sun did not fall 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:49.600
 directly on the worms cardboard 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:59.859
 here I put the temperature degrees 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:00.489
 measure that is our ordinary artisanal 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.680
 conditions 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.809
 perfect do it all on concrete 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.679
 the reason you never 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.979
 drove no higher well we start with 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:14.409
 The usual sandy base and already 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.930
 next year we will do more 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.799
 culturally when we already know how here 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:26.009
 try our winters so let's 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.009
 let's see here we have passed 17 days 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.630
 when they came yes here's a video about 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.179
 how they came from us 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.130
 I showed they were very thin and not 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.619
 were thin barely moving 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:47.259
 that is, as if the long moving food 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:47.259
 apparently already over here we see 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 that is, we already see such full-bodied 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:04.200
 active you we all see some 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 dripped back a little to the side 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.450
 that's about this border poured 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.660
 retreat a little to the side in order 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.680
 to understand they are going for a meal or not 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.810
 see what we see are fat fat 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.209
 corpulent ie all the same and our food 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.840
 they like that is so fat 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:29.250
 one was not then when we only them 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:36.120
 got a look a little different 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:40.590
 place a bunch of us all the manure we have 1 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.220
 The place is already between Artur and yes 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.410
 we have 1 place so as if everywhere will be 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.209
 the result is the same here we are cardboard 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.269
 remove and here they are here too 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.400
 cassation and already visible to the spilled 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.280
 here on top if you look closely here I am right now 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.650
 I need to raise higher 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.200
 already visible balls small balls they 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.200
 already thrown to the surface 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.030
 by him 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:21.960
 where is all the same all 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:26.670
 principle in the whole heap all active all 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:34.050
 hiding from the sun that is 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:37.510
 Basically a good result here is another place 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.610
 everywhere everywhere they became several times 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.700
 fatter 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.740
 but significantly fatter that is, we even 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.740
 about such here it was not yes 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.960
 that is, on the whole, it turns out that 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.980
 our food and suits them then 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.290
 what's in a bit of straw is that a lot 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.820
 passed rainwater all over admired 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:09.790
 ammonia and all that they did not need 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:13.240
 I have repeatedly noticed that even at 100 and 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.930
 when you make out manure for processing 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.280
 plants and then you throw away the worms from 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.400
 this residue is dry 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:27.060
 he always likes that is not to 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.800
 there was at least the minimum 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.730
 some heavy impurities in the match 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 ammonia that is basic reason 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.910
 today's video is that you can 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.270
 easy to relocate the worm we now we 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.150
 bought worms in the south of russia brought them 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.660
 to the north they traveled a few 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.680
 thousand kilometers and other climatic 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.860
 zone 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.370
 other water another different food another 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.060
 manure is different but they are themselves 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.970
 feel great 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.130
 that is, I have now purchased a device for 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.800
 determine the acid-base balance and 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.130
 in the near future we once again all 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.880
 check check test in all 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.139
 parts of the pile, that is, and we will probably 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.889
 carry out some kind of 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:22.430
 experiments at the expense of different-different 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.230
 acidity in different places in order 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.340
 to understand what kind of environment they are after all 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:31.160
 More like to live probably while on 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.840
 this is all health and happiness 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.840
 our fate goodbye
