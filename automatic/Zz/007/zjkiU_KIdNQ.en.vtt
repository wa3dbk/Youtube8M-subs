00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.700
 Then I want to make Santa's boots with origami 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.219
 First fold the origami in half 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.219
 Firmly put on the fruit 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.119
 Turn over to the other side 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.519
 I understand how about a centimeter 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.730
 Turn over again 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.730
 I will turn to the middle battle 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 The other side is the same 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.870
 Wrap 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.960
 And again 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.019
 We fold into Asami in the middle 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.409
 And 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.409
 I will bear fruit here 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.579
 And back 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.950
 According to this crease 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.000
 Diagonally 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.000
 You creased 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.860
 An oblique crease was made here 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.860
 Next is from the crease we made first 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.390
 Launch back 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.470
 And here is a bag 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.640
 I'm done, so open this 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.640
 Crush the middle 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.590
 Become involved in the form 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.460
 This advertisement a 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.460
 I am 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.030
 And 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.030
 Available to you in the middle 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:21.990
 As it came to shape like 5 boots, as the last finish 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.990
 A little bit diagonally 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.900
 And to this dream come true 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.900
 Fold in 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.400
 The other side is the same 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.400
 Both corners 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.650
 Fold inside 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.970
 The boot is ready when you change the direction
