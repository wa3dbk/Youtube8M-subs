00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
my first thought saying so you can get a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.840 
my first thought saying so you can get a
look<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.090> her<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.479> depth<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.920> uh<00:01:28.950> her<00:01:29.369> passive

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.780 
me that it's not really a great passive
it<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.720> probably<00:01:46.500> will<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:47.009> team<00:01:47.520> fights

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it can it probably will for team fights

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.520 
it can it probably will for team fights
it'll<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.420> good<00:01:48.689> because<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.380> know

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it'll be really good because you know

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
it'll be really good because you know
you<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> kill<00:01:50.130> it'll<00:01:50.759> give<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> nice

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
you get a kill it'll give you a nice

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.469 
you get a kill it'll give you a nice
movie<00:01:51.600> speed<00:01:51.899> boot<00:01:52.170> buff<00:01:52.829> too<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:54.270> you're

movie speed boot buff too if you're

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.139 
movie speed boot buff too if you're
going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.689> kite<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.320> bit<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.710> maybe

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
going to kite a little bit or maybe

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.190 
going to kite a little bit or maybe
reposition<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.509> out<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.750> teamfight<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
reposition and get out of teamfight a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
reposition and get out of teamfight a
little<00:01:58.500> bit<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.130> know<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.909> 10<00:02:00.119> fights<00:02:00.420> I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
little bit you know I so in 10 fights I

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.760 
little bit you know I so in 10 fights I
think<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.840> gonna<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.049> good<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.469> as<00:02:01.530> far<00:02:01.710> as

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
think it's gonna be good but as far as

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.440 
think it's gonna be good but as far as
like<00:02:02.009> lightning<00:02:02.460> goes<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.270> be

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
like lightning goes it's not going to be

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.810 
like lightning goes it's not going to be
a<00:02:03.630> huge<00:02:04.259> deal<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.250> obviously<00:02:05.430> you're

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
a huge deal because you obviously you're

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.600 
a huge deal because you obviously you're
not<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.210> getting<00:02:06.770> too<00:02:07.770> many<00:02:08.099> kills

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610
