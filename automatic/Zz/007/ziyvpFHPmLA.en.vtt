my show is a red bastard and people

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.550 
my show is a red bastard and people
should<00:00:13.679> go<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:14.160> because<00:00:15.170> it's<00:00:16.170> an<00:00:16.350> actual

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
should go see because it's an actual

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.470 
should go see because it's an actual
experience<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.580> think<00:00:17.789> it's<00:00:17.910> something<00:00:18.119> where

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
experience I think it's something where

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.980 
experience I think it's something where
you're<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.670> watching<00:00:20.670> something

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
you're not just watching something

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.689 
you're not just watching something
happen<00:00:21.990> up<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.010> stage<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> sort<00:00:23.670> of

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
happen up on this stage and sort of

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.429 
happen up on this stage and sort of
analyzing<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.750> an<00:00:24.900> experience

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
analyzing it it's like an experience

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.460 
analyzing it it's like an experience
that<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.800> are<00:00:26.160> immersed<00:00:26.939> into<00:00:27.470> literally

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
that you are immersed into literally

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.370 
that you are immersed into literally
kind<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.160> what<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.510> trapped<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.230> you're

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
kind of what I'm so trapped but you're

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.200 
kind of what I'm so trapped but you're

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
the show is about being in the same
space<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.820> monster<00:00:36.059> oh<00:00:38.510> it's<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.629> over

encouraged me to pour i can make a
living<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.479> now<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.810> pretty

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
living out of it now which is pretty

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.520 
living out of it now which is pretty
good<00:01:10.350> little<00:01:10.790> yeah<00:01:13.340> that<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> changing

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
good little yeah that is changing

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
good little yeah that is changing
because<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:17.009> getting<00:01:17.340> older<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
because as I'm getting older I think I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.020 
because as I'm getting older I think I
find<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.860> reasons<00:01:20.400> why<00:01:20.549> I'm<00:01:20.610> doing<00:01:20.820> are

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
find that the reasons why I'm doing are

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
find that the reasons why I'm doing are
not<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> same<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.560> sort<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
not the same which is one was sort of

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.910 
not the same which is one was sort of
like<00:01:23.090> public<00:01:24.090> validation<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.530> think

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
like public validation which I think

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.670 
like public validation which I think
that<00:01:26.750> probably<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:28.049> more<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.439> than<00:01:28.500> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that probably was more there than I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.929 
that probably was more there than I
thought<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.729> away

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
thought but I think that's going away

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.859 
thought but I think that's going away
now<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:31.110> I'm<00:01:32.329> finding<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> be

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
now so I'm finding that that is to be

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.620 
now so I'm finding that that is to be
discovered<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.850> don't<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
discovered so like I don't have the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.280 
discovered so like I don't have the
screaming<00:01:37.560> necessity<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.850> stage<00:01:39.060> now

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
screaming necessity to be on stage now

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.620 
screaming necessity to be on stage now
so<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.369> I'll<00:01:41.640> know<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.150> about<00:01:42.299> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
so I think I'll know more about that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
so I think I'll know more about that
next<00:01:42.689> six<00:01:43.170> months<00:01:43.380> year<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.369> will

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
next six months year I think that will

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.700 
next six months year I think that will
change<00:01:44.570> what<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.689> doing<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.110> how<00:01:46.259> I'm<00:01:46.439> doing

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
change what I'm doing and how I'm doing

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.990 
change what I'm doing and how I'm doing
my<00:01:46.770> part<00:01:47.899> of<00:01:48.899> beautiful<00:01:49.470> things<00:01:49.500> on

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.930 

a<00:01:52.090> chance<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:53.080> consider<00:01:53.620> things<00:01:54.040> in<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.910> way

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
a chance to consider things in a way

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.730 
a chance to consider things in a way
that<00:01:55.150> is<00:01:55.510> not<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.460> level<00:01:57.580> of<00:01:58.150> daily<00:01:58.630> life<00:01:58.840> you

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
that is not at a level of daily life you

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.450 
that is not at a level of daily life you
know<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:01.420> can<00:02:01.810> take<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> picture<00:02:02.410> of<00:02:02.920> something

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
know you can take a picture of something

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.670 
know you can take a picture of something
as<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.630> happens<00:02:04.930> in<00:02:05.020> your<00:02:05.050> life<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.470> there's<00:02:05.590> a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
as it happens in your life and there's a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.500 
as it happens in your life and there's a
chance<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.160> explore<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:06.729> at<00:02:06.910> a<00:02:06.940> heightened<00:02:07.360> way

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
chance to explore it at a heightened way

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.900 
chance to explore it at a heightened way
