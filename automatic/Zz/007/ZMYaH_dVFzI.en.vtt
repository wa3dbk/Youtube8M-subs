00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.140 
this actually is the keyboard from that
netbook<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.490> if<00:01:14.490> you're<00:01:14.670> familiar<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
netbook so if you're familiar with that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
netbook so if you're familiar with that
one<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:16.290> will<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.009> exact

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

a high-density version but it is still
suck<00:02:34.959> cell<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.440> will<00:02:35.530> give<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.680> pretty

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
suck cell and it will give a pretty

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.550 
suck cell and it will give a pretty
substantial<00:02:36.790> battery<00:02:37.090> life<00:02:37.270> which<00:02:38.140> I'll<00:02:38.350> get

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
substantial battery life which I'll get

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.900 
substantial battery life which I'll get
to<00:02:38.620> more<00:02:39.190> during<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.850> review<00:02:40.209> later<00:02:41.910> I'm

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
to more during the review later I'm

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.680 
to more during the review later I'm
going<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.090> go<00:02:43.180> ahead<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.330> power<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.930> now

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
going to go ahead and power this on now

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.690 
going to go ahead and power this on now
ok<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.900> spent<00:02:47.230> some<00:02:47.320> time<00:02:47.380> playing<00:02:48.100> around

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
ok so I spent some time playing around

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.890 
ok so I spent some time playing around
with<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.739> 1001<00:02:50.739> p<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.300> one<00:02:52.300> thing<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.540> noticed

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
with the 1001 p and one thing I noticed

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.300 
with the 1001 p and one thing I noticed
is<00:02:52.989> that<00:02:53.050> they've<00:02:53.350> actually<00:02:53.560> forgotten<00:02:54.100> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
is that they've actually forgotten the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.440 
is that they've actually forgotten the
dimpled<00:02:54.790> texture<00:02:55.720> that's<00:02:55.930> normally<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.530> come

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450

think<00:03:00.070> this<00:03:00.250> is<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.430> bad<00:03:00.610> thing<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:01.030> was<00:03:01.209> able<00:03:01.330> to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
think this is a bad thing I was able to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.690 
think this is a bad thing I was able to
navigate<00:03:02.320> just<00:03:02.830> fine<00:03:02.980> i<00:03:03.010> think<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.549> nice

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
touch pad as i did mention before this
is<00:03:07.299> about<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.720> exact<00:03:08.019> same<00:03:08.320> keyboard<00:03:08.590> as<00:03:08.920> a

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
is about the exact same keyboard as a

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.430 
is about the exact same keyboard as a
1000<00:03:11.250> 8h<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.570> which<00:03:13.570> isn't<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.870> bad<00:03:13.900> thing<00:03:14.049> i<00:03:14.290> like

then a keyboard locking you can also see

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.699 
then a keyboard locking you can also see
for<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.060> profile<00:03:52.510> view<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:52.930> pretty<00:03:53.230> it's
