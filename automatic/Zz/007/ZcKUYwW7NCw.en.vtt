 Hey guys, make videos today. I'm 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 here bringing a video where it is 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.299
 firing the shots and if something here 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.610
 approximately 30 meters with the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.300
 carabine 125 radio equipped with a 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.910
 then you get an idea of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.670
 with the center of the small 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.000
 it was 10 cents plus one 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.480
 distance of 30 meters is quite 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.010
 hardly visible this point the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 leaders of SÃ£o Paulo where he approached 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.520
 five and a half with a steel ball in the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.320
 tip 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.810
 it has a very large impact force 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.100
 it's a now let's see gun show here 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.430

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.530
 We'll do the tests later, okay? 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 people here showing nobody's face 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.110
 who will be shooting 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.199
 as I said to the radio 101 5're having 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.200
 a very good power 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.759
 So here she is, then, guys. 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 flowers for material 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.880
 It's kwai down there but a distance 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.530

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.190
 when about ten shots 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:49.900
 there is a town hall 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.900
 Let's see how it goes. 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:13.080
 The first shot from up there is going well. 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.080
 far is not difficult to watch television 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.660
 let's go 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.620
 good second 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.590
 I think then missed it there 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.440
 football is 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.709
 a third of Maria 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.769
 underneath the square now let's do 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.769

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.670

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.670

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:30.290
 the style of good in the lytha line of 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:36.080
 affection turned white O show're in there 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:38.310

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.650
 OK 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.650
 but for the 5th in the shot 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:03.330
 the style of a fly line year music 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.350
 It's a distance of about 40 meters 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.570
 butterfly 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:17.420
 ok let's go the sixth shot you guys 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:21.470
 so I up there 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.240
 the two of us upstairs will meet 17 a 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.070
 shot 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.070
 the staff our last shot here 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.140
 There the truck went down, let's see how that 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.800
 gotta get up it's here the staff at 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:47.570
 box with the same eight days for one 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.600
 error returned in the center on the album another one 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:55.060
 the other line is a little lower and 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:59.000
 two gave up there one on the side 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.470
 right and another on the edge it almost came out 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.750
 from the album 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.920
 I thought of a distance of approximately 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.910
 40 meters 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.910
