hi<00:00:01.580> so<00:00:02.580> I'm<00:00:02.939> here<00:00:03.330> witness<00:00:04.020> program<00:00:04.230> will

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
hi so I'm here witness program will

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.789 
hi so I'm here witness program will
power<00:00:04.799> supply<00:00:05.190> again<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:06.259> this<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.589> final

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
power supply again and this is the final

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.060 
power supply again and this is the final
setup<00:00:08.099> how<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:08.460> will<00:00:08.580> look<00:00:08.610> like<00:00:09.260> so<00:00:10.260> are<00:00:10.860> this

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
setup how it will look like so are this

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.850 
setup how it will look like so are this
the<00:00:11.219> keyboard<00:00:12.080> through<00:00:13.080> which<00:00:13.259> I'll<00:00:13.440> punch<00:00:13.710> in

the set voltage and set current now
these<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:17.010> some<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> fields<00:00:17.730> which<00:00:17.850> I

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
these are some of the fields which I

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.029 
these are some of the fields which I
have<00:00:18.119> left<00:00:18.330> which<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:18.960> left<00:00:19.170> blank

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
have left which I have left blank

have left which I have left blank
I'll<00:00:20.750> set<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> program<00:00:22.170> later<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.460> is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
I'll set the program later on this is

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.330 
I'll set the program later on this is
the<00:00:23.730> control<00:00:24.150> guard<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.750> has<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.320> peak<00:00:25.529> 18<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> 4<00:00:26.189> 5

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the control guard it has a peak 18 a 4 5

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.290 
the control guard it has a peak 18 a 4 5
to<00:00:26.519> 0<00:00:27.439> this<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> muscle<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.609> inner

power supply it's a 2 and 3 0.5 NPN
transistor<00:00:36.230> basically<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.620> drives<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.070> linear

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
transistor basically it drives in linear

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.040 
transistor basically it drives in linear
mode<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.420> how<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.750> different

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
mode and that's how I get different

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.440

voltage<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> LCD<00:00:42.649> this<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
voltage this is the LCD this is the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.260 
voltage this is the LCD this is the
analog<00:00:45.450> board<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.770> has<00:00:46.800> our<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.730> our<00:00:47.760> deck

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
analog board which has our to our deck

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.470 
analog board which has our to our deck
some<00:00:49.020> transistors<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:50.210> for<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.449> know

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
some transistors for for you know

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.650 
some transistors for for you know
supplying<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.199> base<00:00:52.530> current<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.300> this<00:00:54.300> big

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
supplying the base current of this big

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.060 
supplying the base current of this big
trouble<00:00:54.899> stone<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.800> some<00:00:55.920> voltage

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
trouble stone and there is some voltage

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.290 
trouble stone and there is some voltage
regulator<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.000> an<00:00:57.090> error

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
regulator and there is an error

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270 
regulator and there is an error
amplifier<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.440> basically<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.920> an<00:00:59.010> op-amp

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
amplifier so basically it's an op-amp

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.280 
amplifier so basically it's an op-amp
lm35<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.180> which<00:01:00.949> takes<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.190> reference

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
lm35 it which takes the reference

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
lm35 it which takes the reference
reference<00:01:04.309> from<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> art<00:01:05.760> vertex<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
reference from the art vertex so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.810 
reference from the art vertex so
micrometer<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.680> sets<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.130> set<00:01:08.460> voltage

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
micrometer actually sets the set voltage

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.710 
micrometer actually sets the set voltage
and<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:10.170> gets<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.150> get<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> feedback<00:01:12.540> from

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
and it gets the get the feedback from

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.170 
and it gets the get the feedback from
this<00:01:13.200> voltage<00:01:14.070> divider<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.140> that's<00:01:16.140> how<00:01:16.320> it

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
this voltage divider and that's how it

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.499 
this voltage divider and that's how it
drives<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.450> base<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:20.040> transistor<00:01:20.509> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
drives the base of this transistor so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.440 
drives the base of this transistor so
let<00:01:21.990> me<00:01:22.170> switch<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> circuit<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:24.150> how

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
let me switch on the circuit and see how

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.950 
let me switch on the circuit and see how
does<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.720> work<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:29.390> some<00:01:30.390> initial

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
does it work so some initial

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.380 
does it work so some initial
screen<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.640> see<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.969> the<00:01:36.119> zero

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
screen so as you can see in the zero

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
screen so as you can see in the zero
voltage<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.579> almost<00:01:38.579> zero<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.110> here<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:41.070> let

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
voltage is almost zero here here so let

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.139 
voltage is almost zero here here so let
me<00:01:41.460> set<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.789> voltage<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.289> zero<00:01:43.759> zero<00:01:44.759> point

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
me set the voltage of zero zero point

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.899 
me set the voltage of zero zero point
zero<00:01:45.420> zero<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.520> voltage<00:01:47.610> zero

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
zero zero so this is the voltage zero

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.149 
zero zero so this is the voltage zero
point<00:01:48.149> zero<00:01:48.179> zero<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.829> voltage

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
point zero zero you can see the voltage

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:58.069 
point zero zero you can see the voltage
is<00:01:50.250> zero<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:51.090> let<00:01:51.420> me<00:01:51.600> increase<00:01:55.429> 0.01<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:57.079> as

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
is zero now let me increase 0.01 and as

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.130 
is zero now let me increase 0.01 and as
you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:59.729> has<00:01:59.939> actually<00:02:00.329> gone<00:02:00.659> close

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you can see it has actually gone close

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.339 
you can see it has actually gone close
to<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.090> has<00:02:03.240> gone<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.630> hundred<00:02:03.659> below<00:02:04.110> so

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
to so it has gone to hundred below so

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.169 
to so it has gone to hundred below so
let<00:02:04.560> me<00:02:04.709> again<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.979> set<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.520> zero<00:02:05.700> zero<00:02:06.149> zero

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
let me again a set it to zero zero zero

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.350 
let me again a set it to zero zero zero
zero<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.130> zero<00:02:08.310> voltage<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
zero so this is the zero voltage and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.460 
zero so this is the zero voltage and
when<00:02:10.049> I<00:02:10.079> press<00:02:10.470> zero<00:02:10.890> zero<00:02:11.579> one<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:13.319> actually

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
when I press zero zero one it actually

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.569 
when I press zero zero one it actually
goes<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.780> 100<00:02:15.780> millivolts<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
goes to 100 millivolts so this is the

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.420 
goes to 100 millivolts so this is the
least<00:02:18.110> voltage<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.349> can<00:02:19.530> apply<00:02:19.739> now<00:02:20.010> let

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
least voltage that I can apply now let

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.190 
least voltage that I can apply now let
me<00:02:20.549> press<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.970> zero<00:02:21.299> zero<00:02:21.329> P<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.959> again

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
me press the zero zero P it is again

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.240 
me press the zero zero P it is again
close<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.620> 200<00:02:26.010> millivolts<00:02:26.459> 0<00:02:27.269> 0<00:02:27.690> 3<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:29.220> is

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
close to 200 millivolts 0 0 3 it is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.110 
close to 200 millivolts 0 0 3 it is
again<00:02:29.660> closed<00:02:30.660> about<00:02:31.459> okay<00:02:32.459> it's<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.880> very

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
again closed about okay it's not very

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.270 
again closed about okay it's not very
close<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.569> okay<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:33.959> significantly<00:02:34.860> goes<00:02:35.099> to

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
close but okay it significantly goes to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.220 
close but okay it significantly goes to
300<00:02:36.060> millivolts<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.569> that's<00:02:36.780> what<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.049> set

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
300 millivolts and that's what is set

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.680 
300 millivolts and that's what is set
now<00:02:37.920> let's<00:02:38.310> put<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.639> bigger<00:02:38.910> voltage<00:02:39.239> first

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
now let's put the bigger voltage first

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.390 
now let's put the bigger voltage first
let<00:02:39.989> me<00:02:40.019> set<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.500> 12<00:02:41.190> volts<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:43.139> is<00:02:43.260> 1<00:02:43.560> 2

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
let me set to 12 volts so it is 1 2

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.220 
let me set to 12 volts so it is 1 2
point<00:02:45.000> 0<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.180> see<00:02:48.359> it<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.690> 12<00:02:48.989> volts

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230

nicely<00:03:40.720> let's<00:03:41.720> check<00:03:42.019> with<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.590> load<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.849> this

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
nicely let's check with a load so this

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.360 
nicely let's check with a load so this
is<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.540> load<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.170> I'll<00:03:45.470> run<00:03:45.709> this<00:03:45.860> DC<00:03:46.190> motor

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
is the load so I'll run this DC motor

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.970 
is the load so I'll run this DC motor
and<00:03:46.730> let's<00:03:47.209> see<00:03:47.360> how<00:03:47.840> does<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.170> vary<00:03:48.349> so<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:48.739> have

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
and let's see how does it vary so I have

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.160 
and let's see how does it vary so I have
set<00:03:49.190> up<00:03:49.220> my<00:03:49.489> load<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.569> is<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.690> DC<00:03:51.019> motor

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
set up my load and this is the DC motor

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.080 
set up my load and this is the DC motor
is<00:03:51.260> connected<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:51.950> right<00:03:52.130> now<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.549> voltage<00:03:52.819> is

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
is connected so right now the voltage is

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.740 
is connected so right now the voltage is
zero<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.760> modem<00:03:56.060> is<00:03:56.120> not<00:03:56.299> running<00:03:56.480> so

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
zero and the modem is not running so

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.009 
zero and the modem is not running so
we'll<00:03:57.380> let<00:03:57.560> us<00:03:57.799> set<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.250> voltage<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.730> about

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
we'll let us set the voltage to about

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:06.009 
we'll let us set the voltage to about
five<00:04:00.019> volts<00:04:00.470> which<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:02.200> zero<00:04:03.200> five<00:04:03.890> zero<00:04:05.019> and

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.080 
five volts which is zero five zero and
as<00:04:06.170> you<00:04:06.260> can<00:04:06.380> see<00:04:06.440> set<00:04:06.709> voltage<00:04:06.859> is<00:04:07.130> 5<00:04:07.370> this

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
as you can see set voltage is 5 this

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.240 
as you can see set voltage is 5 this
four<00:04:08.450> point<00:04:08.690> seven<00:04:08.870> eight<00:04:09.109> and<00:04:09.380> my<00:04:09.440> motor<00:04:10.130> is

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
four point seven eight and my motor is

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.030 
four point seven eight and my motor is
running<00:04:10.519> and<00:04:11.480> if<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.750> hear<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.170> noise<00:04:12.350> but<00:04:12.859> my

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
running and if you hear the noise but my

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.979 
running and if you hear the noise but my
motor<00:04:13.250> is<00:04:13.340> actually<00:04:13.489> running<00:04:13.850> let<00:04:14.750> me

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
motor is actually running let me

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.380 
motor is actually running let me
increase<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.319> voltage<00:04:15.739> to<00:04:15.950> about<00:04:16.190> so<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.299> is

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
increase the voltage to about so this is

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.460 
increase the voltage to about so this is
the<00:04:17.479> screen<00:04:17.720> where<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:17.989> can<00:04:18.019> see<00:04:18.260> both

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
the screen where you can see both

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.620 
the screen where you can see both
emotion<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.100> voltage<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:20.030> let<00:04:20.269> me<00:04:20.419> set<00:04:20.570> it

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
emotion and the voltage so let me set it

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.840 
emotion and the voltage so let me set it
about<00:04:20.930> 12<00:04:21.229> volts<00:04:21.560> let's<00:04:21.859> see<00:04:22.010> how<00:04:22.160> much<00:04:22.340> is<00:04:22.640> the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
about 12 volts let's see how much is the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.820 
about 12 volts let's see how much is the
voltage<00:04:23.300> under<00:04:23.479> load<00:04:25.570> 12.0

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
voltage under load 12.0

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.059 
voltage under load 12.0
so<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.699> still<00:04:28.879> 12<00:04:29.090> volts<00:04:29.800> nice<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:31.039> is

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
so it is still 12 volts nice it is

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.950 
so it is still 12 volts nice it is
Xavier<00:04:31.580> woods<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.210> my<00:04:32.360> motor<00:04:32.569> is<00:04:32.690> running

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
Xavier woods and my motor is running

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.990 
Xavier woods and my motor is running
pretty<00:04:33.080> fast<00:04:33.789> and<00:04:34.789> no<00:04:35.750> recoil<00:04:36.849> fill<00:04:37.849> the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
pretty fast and no recoil fill the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.510 
pretty fast and no recoil fill the
transistor<00:04:38.449> and<00:04:39.289> not<00:04:39.530> hotter<00:04:39.889> though<00:04:40.129> in<00:04:40.340> fact

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
transistor and not hotter though in fact

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.710 
transistor and not hotter though in fact
the<00:04:40.669> current<00:04:40.849> wrong<00:04:41.120> way<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:41.389> motor<00:04:41.569> is<00:04:41.690> very

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
the current wrong way this motor is very

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.450 
the current wrong way this motor is very
small<00:04:42.050> so<00:04:42.229> effectively<00:04:42.949> this<00:04:43.129> transistor

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
2.0 so basically what we can do is I can

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.150 
2.0 so basically what we can do is I can
connect<00:05:55.560> it<00:05:55.680> to<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.770> PC<00:05:56.009> and<00:05:56.479> and<00:05:57.979> set<00:05:58.979> the

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
connect it to a PC and and set the

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.730 
connect it to a PC and and set the
voltage<00:05:59.310> through<00:05:59.820> a<00:06:00.030> V<00:06:00.780> be<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:00.990> front<00:06:01.380> end<00:06:01.560> or

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
voltage through a V be a front end or

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.930 
voltage through a V be a front end or
visible<00:06:02.639> front<00:06:02.940> end<00:06:03.560> also<00:06:04.560> I'm<00:06:05.400> planning<00:06:05.610> to

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
visible front end also I'm planning to

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.770 
visible front end also I'm planning to
put<00:06:06.210> this<00:06:06.479> entire<00:06:06.840> set<00:06:07.199> up<00:06:07.320> in<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.680> neat<00:06:07.889> box<00:06:08.780> so

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
put this entire set up in a neat box so

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.499 
put this entire set up in a neat box so
that<00:06:09.990> I<00:06:10.490> can<00:06:11.490> have<00:06:11.610> the<00:06:11.789> power<00:06:11.940> supply<00:06:12.270> and
