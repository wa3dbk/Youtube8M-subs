00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.539 
really want to see where the top edge is
that<00:03:44.440> you're<00:03:44.560> spreading<00:03:44.799> it<00:03:44.920> nice<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.130> evenly

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
gathered the slack out of the wrap just

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.350 
gathered the slack out of the wrap just
as<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:49.930> would<00:03:49.989> when<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.680> was<00:03:50.860> wrapping<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.610> new

days<00:05:27.169> after<00:05:27.440> they've<00:05:27.680> had<00:05:27.800> their<00:05:27.980> baby<00:05:28.160> and

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
days after they've had their baby and

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.840 
days after they've had their baby and
then<00:05:29.330> at<00:05:29.930> this<00:05:30.050> point<00:05:30.430> we're<00:05:31.430> going<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.580> tie<00:05:31.790> it

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
then at this point we're going to tie it

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.850 
then at this point we're going to tie it
off<00:05:32.030> then<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.300> can<00:05:32.419> see<00:05:32.600> this<00:05:32.750> one<00:05:33.050> is<00:05:33.800> a

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
off then you can see this one is a

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.379 
off then you can see this one is a
little<00:05:34.100> bit<00:05:34.190> less<00:05:34.340> flattering<00:05:34.700> overall<00:05:35.240> than

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
little bit less flattering overall than

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.200 
little bit less flattering overall than
the<00:05:35.450> first<00:05:35.660> one

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
the first one

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.840 
the first one
and<00:05:38.210> so<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:38.630> tended<00:05:39.169> to<00:05:39.260> just<00:05:39.440> wear<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.850> around

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
and so I tended to just wear it around

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.059 
and so I tended to just wear it around
the<00:05:40.940> office<00:05:41.080> not<00:05:42.080> so<00:05:42.260> much<00:05:42.380> after<00:05:42.560> public

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.309 

if<00:05:46.339> you<00:05:46.520> tie<00:05:46.669> hit<00:05:46.849> a<00:05:46.879> bit<00:05:46.999> higher<00:05:47.240> then<00:05:48.020> you'll

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
if you tie hit a bit higher then you'll

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.170 
if you tie hit a bit higher then you'll
find<00:05:48.589> that<00:05:48.710> it<00:05:48.830> actually<00:05:49.249> comes<00:05:49.909> all<00:05:50.029> the<00:05:50.119> way

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
find that it actually comes all the way

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.260 
find that it actually comes all the way
up<00:05:50.240> under<00:05:50.569> the<00:05:50.659> bus<00:05:50.809> which<00:05:51.740> can<00:05:52.009> be<00:05:52.339> more

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
up under the bus which can be more

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.510 
up under the bus which can be more
comfortable<00:05:53.509> if<00:05:53.869> you<00:05:53.960> feel<00:05:54.219> insecure<00:05:55.219> about

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
comfortable if you feel insecure about

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.070 
comfortable if you feel insecure about
your<00:05:55.669> postpartum<00:05:56.089> body<00:05:56.360> at<00:05:56.539> all<00:05:56.629> and<00:05:56.930> then

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
your postpartum body at all and then

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.809 
your postpartum body at all and then
from<00:05:57.289> here<00:05:57.319> you<00:05:58.189> can<00:05:58.279> adjust<00:05:58.339> adjust

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
from here you can adjust adjust

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.540 
from here you can adjust adjust
everything<00:06:01.180> keep<00:06:02.710> and<00:06:03.710> just<00:06:04.249> tuck<00:06:04.369> everything

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
everything keep and just tuck everything

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.219 
everything keep and just tuck everything
in<00:06:04.789> and<00:06:05.089> now<00:06:05.389> you<00:06:05.449> don't<00:06:05.629> actually<00:06:05.839> have<00:06:06.110> to

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
in and now you don't actually have to

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.869 
in and now you don't actually have to
detecting<00:06:06.619> part<00:06:06.830> this<00:06:07.009> is<00:06:07.069> really<00:06:07.399> more<00:06:07.580> I

conscious stuff Colleen is much less

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.909 
conscious stuff Colleen is much less
body<00:06:13.599> insecure<00:06:14.599> than<00:06:14.749> I<00:06:14.839> am<00:06:15.050> but<00:06:15.409> she<00:06:15.469> also<00:06:15.710> has

discourage<00:06:39.439> is<00:06:39.559> used<00:06:39.770> from<00:06:39.889> slumping<00:06:40.399> and

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
discourage is used from slumping and

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.489 
discourage is used from slumping and
when<00:06:41.300> you're<00:06:41.419> sitting<00:06:41.599> up<00:06:41.749> straight<00:06:42.110> part<00:06:42.409> of

00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:42.499 
when you're sitting up straight part of

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:44.799 
when you're sitting up straight part of
what<00:06:42.589> happens<00:06:42.949> is<00:06:43.249> that<00:06:43.879> you<00:06:44.209> are<00:06:44.240> actively

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:44.809 
what happens is that you are actively

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:46.809 
what happens is that you are actively
engaging<00:06:45.199> those<00:06:45.469> core<00:06:45.740> muscles<00:06:45.770> some<00:06:46.399> people

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
engaging those core muscles some people

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:48.879 
engaging those core muscles some people
suggest<00:06:47.300> that<00:06:47.419> binding<00:06:47.719> your<00:06:47.839> belly<00:06:48.050> can

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889 
suggest that binding your belly can

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.559 
suggest that binding your belly can
cause<00:06:49.219> you<00:06:49.459> to<00:06:49.669> be<00:06:49.819> more<00:06:49.849> relaxed<00:06:50.209> with<00:06:50.389> your

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:50.569 
cause you to be more relaxed with your

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:52.629 
cause you to be more relaxed with your
muscles<00:06:50.839> and<00:06:50.959> not<00:06:51.020> use<00:06:51.289> them<00:06:51.529> to<00:06:52.339> pull<00:06:52.520> them

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
muscles and not use them to pull them

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.079 
muscles and not use them to pull them
all<00:06:52.759> in<00:06:52.879> and<00:06:53.089> I<00:06:53.449> would<00:06:53.509> say<00:06:54.610> that<00:06:55.610> it<00:06:55.759> seems<00:06:55.999> to

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:56.089 
all in and I would say that it seems to

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:58.600 
all in and I would say that it seems to
me<00:06:56.240> that<00:06:56.569> if<00:06:56.719> you<00:06:56.930> overuse<00:06:57.830> it<00:06:58.069> that<00:06:58.430> could

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
me that if you overuse it that could

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.820 
me that if you overuse it that could
very<00:06:58.849> well<00:06:58.909> be<00:06:59.059> the<00:06:59.240> case<00:06:59.449> if<00:06:59.749> you<00:07:00.289> become

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
very well be the case if you become

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.689 
very well be the case if you become
reliant<00:07:01.729> on<00:07:02.089> it<00:07:02.269> for<00:07:02.599> your<00:07:02.719> posture<00:07:02.979> then<00:07:03.979> that

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
reliant on it for your posture then that

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.019 
reliant on it for your posture then that
would<00:07:04.969> certainly<00:07:05.930> be<00:07:06.110> a<00:07:06.139> concern<00:07:06.529> but<00:07:07.069> for

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:08.029 
would certainly be a concern but for

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:11.110 
would certainly be a concern but for
short-term<00:07:08.599> use<00:07:08.959> postpartum<00:07:09.589> I<00:07:10.009> think<00:07:10.849> that

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
short-term use postpartum I think that

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.480 
short-term use postpartum I think that
it<00:07:11.269> is<00:07:11.389> beneficial<00:07:11.959> and<00:07:12.559> it<00:07:12.649> gets<00:07:12.860> you<00:07:13.069> upright

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.490 
it is beneficial and it gets you upright

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.299 
it is beneficial and it gets you upright
it<00:07:13.729> lines<00:07:13.909> everything<00:07:14.240> up<00:07:14.509> nicely<00:07:15.129> pulls<00:07:16.129> the

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:16.309 
it lines everything up nicely pulls the

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:18.519 
it lines everything up nicely pulls the
muscles<00:07:16.699> in<00:07:16.849> together<00:07:17.240> holds<00:07:18.050> them<00:07:18.229> in<00:07:18.349> when

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:18.529 
muscles in together holds them in when

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:21.369 
muscles in together holds them in when
you<00:07:18.649> move<00:07:19.459> around<00:07:19.639> so<00:07:20.240> that<00:07:20.479> because<00:07:21.110> what<00:07:21.259> can

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:21.379 
you move around so that because what can

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:23.589 
you move around so that because what can
happen<00:07:21.439> is<00:07:21.740> if<00:07:21.860> you<00:07:21.979> engage<00:07:22.309> your<00:07:22.669> the<00:07:23.330> rectus

happen is if you engage your the rectus

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:24.820 
happen is if you engage your the rectus
abdominus<00:07:23.719> which<00:07:24.050> is<00:07:24.199> your<00:07:24.289> six-pack<00:07:24.649> muscles

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 
abdominus which is your six-pack muscles

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.730 
abdominus which is your six-pack muscles
if<00:07:25.189> you<00:07:25.279> engage<00:07:25.490> that<00:07:25.849> when<00:07:26.209> you<00:07:26.300> have<00:07:26.449> a

if you engage that when you have a

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.980 
if you engage that when you have a
diastasis<00:07:27.740> recti<00:07:28.089> then<00:07:29.089> what<00:07:29.360> can<00:07:29.449> happen<00:07:29.509> is

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
diastasis recti then what can happen is

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.689 
diastasis recti then what can happen is
you<00:07:30.110> can<00:07:30.229> actually<00:07:30.559> cause<00:07:30.949> that<00:07:31.279> separation

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:31.699 
you can actually cause that separation

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:34.749 
you can actually cause that separation
to<00:07:31.999> get<00:07:32.149> bigger<00:07:32.479> and<00:07:33.039> what<00:07:34.039> this<00:07:34.189> does<00:07:34.399> is<00:07:34.639> it

00:07:34.749 --> 00:07:34.759 
to get bigger and what this does is it

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.519 
to get bigger and what this does is it
will<00:07:34.849> support<00:07:35.419> that<00:07:35.629> and<00:07:35.899> keep<00:07:36.259> it<00:07:36.379> from

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:36.529 
will support that and keep it from

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:38.499 
will support that and keep it from
bulging<00:07:37.009> out<00:07:37.129> and<00:07:37.430> then<00:07:37.639> prevent<00:07:38.209> further

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:38.509 
bulging out and then prevent further

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:40.749 
bulging out and then prevent further
