00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.940 
I thought the final boss battle and the
ending<00:01:15.980> were<00:01:16.130> kind<00:01:16.370> of<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.520> ripoff<00:01:17.530> for<00:01:18.530> you

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.910 
know for how hard it was
I<00:01:20.390> thought<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.110> embossed<00:01:21.470> metal<00:01:21.680> was

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
I thought the embossed metal was

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.960 
I thought the embossed metal was
extremely<00:01:22.490> easy<00:01:23.290> but<00:01:24.290> anyway<00:01:25.040> here<00:01:25.730> we<00:01:25.850> go

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
extremely easy but anyway here we go

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.700 
extremely easy but anyway here we go
with<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.240> video<00:01:26.510> I'll<00:01:26.930> let<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:27.260> judge<00:01:27.470> for

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710
