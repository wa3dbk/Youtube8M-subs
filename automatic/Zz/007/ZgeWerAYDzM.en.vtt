00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.589
 hello girls then this video like 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.120
 you requested boy and the video 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.919
 on my food if you remember 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.430
 in the video in which he replies with yours 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.600
 questions a girl had asked me 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.800
 in fact I had proposed to make a video 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.480
 on this subject I have it 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.760
 required in so many then 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.140
 finally here it is before starting 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.929
 but I wanted to do a little bit 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.359
 brackets that is to remind you that in this 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:33.340
 video I will do nothing but tell you the 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.050
 my diet more or less precisely 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.430
 what I eat as I set is not 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.410
 necessarily what it is of 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.840
 would recommend a dietician then not 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.379
 I'm here to advise you to give you 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.520
 professional advice but precisely if 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:51.489
 just to tell you what I eat 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.050
 in essence, many of you have me 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.910
 asked this video to know how me 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.920
 I keep in shape is actually not keeping myself 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.980
 I keep in shape in the sense that 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.170
 I don't do anything in particular 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.590
 unfortunately this is the first thing 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.180
 that you don't have to do ie in the sense not in 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.860
 actually I do a lot of movement because 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.900
 I ride a lot on a bike, I do a lot 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.110
 so many kilometers by bike so I move 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.720
 always a lot but have not educated 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.100
 and as a sport because the bike anyway 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.680
 I use it to move from the opposite 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.850
 to the other then but I'm about to start 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.290
 go to the pool for a while already 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.850
 I say they are already bought everything 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.440
 the ambaradan so I don't do point 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.970
 particular sports for now but me 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 I move a lot on a bike anyway 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.360
 Let's start this video just to make you 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.520
 understand more or less then in the morning 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.950
 when I get up I am one of those 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.190
 people who can never eat the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.930
 morning I did not eat I did not do the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.000
 breakfast for years for the most part 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.620
 I really didn't do my life 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.960
 breakfast and barely went out to drink a little 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.600
 of juice is really greater than a 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.580
 biscuit or fruit 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.590
 and this was for the moment 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.040
 I was able to do it for some time 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.540
 I'm trying to have breakfast in the morning 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.390
 because I noticed that it really helps me 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.790
 really very much both to recover 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.310
 immediately energies because I wake up 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.380
 really right away and so I'm already pretty 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.869
 something I do ready and perky 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.120
 always in the morning just for breakfast 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.710
 to eat lots and lots of fruit 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.110
 other thing I noticed with 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.090
 the experience that gives me a lot a lot 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.770
 energy so I really see the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.620
 difference if I eat a snack la 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.500
 morning or if I make you a nice one 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.750
 cedonio I see that with a lot of salad 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.790
 much more energy then normally the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.010
 morning to what I eat was right 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.930
 that the same thing a cup of tea 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.190
 possibly black lately i'm 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.660
 avoiding you a little bit because me 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.830
 yellow teeth a lot made 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.740
 I have to do the bleaching, however 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.070
 a cup of hot tea or a cup 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.050
 of hot chocolate because I don't like it 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.850
 the coffee I admit are the tastes of 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.220
 I don't like children at all 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.170
 then a glass of juice always with 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.380
 a lot of lemon juice inside 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.500
 it is sometimes the pelmo I drink 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.540
 always the pelmo grapefruit always though 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.700
 without sugar and 100 percent 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.470
 then concentrated by the easy ones 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.120
 in short, fruit is full of fruit 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.590
 depends on what you find supermarket 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.630
 ange bananas apples strawberries blueberries ones 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.390
 blue are very good for circulation 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.610
 and the raspberries that make me sleep 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.780
 crazy raspberries many kiwi in short 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.459
 so it depends but 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.030
 I always eat three or four different 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.880
 breakfast and then a tart 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.830
 to jam or something else 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.240
 give me a little more substance here 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.800
 really like the tarts to 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.240
 the ones that come here are jam 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.720
 very similar to those of the white mill 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.069
 that we have in Italy are baskets 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.870
 precisely when jam inside and 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.170
 so this is what I eat there 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.580
 morning is not much but it is enough for me 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.860
 really because I eat fruit 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.739
 I eat 12 tarts so much and this is me 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.080
 enough to get up to lunch a 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.250
 lunch those habits are a bit 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.190
 different then from when I am 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.840
 moved here for lunch I eat little 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.090
 then a sandwich or a sandwich a 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.500
 pair of bruschettas a little something rather 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.620
 light also because they are even more 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.959
 disputed by breakfast normally 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.549
 also here normally one would need 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.100
 eat a little more at lunch and 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.970
 be a little lighter to me dinner 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.820
 point I don't do for post habits 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.340
 in which I find myself practically is then the 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.040
 dinner towards the point if we get dressed 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.810
 suppressed 15 my name is around 6 6 am 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.169
 half 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.850
 I eat pasta or risotto 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.110
 or a soup to decide which one 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.229
 that I'm going to eat during the day 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.180
 I always try to do a little bit of space 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.280
 predictable sense if I realize that 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.410
 I haven't eaten eggs since then 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.410
 I decide ok these days have to eat 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.300
 what egg or I realize that 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.950
 it's a bit that I don't eat fish then 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.840
 eaten for so I always try to 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.880
 much to eat a lot of fruit 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.590
 and vegetables and I know what I see they say 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.690
 all eat lots of fruits and vegetables 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.970
 these networks that since your mom is 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.370
 but it must be said that it is something that I do 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.540
 I'm aware that fruits and vegetables 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.520
 precisely they give very very much 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.170
 energy and then this being a channel 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.480
 I also want to highlight the beauty 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:19.020
 made to eat a lot of fruit and 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.270
 vegetables make the skin a lot more 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.700
 beautiful brighter and more hydrated i 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.770
 those too are more beautiful hair 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.630
 bright other thing I always do e 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.910
 lots and lots of water 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.040
 so either I don't have a diet 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.600
 written decision with the young people 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.480
 of what they must ingram though I look for 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.850
 precisely to expand between the various foods 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.280
 so I try to eat a bit of everything 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.830
 regard to carmine I have to say that not 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.350
 I eat dark meat so eat 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.640
 only clear meat as can the 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.520
 turkey 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.830
 do not ask me why it is not because I am 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.080
 becoming a vegetarian or something 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.640
 in fact that has always been the case for me 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.160
 I've never liked steaks either 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.900
 however the school meat makes me a 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.430
 little impression I have to tell the truth 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.430
 it is but it is something that it is 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.020
 irrational because in the end the chicken and 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.510
 I eat turkey but I can't 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.760
 eat steaks or burgers 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.280
 yes I eat maybe a hamburger every death 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.590
 of the Pope, however, to say precisely 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.330
 usually I don't fit in mine 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.500
 my dark meat diet when in the 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.810
 eat I eat a chicken breast or 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.550
 of the fish I try to avoid fried 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.230
 of course not always because I go 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.090
 at McDonald's he will take you from time to time 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.180
 we want to go to the McDonald's but maybe it is 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.980
 so I ate the McDonald's in one 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.140
 week a couple of times then I try 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.630
 in short, up to a month after a couple of 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.190
 months of not eating at McDonald's I'm 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.100
 be careful what she cooks 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.830
 avoiding fried foods or trying to do 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.900
 things the oven put oil in a raw state e 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.140
 I don't do the sauté then 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.560
 I always try to space and I don't have one 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.740
 particular diet that I follow happens that 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.240
 maybe one 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.729
 for a week I eat so many 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.620
 crap and then I look for the whole month 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.900
 to be a little careful not because I have 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.360
 fear of gaining weight rather than anything else it is 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.949
 for the fact of being careful to 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.900
 stomach and don't eat too much crap 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.280
 because then the stomach resents us 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.690
 and this guy a little all that 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.340
 I wanted to tell you about mine 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.520
 power that is nothing 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.789
 of fixed fixed and I am never 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.979
 too careful if I walk and I see a nice one 

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:28.840
 kraft that cream with cotton candy 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:31.479
 and spun sugar that icing sugar 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.009
 above I eat it without any kind of 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.409
 problem this also a cover tip 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:36.180
 nadal and not to make you too many problems not 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:39.240
 be afraid of getting fat 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.470
 constantly weighing in short I have not 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.120
 I don't do these problems, I don't 

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.310
 give a damn if a pound more a pound 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.650
 in the least the important thing is to be happy ea 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.870
 eat what you like naturally 

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.729
 always respecting health by eating
