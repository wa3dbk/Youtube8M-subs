think professional double XP is more

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
think professional double XP is more
more<00:01:22.530> important<00:01:22.920> than<00:01:23.100> getting<00:01:23.460> bad<00:01:23.850> weapons

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
more important than getting bad weapons

more important than getting bad weapons
