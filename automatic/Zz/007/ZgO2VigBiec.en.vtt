00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.200
To all you ladies,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.180
thinking that you’re gonna be alone until you’re 80

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.300
with your mom yelling catch the bouquet toss

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.860
Facebook engagements all across

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.760
Ain't a flirty, thirsty bae day dreaming

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.640
not even the girl hurling the "I can't even"

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.640
Put the Pinterest and Adele to the side

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.800
We're getting it like your Friday night TV guide

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.440
make it bright as a marquee

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.380
I've seen all those Lifetime movies

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.180
No worries plenty of fish in the sea

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.160
I'm buying my own Valentine's candy

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.920
My family is really concerned about me

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.800
Too picky, too busy don't you see

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.940
Oh my gosh will someone please just marry me

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.760
I got no ring

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.460
Alone every occasion

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.860
Let's intermingle, 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.920
I can't handle

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.740
We can do that single stomp

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.460
I got no ring on

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.460
Alone every occasion

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.540
Let's intermingle

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.560
I can't handle

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.380
We can do that single stomp!

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.200
Dinner with my girls

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.320
Cause I don't have a plus one

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.180
Pull together single ladies

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.960
Who know how to have fun

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.040
Dance to Taylor and *smile*

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.780
Let me take a selfie

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.240
Be right back in ten

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.460
I'll make this Instagram worthy

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.180
These pictures cover up

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.200
How I'm waiting for Prince Charming

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.780
I'll just sit around

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.320
And wait for him to bring my diamond ring

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.060
The last Prince Charming found another princess on his way here

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.980
So here's a call to all the boys

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.180
Have I made myself crystal clear

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260
Where you at?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.560
All I'm saying is I'm not content

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.420
I ain't your sister from the convent

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.360
I'm the OG party of one REPRESENT

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.460
But my Instagram will throw you off the scent

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.200
Looking like I'm at a everyday event

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.140
Alone on my own 100%

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.980
Relationship goals is the letter of intent

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.020
Well just a date is a goal at any extent

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.900
I'm always the babysitter guarantee

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.800
Who're you dating?

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.080
Is the question to me

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.640
Because people staying away like I'm hepatitis B

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.600
I got no ring on

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.500
Alone every occasion

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.760
Let's intermingle

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.860
I can't handle

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.520
We can do the single stomp

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.100
*pathetic crying*

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.040
It's Sam &amp; Nasty all day

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.140
Be like Tom Cast Away

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.020
Alone in coffee cafes

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.860
even the cats run away

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.020
We ain't smitten, you tripping

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.720
We lone sitting, no kidding

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.520
We be free every night

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.640
Because we got no commitment 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.880
Third wheeling is the photographer guarantee

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.800
and always the relationship advisory

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.880
My only relationship struggle is pizza

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.920
Cause duh, uh 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.480
that's my true love

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.440
Netflix on the binge

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.534
ChexMix 'til the end

00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:19.573
Predict all your friends' bridesmaids

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:20.635
They say to date a friend

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:21.515
Cliche is the trend

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:23.339
Carpool lane would be an upgrade

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:24.672
It's way of the Kraft cheese

00:03:24.672 --> 00:03:25.534
Pray for the dating scene

00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:27.193
Face of the weekend old maid

00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:28.193
we're ready and waiting

00:03:28.193 --> 00:03:29.116
we're hyperventilating 

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:31.551
we're hating that online dating blind dating

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.840
known it since the spelling bee

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.931
"before I'm dead," is grandma's plea

00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:38.714
where's the bachelor in your degree
