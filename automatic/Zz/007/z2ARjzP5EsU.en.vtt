00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 and well now I'm going to show you the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.470
 talents 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.650
 I am murder 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:17.060
 that this is called mutilate poison 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.460
 because they are the ones that strike good they have 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.140
 that give malice five points because 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.880
 increases the critical 5 % is very good at 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.619
 the perforated wounds because it increases 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.710
 they have 30 percent the probability of 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.650
 critical in stab and the probability of 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.600
 critical of his ability to maul 15 by 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.450
 percent or we have 15 percent more 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.950
 of hitting with a critical hit you press 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.030
 blood spatter also to have 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.820
 club and break 30% more damage here 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.850
 I live by increasing the maximum energy 20 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.700
 points there without the tap you would have 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.110
 120 energy points with the tap 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.910
 they have 130 like me and if it's very good at 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.350
 that some say it is not necessary 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.820
 because they can use it in other talents 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.159
 but in reality it is very necessary 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.070
 mental lethality damage bonuses by 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.270
 critical body very good also poisons 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.690
 filthy very good to be able 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.410
 put the fastest poisons 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.600
 the poisons improved to drink more the 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.240
 Greyhound feet so they do not slow us down 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.850
 both cold blood is very important 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.760
 very important they have to make a macro 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.730
 good if they know how to do macro or me 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.410
 you may leave them in the 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.950
 description is not sure so I do not know 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:45.070
 they make a macro to put blood 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.410
 cold and then poison when they have 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.810
 five combo points and five at doses of 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.030
 deadly poison use the macro and they will give 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.280
 an incredibly strong blow that the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.140
 You can kill your target with a hit 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.830
 of 10 or 12 k and kill them very quickly 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.820
 the precious good recovery to this 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.920
 talent 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.490
 this choice of you I use it 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.150
 because I happen to 20 percent more and 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.150
 if I 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.150
 notary 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.490
 good chile we say he missed a hit 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.710
 it gives me back 80% of my energy from 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:30.240
 kingdom I do not lose my energy like that 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.850
 it serves active 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.940
 murder clear equally all the damage 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.620
 4% all very good sir destiny the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.320
 critical hits that add points of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.800
 convertible 3 100 probability of 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.480
 add a very good compound point 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.210
 exterminate every time they can enter 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.860
 the sigilio mess was shown to 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.690
 after exterminating them, it remains for 20 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.780
 seconds to regenerate energy 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.040
 30 percent faster very good 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.010
 lethal recess for 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.450
 but they have to have it like that oh yes yes or 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.489
 yes to be able to not have the good with 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.790
 scary titles subtleties have like the 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.260
 obligation to use blighting nativity 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.230
 we put the two poisons that 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.240
 we use and in obstruction by the poison 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:22.050
 hurtful or instantaneous 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.490
 in the attacks in centered his hits 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.440
 melee critics have 100 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.890
 probability of giving you two points 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.470
 very good energy very very good because 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.570
 It gives you a lot of energy because good 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.670
 we give ourselves very strong critic 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.240
 followed but we give critics that are 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.220
 small as 300 or 500 but they are 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.840
 critics and those critics for more guys 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.770
 that are give two energy points that 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.270
 they are very necessary to win 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.610
 a duel 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.170
 the master poisoner increased 3 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.670
 one hundred the chance of critical hit 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.500
 of all the attacks carried out against 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.020
 any goal that you have poisoned 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.500
 and 50 percent reduces the duration of 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.270
 effect of poison that apply on you and 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.550
 grants to poison 100 percent of 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.180
 probability not to consume deadly poison 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.770
 very good because our poisoning does not 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.990
 consume our two children since 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.090
 we can hit poison many times 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.670
 we want as long as he gives us the energy 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.610
 because it will not consume the deadly poison 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.400
 and it reduces the poisons in us and 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.060
 we had a contract but very good 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.320
 mutilate is they have to give themselves figs and 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.400
 It is also to say why because 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.380
 we use that is that blow without that 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.150
 we can not beat but well we can 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.670
 fight with some others but the grace 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.980
 is to use mutilating because it is very good 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:47.450
 good very good because apart from that 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.690
 hit with the two weapons hits very hard and 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.140
 it's like our basic attack yes good 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:57.800
 the rogues understand in combat not of 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.620
 nothing though eye instead of giving these two 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.510
 in precious recovery can give it 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.180
 the two in the double specialization 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.969
 grip so that your secondary weapon 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.269
 hit 20% more 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:13.099
 in subtlety the merciless blows 

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:16.279
 they must necessarily see it because 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:19.549
 the auctions have 20% chance 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:21.469
 of per field point restore 25 

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:23.389
 energy points that are very necessary 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:25.459
 like all the energy we need 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.179
 master of deception so that we do not 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:30.589
 find very very unnecessary 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:34.339
 opportunity increases the damage inflicted 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:36.919
 with mutilating 20% and with stab stick and 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:39.860
 ambush that are not not very we do not use it 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:43.759
 much we play to be able to give 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.759
 by reason of 5 meters further and that no 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:50.659
 consume us as much energy as not 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.509
 would normally consume camouflage to 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:57.649
 that the fabric is faster do not delay 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:06:00.889
 so load here if they realize they are 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:04.669
 only four seconds of cdd sigil 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.339
 that without this talent would be ten and we 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.529
 he would probably kill us and lucid 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:11.779
 very good reduces the time of 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.729
 reuse of your ability to smoke is 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:16.460
 will continue and 60 seconds 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.069
 and faculty shadow layer 30 seconds 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.939
 they have to have it because if in a 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:24.919
 sand are left unprepared I know what 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:28.430
 spent is this talent can we 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.650
 save a lot is for crowded provoke 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.330
 that your attacks ignore up to 9% of 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.099
 the armor of your enemy that is and already 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.990
 we have 9 percent penetration of 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:40.069
 armor that is the same thing that ignores and 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.439
 increases the damage inflicted by your 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.580
 breakage capacity of 30 percent very 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:46.370
 good 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.520
 Sharpened senses helps us find 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.439
 other druid eyes peaks ojeal 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.020
 life that may be hidden or 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:56.900
 any other race because in alchemy 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.580
 can buy a position to be made 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.699
 invisible and have the same invisibility 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:04.039
 of us and eye with that they have to 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.710
 be very careful because in old age 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.569
 the paradigms are pretty bastards with that 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.680
 position and they hide like 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:14.180
 we unlike they heal 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.530
 safe while they are hidden so 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:25.190
 eye with that the preparation ends us 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:30.260
 all sorts of spirit vanish evasion 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:34.160
 yes and cold blood and step of the shadows 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:36.980
 in case we are subtlety that would be 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.070
 that power but how are we not 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.810
 it helps us to have some other 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.970
 opportunity if we fight against 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.610
 two or more components the acts 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.860
 reprehensible reduces the cost of energy 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.380
 of your faculty hit low and defeat 20 

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.289
 very good point because the energy is going 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:57.399
 to pain a lot 

00:07:53.289 --> 00:08:00.099
 and cause 20% more damage compared to 

00:07:57.399 --> 00:08:03.610
 targets below 35% that is when 

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:06.939
 already have less than good I have 29 thousand 

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:10.149
 of life as when I would have would 

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:12.389
 as about 10,000 of life I would already hit 20% 

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:12.389
 plus
