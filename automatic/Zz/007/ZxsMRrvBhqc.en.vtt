my entire life and they thought it would

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.800 
my entire life and they thought it would
be<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> good<00:00:28.680> idea<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.279> put<00:00:29.789> their<00:00:29.939> beacon<00:00:30.240> but

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
be a good idea to put their beacon but

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.030 
be a good idea to put their beacon but
when<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:31.019> put<00:00:31.170> their<00:00:31.289> beacon<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.679> they

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
when they put their beacon in they

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.950 
when they put their beacon in they
pulled<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> Scooby's<00:00:32.940> three-point<00:00:33.390> omap<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
pulled a Scooby's three-point omap and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.420 
pulled a Scooby's three-point omap and
add<00:00:34.320> their<00:00:34.469> beacon<00:00:34.710> tower<00:00:34.890> go<00:00:35.100> away<00:00:35.250> higher

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
add their beacon tower go away higher

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.400 
add their beacon tower go away higher
than<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.700> base<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.690> did<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:36.930> shot<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
than the base so all we did was shot the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
than the base so all we did was shot the
tower<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.340> slowly<00:00:38.940> went<00:00:39.239> down

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
tower right here and slowly went down

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.319 
tower right here and slowly went down
through<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> base<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.149> this<00:00:42.149> is

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
through the base so here we go this is

there<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.329> where<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> hoppers<00:01:04.019> were

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
now we were going to scatter them out

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.460 
now we were going to scatter them out
originally<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.090> because<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> water<00:01:06.630> fell<00:01:06.900> we

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
originally but because the water fell we

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.899 
originally but because the water fell we
have<00:01:07.590> two<00:01:07.740> hybrid<00:01:08.070> every<00:01:08.310> single<00:01:08.580> hopper

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
have two hybrid every single hopper

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.910 
have two hybrid every single hopper
except<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.570> obviously<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.290> we're<00:01:10.830> just

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
except that one obviously and we're just

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.380 
except that one obviously and we're just
like<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.369> worth<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> whatever<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.299> we

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
like it's not worth it whatever so we

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.789 
like it's not worth it whatever so we
just<00:01:12.510> kept<00:01:12.689> shooting<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.409> kept<00:01:13.650> shooting

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
just kept shooting and kept shooting

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.890 
just kept shooting and kept shooting
down<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.760> killed<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.060> couple<00:01:15.210> guys<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.479> here

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
down and we killed a couple guys in here

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
down and we killed a couple guys in here
and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.619> pillared<00:01:16.979> yourself<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.430> this

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and then they pillared yourself in this

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.510 
and then they pillared yourself in this
room<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.830> into<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.220> room<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

then<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.840> well<00:01:31.170> I'll<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.439> keep

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
then I was like well I'll just keep

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.020 
then I was like well I'll just keep
shooting<00:01:31.890> down<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> base<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:32.820> fun<00:01:33.000> so

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
shooting down the base just for fun so

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
shooting down the base just for fun so
we<00:01:33.299> shot<00:01:33.509> all<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.840> down<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.470> later

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
we shot all the way down here and later

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.770 
we shot all the way down here and later
on<00:01:35.610> when<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.970> checked<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.270> my<00:01:36.390> world<00:01:36.600> download

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
on when I checked out my world download

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020 
on when I checked out my world download
I<00:01:37.079> realized<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.740> few<00:01:38.040> blocks<00:01:38.159> deeper<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
I realized that a few blocks deeper I

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.560 
I realized that a few blocks deeper I
actually<00:01:39.450> would<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.810> hit<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:41.570> spawner

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
actually would have hit a spawner

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.719 
actually would have hit a spawner
actually<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.409> down<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.799> yeah<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
actually is it down here yeah see I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.980 
actually is it down here yeah see I
would<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.909> hit<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> spawner<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> don't

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
would I hit the spawner but I don't

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.940 
would I hit the spawner but I don't
think<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.380> made<00:01:46.560> him<00:01:46.619> scattered

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
think we would have made him scattered

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.870 
think we would have made him scattered
that<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.430> just

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
that out just

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.520 
that out just
can<00:01:48.149> works<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> scatter<00:01:49.200> will<00:01:49.380> get

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
can works because the scatter will get

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.219 
can works because the scatter will get
here<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.039> here<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:51.149> mean<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.689> so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
here not here but I mean you know so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.190 
here not here but I mean you know so
weird<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.799> close<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.219> that<00:01:53.960> didn't<00:01:54.960> realize

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
weird that close to that didn't realize

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.840 
weird that close to that didn't realize
it<00:01:55.350> was<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.920> kind<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.159> cool<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it was down here is kind of cool and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.249 
it was down here is kind of cool and
they<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.240> room<00:01:57.450> down<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.899> which<00:01:58.170> i

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
they have this room down here which i

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.560 
they have this room down here which i
guess<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.439> where<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.710> their<00:01:59.180> crap<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.420> get

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
guess is where all their crap they get

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.149 
guess is where all their crap they get
from<00:02:00.689> their<00:02:00.720> zombies<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.500> nothing<00:02:01.920> good<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
from their zombies is so nothing good is

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.410 
from their zombies is so nothing good is
going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:02.640> anyways<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
going to be down here anyways but it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.789 
going to be down here anyways but it
would<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.630> been<00:02:03.689> fun<00:02:03.929> anyways<00:02:04.560> that's

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
would have been fun anyways that's

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249
