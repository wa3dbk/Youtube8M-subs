00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 today you go to all kids that such our 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.060
 Origins strategy is pretty easy 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.280
 for everyone for the whole family 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.410
 and really I tell you the truth this has 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.540
 been the first zombie map that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.790
 You have really invited me 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.980
 and I 've started climbing rounds in a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.779
 departure I do not know why but this map of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 upload rounds is a map that as I already 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.890
 I have said many many times is the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.039
 that I liked the most and without a doubt 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.960
 I normally love and maps 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.730
 zombies, I usually do easter 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 I usually discover the secrets things 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.180
 new new weapons such but already when 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.520
 comes the time to raise rounds when 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 everything is more or less discovered then 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 it's like a little bit of them happened 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 Multiplayer level but do not originate if you 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 I'm telling the truth kids I loved it 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.739
 I believe that I will give to the subject of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.149
 go up rounds I'm even thinking about 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.010
 make streaming with this strategy 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.690
 that I am going to show you next 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.730
 good strategy now I'm going to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 explain where to give your where to give 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.480
 first forgiveness first of all you have 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.100
 than choosing a cane that you want to improve 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.750
 in this case better the first one of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.280
 wind but now now I am going to give you 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 my recommendations on what cane 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.149
 improve my special shot 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.799
 personal recommendations but in this 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.060
 case I got better first the wind one 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.540
 which is going great and you are going to see that the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.520
 they consist of going to the appointment area and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.740
 with the cane improved then go killing 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.250
 there piling up in a specific way 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.240
 well the thing consists of the following 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.310
 we have to get in the way and 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.930
 do the rest on the road a very thing 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.759
 characteristic of this map is that he 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.159
 The zombies respond the time they take 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.140
 in reappearing and going after you is very 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.750
 very fast and very superior for example to 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.490
 map bourget in a moment take them sanz 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.159
 responds to two have come out of the hole and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.479
 they make their stuck a jump and to the cinemas 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.799
 back then we have to 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.289
 take advantage of that we put ourselves in the 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.119
 way they do the rest of us to mount 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.580
 we huddled here in the second generator 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.920
 and we kill them here as you see in the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.929
 round 20 so good the cane this 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.030
 the slaughterhouses throws some leaves them 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.500
 stunned good told us one thing 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 referring to that of secondary and 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.450
 I recommend having it mauser lamar 2 since 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.009
 in early rounds from 20 to 30 and such 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.689
 you can get rid of a trap if you give 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.890
 so a few shots in the head and 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.289
 also good to finish the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.299
 round goes pretty well to me as 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.729
 witnesses yes yes I have told you but 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.320
 they killed me in the end comes round 37 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.690
 that for me a 37 wheel is pretty 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.600
 comes to round 37 because I went 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.490
 2 was an incredible shit because I could 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.870
 have followed with the strategy of 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.000
 very simple way but cared 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.350
 commented more things the shield very 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.490
 important to do it down there because the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.670
 shield is a protection weapon 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.200
 incredible good round 25 kids me 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.240
 I wanted him to take it I was going to kill him in a 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.550
 Normal shot of improved cane 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.750
 wind of furious fury of boreas and 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.140
 I find the surprise that the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.820
 zombie is paralyzed makes me stop and 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.080
 thanks to that I die 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.310
 one thing you also have to have 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.410
 very much care with the French 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.850
 soldier and acrisio are hooked you are going to 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.830
 put in the middle of the ball and how we 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.830
 free is quick shooting the arm 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.970
 reached you are going to die almost certainly there 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.310
 have to be very careful also with 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.410
 the titan because with the giant forgiveness 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.750
 because the foot puts it there in the middle and if 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.790
 you have not done the ball well you can 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.560
 fucking very good what was 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.480
 commenting round 26 it turns out that the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.320
 Improved cane no longer kills with your shot 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.150
 normal 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.490
 let the zombies stunned need two 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.750
 bullets is a per ass took quite then 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.850
 what you have to do is recharge the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.220
 cane and press the shoot button 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.660
 reload and throw your special shot in 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.060
 this case the wind stick is the 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.550
 cane that least bullets has all its 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.130
 special shot is pretty 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.860
 but of course that up to six bullets the shot 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.690
 special and in a plis-plas is already a 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.220
 from round 25 you have to go 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.260
 killing with the special shot to kill 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.450
 to a whole and clear wave because you're going 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.370
 to run out of bullets in nothing I realized 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.170
 of this and a moment that I was left without 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.480
 bullets I had to take the bonus of 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.040
 capture the six generators and so on and 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.190
 I was thinking about the topic that 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.020
 cane catch here you see how to kill is 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.540
 say the surge kills it very easy but 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.670
 in a fairly long period of time 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.070
 whirlwind but of course you will stay 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.660
 without bullets entrance into the juve lot and 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.030
 in the thirtieth round I went to 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.310
 improve the ice cane imagine yourself in 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.050
 the room of the elements kill zombies 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.420
 to improve this cane was a 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.550
 authentic madness worth this cane is the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.810
 better to climb rounds because good 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.760
 it turns out that it has more bullets than the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.040
 that's sure, and its attack 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.030
 special the whirlwind whirlwind this 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.010
 mega cool 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.870
 it only spends three bullets of the charger 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.970
 I guarantee you that the special attack of 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.100
 each cane will kill in all 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.010
 rounds that we can get to on banks in 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.750
 the 100 in the 200 in the 1 in all 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.580
 rounds the cane improved with his shot 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.710
 whirlpool special 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.870
 in all the rounds the ice cane 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.819
 he is the only one that his special attack spends 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.830
 three bullets just from charger so 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.229
 so much is a very very weapon to have in 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.659
 also has these weapons 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.340
 special the canes have one thing 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.650
 very positive that many special weapons 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.389
 of other maps do not have and that is that they leave 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.219
 bonuses and what if they leave 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.199
 bonuses leave bonuses to 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:52.349
 sac for ccoo because ammunition gives you the 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.659
 can give perfectly every two rounds 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.360
 every three gives you a lot of insta kill 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.759
 of double dot bombs that little 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.199
 they serve but as I say it gives you a lot 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.849
 It is very many exposes many 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.440
 modifications and this is very good 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.659
 because with the date of July the cane 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.940
 of ice improved because very rarely 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.199
 you're going to run out of bullets as well as people 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.120
 this is the strategy I'm thinking about 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.319
 make a streaming like as done already 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.539
 that we could get to a round 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.219
 quite pretty high with this one 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.870
 round 50 I think I can polish it 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.279
 pretty easy and as I say at the end 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.229
 they killed me because I was with my hobby of 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.940
 have the martos trick in green instead 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.219
 of the mouse but good and you will tell me in 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.469
 round 36 on sea 2 is still running 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.419
 ok but fuck you have the cane 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:31.650
 ice you do not need that weapon either 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.700
 when I screwed up a bit like this 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.530
 they had the golden shovel 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.420
 the euro helmet that there was a moment in 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.070
 the one that stepped on me the giant and thanks to 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.780
 euro helmet I could continue but good 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.550
 as I say this attack kills all 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.740
 zombies is perfectly takes a 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.420
 little bit more to die that is true 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.490
 than the wind but it deserves a lot 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.720
 it's worth it so good people leave me in 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.940
 the comments if you want streaming 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.100
 delighted and bring this strategy if 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.660
 I have reached round 37 and I am a 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.150
 bad you can get to the hundred 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.360
 perfectly and nothing else not following 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.360
 video
