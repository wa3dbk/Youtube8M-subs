00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
we'd like to talk about fattening your

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.130 
we'd like to talk about fattening your
cords<00:00:04.170> instead<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.190> plain<00:00:05.400> just<00:00:05.640> plain<00:00:06.140> chords

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
cords instead of plain just plain chords

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.470 
cords instead of plain just plain chords
playing<00:00:07.470> chords<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.160> occur<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.730> most<00:00:08.910> songs

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
playing chords that occur in most songs

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.540 
playing chords that occur in most songs
such<00:00:10.440> as<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.740> secret<00:00:15.619> or<00:00:16.619> whatever<00:00:16.890> instead

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
such as the secret or whatever instead

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.029 
such as the secret or whatever instead
of<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.060> playing<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> plain<00:00:18.779> chords<00:00:19.320> I'd

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
of just playing the plain chords I'd

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
of just playing the plain chords I'd
like<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.310> talk<00:00:20.490> about<00:00:20.789> ways<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.029> flatten<00:00:21.750> out

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
like to talk about ways to flatten out

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.230 
like to talk about ways to flatten out
to<00:00:22.230> fatten<00:00:22.650> those<00:00:22.830> chords<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.609> fatten<00:00:24.000> them<00:00:24.119> up

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
to fatten those chords to fatten them up

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.050 
to fatten those chords to fatten them up
okay<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> now<00:00:26.039> one<00:00:26.250> way<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.939> is

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
okay and now one way we can do it is

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.200 
okay and now one way we can do it is
simply<00:00:27.390> by<00:00:27.539> adding<00:00:27.810> color<00:00:28.199> tones<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.800> example

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
simply by adding color tones for example

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
simply by adding color tones for example
playing<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> G<00:00:30.570> chord<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.189> possible

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
playing the G chord and if it's possible

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
playing the G chord and if it's possible
if<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.360> works<00:00:33.750> out<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.140> melody<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.950> all

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
if it works out with the melody at all

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
if it works out with the melody at all
then<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.850> ought<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> add<00:00:36.270> something<00:00:36.750> like<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
then you ought to add something like a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.690 
then you ought to add something like a
major<00:00:37.260> seventh<00:00:37.829> than<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.070> means<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.489> that's

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
major seventh than it means like that's

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:48.060 
major seventh than it means like that's
the<00:00:44.690> or<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> six

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
the or at a six

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.870 
the or at a six
or<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.430> $6<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.710> that's<00:00:50.890> one<00:00:51.070> way<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.280> simply<00:00:51.760> to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
or a $6 so that's one way to simply to

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.670 
or a $6 so that's one way to simply to
add<00:00:52.060> color<00:00:52.510> tones<00:00:52.840> if<00:00:52.990> you're<00:00:53.140> playing<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.470> C

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
add color tones if you're playing the C

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:08.670 
add color tones if you're playing the C
chord<00:00:55.380> or<00:00:56.380> a<00:01:03.330> dominant<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:08.140> other<00:01:08.229> words<00:01:08.470> add

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
chord or a dominant in other words add

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.530 
chord or a dominant in other words add
an<00:01:08.890> add<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.160> color<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.700> them<00:01:09.970> whenever<00:01:10.120> possible

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
an add a color to them whenever possible

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.960 
an add a color to them whenever possible
that<00:01:11.050> will<00:01:11.229> go<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.010> long<00:01:12.280> ways<00:01:12.490> towards

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
that will go a long ways towards

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.880 
that will go a long ways towards
flattening<00:01:13.870> your<00:01:14.050> court<00:01:14.290> fattening<00:01:14.710> your

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
flattening your court fattening your

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.160 
flattening your court fattening your
course<00:01:15.160> another<00:01:16.060> way<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.300> do<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.540> is<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.930> voice

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
course another way to do it is to voice

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.999 
course another way to do it is to voice
enforce<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:19.000> so<00:01:19.240> words<00:01:20.200> are<00:01:20.290> usually<00:01:20.560> hoisted

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
enforce is so words are usually hoisted

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.940 
enforce is so words are usually hoisted
in<00:01:21.100> thirds<00:01:21.369> but<00:01:22.330> instead<00:01:22.930> consider<00:01:23.710> something

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
in thirds but instead consider something

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.570 
in thirds but instead consider something
like<00:01:24.100> this<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:26.500> involves<00:01:26.920> color<00:01:27.160> tones<00:01:27.400> as

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
like this it involves color tones as

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.820 
like this it involves color tones as
well<00:01:27.820> but<00:01:28.000> like<00:01:28.600> you'd<00:01:28.869> voice<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.080> C<00:01:29.410> chord<00:01:29.619> like

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
well but like you'd voice a C chord like

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.510 
well but like you'd voice a C chord like
this<00:01:29.860> on<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.610> bottom<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:32.110> then<00:01:32.500> D<00:01:32.800> you<00:01:33.340> see

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
this on the bottom and then D you see

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.730 
this on the bottom and then D you see
each<00:01:33.700> note<00:01:34.090> as<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.479> fourth<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:35.140> perfect<00:01:35.530> fourth

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
each note as a fourth a perfect fourth

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.560 
each note as a fourth a perfect fourth
away<00:01:35.979> from<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.250> other<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.880> playing<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.360> C

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
away from the other I'm playing a C

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.870 
away from the other I'm playing a C
chord<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:41.110> way<00:01:41.350> after<00:01:41.830> you<00:01:42.190> play<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.460> low<00:01:42.759> seat

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
chord that way after you play a low seat

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.410 
chord that way after you play a low seat
now<00:01:45.299> there's<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> big<00:01:46.020> sound

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.300 

if<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.540> voice<00:01:53.780> enforce<00:01:54.320> that<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.920> gives<00:01:55.160> a

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
if you voice enforce that that gives a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.510 
if you voice enforce that that gives a
much<00:01:55.940> more<00:01:56.570> contemporary<00:01:57.050> scent<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.400> do

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
much more contemporary scent but to do

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.040 
much more contemporary scent but to do
that<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.850> have<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.030> play<00:01:59.360> a<00:01:59.390> root<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.840> some

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
that you have to play a root of some

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.780 
that you have to play a root of some
sort<00:02:00.320> for<00:02:00.410> example<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.070> it's<00:02:01.220> secret<00:02:01.550> you<00:02:01.700> have

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
sort for example if it's secret you have

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.990 
sort for example if it's secret you have
to<00:02:01.880> play<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.090> little<00:02:02.390> C<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.810> little<00:02:03.050> CNG

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.780 

another<00:02:09.810> thing<00:02:10.020> about<00:02:10.050> force<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.040> my

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
another thing about force is you can my

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:25.809 
another thing about force is you can my
have<00:02:12.030> sorry

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.690 

see<00:02:26.480> I'm<00:02:26.569> just<00:02:26.810> voicing<00:02:27.349> in<00:02:27.920> force<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.610> I'm

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
see I'm just voicing in force and I'm

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.229 
see I'm just voicing in force and I'm
moving<00:02:28.909> up<00:02:29.090> I'm<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.599> stem<00:02:29.989> and<00:02:30.879> that<00:02:31.879> makes<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
moving up I'm a stem and that makes a

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.319 
moving up I'm a stem and that makes a
nice<00:02:32.390> contemporary<00:02:33.349> sound<00:02:33.939> okay<00:02:34.939> another

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
nice contemporary sound okay another

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.130 
nice contemporary sound okay another
thing<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.569> can<00:02:35.719> do<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.549> use<00:02:37.579> crunches<00:02:38.269> to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
thing you can do is to use crunches to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.990 
thing you can do is to use crunches to
use<00:02:39.260> crunches<00:02:39.769> crunches<00:02:39.980> are<00:02:40.459> where<00:02:40.790> you

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
use crunches crunches are where you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.089 
use crunches crunches are where you
slide<00:02:41.810> down<00:02:41.840> on<00:02:42.379> the<00:02:42.470> court<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:42.859> then<00:02:42.980> it

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
slide down on the court and then it

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.520 
slide down on the court and then it
we're<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:44.030> playing<00:02:44.269> it<00:02:44.390> like<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.750> see

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
playing it like that just take it from

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.509 
playing it like that just take it from
the<00:02:48.650> top<00:02:48.680> down

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.039 

just<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.450> opposite

just the opposite

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:16.130 
just the opposite
usually<00:02:59.409> we<00:02:59.560> have<00:02:59.709> our

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.020

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
now you don't want to overuse that but

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.790 
now you don't want to overuse that but
that's<00:03:18.480> one<00:03:18.660> way<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.870> can<00:03:19.080> make<00:03:19.260> your<00:03:19.410> cords

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
that's one way you can make your cords

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.060 
that's one way you can make your cords
fatter<00:03:21.200> another<00:03:22.200> thing<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:22.530> do<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.860> use

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
fatter another thing you can do is use

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.370 
fatter another thing you can do is use
blue<00:03:23.340> notes<00:03:23.580> instead<00:03:24.210> of<00:03:24.450> just<00:03:24.690> playing<00:03:25.020> all

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
blue notes instead of just playing all

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.580 
blue notes instead of just playing all
the<00:03:25.910> all<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.120> notes<00:03:27.360> as<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:27.960> you<00:03:28.140> can<00:03:28.290> slide

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
the all the notes as it is you can slide

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.330 
the all the notes as it is you can slide
off<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.040> Black<00:03:29.280> Keys<00:03:29.550> like<00:03:29.850> this

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
off the Black Keys like this

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:45.310 
off the Black Keys like this
I<00:03:31.660> said<00:03:32.660> let<00:03:33.349> me<00:03:33.410> do<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.620> slow<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.069> you

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.930 

gives<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.380> little<00:03:46.410> impetus<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.430> sand<00:03:47.700> isn't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
gives a little impetus to the sand isn't

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.260 
gives a little impetus to the sand isn't
it

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
it

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.970 
it
in<00:03:48.540> fact<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.960> guess<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> lot<00:03:49.410> off<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.770> a<00:03:49.800> black

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
in fact I guess a lot off to a black

00:03:49.980 --> 00:04:00.660 
in fact I guess a lot off to a black
user

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
you can use blue notes to fatten your

you can use blue notes to fatten your
courts<00:04:04.410> nothing<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:05.530> do<00:04:05.739> is<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:05.950> can<00:04:06.130> use

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.780 

for<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.000> colored<00:05:11.390> clothes<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:12.710> hear<00:05:13.670> the

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
the good news you can use two hands

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.980 
the good news you can use two hands
voicing<00:05:23.960> and<00:05:25.000> use<00:05:26.000> all<00:05:26.270> of<00:05:26.419> that<00:05:28.810> who<00:05:29.810> knows

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
voicing and use all of that who knows

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.909 
voicing and use all of that who knows
you<00:05:30.500> can<00:05:30.680> plan<00:05:31.430> on<00:05:31.699> this<00:05:32.030> like<00:05:32.419> that<00:05:32.919> sliding

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
you can plan on this like that sliding

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:45.430 
you can plan on this like that sliding
off<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.120> open<00:05:35.120> fifth<00:05:43.750> see<00:05:44.750> that<00:05:44.960> you<00:05:45.290> get<00:05:45.380> a

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
off the open fifth see that you get a

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.960 
off the open fifth see that you get a
big<00:05:45.710> sound<00:05:46.010> like<00:05:46.220> that<00:05:46.400> maybe<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:46.729> got<00:05:46.940> a

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
big sound like that maybe you got a

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.360 
big sound like that maybe you got a
fatter<00:05:47.300> sound<00:05:47.530> so<00:05:48.530> those<00:05:48.710> are<00:05:48.860> just<00:05:48.919> a<00:05:49.160> few

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
fatter sound so those are just a few

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.460 
fatter sound so those are just a few
ways<00:05:49.430> we've<00:05:49.940> considered<00:05:50.360> maybe<00:05:50.660> six<00:05:51.020> or<00:05:51.139> seven

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
ways we've considered maybe six or seven

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.710 
ways we've considered maybe six or seven
ways<00:05:51.680> to<00:05:51.710> make<00:05:52.130> your<00:05:52.280> cords<00:05:52.639> fatter<00:05:52.910> so<00:05:53.690> I

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
ways to make your cords fatter so I

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.930 
ways to make your cords fatter so I
encourage<00:05:54.080> you<00:05:54.200> to<00:05:54.320> look<00:05:54.500> into<00:05:54.710> those<00:05:54.919> now<00:05:55.190> my

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
encourage you to look into those now my

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.780 
encourage you to look into those now my
purpose<00:05:56.330> here<00:05:56.479> was<00:05:56.660> not<00:05:56.870> to<00:05:57.340> my<00:05:58.340> purpose<00:05:58.550> here

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
purpose here was not to my purpose here

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.640 
purpose here was not to my purpose here
was<00:05:58.820> actually<00:05:59.360> make<00:05:59.540> you<00:05:59.690> hungry<00:05:59.870> because<00:06:00.470> you

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
was actually make you hungry because you

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.040 
was actually make you hungry because you
can<00:06:00.860> possibly<00:06:01.639> learn<00:06:01.910> all<00:06:02.210> that<00:06:02.419> in<00:06:02.690> you<00:06:02.930> know

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
can possibly learn all that in you know

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.370 
can possibly learn all that in you know
in<00:06:03.350> one<00:06:03.620> setting<00:06:03.950> but<00:06:04.250> get<00:06:04.820> started<00:06:05.330> and<00:06:05.570> look

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
in one setting but get started and look

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.080 
in one setting but get started and look
into<00:06:06.680> adding<00:06:06.830> color<00:06:07.220> tones<00:06:07.550> and<00:06:07.760> then<00:06:07.850> look

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
into adding color tones and then look

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.700 
into adding color tones and then look
into<00:06:08.300> adding<00:06:08.720> blue<00:06:08.930> notes<00:06:09.169> and<00:06:09.440> then<00:06:09.530> look

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
into adding blue notes and then look

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.710 
into adding blue notes and then look
into<00:06:09.950> voicing<00:06:10.370> and<00:06:10.520> force<00:06:10.729> and<00:06:11.000> so<00:06:11.120> on<00:06:11.270> it's

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
into voicing and force and so on it's

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.200 
into voicing and force and so on it's
all<00:06:11.930> doable<00:06:12.260> it's<00:06:12.590> all<00:06:12.740> possible<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:13.580> if<00:06:14.030> you

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
all doable it's all possible so if you

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.550 
all doable it's all possible so if you
like<00:06:14.389> the<00:06:14.570> sound<00:06:14.750> get<00:06:15.080> to<00:06:15.229> it

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
like the sound get to it
