00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
crossing my fingers that they say yes

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.710 
crossing my fingers that they say yes
because<00:03:34.010> I'd<00:03:34.220> love<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.459> play<00:03:34.790> through<00:03:35.090> some

because I'd love to play through some
more<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:35.930> them<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.440> only<00:03:36.769> downside<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.220> that

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
more of them the only downside is that

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.809 
more of them the only downside is that
on<00:03:38.989> an<00:03:39.530> FMV<00:03:39.919> game<00:03:40.129> you<00:03:40.280> got<00:03:40.400> to<00:03:40.430> make<00:03:40.579> sure<00:03:40.669> that

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
on an FMV game you got to make sure that

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.699 
on an FMV game you got to make sure that
disc<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.120> perfect<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.959> I<00:03:42.379> don't<00:03:42.440> know<00:03:42.590> if<00:03:42.650> you

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
disc is perfect and I don't know if you

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.539 
disc is perfect and I don't know if you
guys<00:03:42.799> will<00:03:42.949> be<00:03:43.010> able<00:03:43.069> to<00:03:43.250> tell<00:03:43.430> in<00:03:43.489> the

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
guys will be able to tell in the

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.009 
guys will be able to tell in the
recording<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:44.239> there<00:03:44.389> was<00:03:44.510> some<00:03:44.629> skipping

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
recording but there was some skipping

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.319 
recording but there was some skipping
that<00:03:45.769> went<00:03:45.949> on<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.310> fixed<00:03:46.669> pretty<00:03:46.970> much<00:03:47.180> all

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
that went on and I fixed pretty much all

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.610 
that went on and I fixed pretty much all
of<00:03:47.359> it<00:03:47.510> in<00:03:47.629> editing<00:03:47.989> so<00:03:48.139> you<00:03:48.230> can't<00:03:48.410> really

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
of it in editing so you can't really

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.819 
of it in editing so you can't really
tell<00:03:48.889> now<00:03:49.099> but<00:03:50.199> you<00:03:51.199> have<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.440> make<00:03:51.560> sure<00:03:51.709> that

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
tell now but you have to make sure that

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:52.960 
tell now but you have to make sure that
if<00:03:51.949> you're<00:03:52.099> gonna<00:03:52.220> play<00:03:52.430> enough<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:52.760> begin

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
if you're gonna play enough and begin

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.110 
if you're gonna play enough and begin
that<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.209> disc<00:03:53.389> is<00:03:53.540> like<00:03:53.799> perfect<00:03:54.799> and<00:03:55.120> the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
that the disc is like perfect and the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.750 
that the disc is like perfect and the
unfortunately<00:03:56.870> Fox<00:03:57.079> ons<00:03:57.290> got<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.500> few<00:03:58.220> issues<00:03:58.730> I

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
unfortunately Fox ons got a few issues I

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.129 
unfortunately Fox ons got a few issues I
might<00:03:59.120> take<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.389> back<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.599> player<00:03:59.750> stores<00:03:59.989> and

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
might take it back to player stores and

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.830 
might take it back to player stores and
see<00:04:00.199> if<00:04:00.290> they<00:04:00.349> can<00:04:00.500> clean<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:00.919> and<00:04:01.040> get<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.879> know

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
see if they can clean it and get it know

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.330 
see if they can clean it and get it know
all<00:04:02.959> cleaned<00:04:03.230> up<00:04:03.379> in<00:04:03.530> Mabel<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:04.010> don't<00:04:04.280> know

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
all cleaned up in Mabel I don't know

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.170 
all cleaned up in Mabel I don't know
maybe<00:04:04.459> we'll<00:04:04.579> play<00:04:04.730> through<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.000> rest<00:04:05.150> of

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
maybe we'll play through the rest of

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.240 
maybe we'll play through the rest of
game<00:04:05.329> it's<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.569> three<00:04:05.840> disc<00:04:06.049> game<00:04:06.349> which

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
game it's a three disc game which

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.439 
game it's a three disc game which
doesn't<00:04:07.549> actually<00:04:07.669> mean<00:04:08.000> anything<00:04:08.060> it

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
doesn't actually mean anything it

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:09.789 
doesn't actually mean anything it
doesn't<00:04:08.690> mean<00:04:08.780> it's<00:04:08.930> particularly<00:04:09.560> long

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
doesn't mean it's particularly long

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.849 
doesn't mean it's particularly long
because<00:04:10.220> video<00:04:10.579> takes<00:04:10.849> up<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.329> much<00:04:11.359> room<00:04:11.900> even

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
because video takes up so much room even

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:14.379 
because video takes up so much room even
though<00:04:12.979> the<00:04:13.099> video<00:04:13.220> quality<00:04:13.609> looks<00:04:14.180> like

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
though the video quality looks like

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:15.879 
though the video quality looks like
garbage<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.109> I'm<00:04:15.169> pretty<00:04:15.349> sure<00:04:15.530> it's<00:04:15.650> running

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
garbage and I'm pretty sure it's running

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.849 
garbage and I'm pretty sure it's running
it<00:04:15.979> like<00:04:16.150> solid<00:04:17.150> 15<00:04:17.510> frames<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.989> second<00:04:18.470> this

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
it like solid 15 frames a second this

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
maybe I'm wrong maybe there may be

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.060 
maybe I'm wrong maybe there may be

don't realistically see us ever doing it
full<00:05:24.530> let's<00:05:24.740> play<00:05:24.830> of<00:05:25.100> any<00:05:25.220> of<00:05:25.400> these<00:05:25.490> because

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
full let's play of any of these because

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.280 
full let's play of any of these because
there<00:05:26.210> even<00:05:26.780> though<00:05:26.840> they're<00:05:26.990> short<00:05:27.230> they're

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
there even though they're short they're

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.110 
there even though they're short they're
just<00:05:27.590> they're<00:05:27.800> really<00:05:28.040> they're<00:05:28.700> pretty<00:05:28.730> bad

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
just they're really they're pretty bad

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.260 
just they're really they're pretty bad
and<00:05:29.480> i<00:05:29.630> think<00:05:29.930> doing<00:05:30.650> like<00:05:31.370> 20<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.790> 30<00:05:32.000> minute

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
and i think doing like 20 to 30 minute

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.630 
and i think doing like 20 to 30 minute
segments<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.780> them<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.080> probably<00:05:33.560> the<00:05:34.490> most

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
segments of them is probably the most

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.540 
segments of them is probably the most
that<00:05:34.790> people<00:05:35.240> could<00:05:35.770> realistically<00:05:36.770> handle

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
that people could realistically handle

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.860 
that people could realistically handle
but<00:05:38.000> if<00:05:38.120> there's<00:05:38.270> some<00:05:38.450> that<00:05:38.570> you'd<00:05:38.690> like<00:05:38.810> to

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
like the only Sega CD 32x game that we

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.040 
like the only Sega CD 32x game that we
