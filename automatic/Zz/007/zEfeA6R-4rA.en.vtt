00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.520
 what they are trying to do is put a 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.470
 little bit of sanity and calm me 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.850
 situation that is totally chaotic if 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.130
 it is true that during the last 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.380

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.420
 little is going into relative normality 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.710
 and above all we want to insist on what 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.740
 relative because it's a situation 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.570
