(surf rock)

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.169
Hi my name is Abby Seitchek. I'm Pedro Borges.
I'm Lex. I'm Tyrone Breaux Jr. Alejandro Ibarra.

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.650
Connor Blake. My name is Louise Grams and
I'm in the BFA Filmmaking program at the New

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:36.960
York Film Academy. I always wanted to act
and film always appealed to me. I remember

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.280
when we first got our video camera and all
we could think about, our whole family could

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.420
only think about movies. I just remember this
magical moment where we watched this movie

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.940
all together and suddenly I looked over and
see my mom just laughing so hard, she almost

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.460
cried. That was the moment I fell in love
with filmmaking. I decided to come to the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.600
New York Film Academy because they are so
hands-on. Typically with something like filming

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.420
and acting, you have to do it. You can't just
read about it, you can't just be taught it.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:32.130
You get to write, you get to act, you get
to edit, you can direct, you can produce.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.280
You have to write your own scripts, write
your own thesis. You're on your feet working

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.750
from the get-go. Their General Ed classes
are still focused on filmmaking. For example,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.000
Public Speaking. Psychology's like opened
my mind up about creating characters. If I'm

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.119
going to get a degree in something, why not
it be something I really love? So everything

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.899
that you're learning is cinema, is filmmaking.
We learned 35mm camera, we learned 16mm camera,

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.459
we're working with it every week in class.
How to set a budget. How to go out and get

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.330
permits. I've been able to work and figure
out how to use different parts of my voice.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.160
Screenwriting, which I never would have thought.
I did not consider myself a writer before

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.930
I came here, but once you have a story that
you want to tell, that you're passionate about,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.480
it's just so great making it better with your
classmates, working on it together. I just

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.980
finished an outside project with my NYFA class
because they're just so amazing. It's all

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.870
about the people you're working with because
it's a collaboration. So one big thing I found

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.480
myself attracted to for NYFA was its international
appeal. Knowing I would be around students

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.360
who were from all over the world. We have
everything. We have Mexicans. Kazakhstan,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.990
India. A girl from Lebanon. Korea. Just all
over the place. You get to meet people from

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.250
a different culture and a different background.
Understand where they're coming from, they

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.100
get to understand where you're coming from,
and you get to learn from them. There's always

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.450
something going on here. There's always some
Q&amp;A. There's always some screening. Where

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.520
else would you rather be than right here in
the middle of everything. You can be in one

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.360
part of LA, drive twenty minutes and you've
got a completely different atmosphere. I love

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.810
LA. It never gets boring, there's always something
to see that you haven't seen yet. Yeah, there's

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.450
nowhere else to be. A year down the road after
graduation I plan to be working on my feature

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.750
film. I am working on the script now so it
is ready by graduation.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.569
(audience clapping, cheering)

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.640
I'm very excited to be graduating. NYFA's
given me such a good platform to stand on.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.700
I want to leave a mark with my films, I want
to make something that the world hasn't yet

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.500
seen before. I can say I did this. This was
in my head, this is what I wrote. And that

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.069
shot there you were on the floor in the weirdest
position, trying to make it look amazing and

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.760
to see it work perfectly on the screen? It's
a very good feeling.
