00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello guys today we will draw a ball 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.799
 soccer 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.769
 first draw a circle and make 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.710
 the basic strokes of the ball that go 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.900
 to vary according to the chosen model 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.260
 I'm going to draw a nike ball 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.260
 what ronaldinho 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.439
 Y 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.060
 or 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.079
 with a marker or watercolors make a base 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:51.350
 colored one or two shades below the 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.960
 color of the ball I used a color 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.000
 dark gray then the predominant color 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.510
 of the ball that I'm going to draw is the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.510
 black 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.750
 I leave some blank spaces just in 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.659
 the divisions of the different areas 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 of the ball and later on I will explain 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.650
 why now I'm going to start coloring 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.479
 with prismacolor brand color pencils 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.990
 I will be placing the codes in the part 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.380
 top right of this video from the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.200
 principle they must choose if there will be an area 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.020
 on which more light will strike or more 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.690
 shadow to plan where we will place 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 the lightest or darkest tones in the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.899
 ball 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.359
 For example, I will make the light come from 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.320
 top down and left to 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:43.780
 lecce in this way I already know that I will use shades 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.990
 darker on the left side and 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.000
 they will have less lit areas here like this 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.429
 I know that the shadows are the ground 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.939
 will be projected to the left of the 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:58.179
 It is important to determine if the 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.360
 ball looks very smart or has texture 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.900
 as we usually observe in leather 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.570
 for example 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.210
 to help give texture to our 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.580
 surface we can color by doing 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.830
 small circular movements what 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.540
 will invite the rugosity of the ball if 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.209
 I had it 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.579
 It is also important to degrade the 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.370
 colors in the shadow light interface 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:25.849
 to get a more realistic result 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.480
 as well as give the most minute details 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.480
 possible 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.900
 or not 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.770
 with a black graph style 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.160
 I'm going to draw dark lines right at the 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.820
 divisions that he had left blank 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.830
 this will give a sensation of indentations 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.370
 where the seams of each part of 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.370
 the ball 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.459
 with a brush and acrylic paint made 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.390
 small dots on the surfaces 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:46.450
 most illuminated ball points 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.599
 They should be small and very close together 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.629
 from others this will not only illuminate the 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:56.670
 surface as it will give you more texture and 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.670
 therefore more realism 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.530
 it's good and the outermost points of 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.860
 determined area look less white 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.870
 we can achieve this by diluting a bit 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.090
 plus the acrylic paint before placing 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.769
 the points but we can also 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.400
 just remove some of the 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.840
 painting of the points already done as you see 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.540
 that I am doing here with the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.669
 finger but you can do it too 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.260
 do not worry about a rag because the 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.260
 absorbent with a sponge 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.280
 I also use acrylic paint for 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.380
 simulate the seams of the divisions 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:57.970
 dark I did with the graphical style 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:05:00.070
 black to finish painting the 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.620
 seams with acrylic paint can I 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.169
 reinforce the shadows around with the 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.080
 same black graph style and to finish 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.199
 with graphite pencils can be for 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.720
 example a hd and a 6 b 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.660
 I'm going to draw the shadow that is projected 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.030
 on the floor I start with the pencil hd in 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.419
 this case is being a shadow the slight 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.990
 and to the medium reinforcement at the end with the 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.990
 pencil 6 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.590
 You can strike down with a pointed brush 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:53.199
 flat or like an extra cloth a chamois 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.310
 I use these instead of the xoom and not for 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:59.949
 have a smoother result and degraded 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:03.070
 and you guys ready if you liked please
