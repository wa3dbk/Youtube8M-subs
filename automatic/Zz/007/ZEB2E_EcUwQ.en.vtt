00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
there and this is the course when I go

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.460 
there and this is the course when I go
up<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.270> D<00:04:30.659> again

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470

on<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.560> pretty<00:04:31.860> cool<00:04:32.130> worse<00:04:32.400> free<00:04:33.440> because<00:04:34.440> with

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
on a pretty cool worse free because with

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.190 
on a pretty cool worse free because with
this<00:04:34.950> scar<00:04:35.400> pretty<00:04:35.760> much<00:04:36.030> after<00:04:36.270> every<00:04:36.900> kill

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
this scar pretty much after every kill

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.830 
this scar pretty much after every kill
you<00:04:37.500> have<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.920> reload<00:04:38.400> if<00:04:38.790> you<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.300> spraying

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
you have to reload if you like spraying

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.610 
you have to reload if you like spraying
and<00:04:40.170> not<00:04:40.320> using<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:41.900> single<00:04:42.900> shops<00:04:43.200> you<00:04:43.590> can

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
and not using a single shops you can

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.130 
and not using a single shops you can
trade<00:04:43.950> this<00:04:44.130> this<00:04:44.400> guy<00:04:44.970> only<00:04:45.300> has<00:04:45.390> fully

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
trade this this guy only has fully

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.700 
trade this this guy only has fully
automatic<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.070> single<00:04:47.580> shot<00:04:48.290> where<00:04:49.290> but<00:04:49.560> it's

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
automatic and single shot where but it's

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.890 
automatic and single shot where but it's
not<00:04:50.010> very<00:04:50.250> good<00:04:50.400> at<00:04:50.640> long<00:04:50.820> range<00:04:51.090> anyway<00:04:51.600> so<00:04:51.660> I

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
not very good at long range anyway so I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.480 
not very good at long range anyway so I
don't<00:04:52.050> know<00:04:52.170> why<00:04:52.320> you'd<00:04:52.500> use<00:04:52.800> single<00:04:53.280> shot

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
don't know why you'd use single shot

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.970 
don't know why you'd use single shot
much<00:04:53.730> as<00:04:53.880> burst<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.840> this<00:04:55.380> is<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.620> bit<00:04:55.770> here

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
much as burst so this is the bit here

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.710 
much as burst so this is the bit here
when<00:04:56.130> I<00:04:56.160> go<00:04:56.370> over<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.610> deeds<00:04:56.940> they<00:04:57.210> capped<00:04:57.480> it

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
when I go over to deeds they capped it

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.790 
when I go over to deeds they capped it
it's<00:04:58.620> nice<00:04:58.920> and<00:04:59.130> nearly<00:04:59.370> cut<00:04:59.700> me<00:04:59.910> twice<00:05:00.180> then

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
it's nice and nearly cut me twice then

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.020 
it's nice and nearly cut me twice then
must<00:05:01.800> have<00:05:01.950> been<00:05:02.070> terribly<00:05:02.520> much<00:05:02.790> like

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
must have been terribly much like

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.120 
must have been terribly much like
standing<00:05:03.630> still<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.110> running<00:05:04.350> right<00:05:04.770> toward

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
standing still and running right toward

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.120 
standing still and running right toward
let's<00:05:05.490> see<00:05:05.640> how<00:05:05.730> to<00:05:05.790> get<00:05:06.180> me<00:05:06.860> so<00:05:07.860> here's<00:05:08.070> a

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
let's see how to get me so here's a

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.570 
let's see how to get me so here's a
little<00:05:08.310> streak<00:05:09.150> thing<00:05:09.480> it's<00:05:09.780> not<00:05:09.870> absolutely

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
little streak thing it's not absolutely

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.060 
little streak thing it's not absolutely
amazing<00:05:11.580> but<00:05:12.000> it's<00:05:12.690> pretty<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.500> look<00:05:13.680> at<00:05:13.890> them

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
amazing but it's pretty to look at them

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.290 
amazing but it's pretty to look at them

went down to like 24 frames at some

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.360 
went down to like 24 frames at some
point<00:05:38.850> which<00:05:39.690> is<00:05:39.870> a<00:05:39.900> pretty<00:05:40.230> bad<00:05:40.530> cuz<00:05:41.070> i'd<00:05:41.130> like

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
point which is a pretty bad cuz i'd like

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.940 
point which is a pretty bad cuz i'd like
to<00:05:41.550> get<00:05:41.669> 60<00:05:42.090> frames<00:05:42.330> but<00:05:42.690> my<00:05:42.990> graphics<00:05:43.410> card<00:05:43.470> is

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
to get 60 frames but my graphics card is

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.600 
to get 60 frames but my graphics card is
quite<00:05:44.460> old<00:05:44.640> now<00:05:44.960> two<00:05:45.960> years<00:05:46.140> old<00:05:46.470> I<00:05:46.800> got<00:05:47.490> it

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
quite old now two years old I got it

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.180 
quite old now two years old I got it
about<00:05:47.669> here<00:05:47.970> two<00:05:48.360> years<00:05:48.390> ago<00:05:48.950> but<00:05:49.950> it's<00:05:50.130> still

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
about here two years ago but it's still

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.490 
about here two years ago but it's still
playable<00:05:50.940> like<00:05:51.450> there's<00:05:51.690> no<00:05:51.840> point<00:05:52.140> getting<00:05:52.320> a

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
playable like there's no point getting a

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.050 
playable like there's no point getting a
new<00:05:52.650> graphics<00:05:53.010> card<00:05:53.100> now<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.669> I<00:05:53.700> can<00:05:53.820> still

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
new graphics card now and I can still

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.380 
new graphics card now and I can still
play<00:05:54.390> the<00:05:54.780> majority<00:05:55.410> of<00:05:55.440> games<00:05:56.390> absolutely

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
play the majority of games absolutely

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.770 
play the majority of games absolutely
fine<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:58.310> still<00:05:59.310> do<00:05:59.460> well<00:05:59.729> it's<00:06:00.090> still<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.479> fair

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
fine and still do well it's still a fair

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.290 
fine and still do well it's still a fair
was<00:06:00.900> getting<00:06:01.080> like<00:06:01.169> 10<00:06:01.470> frames<00:06:01.940> unlike<00:06:02.940> low

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
was getting like 10 frames unlike low

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.450 
was getting like 10 frames unlike low
then<00:06:03.720> definitely<00:06:04.350> i'll<00:06:04.710> get<00:06:04.860> a<00:06:04.890> new<00:06:05.100> graphics

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
then definitely i'll get a new graphics

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.030 
then definitely i'll get a new graphics
card<00:06:05.520> but<00:06:06.479> this<00:06:06.750> is<00:06:06.870> my<00:06:06.960> final<00:06:07.200> kill<00:06:07.590> here

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.880 
card but this is my final kill here
there's<00:06:08.310> a<00:06:08.400> pretty<00:06:08.640> good<00:06:08.850> game<00:06:09.080> i<00:06:10.080> could<00:06:10.800> have

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
there's a pretty good game i could have

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
there's a pretty good game i could have
got<00:06:11.160> a<00:06:11.460> much<00:06:12.060> better<00:06:12.390> game<00:06:13.010> recorded<00:06:14.010> but<00:06:14.340> I

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
got a much better game recorded but I

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.690 
got a much better game recorded but I
kept<00:06:15.360> running<00:06:15.540> out<00:06:15.780> of<00:06:15.810> hard<00:06:16.080> drive<00:06:16.350> space

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
kept running out of hard drive space
