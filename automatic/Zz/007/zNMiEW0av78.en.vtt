let them know right at the pump at the
point<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.530> write<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.890> whether<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.250> not<00:02:08.340> they

point of write up whether or not they

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.420 
point of write up whether or not they
need<00:02:08.610> an<00:02:08.729> alignment<00:02:09.890> at<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.130> point

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
need an alignment at that point

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.280 
need an alignment at that point
basically<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.239> increases<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> sale

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
basically it increases the sale

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.630 
basically it increases the sale
if<00:02:13.349> they<00:02:13.620> do<00:02:13.680> need<00:02:13.890> an<00:02:14.010> alignment<00:02:14.220> because

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
if they do need an alignment because

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.400 
if they do need an alignment because

alignments<00:03:23.890> with<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.220> but<00:03:24.549> they<00:03:24.819> got<00:03:25.000> old

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
alignments with that but they got old

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.119 
alignments with that but they got old
and<00:03:25.390> then<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:25.569> just<00:03:25.739> someone<00:03:26.739> would<00:03:26.890> come<00:03:27.040> in

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
and then we just someone would come in

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.259 
and then we just someone would come in
and<00:03:27.190> we<00:03:27.280> look<00:03:27.459> at<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> car<00:03:27.970> up<00:03:28.060> on<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.180> lift

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.699 
and we look at the car up on the lift
and<00:03:28.569> you<00:03:28.629> check<00:03:28.870> their<00:03:29.049> tires<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.410> we<00:03:29.560> say

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
and you check their tires and we say

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.990 
and you check their tires and we say
yeah<00:03:29.890> they're<00:03:30.069> worn<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.280> little<00:03:30.370> bit<00:03:30.580> unevenly

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
yeah they're worn a little bit unevenly

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.539 
yeah they're worn a little bit unevenly
and<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.269> need<00:03:31.420> an<00:03:31.540> alignment<00:03:32.190> Vinnie<00:03:33.190> came<00:03:33.400> in

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
and you need an alignment Vinnie came in

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.309 
and you need an alignment Vinnie came in
one<00:03:33.730> day<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.940> showed<00:03:34.330> us<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.569> alignment

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
one day and showed us this alignment

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.770 
one day and showed us this alignment
checker<00:03:35.650> from<00:03:35.890> Hunter<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:37.299> had<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.569> print

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780 
checker from Hunter and it had to print
out<00:03:37.930> with<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.470> what<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.370> can<00:03:39.489> do<00:03:39.580> is<00:03:39.700> you

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
out with it and what you can do is you

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.920 
out with it and what you can do is you
can<00:03:39.910> just<00:03:39.940> run<00:03:40.180> it<00:03:40.209> over<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.540> check<00:03:40.720> or<00:03:40.870> it

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
can just run it over to check or it

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.960 
can just run it over to check or it
takes<00:03:41.079> about<00:03:41.200> 60<00:03:41.680> seconds<00:03:42.099> and<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:42.819> actually

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
takes about 60 seconds and we actually

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.160 
takes about 60 seconds and we actually
had<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.239> printout<00:03:43.599> that<00:03:43.660> we<00:03:43.870> could<00:03:43.989> show

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
alignment checker we were doing we have

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.670 
alignment checker we were doing we have
one<00:04:01.720> guy<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:01.989> that's<00:04:02.170> all<00:04:02.290> he<00:04:02.379> does<00:04:02.530> is

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
one guy that that's all he does is

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.970 
one guy that that's all he does is
alignment<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.760> we<00:04:03.910> are<00:04:04.000> doing<00:04:04.180> about<00:04:04.360> 65<00:04:04.989> 60

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
alignment and we are doing about 65 60

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.640 
alignment and we are doing about 65 60
65<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.549> month<00:04:06.879> the<00:04:07.720> first<00:04:07.900> month<00:04:08.079> we<00:04:08.349> got<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
65 a month the first month we got the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.259 
65 a month the first month we got the
alignment<00:04:09.010> check<00:04:09.160> if<00:04:09.280> we<00:04:09.400> doubled<00:04:09.849> that<00:04:09.970> and

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
alignment check if we doubled that and

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.990 
alignment check if we doubled that and
now<00:04:10.750> we're<00:04:10.900> averaging<00:04:11.110> about<00:04:11.500> 150<00:04:12.489> 160

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
now we're averaging about 150 160

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.879 
now we're averaging about 150 160
alignments<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:13.840> one<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.319> it's<00:04:14.680> been<00:04:14.859> very

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
alignments and one so it's been very

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.789 
alignments and one so it's been very
good<00:04:15.459> we've<00:04:16.359> seen<00:04:16.510> some<00:04:16.720> tire<00:04:16.959> sales<00:04:17.320> increase

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
good we've seen some tire sales increase

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
phenomenal piece of equipment if you

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.100 
phenomenal piece of equipment if you
don't<00:05:04.160> have<00:05:04.340> one<00:05:04.550> you<00:05:04.760> should<00:05:04.790> definitely<00:05:05.270> go
