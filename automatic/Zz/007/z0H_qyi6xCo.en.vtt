Hi.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.920
I'm Arne Duncan, Secretary of Education.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.619
And first, I want to thank the Institute of
Educational Leadership for their leadership

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.490
and for giving us a great forum for making
this announcement.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.630
I also want to thank my good friend Harvard's
Dr. Karen Mapp for helping us develop our

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.490
draft framework and for her insights and recommendations.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.000
In all my life I have seen first-hand the
positive effects family and community engagement

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.650
can have and do have on our students success.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.260
Research absolutely supports this.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.530
When parents are involved in the educational
process of their children, students are more

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.989
likely to attend school regularly, to take
more rigorous courses, earn higher grades,

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.629
and graduate and go on to both college and
careers.

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.170
And that's why I am so pleased to announce
the upcoming release of the U.S. Department

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.850
of Education's Family and Community Engagement
Framework, which will support families, schools,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.740
districts and states in building capacity
for student achievement and school improvement.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.520
Beginning back in October of 2011, our Department,
with the assistance of leaders like Dr. Mapp,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.930
began working to develop a framework for family
and community engagement.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.630
And in December 2012, we released the draft
document and sought feedback from the field.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.960
Today we're sharing our Model Framework that
schools can use to help them develop partnerships

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.549
and increase both family and community engagement.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.810
It's just one example of the work that schools
can do to build stronger family and school

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.340
partnershipsâ€”ones that expand opportunities
for shared responsibility between families

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.020
and the broader community.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.240
And please when we speak about families, let's
not forget our Dads.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.170
It's important that fathers -- along with
brothers, uncles, and grandfathers -- are

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.420
actively engaged in schools.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.510
They can and must share their values and serve
as role models, especially for young boys

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.310
who need their support.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.410
During this conference and in the months ahead,
please look forward to the release of more

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.250
model framework resources for districts and
schools, and guidance about our Department

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.310
can better support family and community engagement.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.840
Thank you so much.
