00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 a simple elegant painting that's how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.330
 that pierre montillot likes to define his 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.259
 works for 40 years the exposed artist 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.550
 in many galleries 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.559
 especially in switzerland 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.759
 isabelle white collar and damien bourelly 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.719
 met the painter in his 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.510
 workshop in saint jorioz in haute savoie 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.789
 a little corner almost lost over 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.060
 Lake Annecy is the new refuge of 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.550
 painter is an artist who likes calm 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.769
 the tranquility of the great outdoors and the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.399
 company of some animals a frame 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.219
 idyllic propitious to his imagination 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.500
 when we do a lot of exhibitions 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.800
 it is very good but we are very much 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.239
 solicited and that's really it's 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 return to nature in the countryside it's 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.600
 for me it's really beautiful 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.789
 for 40 years stone painting 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.739
 turned impressionist to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:03.420
 montmartre he has since and pure and his 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.460
 style since now about twenty 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.040
 years 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.939
 over the years the painting goes it's pure 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.909
 more and more yes to go to in 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.990
 do some traits but I give the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.380
 maximum in my painting but with little 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.380
 of traits 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:33.520
 in fact I come very rarely there are 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:37.600
 moments that's why it's good 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.930
 feel that creation is coming and it's 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.730
 times it's not sure if it's raining 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.810
 Lagesse takes the brush 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:50.080
 if the weather is nice I prefer the first 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.180
 I make series of 15 20 canvases on 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.690
 the dear i have always internal on at 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.610
 she supported after three mini stage I 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.280
 can easily stay two months three 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.170
 month without talent the artist is always 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.720
 amazed that we love the paintings he 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.179
 realize this is probably also where 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.970
 resides its stone monti elegance in the east 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.610
 an artist all in emotion who says go 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.190
 today to the essential the universe that 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.280
 we book is simple sober and stripped 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.760
 like the definition maybe of a 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.760
 work of art
