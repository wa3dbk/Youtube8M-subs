00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello today, we'll break it down 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:25.019
 a group of beetles called battery 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:27.380
 is played in the way 30 seconds in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380
 this song 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.329
 getting out of a childhood song is difficult 100 bar 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.910
 and chords put on what bars on the family 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.219
 fret on the ninth year we pin a little finger 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.370
 fourth string and ring finger 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:53.190
 the fifth string in the ninth year shall 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.329
 turn out so next chord 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.300
 move it all 7 on the fifth fret and 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.300
 add middle finger on 3 amount 6 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.200
 here it is here and move to answered from and 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:19.160
 then the second one is basically all four 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:24.820
 brute force here, too, just yank 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:38.180
 sixth string 3 2 lower spot and again 3 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:44.510
 6 3 3 and this is all once for each 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:48.729
 year basis principle can be different 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:54.100
 play as if i show 2 views 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.100
 the first easiest is achieved so 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:19.660
 chords the same soup in order goes 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.660
 7 5 3 hours as a beat down twice 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.569
 the third time it's not a problem 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.569
 if that is the plot 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:50.180
 that's all very simple and the second way 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.180
 for chorus so 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.460
 here 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:21.159
 all codes do also go down twice 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:31.180
 girl 3 1 2 court on 5 fret 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:37.599
 we beat three times already on the third fret 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:41.970
 legs u twice again and on the second 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.970
 fret that's it so we'll kill four times 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:08.459
 learn the guys on the guitar useful thing 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.459
 good for everyone
