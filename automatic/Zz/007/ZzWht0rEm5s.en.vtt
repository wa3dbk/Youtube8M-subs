00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
one the model is wearing is more like a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.060 
one the model is wearing is more like a
burgundy<00:02:10.190> color<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.729> think<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:11.180> called<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.600> and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
burgundy color I think it's called a and

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.640 
burgundy color I think it's called a and
lx9<00:02:13.090> 5/3<00:02:14.090> something<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.780> first<00:02:18.350> of

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
lx9 5/3 something like that so first of

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.030 
lx9 5/3 something like that so first of
all<00:02:18.799> most<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.489> human<00:02:19.940> hair<00:02:20.150> wig<00:02:21.040> so

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
all most this is a human hair wig so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.479 
all most this is a human hair wig so
these<00:02:22.250> curls<00:02:23.739> are<00:02:24.739> going<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.070> have<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.340> be

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
these curls are going to have to be

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.530 
these curls are going to have to be
managed

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.120 

some<00:02:29.540> kind<00:02:30.109> of<00:02:30.200> way<00:02:31.780> now<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.810> think<00:02:32.989> this<00:02:33.470> style

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
some kind of way now I think this style

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.690 
some kind of way now I think this style
is<00:02:34.459> really<00:02:34.790> really<00:02:35.690> different<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:37.310> really

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
is really really different it's really

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.670 
is really really different it's really
cute

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.059 

I<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.930> I'm<00:02:44.079> probably<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.680> be<00:02:44.799> playing

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
I think I'm probably going to be playing

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.630 
I think I'm probably going to be playing
with<00:02:45.340> these<00:02:45.459> curls<00:02:45.939> for<00:02:46.329> a<00:02:46.950> good<00:02:47.950> long<00:02:48.219> minute

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
with these curls for a good long minute

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.599 
with these curls for a good long minute
I<00:02:49.299> figure<00:02:50.109> out<00:02:50.230> exactly<00:02:50.439> how<00:02:50.829> I<00:02:51.010> want<00:02:51.400> them<00:02:51.549> to

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609

lay<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:53.560> probably<00:02:54.099> get<00:02:54.280> some<00:02:54.549> curl<00:02:54.849> product

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
lay and I probably get some curl product

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.259

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
hair is relaxed but I'll probably get

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.580

I<00:03:24.669> left<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.599> straps<00:03:25.900> where<00:03:26.200> they<00:03:26.319> were<00:03:26.409> and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
I left the straps where they were and

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.789 
I left the straps where they were and
this<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.599> how<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.900> fits<00:03:29.139> me<00:03:29.409> so<00:03:31.560> I'll<00:03:32.560> turn

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
this is how it fits me so I'll turn

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.259

around<00:03:32.919> so<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.400> can<00:03:33.549> see<00:03:33.579> how<00:03:33.819> it<00:03:33.939> looks<00:03:34.150> in

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
around so you can see how it looks in

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:45.890 
around so you can see how it looks in
the<00:03:34.329> back

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.870 

alright<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.110> this<00:03:47.290> style<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.920> really<00:03:48.430> cute<00:03:48.700> and

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
alright so this style is really cute and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.500 
alright so this style is really cute and
fun<00:03:49.360> I<00:03:50.250> think<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.520> looks<00:03:51.700> really<00:03:51.940> good<00:03:52.210> with

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
fun I think it looks really good with

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.550 
fun I think it looks really good with
the<00:03:52.630> big<00:03:52.810> earrings<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:55.480> kind<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.200> have<00:03:56.320> big

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
the big earrings I kind of have big

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.120 
the big earrings I kind of have big
cheeks<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:58.810> like<00:03:59.200> to<00:03:59.380> wear<00:03:59.560> stuff<00:03:59.890> that

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
cheeks so I like to wear stuff that

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.710 
cheeks so I like to wear stuff that
either<00:04:00.900> hits<00:04:01.900> right<00:04:02.320> at<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.680> cheek<00:04:02.920> or<00:04:03.720> has

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
either hits right at the cheek or has

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.900 
either hits right at the cheek or has
layers<00:04:05.080> they<00:04:05.470> hit<00:04:05.710> at<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.040> cheek<00:04:06.250> which<00:04:06.700> this

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
layers they hit at the cheek which this

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.280 
layers they hit at the cheek which this
one<00:04:07.120> does<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.730> I<00:04:09.760> think<00:04:09.880> this<00:04:10.240> week<00:04:10.510> fits<00:04:11.020> my

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
one does so I think this week fits my

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.800 
one does so I think this week fits my
head<00:04:11.610> perfectly<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:13.000> if<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.270> have<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.450> smaller

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
head perfectly so if you have a smaller

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.400 
head perfectly so if you have a smaller
head

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
head

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.729 
head
you<00:04:15.040> should<00:04:15.280> anticipate<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:16.390> curls<00:04:17.380> looking

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
you should anticipate the curls looking

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.640 
you should anticipate the curls looking
longer<00:04:17.980> on<00:04:18.550> your<00:04:18.790> head<00:04:19.110> as<00:04:20.110> you<00:04:20.320> can<00:04:20.470> see<00:04:20.620> I

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
longer on your head as you can see I

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.490 
longer on your head as you can see I
haven't<00:04:20.950> stopped<00:04:21.690> fuller<00:04:22.690> with<00:04:22.870> these<00:04:23.020> curls

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
haven't stopped fuller with these curls

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.870 
haven't stopped fuller with these curls
yet<00:04:24.040> I<00:04:25.620> don't<00:04:26.620> think<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.070> would<00:04:27.250> try<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.460> party<00:04:27.850> I

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:39.810 
think I would just wear them straight
down<00:04:29.470> in<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:29.980> front<00:04:30.660> like<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.840> model<00:04:38.820> but
