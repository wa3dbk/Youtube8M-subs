 the first thing you need is a launcher 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.439

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.070

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.019

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.159

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.310
 Next we go waterfowl 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:17.100

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.549

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.060

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:42.989
