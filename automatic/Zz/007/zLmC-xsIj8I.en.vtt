00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.930 

well<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.739> sort<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.039> started<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.820> know

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
different for this truck exhaust pipe

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.700 
different for this truck exhaust pipe
certainly<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.930> something<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.260> wanted<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.559> play

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
around with so we've got four induction

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720 
around with so we've got four induction
pipes<00:00:54.510> eight<00:00:54.870> exhaust<00:00:55.320> pipes<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.489> top<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
pipes eight exhaust pipes just to top it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.120 
pipes eight exhaust pipes just to top it

we<00:01:58.790> tried<00:01:59.570> a<00:01:59.840> few<00:01:59.870> different<00:02:00.050> ideas<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.710> what

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
we tried a few different ideas and what

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.930 
we tried a few different ideas and what
we<00:02:00.890> want<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.130> do<00:02:01.190> with<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.340> tanks<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.790> so

we want to do with the tanks and so

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.490 
we want to do with the tanks and so
forth<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:02.450> we<00:02:02.750> decided<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.170> wrap<00:02:03.320> them<00:02:03.440> in

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
forth so we decided to wrap them in

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.840 
forth so we decided to wrap them in
leather<00:02:03.770> didn't<00:02:04.010> look<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.280> good<00:02:04.520> until<00:02:04.820> we

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
leather didn't look that good until we

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.940 
leather didn't look that good until we
actually<00:02:05.030> bolted<00:02:05.450> them<00:02:05.540> on<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:05.870> and<00:02:06.710> these

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
actually bolted them on and and these

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.190 
actually bolted them on and and these
straps<00:02:07.310> got<00:02:07.490> airbrushed<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.060> know<00:02:08.180> so<00:02:08.479> that

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
of the fact that we can probably take a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.300 
of the fact that we can probably take a
little<00:02:29.140> bit<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.320> attention<00:02:29.710> away<00:02:29.800> from<00:02:30.070> some

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
little bit the attention away from some

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.760
