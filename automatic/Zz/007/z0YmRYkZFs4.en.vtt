00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 after launching the 2013 version of its 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.360
 3521 day reed harvester brings one more 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.759
 great novelty for the market 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.120
 the new simulator for training 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.170
 cane harvester operators 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.570
 equipment that arrives with the same 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.420
 Navy Simulators Technology 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.119
 north american and even nasa 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.859
 see the next five years with 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 intensification of agricultural mechanization 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.599
 in the areas of sugarcane cultivation 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.840
 only to drive the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.120
 will require another 13 thousand new 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.640
 operators and in the face of this 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.710
 prepare and train these 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 Where did you bring workers from Brazil? 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.960
 an exclusively designed simulator 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.980
 to train 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.760
 Cane and simulator I 'm going to test now is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.500
 to train harvester operators 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.199
 3521 is the first machine simulator 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 agriculture in Brazil and was designed to 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.309
 by a company in texas that assists 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.309
 US government and also NASA. 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.900
 the simulator from where it was presented in 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.060
 campinas in the interior of são paulo a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 event that had the presence of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.130
 consultants of the group of motomecanização 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.350
 the sugar and alcohol industry and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.810
 day-to-day dealerships for each 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.939
 harvester entering the market a new 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.930
 drop in demand if at least four 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.420
 operators 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.060
 So it's a big bill of people. 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.060
 Thinking of a thousand machines years in this country 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.950
 would be at least 4 thousand people years 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.610
 and simulator but simulator is not only a 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.729
 teacher 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.299
 he is an evaluator also this simulator 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.460
 where it will be used to evaluate the already 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.909
 regarded as operators as they are 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.159
 operating on the sound and launched here 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.130
 in Brasilia for the first time, but 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.950
 from the agricultural line our friends 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.469
 in law 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.110
 yellow building have three simulators 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.869
 weeks behind us and only the first 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.349
 two for agricultural and also in 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.660
 The model 13 machine works as 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.140
 simulator is for this the launch is at the 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.940
 while the new simulator 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.000
 sugar cane harvesters where it is 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.200
 laptop and will soon be on sale 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.630
 providing the sugarcane supplier with 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.180
 mills reduce training time 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.709
 in the field of fuel consumption and 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.349
 maintenance of used machinery 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.769
 during conventional training a 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.370
 need that we have always had is 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.829
 a thing to help in the preparation of 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.829
 our operators 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.319
 We're going to change a step here. 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:53.709
 of preparation with a cost 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:56.560
 I believe that very reasonable 70% of the cost 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.140
 production of the liter of ethanol 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.480
 occurs in the field of mechanization 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.280
 the simulator will cause us 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.700
 we have the ability to train more 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.090
 people and the new machine in the 2013 version 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.489
 it also brings a number of benefits 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.579
 which will improve operator interaction 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.430
 with the machine to facilitate interpretation 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:21.549
 of the machine functions and at the end 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.620
 efficiency plus income less consumption 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.620
 of fuel - cost of production
