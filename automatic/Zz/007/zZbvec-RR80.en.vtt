 weeks now regularly with the 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.840

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.839
 because I am always present is what that 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.720
 concerns 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.509
 yes all currently positive yes 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.369
 sit on the couch and belong to that group 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.960
 feels that as now the maximum attainable 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.149
 at this time 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.559
 yes i think my remember where 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.690
 I come from and all in all I have 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.980
 for almost a year not on one 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.010
 played a decent level 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.699
 And yes if you actually now after you 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.870
 be fit again for about six or seven weeks 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.730
 yeah actually already a man again 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.280
 selection is there you must be satisfied 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.829
 and I am still keeping 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.809
 enough satisfaction from the training sessions and 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.820
 the matches with the second team 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.739
 And of course you always have 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.989
 always feel like you want to come with me 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.030
 and do good name but every minute 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.350
 I get it now is just me and me 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.230
 just have to make sure that this season is fit 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.370
 remains that I stick with it and away 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.740
 next season I really have to go and watch 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.210
 to a place in the first that's your 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.570
 plan your strategy we could 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.430
 say 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.310
 yes no yes well you know yourself already 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.470
 fooled chef yo i have to go now 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.270
 have to show it and I want in the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.740
 basic elf and of course you want that 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.970
 you have to be realistic and on this 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.830
 that is not realistic at the moment 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.590
 this group and we see that for example 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.940
 if spell the winning man against psv 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.230
 radiates whole for unity oh 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.940
 correct forfeit cheering 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.340
 along the sidelines 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.410
 and fire that unit every day or well 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.490
 is that looks bad on the outside world 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.990
 no no I think that is indeed the case 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.650
 if you see how we how we train it 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.600
 is very sharp 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.820
 ticks are distributed and everything 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.560
 is accepted and therefore very much 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.630
 respect each other and we just notice that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.910
 we really are a group and guess what that 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.860
 that is a strong point of ours 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.330
 is that you have heard that the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.700
 Understand what groups are but that's you 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.380
 totally out of the question is typical of 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.780
 you also easier to submit 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.280
 with your current role 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.270
 well for me is of course different then 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.510
 for another bills 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.160
 I mean yes I come from one of one 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.080
 very different 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.590
 yes it is therefore more difficult for me to be late 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.670
 I say so and or it 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.890
 whether it still me everything of exactly 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.510
 harder for you yes well considering my 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.580
 situation that I have been driving for so long 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.100
 come back then you have the sooner peace 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.140
 because you are all this shoe fit and that 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.500
 you just have to wait a while for you 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.720
 opportunity 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.300
 Ruud maker for so an example to 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.060
 call yes well all respect him how 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.670
 so he picks it up and when you see how 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.330
 you train it is just good and good 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.460
 at the moment 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.780
 you just see that it is running at the bee 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.280
 the boss team and just have to be patient 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.170
 and you just have to make sure 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.270
 to you satisfaction from the from the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.050
 get training and show you 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.310
 that you are there and well I mean I think 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.960
 not what all that very much 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.340
 It is important to present it 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.880
 say how everyone feels 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.870
 it just goes well and positively 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.340
 positive feeling is there and then it must be 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.600
 just hold on and we are in it 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.790
 netherlands good life from parts of 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.990
 stamps on people you came from nec 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.930
 wherever you would just like it 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.000
 desire in the time still could not 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.140
 play through injuries and now they 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.120
 chess ran an example of someone 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.540
 who also needed a long run-up 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.890
 so that he in this club in this town 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.090
 This role important work there will also be one 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.590
 kind of scenario what you get for yourself 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.760
 see 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.220
 but I'm already talking about it 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.860
 had that he also no ideal start here 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.630
 at feyenoord and 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.970
 everyone found a mis-purchase of VVV 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.070
 this city at this club yes well that must 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.480
 only for himself to to 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.650
 just to indicate you can go right 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.240
 to the positive 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.300
 yes no yes good I always really myself 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.030
 positive attitude and yes it is it is 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.440
 there has been a lot a period but i me 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.360
 I have done everything and I can handle myself 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.920
 nothing to blame day in day out 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.650
 I have delivered for as soon as possible 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.270
 again and yes you can do that 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.400
 easy to put down than then 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.070
 I ask something well then it had to be that way 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.420
 and I feel that I am 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.790
 the now behind the face i feel good 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.380
 and I feel fit I actually have you 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.160
 just no longer bothered by that 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.980
 so in that respect yes good as me 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.510
 the ruben scenario yes if i have that path 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.380
 now go for a walk yes this would of course 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.700
 be fantastic 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.310
 so that for women just as national coach 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.900
 remain polite for so long 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.880
 they are so often every why wins 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.180
 feyenoord sunday in nijmegen 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.950
 why why but it is not one 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.080
 west that we just won late 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.730
 that it is clear it is and this is 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.710
 a stable team that is recognizable 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.080
 we play football are very strong 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.590
 midfield and they the attackers who what 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.320
 to create 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.150
 And yes you have to be wanting your Nijmegen 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.370
 win because it's it's not easy 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.169
 to win there but well we are going 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.020
 there for the full three points 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.830
 and 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.720
 that must also happen given how we now 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.620
 yes, how little perform we are 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.620
 required to put vegetables there
