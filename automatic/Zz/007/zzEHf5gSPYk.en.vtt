how<00:02:09.929> much<00:02:10.110> detailing<00:02:11.009> our<00:02:11.250> work<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.700> entails

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
how much detailing our work it entails

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.280 
how much detailing our work it entails
and<00:02:12.599> then<00:02:13.489> step<00:02:14.489> 3<00:02:14.790> choose<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> chain<00:02:15.540> all<00:02:15.810> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and then step 3 choose a chain all of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.170 
and then step 3 choose a chain all of
our<00:02:16.440> lockets<00:02:16.739> come<00:02:17.099> with<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> chain<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
our lockets come with a chain so you

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.360 
our lockets come with a chain so you
don't<00:02:18.420> have<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.959> buy<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> separate<00:02:20.130> chain

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
don't have to buy a separate chain

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.370 
don't have to buy a separate chain
unless<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.880> want<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.930> shame<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.260> it

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
unless you want to and the shame that it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.320 
unless you want to and the shame that it
comes<00:02:22.620> with<00:02:22.739> it's<00:02:23.040> actually<00:02:23.430> really<00:02:23.790> really

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
comes with it's actually really really

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.080 
comes with it's actually really really
pretty<00:02:25.100> like<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.280> um<00:02:26.550> it's<00:02:27.390> like<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.750> football

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
pretty like it's um it's like a football

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
not a type of chain there so it's really

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.650
