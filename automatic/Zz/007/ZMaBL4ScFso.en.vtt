a great feature also about these

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.099 
a great feature also about these
vertical<00:02:40.280> grow<00:02:40.459> rooms<00:02:40.730> is<00:02:41.329> you<00:02:41.569> have<00:02:41.720> super

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
vertical grow rooms is you have super

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.190 
vertical grow rooms is you have super
light<00:02:42.349> penetration<00:02:43.180> since<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.690> light<00:02:44.900> is

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
light penetration since the light is

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.960 
light penetration since the light is
going<00:02:45.410> vertically<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.459> plants<00:02:46.849> are

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
going vertically and the plants are

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.509 
going vertically and the plants are
coming<00:02:47.150> at<00:02:47.599> it<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.590> light<00:02:48.829> actually<00:02:49.069> goes

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
coming at it the light actually goes

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.699 
coming at it the light actually goes
deeper<00:02:50.000> inside<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.930> families<00:02:51.440> do<00:02:51.680> not

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
deeper inside so the families do not

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.479 
deeper inside so the families do not
hide<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:53.180> lumens<00:02:53.660> from<00:02:54.109> from<00:02:54.920> deeper<00:02:55.340> down

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
hide the lumens from from deeper down

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.330 
hide the lumens from from deeper down
and<00:02:55.849> they<00:02:56.030> plant<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.989> entire<00:02:57.109> Big<00:02:57.829> Buddha<00:02:58.010> box

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
and they plant the entire Big Buddha box

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.780 
and they plant the entire Big Buddha box
fills<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.030> huge<00:02:59.450> thick<00:03:00.200> canopy<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:01.400> dense
