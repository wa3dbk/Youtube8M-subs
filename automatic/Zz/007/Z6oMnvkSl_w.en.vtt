00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.840
 I want to be a gentle person. 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.060
 I want to be a strong person. 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.960
 I want to be happy. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.000
 But that kind of thing is good anyway. 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.960
 Thinking about where to go 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.920
 If you can disappear, it’s not good. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.760
 I can't maintain a smile 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.440
 So hate such a world 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.320
 Ah 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.660
 rock 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 Writing, composing: ナノウ

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 Song: そらる

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.660
 Who is jumping today? 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.200
 Who is laughing at today? 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.500
 Who is stabbing someone today? 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.620
 So who is crying? 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 in the morning 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.480
 night 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.420
 Nowadays 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.220
 And tomorrow 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.180
 Tired of repeating 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.180
 Then it’s like this kind of deception 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.780
 But can smile like this 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.720
 I like to use my own methods. 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.760
 Because you are always like this 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.660
 Laughing with a happy face 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.800
 I swayed and swayed 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.940
 Between likes and dislikes 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.760
 Today's world is still cruel 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.600
 Who is crying at the moment? 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.420
 Obviously gentle does not exist 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.100
 however 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.540
 After seeing the face 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.540
 But can't be sure 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.140
 I just said "like" yesterday. 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.980
 I changed my mind when I woke up the next day. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.980
 Forgetting everything, showing a smile 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.320
 Is also a part of survival 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.360
 Lie to lie with lies 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.060
 Which one is the lie? 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.420
 You won't know 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.280
 I still have today 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.140
 Can't sleep from start to finish 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.920
 You are the same today. 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.240
 Some happy things exist 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.760
 Like the way to the world 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.720
 Who will tell me? 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.960
 Because of you today, like this 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.760
 Laughing with a happy face 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.920
 Even everyday like garbage 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.700
 I will feel a little special feeling 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.500
 But why are we always 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.760
 Soon, injured because of loss 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.920
 It’s like this can’t be gentle 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.600
 Who will cry so loudly? 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.480
 At the time of our birth 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.680
 Constantly crying 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.360
 The days since then 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.260
 Also continue to cry and live 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.200
 Every day in the future is also 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.340
 Same tears in the same way. 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.720
 So please at least 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.280
 I have more smiles. 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.800
 Want to be a gentle person 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.680
 Want to be a strong person 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.660
 But that kind of thing is good anyway. 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.520
 It’s ok to stay the same. 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.700
 Who is smiling today? 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.080
 Who is crying in the shadow? 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.820
 However, if you don’t smile, 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.240
 I will be very sad. 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.160
 Because you always look like this 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.780
 Laughing with happiness 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.880
 Even garbage-like everyday 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.080
 So I feel a little special 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.680
 Today's world is still cruel 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.500
 Who is crying at the moment? 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.800
 Obviously gentle has never existed before 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.780
 however 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.640
 That face is also today 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.120
 Saved me.
