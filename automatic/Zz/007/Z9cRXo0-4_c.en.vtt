 good two united still did not live good 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.559
 it seems that the co-founder of 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.029
 sledgehammer games michael country ya 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:09.740
 he knows he's announcing when he's going to be 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.090
 a patch and different things we could 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.440
 say what to do as community manager 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.590
 He has said what will contain 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.020
 basically the next update of 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.970
 call of duty up and so warfare and good 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.000
 a lot of good people the next company are 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.029
 four pc and xbox what remember you 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.520
 hammer game or the next one is not dedicated 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.920
 generation with the vast generation ipc and 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.469
 high moon studios to those of previous 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.510
 generation remember it always and good 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.429
 there is a good study because almost never gives 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.679
 details of that patxi nor of 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.870
 absolutely nothing serves as pitiful 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.969
 well this neighborhood basically what's going 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.559
 to do is rebalance could we say 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.219
 the weapons this smells to me that they're going to 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.749
 touch the laval quite surely 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.429
 because it is one of the weapons that carries most 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:56.209
 to the people the game is full of the 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:59.269
 walt from 21 to 27 that say fuck the 21 

00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:01.490
 games like me I call it valva love 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.830
 duty rooftops warfare 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.530
 it's not for nothing but because everyone 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.880
 it's already going better or worse is that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.230
 everyone takes it is totally 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.360
 flippant and in fact yesterday I saw 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.280
 competitive also and everyone the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.530
 Take it own you do not know I'd like to see a 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.900
 little more variety in weapons have 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.330
 the game when I play public and when 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.470
 I also see games and others to see 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.540
 it also seems that and they will make one 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.840
 corrections also in some in 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.010
 some maps and others and also the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.080
 response 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.360
 they are going to touch them finally because 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.700
 in some ways that the response 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.520
 to split the tail seriously 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.830
 they appeared me part a robot I do not know I think 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.600
 which is a good game and if they go well 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.250
 touching the little things and they can also 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.680
 it would be nice to be the same 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.300
 I know if you hear it is falling good and 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.250
 in Valencia 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.860
 and well basically, well, that too 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.090
 improvements the game lists matched and 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.040
 nothing else 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.690
 basically because that balances a bit 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.510
 more the game still no date for 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.310
 this patch or more details about the 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.260
 weapons they played and more details about 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.119
 maps also will touch the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.040
 Responses that will touch in what ways or 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.750
 nothing so good we'll have to wait 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.910
 We'll have to wait until they have a date 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.340
 what will they say in what the patch does and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.320
 all this so nothing expects to remember 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.480
 that the patch that started in 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.920
 prison four in four on xbox van 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.130
 first remember that they are going to leave all 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.190
 equal they usually improve the game by 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.510
 the same on all platforms and nothing 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.950
 more guys this has been everything and nothing 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.220
 we go to a next video until the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.220
 next
