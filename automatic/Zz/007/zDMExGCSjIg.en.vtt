here and you can you need to say select

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.810 
here and you can you need to say select
inverse<00:01:02.050> so<00:01:03.050> what<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.500> does<00:01:03.770> it<00:01:04.100> selects<00:01:04.550> all

here you go in the filter and here in
select<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:11.240> blur<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:11.690> yoona<00:01:12.650> do<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.190> Gaussian

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
select a blur and yoona do the Gaussian

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.560 
select a blur and yoona do the Gaussian
blur<00:01:14.650> you<00:01:15.650> can<00:01:15.830> see<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.700> Gaussian<00:01:17.180> blur<00:01:17.330> is

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
blur you can see the Gaussian blur is

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.630 
blur you can see the Gaussian blur is
something<00:01:17.900> like<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.280> can<00:01:19.430> adjust

something like this and you can adjust

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.920 
something like this and you can adjust
the<00:01:20.060> radius<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.070> blur<00:01:22.720> capacity<00:01:23.720> will

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
the radius and the blur capacity will

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.680 
the radius and the blur capacity will
increase<00:01:24.080> as<00:01:24.620> you<00:01:25.160> adjust<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.850> radius<00:01:26.150> the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
increase as you adjust the radius the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.340 
increase as you adjust the radius the
more<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.860> movie<00:01:28.070> register<00:01:28.850> radius<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:30.080> more

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
more the movie register radius the more

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.010 
more the movie register radius the more
to<00:01:30.590> blur<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.310> image<00:01:31.340> will<00:01:31.729> become<00:01:31.910> and<00:01:32.330> the

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
to blur the image will become and the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.510 
to blur the image will become and the
less<00:01:33.200> either<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.970> less<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.680> image<00:01:36.680> blur<00:01:36.979> look

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
less either the less the image blur look

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.660 
less either the less the image blur look
um<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:39.460> if<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:40.580> give<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.180> 4<00:01:41.840> points<00:01:43.119> sorry<00:01:45.310> 4.5<00:01:46.310> it
