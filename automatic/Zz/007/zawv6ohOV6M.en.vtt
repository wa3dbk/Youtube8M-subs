00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.790
 Hello dear friends yourself today 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.200
 I will review a mod called with 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.840
 new killed do you think he is 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.189
 adds a he adds that's what's what 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.080
 great snowmobile i don't know guys 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.850
 I think this is the most beautiful and 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.510
 traced thing I saw in 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.430
 minecraft 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.470
 i'm playing now budget because this 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.520
 version 164 that is if i played 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.340
 shaders it seems to me then I'm a fanatel from 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.680
 but because look, well, really 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 everything is drawn very nicely that is and 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.290
 shadows done and done look 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.350
 just a fairy tale just a fairy tale i'm honest 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.620
 word let's make a little bit music 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.399
 It sounds like this and did like this on 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.410
 a dozen , like that 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:05.020
 showed that if I sit on it you 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:08.289
 You hear what happens, he also 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.910
 works in general guys this is something and this 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:15.100
 Something between what I was observing 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.140
 all sorts of quad bikes methane bikes and 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.080
 so on but this is more like 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.869
 me because he he goes everywhere and 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:29.679
 water and snow and stones and on earth everywhere 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.630
 everywhere everywhere in general other things that 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.610
 We have in the past reviews were that is 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.950
 getting into the water they immediately drown a 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.830
 depth is not important here we will 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.380
 Now we will go there because I will show somewhere 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.649
 built down the not built track 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.660
 but there is one minus for him as for me 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.710
 the first is that it is very slow 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:54.770
 rides the grass on the ground 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.470
 popov ass and on the water but if he 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.960
 leaves on snow hi it's just beasts 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.180
 I honestly say let's you 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.190
 show what from what craft in general 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.740
 craft and quite expensive but not 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.410
 so much so that your straight is very very 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.759
 very much so as you see it already 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.759
 let me show you a snowmobile 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.040
 It turns out as I understood or sidushka 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.150
 or the wheel is likely to see the wheel 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.190
 leather and uniform crafting and don't know 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.220
 just a translation of it there 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:34.070
 engine to the piston and the glands and then 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.330
 it turns out wood and also a piece of iron 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:41.019
 it turns out the frame itself then another frame 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.320
 It turns out as the top probably the role and 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.080
 This we sidushka it was the wheel and on 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.350
 sidushka but also after which we are going to 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.750
 whole to attack and after we take 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.540
 him and sit down how to see he has 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.190
 damage seems to be enough for me 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.160
 quickly empty hand if i take 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.760
 diamond sword that will be even stronger and 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.370
 very quickly in sin 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.019
 that is, that's so expensive but to me 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.030
 it seems if it breaks something from it 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.480
 fall out let's check for an interesting 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.640
 never wore it as a pair 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.269
 coming from him went titans to his 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.980
 that the owner and this I did not expect 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:31.400
 Cook I fakeyu 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:34.880
 honestly i never blew it up that is 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.739
 own I give the word that is, damn this I do not 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.739
 I expected to fall out as usual 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.500
 quad bike mods this ordinary details 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.310
 what kind of explosion here is damn it 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.840
 awesome mod guys i added it myself 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.519
 sure if I have a build then 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.860
 There is if I will play there further with 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.630
 you or someone else I must him 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.430
 I catch it ofigensky agree so 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.070
 let's omsa you and so some small 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.720
 It appeared on the side it looks in 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.140
 so here it is slowly 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.560
 give i did yes i am now and gravis 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.540
 shaders that are very slow there 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.239
 that is, no way will be faster on foot 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.239
 on the water on we enter even accelerates 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.229
 but as soon as he calls in the meadow 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.229
 you saw yes look 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.790
 ice is the same well it is because of the jet me 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.980
 threw off so look how fast 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.780
 believe me it seems to me I am not on one 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.970
 from vehicles to minecraft and 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.430
 so quickly would not have reached another case 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.730
 fast enough faster than the boat is 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.730
 one hundred percent 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:01.180
 that is, he is taken everywhere certainly not 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.370
 by 5 points and a pity that two blocks but it 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.840
 in principle, it would not be realistic if 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.040
 you two blocks rose 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.280
 but still all the same 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:16.160
 as we see very quickly and so are we 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.160
 We can kill the same fashion here at 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.630
 but I did not expect to Come 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.919
 you still have an animation going on because 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.520
 helped the start up bubbles 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:32.820
 that's cool guys really 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.820
 standing brain 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.830
 is it if we go to the place all he 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:48.510
 drowned 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:49.860
 To go nuts all he sinks I did not know the guys then 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.940
 is she really like the laws 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.680
 physicists look I saw on and on stage and 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.100
 on discovery, is there any way to overclock 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.340
 such a snowmobile and call in with it 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.960
 water at speed you can swim even 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.090
 small lake but as soon as she 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.890
 will break or lose speed then all 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.890
 look we are going, we are going 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.890
 turn around 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:25.080
 and let the gas and go to the bottom all a 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:32.110
 In general, there is such a mod expensive 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:33.849
 friends if you like it put 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.530
 husky i thought he liked it very much 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:38.250
 because he is very strong to me 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.629
 like if you are here for the first time 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.370
