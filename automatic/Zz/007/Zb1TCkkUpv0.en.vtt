00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.080
 hello how are football friends for the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.450
 band a very special greeting to all the 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.310
 band to grind to today we are going to 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.470
 back we did some tutorials back 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.390
 to review some things where you 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.280
 they had doubts I received a lot of 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.830
 comments from the first tutorial I did 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.020
 where I made a lot of plays so 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.150
 I chose five of them to explain them to 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.660
 detail in this tutorial so 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.660
 let's start 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.510
 This move must be made with much 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.460
 be careful because if you do it wrong you 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.440
 Knee can explode 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.960
 you must practically stick your foot to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.790
 ball when doing it with your foot 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.190
 right you must move the ball towards the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.810
 right and in the same movement with the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.510
 tip of your foot you must change the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.140
 path of the ball to the left 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.140
 thus confusing your rival 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.189
 this move is only to bluff only 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.289
 they are made by the gÃ¼eyes that are some trunks 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.869
 on the court and they want to call the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.789
 attention doing things with the ball 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.439
 all but me obviously with my foot 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.899
 right you must step on the ball towards 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.630
 forward and in the same movement with the 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.450
 left foot catch it pull it towards you 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.689
 and pick it up it sounds difficult but it does not 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.119
 is 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.189
 it came to me like after about three 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.189
 years do not be discouraged I'm calm 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.340
 this move is one of my favorites since 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.140
 which is quite difficult to do and go 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.420
 that there are guys who have tried it and 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.730
 they end up with a sprained ankle if 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.650
 you look good with your right foot you should 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.240
 advance the ball a little so that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.180
 your rival tries to prevent you from 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.520
 burles is there with that movement where 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.860
 you must take advantage and make the tunnel you must 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.350
 pass the ball and with the other foot is , 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.150
 the support foot give the touch so that 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.150
 Passes between your rival's legs 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.720
 is the truth to little not when you will do that 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.520
 played in a game is pretty 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.849
 complicated and if you do not do it right you can 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.099
 be in a good coma not so much but at a 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.620
 of two if you leave everything you have left 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.630
 looking as if you were an android and if 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.160
 you do not leave everything you are left watching how 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.730
 they are saved are an android but in 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.800
 culero look good first you must 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.540
 overtake the left foot and leave the 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.569
 ball back as if you had 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.849
 forgotten afterwards with the other foot you must 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.280
 give two little touches one towards the 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.110
 right and the other one to the left and 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.350
 so pass the ball on one side of your 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.350
 rival 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.060
 you must be well standing and look 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.190
 well how do you do a squat 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.070
 perfect when collecting the ball 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.660
 It's not easy even if you do not believe it 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.660
 people do not get this move 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.959
 there was a player there gave me famous 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.650
 who played in Madrid was called 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.299
 roberto carlos rossi because that guy is 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.189
 it happened to see me on an air straight 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.099
 for my house doing this play and I the 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:38.140
 robbery is easy enough to just burn and so 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.359
 you do not get the first try 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.040
 you must advance the ball a little and 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.579
 moment you feel that they are going to 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.730
 get to step on it with the right foot give you 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.500
 the turn step on it and pull it with the other 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.079
 foot so that with your foot support what 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.790
 up and so with a heel in the 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.939
 air make a hat to your rival 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.280
 easy or tell me how I'll explain it up 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.849
 Make it look pretty badass and do not let 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.849
 you copy it 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.130
 there were the five moves 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.110
 they were chosen more so I hope the 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.669
 practice they've seen that they are pretty 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.650
 easy I leave here in my networks 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.990
 social to tell me if you want 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.910
 give me hold everything they want 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.270

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.630
