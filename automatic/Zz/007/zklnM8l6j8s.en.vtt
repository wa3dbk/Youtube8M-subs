00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
a little fishhook needle on in there and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.540 
a little fishhook needle on in there and
they'll<00:00:16.770> get<00:00:16.980> these<00:00:17.160> little<00:00:18.560> berries<00:00:19.560> on<00:00:20.010> they

they'll get these little berries on they

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.439 
they'll get these little berries on they
actually<00:00:20.699> look<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.210> little<00:00:21.750> chili<00:00:22.199> peppers

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
actually look like little chili peppers

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.300 
actually look like little chili peppers
like<00:00:24.449> they're<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.930> shape<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.769> something<00:00:26.189> like

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
like they're the shape of something like

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.439 
like they're the shape of something like
a<00:00:26.369> Thai<00:00:26.609> chili<00:00:27.080> a<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.439> bit<00:00:28.560> smaller<00:00:29.449> but

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
a Thai chili a little bit smaller but

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
a Thai chili a little bit smaller but
they're<00:00:30.630> really<00:00:30.810> sweet<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.320> think<00:00:31.679> they<00:00:31.769> taste

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
they're really sweet I think they taste

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.790 
they're really sweet I think they taste
like<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> cherry<00:00:33.410> that's<00:00:34.410> probably<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
like a cherry that's probably the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.700 
like a cherry that's probably the
closest<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:36.170> can<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:38.160> them<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:39.559> kind<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
closest I can put them to kind of a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.490 
closest I can put them to kind of a
sweet<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.960> kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.110> tart<00:00:43.350> taste<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.890> him

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
sweet and kind of a tart taste to him

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.260 
sweet and kind of a tart taste to him
but<00:00:46.579> I've<00:00:47.579> never<00:00:47.960> tried<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.140> flowers<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> I

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
but I've never tried the flowers so I

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:07.480 
but I've never tried the flowers so I
wanted<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.579> take<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.820> these<00:00:54.030> flowers<00:00:54.239> here

that's pretty good

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.999 
that's pretty good
the<00:01:51.179> only<00:01:51.390> thing<00:01:51.569> I<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:51.719> do<00:01:51.959> is<00:01:52.109> if<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.860> was

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the only thing I would do is if I was

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.179 
the only thing I would do is if I was
out<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:54.349> desert<00:01:56.390> eating<00:01:57.390> these<00:01:58.039> right<00:01:59.039> now

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
out in the desert eating these right now

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.179 
out in the desert eating these right now
I<00:01:59.219> would<00:01:59.579> probably<00:01:59.759> take<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:01.009> biggest<00:02:02.009> one

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
I would probably take the biggest one

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.059 
I would probably take the biggest one
here<00:02:02.689> cut<00:02:03.689> them<00:02:03.840> off<00:02:03.959> down<00:02:03.989> as<00:02:04.409> low<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.829> could

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
here cut them off down as low as I could

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.089 
here cut them off down as low as I could
and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:06.149> take<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.509> cutting<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:08.009> know

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and then take that cutting and you know

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.889 
and then take that cutting and you know
flaming<00:02:08.519> right<00:02:08.670> next<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.599> way<00:02:09.690> next

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
flaming right next to it that way next

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.740 
flaming right next to it that way next
time<00:02:10.079> I<00:02:10.170> come<00:02:10.319> out<00:02:10.379> there'd<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.799> more<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.099> them

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
time I come out there'd be more of them

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.190 
time I come out there'd be more of them
that's<00:02:12.750> something<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.349> doing<00:02:13.530> with

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200
