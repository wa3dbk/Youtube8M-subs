some time with her uncle in this like

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.500 
some time with her uncle in this like
tiny<00:00:46.620> town<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.520> her<00:00:47.640> Greyhound<00:00:48.030> bus<00:00:48.239> pulls

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
tiny town but her Greyhound bus pulls

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.150 
tiny town but her Greyhound bus pulls
over<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> side<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> road<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.739> she

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
over on the side of the road and she

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.100 
over on the side of the road and she
ends<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.850> crazy<00:00:51.120> town<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.840> thinks

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
ends up in this crazy town the thinks

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.200 
ends up in this crazy town the thinks
the<00:00:52.199> end<00:00:52.350> times<00:00:52.649> are<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> think<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the end times are here so I think that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.520 
the end times are here so I think that
this<00:00:54.300> means<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.930> sort<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.410> end

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this means that it's sort of like an end

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
this means that it's sort of like an end
of<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> world<00:00:55.710> scenario<00:00:56.039> type<00:00:56.579> group<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
of the world scenario type group of

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.000 
of the world scenario type group of
people<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.260> weird<00:00:58.530> things<00:00:58.770> start

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
people but then weird things start

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.529 
people but then weird things start
happening<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.609> affirm<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> maybe<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.390> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
happening that affirm that maybe this is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.500

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
think that's hopefully a part of the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.610 
think that's hopefully a part of the
beauty<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:45.959> I've<00:02:46.230> heard<00:02:46.379> nothing<00:02:46.409> but
