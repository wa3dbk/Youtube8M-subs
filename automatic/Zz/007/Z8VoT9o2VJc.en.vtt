00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
to the others at this point would be

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.220 
to the others at this point would be
what<00:06:20.190> they<00:06:20.400> recommend<00:06:20.940> is<00:06:21.060> stopping

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
what they recommend is stopping

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.840 
what they recommend is stopping
they're<00:06:22.320> done<00:06:22.530> go<00:06:22.830> ahead<00:06:23.010> and<00:06:23.100> put<00:06:23.220> trim<00:06:23.490> on<00:06:23.670> it

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:23.850

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.120 
they're done go ahead and put trim on it
I<00:06:24.000> think<00:06:24.540> the<00:06:24.930> opposite<00:06:25.410> side<00:06:25.650> of<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.890> door<00:06:25.920> on

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
I think the opposite side of the door on

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.640 
I think the opposite side of the door on
the<00:06:26.340> bottom<00:06:26.520> still<00:06:27.000> a<00:06:27.030> little<00:06:27.270> loose<00:06:27.570> so<00:06:28.440> let's

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
the bottom still a little loose so let's

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.350 
the bottom still a little loose so let's
go<00:06:28.830> over<00:06:29.010> to<00:06:29.070> the<00:06:29.220> other<00:06:29.370> side<00:06:29.670> starting<00:06:30.060> at

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
go over to the other side starting at

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.020 
go over to the other side starting at

the top where you bent the flange out

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.120 
the top where you bent the flange out
with<00:06:33.210> your<00:06:33.360> pliers<00:06:33.600> go<00:06:34.530> ahead<00:06:34.770> and<00:06:34.890> take<00:06:35.010> your
