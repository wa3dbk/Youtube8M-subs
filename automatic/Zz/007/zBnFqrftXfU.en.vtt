turn me into this first straightaway

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
turn me into this first straightaway
section<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.620> now<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> car

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

right there and here we go so you see
the<00:01:00.629> blue<00:01:00.780> line<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.320> dynamically<00:01:02.219> changing

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the blue line it's dynamically changing

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.789 
the blue line it's dynamically changing
colors<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.600> red<00:01:04.049> means<00:01:04.289> i<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> slow<00:01:04.769> down

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
colors so red means i have to slow down

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.679 
colors so red means i have to slow down
a<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.149> cool<00:01:06.329> thing<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.539> it

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
a little bit and the cool thing about it

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.389 
a little bit and the cool thing about it
is<00:01:06.899> that<00:01:06.930> I'm<00:01:07.140> feeling<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.619> lot<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.950> things<00:01:08.159> on

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
is that I'm feeling a lot of things on

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.560 
is that I'm feeling a lot of things on
the<00:01:08.490> steering<00:01:08.670> wheel<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.240> because

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the steering wheel right now because

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
the steering wheel right now because
this<00:01:09.719> is<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.899> full<00:01:10.170> force<00:01:10.440> feedback<00:01:10.680> steering

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
this is a full force feedback steering

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.149 
this is a full force feedback steering
wheel<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.210> said<00:01:12.270> before<00:01:12.770> when<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:13.890> go<00:01:14.010> out

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
wheel like I said before when we go out

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.219 
wheel like I said before when we go out
to<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> tracks<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:15.060> capture<00:01:15.630> all<00:01:15.810> sorts<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to the tracks we capture all sorts of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.560 
to the tracks we capture all sorts of
data<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.950> track<00:01:17.729> consistency<00:01:18.420> we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
data so we have track consistency we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020 
data so we have track consistency we
have<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.710> bumps<00:01:20.070> feel<00:01:20.340> we<00:01:21.000> have

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
have how the other bumps feel we have

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
have how the other bumps feel we have
exactly<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> differentiates<00:01:22.560> from

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
exactly how it differentiates from

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.789 
exactly how it differentiates from
section<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.430> section<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.510> right<00:01:25.110> now<00:01:25.140> I'm

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
section to section so right now I'm

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.070 
section to section so right now I'm
feeling<00:01:26.070> how<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> street<00:01:27.510> wheel<00:01:27.750> all

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
feeling how the on the street wheel all

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.570 
feeling how the on the street wheel all
that<00:01:28.229> information<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.799> being<00:01:29.010> passed<00:01:29.280> through

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
that information is being passed through

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.399 
that information is being passed through
so<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.299> feeling<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.689> streamlet<00:01:31.170> kind<00:01:31.350> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
so I'm feeling the streamlet kind of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.350 
so I'm feeling the streamlet kind of
wobble<00:01:31.799> showing<00:01:32.340> me<00:01:32.430> exactly<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> car

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
wobble showing me exactly how the car

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
wobble showing me exactly how the car
would<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.689> wobbling<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.260> i<00:01:34.380> was<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.340> real

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
would be wobbling if i was there in real

turns on this track and not just that if
you<00:02:47.349> kind<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.620> look<00:02:47.829> at<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.069> steering<00:02:48.340> wheel

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
you kind of look at the steering wheel

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.009 
you kind of look at the steering wheel
and<00:02:48.760> there's<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.060> lot<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.299> movement<00:02:49.720> going<00:02:49.810> on
