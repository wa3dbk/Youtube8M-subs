00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.010 
so that all that means is that it
doesn't<00:02:00.869> necessarily<00:02:01.579> matter<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.180> raw

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
doesn't necessarily matter if it's raw

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.770 
doesn't necessarily matter if it's raw
or<00:02:04.290> not<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.490> sense<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.479> need<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.440 
or not in the sense that you need the
calories<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:08.009> need<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> nutrients<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
