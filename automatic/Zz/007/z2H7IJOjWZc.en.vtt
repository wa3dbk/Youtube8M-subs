00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.609

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.609

 we also know that the national team 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.210
 Spain in the all-around yesterday took 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.210
 fourth place 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:12.360
 but you immediately started this 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.520
 interesting variation in general in girls 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.090
 let's do a very interesting exercise 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090
 we'll see 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.170
 the first transfer is now an exercise either 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.170
 you must have 5 redeployment 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.680
 not immediately 2 transfers in diagonal 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.680

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.560
 wallpaper does 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.610
 exercise I think do not want to ring 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.210
 and they have the opportunity to fight for 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.210
 top three 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.710
 see 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.070
 Well done, but you were so much in the end 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.050
 throwing girls coped with the performance 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.900
 it's very hard to hide the world championship 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.950
 and the more I was all-around but yesterday 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.950
 Well done very well 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.730

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.730
 kind of program this trio rotate both tapes 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.459

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.580
 to see them repeat, we see very interesting 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.860
 drawings in group exercises should 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.360
 be sure to be 6 rebuild it like 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.520
 minimum and more 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.520
 gymnasts should move around the area 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.190
 we saw now study on repeat was 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.170
 mistake is made 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.590
 one team team score team 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.780
 spain 17 350 thousandths while this is the first 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.470
 place but we still have seven teams ahead 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.820
 so how will the space be distributed on 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.530
 pedestal we learn only after 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.530
