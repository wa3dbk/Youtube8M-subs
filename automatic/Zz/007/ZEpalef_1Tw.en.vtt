little nubs of the rubber silicone and
then<00:02:44.070> there's<00:02:44.250> your<00:02:44.400> vibrate<00:02:44.790> switch<00:02:44.940> guys

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
then there's your vibrate switch guys

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.270 
then there's your vibrate switch guys
it's<00:02:45.600> really<00:02:45.930> deep<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.290> there<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.950> cutouts

I<00:03:24.480> don't<00:03:24.720> use<00:03:24.870> my<00:03:24.900> flash<00:03:25.290> all<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.680> often<00:03:25.860> but

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I don't use my flash all that often but

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.920 
I don't use my flash all that often but
I<00:03:26.310> imagine<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.000> will<00:03:27.209> run<00:03:27.390> into<00:03:27.450> some<00:03:27.900> issues

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
I imagine you will run into some issues

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.260 
I imagine you will run into some issues

with you know washing out if you're

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.550 
with you know washing out if you're
using<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.630> flash<00:03:30.810> just<00:03:31.020> because<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.380> so

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
using the flash just because it's so

recessed<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.610> black<00:03:32.850> case<00:03:33.180> may<00:03:33.510> help<00:03:33.750> in

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
recessed the black case may help in

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.750 
recessed the black case may help in
preventing<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:35.340> know<00:03:35.370> that

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
preventing that but you know that

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.550 
preventing that but you know that
remains<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.180> be<00:03:36.209> seen<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.200> course<00:03:37.410> you've

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
remains to be seen then of course you've

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.110 
remains to be seen then of course you've
got<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.830> spec<00:03:38.040> logo<00:03:38.340> on<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.700> back<00:03:38.850> as<00:03:39.090> well

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
got the spec logo on the back as well

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.930 
got the spec logo on the back as well
now<00:03:39.930> just<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.530> candy<00:03:40.830> shell<00:03:41.010> for<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.459> 3g

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
now just like the candy shell for the 3g

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.180 
now just like the candy shell for the 3g
and<00:03:42.090> 3gs<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.870> does<00:03:43.050> scratch<00:03:43.500> pretty<00:03:43.950> easily

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
and 3gs this does scratch pretty easily

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.640 
and 3gs this does scratch pretty easily
but<00:03:44.670> since<00:03:45.330> it's<00:03:45.510> kind<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.750> high<00:03:45.959> gloss<00:03:46.260> and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
but since it's kind of high gloss and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.949 
but since it's kind of high gloss and
dark<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.610> don't<00:03:47.790> really<00:03:47.880> notice<00:03:48.180> scratches

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
dark you don't really notice scratches

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.410 
dark you don't really notice scratches
all<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.410> much<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.980> do<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:50.970> case<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.239> lot

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
all that much I do like this case a lot

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.420 
all that much I do like this case a lot
the<00:03:51.810> corners<00:03:52.230> are<00:03:52.410> reinforced<00:03:53.160> with<00:03:53.220> that

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
the corners are reinforced with that

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.070 
the corners are reinforced with that
rubber<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:53.850> silicon<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.690> if<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.900> were<00:03:55.019> to

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
rubber in silicon so that if you were to

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.110 
rubber in silicon so that if you were to
drop<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.920> know<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.130> would<00:03:56.400> or<00:03:56.550> land<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.940> one

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
drop it you know it would or land on one

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.490 
drop it you know it would or land on one
of<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.269> corners<00:03:57.420> it's<00:03:57.750> going<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.380> know

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
of the corners it's going to you know

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.259 
of the corners it's going to you know
hopefully<00:03:58.950> absorb<00:03:59.550> a<00:03:59.640> lot<00:03:59.820> of<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.030> shock<00:04:00.239> and

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
hopefully absorb a lot of the shock and

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.199 
hopefully absorb a lot of the shock and
impact<00:04:00.739> overall<00:04:01.739> I<00:04:02.070> really<00:04:02.100> like<00:04:02.580> this<00:04:02.730> case<00:04:03.000> I

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
impact overall I really like this case I

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.610 
impact overall I really like this case I
think<00:04:03.239> it's<00:04:03.570> one<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.870> best<00:04:04.050> choices<00:04:04.410> for

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
think it's one of the best choices for

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.220 
think it's one of the best choices for
the<00:04:05.400> iphone<00:04:05.730> 4<00:04:06.030> currently<00:04:06.540> out<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.840> market
