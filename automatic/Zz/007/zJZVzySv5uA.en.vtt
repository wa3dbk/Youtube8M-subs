00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
power switch IEC power let's go back up

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.080 
power switch IEC power let's go back up
and<00:02:01.110> we'll<00:02:01.229> check<00:02:01.380> out<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> rest<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.909> can

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and we'll check out the rest you can

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.109 
and we'll check out the rest you can
actively<00:02:03.450> engage<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:04.380> disengage<00:02:04.409> an<00:02:05.250> EQ<00:02:05.850> curve
