this time I promise because I only got a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.769 
this time I promise because I only got a
couple<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.220> points<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> talk<00:00:23.789> about<00:00:24.000> obviously

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
couple of points to talk about obviously

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.839 
couple of points to talk about obviously
there's<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> huge<00:00:25.740> array<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> differences

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
there's not a huge array of differences

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.589 
there's not a huge array of differences
you're<00:00:27.810> looking<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> size<00:00:28.680> difference

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
you're looking at a size difference

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.040 
you're looking at a size difference
here's<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> clothes<00:00:30.990> size<00:00:31.289> difference<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
here's the clothes size difference and

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.540 
here's the clothes size difference and
open<00:00:34.050> size<00:00:34.500> difference<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.160> course<00:00:35.399> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
open size difference of course this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.660 
open size difference of course this
one's<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> satin<00:00:36.630> stonewash<00:00:37.110> finish<00:00:37.670> we

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
one's the satin stonewash finish we

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
one's the satin stonewash finish we
align<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> pivots<00:00:39.450> more<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:39.840> less<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.559> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
align the pivots more or less so that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.340 
align the pivots more or less so that
they're<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.309> sync<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.079> how

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
they're in sync you can see kind of how

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.350 
they're in sync you can see kind of how
they're<00:00:44.129> sized<00:00:44.370> differently<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.270> we

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
they're sized differently and then if we

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360 
they're sized differently and then if we
go<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> handle<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.190> how

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
go down to the handle you can see how

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.869 
go down to the handle you can see how
much<00:00:47.520> more<00:00:47.760> blade<00:00:48.420> length<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> get<00:00:49.640> by<00:00:50.640> far

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
much more blade length you get by far

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.869 
much more blade length you get by far
one<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> my<00:00:51.180> favorite<00:00:51.440> Emerson<00:00:52.440> designs<00:00:52.879> the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
it's been called absolutely amazing I

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.320 
it's been called absolutely amazing I
mentioned<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.220> first<00:01:20.580> showed<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.000> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
mentioned when I first showed this that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.670 
mentioned when I first showed this that
one<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> things<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.080> noticed<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
one of the things I noticed was the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.160 
one of the things I noticed was the
hardware<00:01:23.220> seem<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.729> more<00:01:23.850> blacked<00:01:24.150> out<00:01:24.330> as

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
hardware seem to be more blacked out as

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.999 
hardware seem to be more blacked out as
an<00:01:25.290> example<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.740> how

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
an example for that you can see here how

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.679 
an example for that you can see here how
this<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:29.610> almost<00:01:29.790> looks<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.299> wasn't

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
this one almost looks like it wasn't

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
this one almost looks like it wasn't
ever<00:01:30.869> black<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:32.009> can't<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.310> remnants<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
ever black you can't see remnants of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.030 
ever black you can't see remnants of
black<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:34.200> more<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:34.470> less<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.829> kind<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
black on it but more or less it kind of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.460 
black on it but more or less it kind of
looks<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.430> light<00:01:35.909> gray<00:01:36.329> whereas<00:01:37.320> this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
looks like a light gray whereas this

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.870 
looks like a light gray whereas this
one's<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:39.170> black<00:01:40.170> black<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
one's actually black black and if you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.130 
one's actually black black and if you
look<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.090> pivots<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.810> about<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
look at the pivots this is about the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.719 
look at the pivots this is about the
same<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.590> one's<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> little<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.159> more<00:01:44.369> worn

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
same this one's a little bit more worn

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
same this one's a little bit more worn
but<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:45.990> side<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.799> how<00:01:46.950> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
but on this side you can see how this

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.760 
but on this side you can see how this
one<00:01:47.369> looks<00:01:47.640> basically<00:01:48.450> gray<00:01:48.990> instead<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
one looks basically gray instead of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
one looks basically gray instead of
black<00:01:50.090> just<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.420> something<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.869> noticed

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
black just a little something I noticed

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.020 
black just a little something I noticed
I<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:52.560> know<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> change<00:01:53.729> in

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I don't know if that is a change in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.630 
I don't know if that is a change in
manufacturer<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.530> luck<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> draw

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
manufacturer or just luck of the draw

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.020 
manufacturer or just luck of the draw
that<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:58.560> particular<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.250> had<00:01:59.640> darker

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that this particular one just had darker

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.520 
that this particular one just had darker
coloration<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.079> kind<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> how<00:02:01.409> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
coloration on it that's kind of how it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.890 
coloration on it that's kind of how it
is<00:02:01.560> with<00:02:01.799> Emerson's<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.729> they

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
is with Emerson's you know they

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.040 
is with Emerson's you know they
this<00:02:04.900> as<00:02:05.020> long<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.440> it<00:02:05.620> it<00:02:06.250> works<00:02:06.610> they<00:02:07.600> send<00:02:07.960> it

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
this as long as it it works they send it

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.419 
this as long as it it works they send it
out<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.289> door<00:02:08.440> they<00:02:08.649> don't<00:02:08.679> get<00:02:08.920> caught<00:02:09.100> up<00:02:09.130> in

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
out the door they don't get caught up in

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.250 
out the door they don't get caught up in
little<00:02:10.000> details<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:11.020> they're<00:02:11.140> all

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
little details like that so they're all

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
little details like that so they're all
kind<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.620> little<00:02:11.650> bit<00:02:12.070> unique<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:13.420> that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
kind of a little bit unique in that

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.430 
kind of a little bit unique in that
sense<00:02:15.030> another<00:02:16.030> thing<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> noticed<00:02:17.280> which

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
sense another thing that I noticed which

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.500 
sense another thing that I noticed which
you'll<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:20.709> here<00:02:21.100> on<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.459> on<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.090> cutout

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
you'll see here on the on the cutout

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.699 
you'll see here on the on the cutout
where<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.870> reach<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.670> lock<00:02:24.670> bar<00:02:25.260> if<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.440> line

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
where you reach the lock bar if I line

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.440 
where you reach the lock bar if I line
up<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.890> scales<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.550> both<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:28.060> can<00:02:28.180> see<00:02:28.300> how

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
up the scales on both you can see how

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.260 
up the scales on both you can see how
much<00:02:28.570> more<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> full-size<00:02:30.270> but

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
much more you have on the full-size but

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.449 
much more you have on the full-size but
this<00:02:31.450> one<00:02:31.690> when<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.560> really<00:02:32.860> kind<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.130> have<00:02:33.250> to

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
this one when you really kind of have to

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.940 
this one when you really kind of have to
get<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.820> like<00:02:34.060> here<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.500> one<00:02:35.709> thing<00:02:35.860> I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
get in like here and that is one thing I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.040 
get in like here and that is one thing I
noticed<00:02:36.280> with<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.550> knife<00:02:36.790> how<00:02:37.600> it's<00:02:37.780> almost

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
noticed with this knife how it's almost

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.560 
noticed with this knife how it's almost
flush<00:02:38.680> right<00:02:39.100> here<00:02:39.430> like<00:02:39.700> between<00:02:40.030> here<00:02:40.390> and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
flush right here like between here and

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.300 
flush right here like between here and
this<00:02:40.720> scale<00:02:40.989> like<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.980> can<00:02:42.130> just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
this scale like you can just

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.420 
this scale like you can just
it's<00:02:42.550> barely<00:02:42.880> raised<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.680> wondered<00:02:45.130> if<00:02:45.280> it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
it's barely raised and I wondered if it

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.920 
it's barely raised and I wondered if it
was<00:02:45.550> gonna<00:02:45.700> be<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.970> same<00:02:46.150> on<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.570> but<00:02:46.810> it's

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
was gonna be the same on this but it's

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.080 
was gonna be the same on this but it's
not<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.440> actually<00:02:47.709> have<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.860> lot<00:02:48.130> more<00:02:48.190> real

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
not you actually have a lot more real

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.850 
not you actually have a lot more real
estate<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.720> can<00:02:49.959> unlock<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.500> easily

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
estate so you can unlock it easily

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.699 
estate so you can unlock it easily
without<00:02:51.040> turning<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.730> where's<00:02:52.630> this<00:02:52.840> one<00:02:53.110> it's

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
without turning it where's this one it's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.290 
without turning it where's this one it's
a<00:02:53.770> lot<00:02:53.950> more<00:02:54.070> difficult<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.640> know<00:02:54.700> slide<00:02:55.090> off

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
a lot more difficult you know slide off

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.270 
a lot more difficult you know slide off
which<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.989> why<00:02:56.140> usually<00:02:56.530> when<00:02:56.680> i<00:02:56.709> unlock<00:02:56.920> this

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
which is why usually when i unlock this

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.240 
which is why usually when i unlock this
I<00:02:57.430> kind<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.670> flip<00:02:57.880> it<00:02:57.910> around<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.390> way<00:02:59.250> so

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
I kind of flip it around this way so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.250 
I kind of flip it around this way so
it's<00:03:00.400> definitely<00:03:00.730> easier<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.180> unlock<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.810> the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
it's definitely easier to unlock the the

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's definitely easier to unlock the the
regular<00:03:02.680> CQC<00:03:03.489> 8<00:03:03.989> another<00:03:04.989> thing<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.350> I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
regular CQC 8 another thing that I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.340 
regular CQC 8 another thing that I
noticed<00:03:06.030> now<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.360> very<00:03:07.720> cool<00:03:07.959> and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
noticed now this is very cool and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.020 
noticed now this is very cool and
interesting<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.250> don't<00:03:09.310> know<00:03:09.519> once<00:03:09.790> again

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
interesting and I don't know once again

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.060 
interesting and I don't know once again
if<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.330> a<00:03:10.450> change<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.170> manufacturer<00:03:11.830> or

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
if this is a change in manufacturer or

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.110 
if this is a change in manufacturer or
just<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.700> don't<00:03:13.150> know<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:15.580> can<00:03:15.730> see<00:03:15.850> these<00:03:15.970> are

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
just I don't know you can see these are

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.789 
just I don't know you can see these are
both<00:03:16.239> 2012<00:03:16.840> models<00:03:17.290> they<00:03:17.380> both<00:03:17.530> have<00:03:17.709> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
both 2012 models they both have the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.210 
both 2012 models they both have the
updated<00:03:18.190> deeper<00:03:18.700> set<00:03:19.000> pivots<00:03:19.840> there<00:03:20.100> with<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
updated deeper set pivots there with the

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.660 
updated deeper set pivots there with the
wider<00:03:21.430> slot<00:03:21.910> both<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.840> these<00:03:22.930> have<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.670> and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
wider slot both of these have that and

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.370 
wider slot both of these have that and
you<00:03:25.180> probably<00:03:25.510> won't<00:03:25.660> be<00:03:25.750> able<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:25.989> see<00:03:26.170> that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
you probably won't be able to see that

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
you probably won't be able to see that
on<00:03:26.860> camera<00:03:27.579> here<00:03:27.940> but<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:29.170> lock<00:03:29.769> side<00:03:30.130> the

on camera here but the lock side the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.150 
on camera here but the lock side the
titanium<00:03:30.970> side<00:03:31.209> is<00:03:31.480> thicker<00:03:31.840> than<00:03:32.769> the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
titanium side is thicker than the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.949 
titanium side is thicker than the

non-locking side the no unlocking side

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:35.819 
non-locking side the no unlocking side
is<00:03:35.110> pretty<00:03:35.320> thin

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
is pretty thin

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.620 
is pretty thin
and<00:03:35.950> that's<00:03:36.370> how<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.760> with<00:03:36.910> my<00:03:37.150> super

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
and that's how it is with my super

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.530 
and that's how it is with my super
commander<00:03:38.049> which<00:03:38.200> is<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> known<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.579> believe<00:03:40.209> as

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
commander which is a known I believe as

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.039 
commander which is a known I believe as

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.770 
well as my Road house which is in 2011
if<00:03:44.620> I'm<00:03:44.739> not<00:03:44.920> sure<00:03:45.250> if<00:03:45.880> I'm<00:03:46.000> not<00:03:46.120> mistaken<00:03:46.480> and

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
if I'm not sure if I'm not mistaken and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.060 
if I'm not sure if I'm not mistaken and
then<00:03:47.620> my<00:03:47.910> CQC<00:03:48.910> 7<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.660> same<00:03:50.230> way<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
then my CQC 7 the same way the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.310 
then my CQC 7 the same way the
non-locking<00:03:51.970> side<00:03:52.360> is<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.630> little<00:03:52.930> bit<00:03:53.049> thinner

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
non-locking side is a little bit thinner

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.690 
non-locking side is a little bit thinner
than<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.430> locking<00:03:54.820> side<00:03:55.090> where<00:03:55.959> as<00:03:56.290> on<00:03:57.130> Nass

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
than the locking side where as on Nass

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
than the locking side where as on Nass
they<00:03:58.390> are<00:03:58.540> almost<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.079> exact<00:03:59.500> same<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:01.390> much

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
they are almost the exact same so much

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.979 
they are almost the exact same so much
thicker<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.709> opposing<00:04:03.670> side<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.420> really

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
thicker on the opposing side I really

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.500 
thicker on the opposing side I really
like<00:04:05.170> that<00:04:05.410> really<00:04:06.310> just<00:04:06.519> it<00:04:07.030> adds<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.360> little

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
like that really just it adds a little

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.050 
like that really just it adds a little
bit<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.750> weight<00:04:07.900> but<00:04:08.370> it<00:04:09.370> just<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.730> don't<00:04:09.790> know<00:04:10.030> I

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
bit of weight but it just I don't know I

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.210 
bit of weight but it just I don't know I
just<00:04:10.090> feel<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.750> like<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.440> construction<00:04:11.859> idea

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
just feel I like that construction idea

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.039 
just feel I like that construction idea
better<00:04:12.459> with<00:04:13.180> how<00:04:13.299> these<00:04:13.510> screws<00:04:13.810> work

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
better with how these screws work

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.259 
better with how these screws work
they're<00:04:14.949> basically<00:04:15.370> only<00:04:15.639> threaded

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
they're basically only threaded

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.449 
they're basically only threaded
on<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.419> opposite<00:04:16.840> side<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:17.379> there's<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.340> know

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
on the opposite side so there's you know

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.029 
on the opposite side so there's you know
not<00:04:18.819> that<00:04:18.849> much<00:04:19.269> room<00:04:19.509> for<00:04:19.569> threads<00:04:20.199> available

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
not that much room for threads available

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.210 
not that much room for threads available
on<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.430> opposite<00:04:22.150> side<00:04:22.389> here<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:23.500> know<00:04:23.590> if<00:04:24.039> I

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
on the opposite side here you know if I

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.070 
on the opposite side here you know if I
could<00:04:24.280> make<00:04:24.430> things<00:04:25.620> in<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.770> perfect<00:04:27.099> world<00:04:28.080> you

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
could make things in a perfect world you

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.020 
could make things in a perfect world you
know<00:04:29.229> it'd<00:04:29.830> be<00:04:29.919> cool<00:04:30.250> if<00:04:30.400> Emerson<00:04:30.909> would

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
know it'd be cool if Emerson would

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.279 
know it'd be cool if Emerson would
actually<00:04:31.449> insert<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.759> pillar<00:04:33.759> into<00:04:34.690> this<00:04:34.810> g10

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
actually insert a pillar into this g10

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.839 
actually insert a pillar into this g10
and<00:04:35.590> have<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.860> screws<00:04:36.159> screw<00:04:36.490> into<00:04:36.669> that

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
and have the screws screw into that

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.839 
and have the screws screw into that
pillar<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.419> think<00:04:38.319> you<00:04:38.440> would<00:04:38.560> get<00:04:38.789> you<00:04:39.789> know

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
pillar I think you would get you know

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.529 
pillar I think you would get you know
just<00:04:40.210> more<00:04:40.360> threads<00:04:41.280> in<00:04:42.280> there<00:04:42.580> but<00:04:42.940> he<00:04:43.210> does

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
just more threads in there but he does

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.629 
just more threads in there but he does
it<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.780> way<00:04:43.810> he<00:04:43.930> does<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.440> and<00:04:44.680> so<00:04:44.919> you<00:04:45.520> gotta

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
it the way he does it and so you gotta

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.999 
it the way he does it and so you gotta
live<00:04:45.879> with<00:04:45.909> that<00:04:46.060> but<00:04:47.020> I<00:04:47.259> like<00:04:47.560> having<00:04:47.710> a

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
live with that but I like having a

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.980 
live with that but I like having a
thicker<00:04:48.490> posing<00:04:48.940> liner<00:04:49.150> on<00:04:49.360> both<00:04:49.509> sides<00:04:49.780> it

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
thicker posing liner on both sides it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.689 
thicker posing liner on both sides it
just<00:04:50.110> makes<00:04:50.289> it<00:04:50.380> makes<00:04:51.220> me<00:04:51.370> feel<00:04:51.520> more

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
just makes it makes me feel more

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.570 
just makes it makes me feel more
