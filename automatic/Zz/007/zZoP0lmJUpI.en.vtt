draw him out oh and I think you can do
special<00:02:56.519> when<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> get<00:02:57.329> to<00:02:57.420> like<00:02:57.540> one<00:02:57.720> half<00:02:57.900> I

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
special when you get to like one half I

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.160 
special when you get to like one half I
think<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.319> other<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.859> can<00:02:59.010> do<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.579> in<00:03:00.170> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
think the other and you can do it in the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.080 
think the other and you can do it in the
infinite<00:03:01.769> otherwise<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.340> takes<00:03:02.489> away<00:03:02.700> a

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
infinite otherwise it takes away a

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.840 
infinite otherwise it takes away a
little<00:03:03.870> bit<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.200> help<00:03:04.410> each<00:03:04.739> time<00:03:05.069> one<00:03:05.459> bar<00:03:05.819> I
