00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 well let's listen to the rolfi 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.410
 montenegro forward 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.990
 if one works to be able to stay 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.450
 I have the 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.910
 the luck of doing it that both the 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.619
 technical president relies on the 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.270
 ability that one has and good to give 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.400
 with everything also for only independent 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.770
 many teams passed but I think what 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.079
 Most importantly , I want here to 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.630
 one can contribute what the team 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.029
 better than what we did the semester 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.910
 past was not good at all I think that 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.350
 this is going to be a year where really 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.019
 we have to give everything of each one each 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.050
 remove that thorn that was stuck goes 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.120
 to be much better we are working the 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.330
 reality is going to be on January 67 when we 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 touch play and there we will see for what 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.370
 we're 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.650
 we want that we are for great things 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.680
 and a better gift would be to see the america 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.170
 champion that would be the best the best 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.510
 what can happen to us all then 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.119
 let's hope that 2012 is ours and that 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.470
 in June we can be thinking about another 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.299
 thing we are very aware that 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.369
 we need to solidify the team but 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.200
 everything becomes rumors and 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.700
 suddenly those rumors do that if 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.870
 you think about playing you can not think anymore 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.120
 on why then obviously know 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.800
 the prisoners go to the cloud and has not 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.570
 put transferable list or nothing 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.240
 then there has not been and today because 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.210
 I have why I have to fasting I have 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.220
 to corral or will bring mud and will 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 to leave one of those four I told them 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.540
 I 'm not with Johnny with Ricardo very 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.970
 clear that we hope the team is already 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.920
 no later than Friday we have 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.710
 our party match we already have the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.110
 team that we want and the complete the 95 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 or 97 percent of being the team 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.220
 complete those if there are candidates there 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.390
 candidates and as I told them the first 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.580
 we are seeing they told us because those 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 are those who are just the term and the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.330
 21 do not let it go to another team 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.470
 So we are giving priority to 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.970
 the Mexicans that we would like to look for 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.160
 and then if we find in the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.720
 Mexicans what we want good 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.950
 we are not looking outside anymore 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.990
 all five foreigners will be left 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.790
 but as I also said it there will be a plan 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.340
 I hope we do not get to that plan 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.560
 b but it's there are the words of 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.179
 miguel herrera good job in your car and 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.170
 attended the media 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.350
 as it should be 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.780
 many schoolchildren be but not yes 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.830
 and nobody with a formula of safety 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.070
 he does not 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.650
 but this man when you had seen that 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.260
 a man a coach from america he 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.000
 lowered but in access to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.190
 parking the one that is later 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.890
 from the main entrance to attend 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.780
 clear that reason or is still missing a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.190
 good stretch to the exit door 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.510
 where many said that they had 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.670
 the quick escapes 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.590
 yes while everyone enters the door 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.380
 main we are distracted is nothing 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.740
 that's right but I hope it's always the 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.740
 tenor d 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.630
 worries 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.060
 nothing more than the carpenter has not 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.900
 anime did not follow I am the america 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.900
