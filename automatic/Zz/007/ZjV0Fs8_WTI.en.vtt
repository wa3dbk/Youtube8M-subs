00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.140
 Good morning you love me 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.310
 thought 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.050
 domestic before considering and now puts 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.730
 to do that around me on everyone 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.250
 case a few recipes will show the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.050
 here are typical eager because the gage 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.150
 was really really a lot to offer 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.190
 and my grandparents cook on it 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.470
 really always very varied 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.260
 This morning, there is that 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.030
 Bulgarian cult breakfast and that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.040
 Bunny time me now with you 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.640
 make or make my grandma 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.680
 the ones and I are filming them for you 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.410
 filling really only the feta cheese 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.730
 small yes made small with the fork 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.440
 for example, easy to do with it 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.070
 really can not be that rude 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.110
 then fine for a one done bowl 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.300
 then come to two or three eggs like 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.970
 So my grandma says 2 1 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.550
 meant four even taken 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 Although rich entirely of which are 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:24.250
 then yes there comes to it pure 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.399
 another tablespoon of yoghurt and then 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.509
 a little bit because I know now 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.599
 not whether one instead of repentance is called up 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.289
 German exactly these things become 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:40.149
 Decisions done and right together 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.090
 then mixed properly beat 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:47.369
 rolled out with the weather and with oil 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.369
 smeared a bit out of focus 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.369
 and our filling also directly of the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.270
 given weather dough 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:02.200
 so spread a little more and 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:08.850
 then it gets loud even for half as 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:13.350
 others put it on and so together yes 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.269
 because I always pushed together like that 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.540
 caught up because it is the first sheet 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.620
 and in the middle and around 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.620
 come the other leaves 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.430
 on the leftover filling comes 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.150
 then an egg that will be again 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.150
 strike properly 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.739
 then a pinch of natron powder and 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.810
 carbonated water so water 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.989
 with carbonic acid is then also into it 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.560
 that's really nice you poured 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.590
 you'll see it go on and on 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.590
 continue 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.049
 you see yourself until it really does 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.620
 I do not know, I do not know 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.920
 because at the france of like almost 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.200
 like over and then again as 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.200
 distribute all over the Valais 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.910
 and last step before you leave the oven 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.190
 come again with a tablespoon of oil 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.440
 are taken with such a sergeant mine 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.100
 grandma gÃ¼nther several tablespoons the me 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.940
 that knew 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.280
 no so really important with that 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.380
 Bikers do not know they are sticky 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.380
 really can share later 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:48.710
 so when she finishes is still with 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.710
 bit of water drizzled 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.860
 and then a newspaper, a film 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.460
 placed over it and then it becomes 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.460
 turned around 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.950
 and also three cups put the sense 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.950
 the thing is that the oil is not down at the 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:13.840
 The whole oil remains solid through the ground 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:17.650
 entire bank dissolves so a cloth 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.440
 Covered and so remains first for about 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.320
 ten minutes 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.900
 after about ten to twenty minutes 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.680
 newspaper before it all away and it is 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.680
 finished
