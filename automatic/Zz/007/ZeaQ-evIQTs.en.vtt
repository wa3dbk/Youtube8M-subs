00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.660 
after a light screen i will be able to
finish<00:01:57.869> off<00:01:58.200> his<00:01:58.439> medicos<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.189> an<00:01:59.280> hydro

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
finish off his medicos with an hydro

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.560 
finish off his medicos with an hydro
pump<00:01:59.909> however<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:02.009> wanted<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> try<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
pump however I just wanted to try and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.690 
pump however I just wanted to try and
play<00:02:03.840> safe<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> go<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.829> safe<00:02:05.100> hydro<00:02:05.520> pump

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
play safe and go for the safe hydro pump

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.180 
play safe and go for the safe hydro pump
it<00:02:06.210> goes<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.659> suicune<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.409> I'm<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
it goes for suicune and I'm with the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.369 
it goes for suicune and I'm with the
last<00:02:08.489> screen<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.629> resistance<00:02:10.170> that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
last screen up and the resistance that

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.120 
last screen up and the resistance that
is<00:02:10.440> obviously<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> do

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
is obviously not going to do

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.610 
is obviously not going to do
I<00:02:12.490> switch<00:02:13.060> out<00:02:13.240> into<00:02:13.540> my<00:02:13.690> Celebi<00:02:14.110> because

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
I switch out into my Celebi because

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.350 
I switch out into my Celebi because
Sally<00:02:14.950> became<00:02:15.250> pretty<00:02:15.550> much<00:02:15.730> voltage<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.330> a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
Sally became pretty much voltage to a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.870 
Sally became pretty much voltage to a
coon<00:02:16.570> if<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.900> doesn't<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.470> an<00:02:17.770> ice<00:02:18.190> beam<00:02:18.610> and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
coon if it doesn't have an ice beam and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.420 
coon if it doesn't have an ice beam and
I<00:02:19.480> didn't<00:02:19.810> see<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.080> lefty<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.770> thought<00:02:21.160> it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
I didn't see the lefty so I thought it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.550 
I didn't see the lefty so I thought it
would<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.150> berry<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.510> makes<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:23.230> awake

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
would have the berry that makes it awake

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.910 
would have the berry that makes it awake
after<00:02:23.860> com<00:02:24.730> minding<00:02:25.150> up<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.740> use

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
after com minding up and when you use

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.030 
after com minding up and when you use
his<00:02:27.070> rest<00:02:27.370> wakes<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.820> up<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.240> stuff<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:29.290> it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
his rest wakes it up and stuff but it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.860 
his rest wakes it up and stuff but it
goes<00:02:30.250> through<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.460> ice<00:02:30.610> beam<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:31.000> was<00:02:31.210> so<00:02:31.660> much

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
goes through the ice beam it was so much

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.960 
goes through the ice beam it was so much
that<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.710> can't<00:02:33.130> believe<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.760> has<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
that I can't believe that it has the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.480 
that I can't believe that it has the
berry<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.140> see<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.500> live<00:02:35.740> for<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.340> was

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
berry but I see the live for and I was

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.090 
berry but I see the live for and I was
really<00:02:36.640> surprised<00:02:37.150> by<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.480> because<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:38.110> life

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
really surprised by that because a life

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.510 
really surprised by that because a life
orb<00:02:39.400> suicune<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:40.120> pretty<00:02:40.420> much<00:02:40.540> original<00:02:41.110> and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
orb suicune is pretty much original and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.550 
orb suicune is pretty much original and
yeah<00:02:42.520> it's<00:02:42.910> really<00:02:43.600> nice<00:02:43.870> for<00:02:43.930> him<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.470> he

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
yeah it's really nice for him that he

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.490 
yeah it's really nice for him that he
plays<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.490> like<00:02:45.550> that<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> don't<00:02:47.230> have

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
plays it like that so I don't have

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.620 
plays it like that so I don't have
anything<00:02:47.770> against<00:02:48.280> suicune<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:48.940> honest<00:02:49.330> so

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
anything against suicune to be honest so

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.420 
anything against suicune to be honest so
I<00:02:49.660> just<00:02:49.990> decided<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.440> switch<00:02:50.680> out<00:02:50.920> into<00:02:51.250> my

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
I just decided to switch out into my

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.600 
I just decided to switch out into my
empoleon<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.290> he<00:02:53.710> can<00:02:53.950> do<00:02:54.160> anything

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
empoleon because I'm he can do anything

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.850 
empoleon because I'm he can do anything
against<00:02:54.880> my<00:02:55.030> Emporium<00:02:55.600> goes<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.470> an<00:02:56.530> ice<00:02:56.620> beam

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
against my Emporium goes for an ice beam

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.920 
against my Emporium goes for an ice beam
gets<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.310> live<00:02:57.490> for<00:02:57.730> damage<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.330> that's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
gets the live for damage and that's

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.360 
gets the live for damage and that's
great<00:02:59.170> for<00:02:59.410> me<00:02:59.530> because<00:02:59.560> now<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.100> light

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
great for me because now the light

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.790 
great for me because now the light
screen<00:03:00.640> has<00:03:00.820> worn<00:03:01.120> off<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:01.510> I'm<00:03:02.230> nearly<00:03:02.500> back

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
screen has worn off and I'm nearly back

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.340 
screen has worn off and I'm nearly back
at<00:03:02.830> full<00:03:03.160> health<00:03:03.340> with<00:03:03.640> my<00:03:03.790> impot<00:03:04.150> Liam<00:03:04.420> here<00:03:05.320> I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
at full health with my impot Liam here I

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.660 
at full health with my impot Liam here I
really<00:03:06.250> thought<00:03:06.580> that<00:03:06.910> he<00:03:07.120> would<00:03:07.320> switch<00:03:08.320> out

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
really thought that he would switch out

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.270 
really thought that he would switch out
because<00:03:09.670> yeah<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.720> didn't<00:03:11.470> expect<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.070> hidden

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
because yeah I didn't expect the hidden

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.820 
because yeah I didn't expect the hidden
power<00:03:12.490> electric<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:14.350> he<00:03:14.410> goes<00:03:14.530> through<00:03:14.710> hidden

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
power electric so he goes through hidden

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.680 
power electric so he goes through hidden
power<00:03:15.130> electric<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.850> think<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.390> go<00:03:16.480> for<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
power electric I think and go for the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.630 
power electric I think and go for the
cell<00:03:16.990> trucks<00:03:17.290> expecting<00:03:17.860> him<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.070> switch<00:03:18.370> out

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
cell trucks expecting him to switch out

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.640 
cell trucks expecting him to switch out
and<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:20.080> get<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:21.450> lead<00:03:22.450> sheath<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.020> I<00:03:23.410> grow

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
and I get the lead sheath and I grow

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.370 
and I get the lead sheath and I grow
back<00:03:23.890> at<00:03:24.100> 100<00:03:24.640> HP<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.480> at<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.020> point<00:03:26.230> I

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
back at 100 HP and at this point I

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.560 
back at 100 HP and at this point I
thought<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.650> would<00:03:26.980> live<00:03:27.220> any<00:03:27.850> attack<00:03:28.240> coming

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
thought I would live any attack coming

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.930 
thought I would live any attack coming
from<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.960> suicune<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.010> just<00:03:30.310> decided<00:03:30.460> to<00:03:30.760> go

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
from the suicune so I just decided to go

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.960 
from the suicune so I just decided to go
for<00:03:31.150> an<00:03:31.240> aqua<00:03:31.720> jet<00:03:31.830> because<00:03:32.830> Aquajet<00:03:33.700> I

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
for an aqua jet because Aquajet I

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.360 
for an aqua jet because Aquajet I
thought<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.840> would<00:03:34.990> do<00:03:35.200> more<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.680> be<00:03:35.800> honest<00:03:36.130> I

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
thought it would do more to be honest I

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.150 
thought it would do more to be honest I
goes<00:03:37.330> for<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.570> hydro<00:03:37.960> pump<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.470> it<00:03:38.710> surprised

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
goes for the hydro pump and it surprised

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.940 
goes for the hydro pump and it surprised
me<00:03:39.340> that<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:40.120> finished<00:03:40.480> me<00:03:40.660> off<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:41.500> be<00:03:41.620> honest

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
me that it finished me off to be honest

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.880 
me that it finished me off to be honest
so<00:03:42.400> but<00:03:42.850> hey<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:43.780> go<00:03:43.990> for<00:03:44.200> my<00:03:44.230> Ganga<00:03:44.590> right

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
so but hey so I go for my Ganga right

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.650 
so but hey so I go for my Ganga right
