let's<00:02:25.769> say<00:02:25.919> you're<00:02:26.069> doing<00:02:26.370> something<00:02:26.669> that's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
let's say you're doing something that's

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.820 
let's say you're doing something that's
like<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.359> yellow<00:02:27.719> thing

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
like a yellow thing

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.449 
like a yellow thing
Solly's<00:02:29.830> yellow<00:02:30.129> sprinkles<00:02:30.519> available<00:02:32.459> nuts

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
are nice too but like I said be mindful

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.920 
are nice too but like I said be mindful
not<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.680> put<00:02:39.069> anything<00:02:39.340> too<00:02:39.849> heavy<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:40.420> here

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
not to put anything too heavy on here

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.600 
not to put anything too heavy on here
because<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.590> not<00:02:41.650> going<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> be<00:02:42.159> as<00:02:42.310> delicate

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
because it's not going to be as delicate

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.259 
because it's not going to be as delicate
and<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.959> may<00:02:44.170> kind<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.829> just<00:02:45.129> roll<00:02:45.459> off<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:46.090> you
