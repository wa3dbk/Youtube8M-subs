00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
realized that that was only part of the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
realized that that was only part of the
solution<00:01:38.550> we<00:01:39.120> wanted<00:01:39.660> to<00:01:39.750> change<00:01:39.930> life<00:01:40.230> but<00:01:40.500> we

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
solution we wanted to change life but we

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.200

these<00:01:42.300> girls<00:01:42.570> were<00:01:42.780> coming<00:01:42.960> from<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.770> we

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
these girls were coming from and so we

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
these girls were coming from and so we
