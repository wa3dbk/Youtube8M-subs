pearl called amber orange and so I took
the<00:01:35.430> amber<00:01:35.759> orange<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.540> painted

different<00:01:44.189> colors<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.329> got<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> down

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
different colors to it and I got it down

summer we'll have some fun with it I
started<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.370> SEMA<00:02:44.819> back<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:46.340> 1973<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
started going to SEMA back in 1973 and

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.670 
started going to SEMA back in 1973 and
prior<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.510> actually<00:02:49.050> when<00:02:49.260> they<00:02:49.379> were<00:02:49.440> in

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
prior to that actually when they were in

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.650 
prior to that actually when they were in
Anaheim<00:02:50.190> but<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> thing<00:02:50.879> is<00:02:50.910> they<00:02:51.180> outgrew

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
Anaheim but the thing is they outgrew

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.259 
Anaheim but the thing is they outgrew
that<00:02:51.900> very<00:02:52.290> very<00:02:52.560> quickly<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.580> they've

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
that very very quickly and so they've

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.530 
that very very quickly and so they've
been<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:54.870> many<00:02:55.830> many<00:02:55.980> decades<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.970> think

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
been here for many many decades I think

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.920 
been here for many many decades I think
since<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.650> mid<00:02:59.580> 80s<00:03:00.150> I've<00:03:00.390> been<00:03:00.569> here<00:03:00.750> almost

since the mid 80s I've been here almost

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.140 
since the mid 80s I've been here almost
every<00:03:01.349> single<00:03:01.709> year<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.099> thought<00:03:02.909> it<00:03:03.060> was

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
every single year I thought it was

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.020 
every single year I thought it was
important<00:03:03.690> enough<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:05.040> meet<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.250> people<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
important enough to meet the people that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.610 
important enough to meet the people that

going<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.769> waterborne<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.879> waterborne

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
going to waterborne this and waterborne

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.170 
going to waterborne this and waterborne
that<00:03:27.629> and<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.769> I'm<00:03:29.099> really<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.459> solvent<00:03:30.000> head<00:03:30.150> I

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
that and and I'm really a solvent head I

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.210 
that and and I'm really a solvent head I
really<00:03:30.599> like<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.049> stay<00:03:31.290> with<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.709> solvents

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
really like to stay with the solvents

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.580 
really like to stay with the solvents
and<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.970> what<00:03:33.150> we've<00:03:33.330> done<00:03:33.569> is<00:03:33.629> designed<00:03:34.379> a

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and so what we've done is designed a

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.570 
and so what we've done is designed a
resin<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.310> system<00:03:35.849> that<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.629> 7<00:03:37.200> points<00:03:37.860> less

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
resin and a system that is 7 points less

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.979 
resin and a system that is 7 points less
than<00:03:38.909> water<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.860> water<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:41.090> 3.5<00:03:42.120> volatile

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
than water so water is 3.5 volatile

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.589 
than water so water is 3.5 volatile
organic<00:03:43.470> compounds<00:03:44.129> per<00:03:44.340> gallon<00:03:44.849> pounds<00:03:45.420> in

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
organic compounds per gallon pounds in

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.869 
organic compounds per gallon pounds in
in<00:03:46.230> Southern<00:03:46.620> California<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> strictest

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
in Southern California the strictest

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.170 
in Southern California the strictest
market<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.599> we<00:03:49.319> come<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.650> at<00:03:49.769> 2.8<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.430> we're

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
market and we come in at 2.8 and we're

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.530 
market and we come in at 2.8 and we're
all<00:03:51.330> solvent<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.620> we're<00:03:53.610> kicking<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.239> and

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
all solvent so we're kicking and and

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.390 
all solvent so we're kicking and and
look<00:03:54.840> at<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.110> thing<00:03:55.379> I<00:03:55.500> mean<00:03:55.530> it's<00:03:55.830> easy<00:03:56.159> to

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
look at this thing I mean it's easy to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.610 
look at this thing I mean it's easy to
paint<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.939> our<00:03:57.360> clears<00:03:57.780> our<00:03:58.049> primers

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
paint and our clears our primers

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.250 
paint and our clears our primers
everything<00:03:59.370> meet<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.730> VOCs<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.959> we<00:04:01.140> are<00:04:01.230> a

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
everything meet the VOCs so we are a

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.280 
everything meet the VOCs so we are a
totally<00:04:01.920> compliant<00:04:02.610> system<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.629> I<00:04:03.780> started

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
totally compliant system and I started

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.210 
totally compliant system and I started
making<00:04:04.500> my<00:04:04.830> own<00:04:04.860> paint<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.989> 1963<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:08.010> never

making my own paint in 1963 and I never

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.830 
making my own paint in 1963 and I never
intended<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.819> sell<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> quart<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.689> to

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
intended to sell a quart of it to

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.250 
intended to sell a quart of it to
anybody<00:04:10.049> basically<00:04:10.860> I<00:04:11.549> used<00:04:12.450> all<00:04:12.720> organic

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
anybody basically I used all organic

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.110 
anybody basically I used all organic
pigments<00:04:13.439> and<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:14.250> started<00:04:14.730> winning<00:04:14.909> awards

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.920 
in 1965 I started selling house of color
custom<00:04:38.160> paints<00:04:38.700> but<00:04:39.300> it<00:04:39.420> took<00:04:39.600> 10<00:04:39.900> years

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
custom paints but it took 10 years

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.050 
custom paints but it took 10 years
before<00:04:40.410> people<00:04:40.770> recognized<00:04:41.490> what<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:41.820> was

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
before people recognized what I was

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.780 
before people recognized what I was
doing<00:04:42.390> different<00:04:42.810> than<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.080> big<00:04:43.260> guys
