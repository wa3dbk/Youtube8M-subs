00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.910
 is being the chip in light of the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.910
 steamer 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.300
 do not 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.710
 this will be the air 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
 two 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.040
 do not 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.770
 do not 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.770
 ah 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.590
 your arrival point for later 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.480
 surely we are still going to others 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.520
 places this is the situation at this time 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.560
 making it from peers 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.080
 álvaro I do not know if you are listening to me 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.850
 well what I wanted to ask you is if 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.130
 there has been some special advice from the 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.930
 authorities to give people for 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.120
 people if you are deploying some 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.770
 Special operative if there is a recommendation 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.729
 of not circulating of not leaving the houses 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.310
 and if this strong wind has already passed 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.810
 good for this moment at this moment 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.930
 we are having the rain 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.490
 intense but imagine something very normal 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.320
 growing the worst seemingly already 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.430
 passed on to the authorities that have preached 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.679
 work is to start to recover and give 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.130
 a hand to the neighbors who are this 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.170
 affected by blasting roofs and 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.820
 especially from flooding of their houses 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.310
 there are many houses that were 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.320
 affected by flood 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.330
 we are seeing in the area of ​​what 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.630
 traditional for example drains that do not 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.340
 it's so much supply and in some places 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.670
 from the downtown area we have pressure 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.510
 also the sanitation cap that jane 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.300
 they have skipped this mark yet now a 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.239
 strong is also water pressure 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.610
 that at that level and in terms of what 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.770
 you asked us about the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.870
 recommendation of course of first of 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.640
 tranquility of the second do not go out to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.840
 streets but heavy stress and a lot of people 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.730
 who has learned about how the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.130
 Petrobras service station gave me 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.920
 many people have these hours and they are 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.840
 complicating a lot in the work of the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.780
 road police that is stationed there 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.910
 but there is also risk because the route 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.900
 vision at that height where is the trunk 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.140
 of the road but 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.620
 Juan Manuel is a path that serves to 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.629
 the transfer of a road that serves 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.159
 for moving the trucks towards 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.360
 Route 21 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:25.910
 you have to indicate what 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.970
 121 makes a very important passage of 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.890
 water therefore at this height that area 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.569
 It is very dangerous for vehicles that 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.890
 they are simply seeing something that is more 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.230
 the provision of the service that in 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.150
 reality to leave is clear no no no and you should 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.950
 to appreciate that he made a good mind 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.560
 álvaro martínez we appreciate this 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.540

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.459
 I hope they can soon recover from 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.709
 all this situation I meanwhile

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.959
 ceilings reported so far in the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.660
 city ​​of pains that also fell 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.579
 about 40 trees and that route 21 which is 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.769
 that route you are traveling through 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.569
 is precisely cut in some 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.890
 stretches by falling trees makes 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.410
 moments managed to restore 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.049
 energy in the local hospital but great 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.060
