00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.430
 girls caught me checking my 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.780
 nail polish collection I'm going to 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.880
 tell everything they have to know 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:29.230
 about trends for winter for 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:30.400
 summer and about care the first thing that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.140
 Let's talk about the products 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.910
 basic treatment obviously 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.210
 we have to have a 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.120
 good lime of recess and a good lime 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.500
 also that is to leave the nail lawful 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.170
 and brilliant 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.620
 the other thing that we have to have is always 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.420
 a fluid for the cuticles the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.850
 Cuticles that are thin 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.160
 suavecita is super important so that 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.210
 do not grow us by the nail and they put us 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.210
 as well as a swamp 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.960
 then obviously we have to have 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.699
 treatment products like the typical 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.790
 nail hardener that a product 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.460
 transparent that we made before 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.610
 throw enamels 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.540
 the brillito also obviously if they can 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.880
 Also make it with nail hardener 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.430
 great and for my vital taste is also 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.840
 have a good pair of rosadito colors or 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:31.280
 skin color a color like that goes to my taste is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.320
 vital this for my taste are the basics 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.909
 what happens now with the colors of 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.909
 trend for winter and for summer 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.159
 good girls obviously one can use 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.619
 the color you want when 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.750
 want but in terms of trend the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.970
 colors that marked the winter were 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.920
 the metallic colors the color that 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.590
 comes also very for the summer is going to 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.000
 be the navy 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.219
 Pearl 2 colors in green tones and a 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.380
 a little more purple also caused a furore 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.409
 this winter and already if you want them 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.600
 last longer enamel apply only 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.579
 a layer of color for that comprises 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.310
 good products that are much better 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.030
 pigmented and with a layer of color 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.500
 It will suffice and they will be left over with another 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.290
 color that I also loved will be in 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.709
 winter is this electric blue color 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.390
 wonderful leaves you sexy nails and more 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.170
 like to go out in the night 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.420
 the color totally winter and very between 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.500
 the boy a girl and something that to me 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.180
 love to wear also in winter is the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.209
 craquelure that came out last year and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.310
 caused a furore and that I came up with the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.370
 great idea to mix it with yellow a 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.130
 super strong color and that looks medium to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.740
 leopard to 2 but if you did not know 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.440
 the craquelado are going to want to die 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.390
 now that they know him because it 's a 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.260
 way too much fun to wear the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.260
 nails for this winter 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.000
 and now we are ready to throw ourselves 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.830
 our craquelure this for example is 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.920
 of ping and I have a great data 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.810
 to buy much cheaper products 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.140
 go to santa filomena with patronato a 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.940
 store that sell the glazes and a lot 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.940
 Cheapest kids will love them 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.079
 good and what they have to buy is 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.579
 this product that is cracked what 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.500
 they have to do is pass it as much 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.930
 fast possible one pass with fed up 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.319
 product and it starts to be created only in 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.319
 a few seconds 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.549
 it comes with all the winter that 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.530
 you can do the winter after 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.409
 winter is to become French manicure 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.370
 but of special colors to me the 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:47.480
 combination that I like the most 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.310
 it's the watermelon tone with the black and for 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.620
 this obviously they need to buy without 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.230
 colour 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.340
 strong red and can also be for 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.010
 celestial example 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.379
 try daring witches then what 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.040
 first thing I do is apply the color of 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:07.939
 base then I wait for it to dry 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:12.219
 and with a large share of the pulse I get 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.219
 a thin line for my French 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.669
 we are not going to worry about us 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.260
 leave the product outside because 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.650
 we are always going to have a cotton milestone with 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.449
 us to clean up all the excess that 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.550
 get in our little fingers 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.169
 with these simple steps and the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.509
 suitable products we can have a 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.180
 manicure like of salon made in our 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.460
 same house good girls we already saw a little 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.439
 of trends for this winter and things 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.849
 that can be done in your own home and 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.949
 now let's see some of the colors 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.629
 that are coming for this summer for this 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.460
 summer they will repeat a little 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.770
 same colors as for the previous one are 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.270
 colors always very cheerful very pastel and 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.249
 also very neon is so that they 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.469
 I recommend that they have a good color 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:00.720
 pastel either green or celestial in this 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.970
 spectrum 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.460
 that looks amazing on the nails 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.520
 although they do not believe it and finally the other 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.820
 range that they have to have is the range already 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.580
 of the pink orange watermelon and so on 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.770
 and also a good neon color that never 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.860
 they will come from more 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.860
 i 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.970
 good girls that's all for today I hope 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.350
 has been very clear all them all 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.840
 the possibilities they have for their 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.370
 nails both winter and summer 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.590
