00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the best gameplay because I'm just

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
the best gameplay because I'm just
kidding<00:01:16.619> looking<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:16.920> spawns<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.850> kind

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
kidding looking at spawns and just kind

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
kidding looking at spawns and just kind
of<00:01:18.090> picking<00:01:18.299> them<00:01:18.479> off<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> spawn<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:20.100> at

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
of picking them off as a spawn but at

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.149 
of picking them off as a spawn but at
the<00:01:20.250> same<00:01:20.490> time<00:01:21.290> it's<00:01:22.290> not<00:01:22.439> easy<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:22.979> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the same time it's not easy to do that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.660 
the same time it's not easy to do that
so<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.310> gonna<00:01:23.520> scan<00:01:23.790> underused<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.549> this<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
so I gonna scan underused and this is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
so I gonna scan underused and this is
probably<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.060> most<00:01:27.180> SMG<00:01:28.080> league<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.409> sorry
