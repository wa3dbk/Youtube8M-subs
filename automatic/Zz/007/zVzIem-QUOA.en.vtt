little bit of damage in between the
parries<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.750> you'll<00:01:15.869> notice<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:16.350> not

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
parries that you'll notice I'm not

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.090 
parries that you'll notice I'm not
timing<00:01:16.710> very<00:01:17.130> well<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> problem<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
timing very well and the problem is it

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
timing very well and the problem is it
can<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.340> difficult<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.880> see<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> windup

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
can be difficult to see the windup

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.730 
can be difficult to see the windup
unless<00:01:21.780> you're<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> left<00:01:22.290> side<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> his

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
unless you're on the left side of his

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.520 
unless you're on the left side of his
body<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:24.570> difficult<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.049> stay<00:01:25.259> there

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
body and it's difficult to stay there

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.080 
body and it's difficult to stay there
but<00:01:25.740> there's<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> parry<00:01:26.430> there's<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but there's the parry there's a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.109 
but there's the parry there's a
successful<00:01:27.659> timing<00:01:28.820> that's<00:01:29.820> what<00:01:30.030> we're

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
successful timing that's what we're

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.280 
successful timing that's what we're
gonna<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.390> doing<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.079> saving

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.949 
then use the Trinity smash with the
arbiter<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.430> do<00:03:26.519> some<00:03:26.700> massive<00:03:27.030> damage<00:03:27.359> once

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
arbiter to do some massive damage once

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.020 
arbiter to do some massive damage once
you<00:03:28.079> drain<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:28.440> her<00:03:28.650> life<00:03:28.859> bar<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.579> isn't<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
you drain all her life bar it isn't the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.339 
you drain all her life bar it isn't the
end<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.299> fight<00:03:30.599> although<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.109> probably

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
end of the fight although it probably

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.110 
end of the fight although it probably
should<00:03:31.829> be<00:03:31.859> it<00:03:32.250> would<00:03:32.370> make<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.700> much<00:03:32.910> more

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
should be it would make it much more

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.569 
should be it would make it much more
bearable<00:03:33.480> instead<00:03:34.410> there's<00:03:34.650> an<00:03:34.950> unnecessary

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
bearable instead there's an unnecessary

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.839 
bearable instead there's an unnecessary
third<00:03:35.880> phase<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:37.440> don't<00:03:38.160> understand<00:03:38.639> it<00:03:38.730> at

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
third phase and I don't understand it at

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.640 
third phase and I don't understand it at
all<00:03:39.000> it's<00:03:39.510> almost<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.230> have<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.530> do

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
all it's almost like you have to do

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.259 
all it's almost like you have to do
three<00:03:40.889> phases<00:03:41.099> regardless<00:03:41.819> which<00:03:42.000> seems

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
three phases regardless which seems

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.990 
three phases regardless which seems
strange<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.750> me<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.769> Ninja<00:03:44.669> theories

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
strange to me but Ninja theories

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.170 
strange to me but Ninja theories
decision

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
decision

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.259 
decision
I<00:03:46.239> don't<00:03:47.079> think<00:03:47.230> it's<00:03:47.349> a<00:03:47.379> good<00:03:47.500> one<00:03:51.269> because

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
I don't think it's a good one because

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.209 
I don't think it's a good one because
you<00:03:52.780> look<00:03:52.959> at<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.109> sliver<00:03:53.409> of<00:03:53.500> life<00:03:53.799> she's<00:03:54.040> got

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.219 
you look at the sliver of life she's got

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:55.860 
you look at the sliver of life she's got
left<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.670> took<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:55.060> sliver<00:03:55.420> off<00:03:55.629> because

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
left I took that sliver off because

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.420 
left I took that sliver off because
after<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.230> Trinity<00:03:56.560> smash<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:56.950> hit<00:03:57.129> her<00:03:57.280> twice

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
after the Trinity smash I hit her twice

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.309 
after the Trinity smash I hit her twice
like<00:03:58.030> two<00:03:58.540> more<00:03:58.719> times

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
like two more times

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.369 
like two more times
luckily<00:04:00.189> for<00:04:00.370> me<00:04:00.609> the<00:04:01.329> timing<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.019> parries

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
luckily for me the timing on the parries

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.599 
luckily for me the timing on the parries
is<00:04:02.799> coming<00:04:03.250> back<00:04:03.400> to<00:04:03.609> me<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:05.079> managed<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.620> to

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
is coming back to me and I managed to to

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.229 
is coming back to me and I managed to to
end<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.969> a<00:04:07.150> little<00:04:07.659> swifter<00:04:07.900> then<00:04:09.120> then<00:04:10.120> it

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
end it a little swifter then then it

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.459 
end it a little swifter then then it
could<00:04:10.389> have<00:04:10.420> been<00:04:10.629> could<00:04:11.139> have<00:04:11.230> been<00:04:11.319> much

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:11.469 
could have been could have been much

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.129 
could have been could have been much
less<00:04:11.650> graceful<00:04:11.889> well<00:04:12.790> there<00:04:13.510> she<00:04:13.659> goes<00:04:13.840> the

demon<00:04:14.709> spawn<00:04:14.889> is<00:04:15.099> down<00:04:15.340> not<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.879> most

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
demon spawn is down not the most

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.029 
demon spawn is down not the most
challenging<00:04:16.449> of<00:04:16.539> bosses<00:04:16.959> they're<00:04:17.829> not<00:04:17.979> the

challenging of bosses they're not the

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.680 
challenging of bosses they're not the
most<00:04:18.160> imaginative<00:04:18.489> as<00:04:19.060> well<00:04:19.269> when<00:04:19.449> it<00:04:19.539> comes

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
most imaginative as well when it comes

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.260 
most imaginative as well when it comes
to<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.930> fight<00:04:20.320> itself<00:04:20.769> better<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.789> concept

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
to the fight itself better in concept

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.719 
to the fight itself better in concept
less<00:04:22.479> often<00:04:22.900> when<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.349> comes<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.680> practice<00:04:24.160> but

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
less often when it comes to practice but

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.580 
less often when it comes to practice but
thank<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.030> for<00:04:25.210> watching<00:04:25.599> and<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.169> take<00:04:26.380> care

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
thank you for watching and you take care

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.620 
thank you for watching and you take care
now
