00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.860 
there I was stunned and amazed because
I'd<00:04:38.430> never<00:04:38.669> heard<00:04:38.970> my<00:04:39.120> violin<00:04:39.450> played<00:04:39.690> like

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
I'd never heard my violin played like

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.480 
I'd never heard my violin played like
that<00:04:40.020> bunny<00:04:40.260> buddy<00:04:40.440> else<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.830> everyone<00:04:41.220> and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
that bunny buddy else and everyone and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.620 
that bunny buddy else and everyone and
their<00:04:41.550> mother<00:04:41.760> had<00:04:41.970> been<00:04:42.060> into<00:04:42.270> my<00:04:42.389> shop<00:04:42.600> and

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
their mother had been into my shop and

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.110 
their mother had been into my shop and
play<00:04:42.930> dead<00:04:43.139> violin<00:04:43.500> but<00:04:44.340> Perlman<00:04:44.820> was<00:04:44.970> the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
play dead violin but Perlman was the

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.180 
play dead violin but Perlman was the
first<00:04:45.330> one<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:46.200> really<00:04:46.530> showed<00:04:46.770> me<00:04:46.800> what

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
first one that really showed me what

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.760 
first one that really showed me what
that<00:04:47.850> violin<00:04:48.240> could<00:04:48.419> do<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.990> for<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.320> rest<00:04:49.590> of

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
that violin could do and for the rest of

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.310 
that violin could do and for the rest of
my<00:04:50.010> time<00:04:50.280> I've<00:04:50.580> been<00:04:50.700> trying<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.120> emulate<00:04:52.050> that

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
my time I've been trying to emulate that

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.140 
my time I've been trying to emulate that
sound<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:52.830> I'll<00:04:52.919> never<00:04:53.130> be<00:04:53.340> able<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.669> because

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
sound and I'll never be able to because

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.400 
sound and I'll never be able to because
I'm<00:04:54.389> that<00:04:54.720> Perlman

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
I'm that Perlman

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.120 
I'm that Perlman
I'm<00:04:55.740> Paul<00:04:56.039> Martel

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:08.090 

it's<00:05:00.130> my<00:05:00.280> violin

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.160
