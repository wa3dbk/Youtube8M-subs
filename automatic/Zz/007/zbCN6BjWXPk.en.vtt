now this particular lesson is on the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.020 
now this particular lesson is on the
three<00:00:10.410> types<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.800> rocks<00:00:11.040> for<00:00:11.490> my<00:00:11.639> students

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
three types of rocks for my students

three types of rocks for my students
into<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.450> lesson<00:00:12.840> there

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
into this lesson there

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.460 
into this lesson there
they've<00:00:13.500> already<00:00:13.710> observed<00:00:14.160> twelve<00:00:14.580> rocks

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
they've already observed twelve rocks

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.170 
they've already observed twelve rocks
the<00:00:16.470> objective<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.340> classify<00:00:17.640> rocks

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the objective here is to classify rocks

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.730 
the objective here is to classify rocks
and<00:00:18.480> rock<00:00:18.630> forming<00:00:18.960> minerals<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.529> think

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
and rock forming minerals do you think

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.800 
and rock forming minerals do you think
student<00:00:20.100> may<00:00:20.220> rules<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.939> I'm<00:00:21.060> hoping<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
student may rules and I'm hoping that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.090 
student may rules and I'm hoping that
they<00:00:22.050> learned<00:00:22.289> how<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.590> determine<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
they learned how to determine the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
they learned how to determine the
properties<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.730> rocks<00:00:23.939> how<00:00:24.359> rocks<00:00:24.630> are

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
properties of the rocks how rocks are

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.200 
properties of the rocks how rocks are
formed<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.380> how<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.949> sciences<00:00:26.580> actually

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
formed and how the sciences actually

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.019 
formed and how the sciences actually
classify<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> rocks

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
classify the rocks

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.700 
classify the rocks

chance to guess what type of rock this

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.240 
chance to guess what type of rock this
is<00:00:39.079> then<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.320> click<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.800> see<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.070> they

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
is then they can click to see if they

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
is then they can click to see if they
are<00:00:41.309> correct<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.899> particular

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
are correct and on this particular

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
are correct and on this particular
respondents<00:00:43.920> they<00:00:44.309> actually<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> link<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
respondents they actually have a link to

respondents they actually have a link to
a<00:00:45.390> video<00:00:50.000> at<00:00:51.000> one<00:00:51.180> time

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.450 

to<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.440> next<00:01:04.620> but<00:01:06.350> once<00:01:07.350> again<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.100> give<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
to the next but once again if I give it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.610 
to the next but once again if I give it
the<00:01:08.490> scription<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:11.190> then<00:01:11.400> Who<00:01:11.610> am<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.620> it'll

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
the scription and then Who am I it'll

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.070 
the scription and then Who am I it'll
make<00:01:13.740> their<00:01:13.950> gap<00:01:14.190> we<00:01:15.060> check<00:01:15.360> our<00:01:15.540> answer

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.230 

same<00:01:19.080> thing<00:01:19.350> three<00:01:19.979> types<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> rock<00:01:22.070> right<00:01:23.240> so

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
same thing three types of rock right so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.390 
same thing three types of rock right so
then<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> next<00:01:24.869> slide<00:01:25.110> using<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.860> vocabulary

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
then the next slide using the vocabulary

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.710 
then the next slide using the vocabulary
that's<00:01:26.490> been<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.790> previous<00:01:27.180> three<00:01:27.420> slides

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that's been in the previous three slides

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.170 
that's been in the previous three slides
they<00:01:28.680> will<00:01:28.800> be<00:01:28.920> able<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.310> match<00:01:29.520> vocabulary

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
they will be able to match vocabulary

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:45.520 
they will be able to match vocabulary
with<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.450> definition<00:01:36.110> I'm<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.350> remembering

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.410 

anything<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.800> they<00:01:46.920> might<00:01:47.160> have<00:01:47.369> wrong<00:01:47.700> they

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
anything that they might have wrong they

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.800 
anything that they might have wrong they
would<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.750> able<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.170> change<00:01:50.210> such<00:01:51.210> as<00:01:51.450> moving

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
would be able to change such as moving

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.980 
would be able to change such as moving
down<00:01:52.080> right<00:01:53.039> now<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.280> years<00:01:53.700> tick<00:01:54.539> mark<00:01:54.810> will

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
down right now the years tick mark will

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
down right now the years tick mark will
be<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> check<00:01:55.380> instead<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.860> neck

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.310 

reinforcement<00:02:04.060> vocabulary<00:02:04.689> it<00:02:04.930> is<00:02:05.049> fun

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
reinforcement vocabulary it is fun

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.339 
reinforcement vocabulary it is fun
innovative<00:02:05.920> way<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.659> then<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.869> black<00:02:08.110> ones

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
innovative way so then the black ones

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.749 
innovative way so then the black ones
these<00:02:08.470> are<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.679> swab<00:02:08.920> rocks<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.340> we<00:02:09.459> observe

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
these are the swab rocks that we observe

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.970 
these are the swab rocks that we observe
it's<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.209> classroom<00:02:10.479> we've<00:02:11.260> discussed<00:02:11.709> now

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's a classroom we've discussed now

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.740 
it's a classroom we've discussed now
that's<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.819> properties<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:13.420> three<00:02:13.569> types

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
that's the properties of the three types

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350 
that's the properties of the three types
of<00:02:13.959> rocks<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.709> I'm<00:02:15.160> hoping<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.580> they<00:02:15.700> can<00:02:15.730> go

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
of rocks and I'm hoping that they can go

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.540 
of rocks and I'm hoping that they can go
ahead<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.959> classify<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.310> they<00:02:18.400> would

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
ahead and classify this so they would

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.729 
ahead and classify this so they would
come<00:02:18.700> up<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.940> dimension<00:02:19.450> game<00:02:19.630> limestone<00:02:20.590> is

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
come up a dimension game limestone is

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.610 
come up a dimension game limestone is
sedimentary<00:02:21.280> say<00:02:21.819> we<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.150> think<00:02:22.420> about

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
sedimentary say we have to think about

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.809 
sedimentary say we have to think about
what<00:02:23.620> were<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.830> properties<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.280> sedimentary

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
what were the properties of sedimentary

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.440 
what were the properties of sedimentary
what<00:02:25.120> other<00:02:25.330> rocks<00:02:25.660> have<00:02:25.900> those<00:02:26.050> properties

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
what other rocks have those properties

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.640 
what other rocks have those properties
they're<00:02:28.450> using<00:02:28.840> their<00:02:29.049> notes<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.500> their

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
they're using their notes and their

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.490 
they're using their notes and their
observations<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.690> next<00:02:37.930> person<00:02:38.230> would<00:02:38.319> come

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
observations the next person would come

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:54.720 
observations the next person would come
up<00:02:52.349> smart<00:02:53.349> technologies<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.250> was<00:02:54.400> not<00:02:54.579> one

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
to the rock cycle sometimes I usually

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.599 
to the rock cycle sometimes I usually
have<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.480> quit<00:03:23.439> as<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.739> follows<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.310> we<00:03:24.400> use<00:03:24.489> the

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
have a quit as it follows and we use the

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.670 
have a quit as it follows and we use the
SmartWatch<00:03:25.060> suckers<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.689> go<00:03:25.780> ahead<00:03:25.930> get<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
SmartWatch suckers to go ahead get the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.740 
SmartWatch suckers to go ahead get the
results<00:03:27.189> quick<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.670> see<00:03:28.120> what<00:03:28.329> it<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.510> that<00:03:28.569> I

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
results quick and see what it is that I

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.470 
results quick and see what it is that I
might<00:03:28.900> need<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.109> go<00:03:29.290> back<00:03:29.319> over<00:03:29.829> so<00:03:30.310> using<00:03:31.120> that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
might need to go back over so using that

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.539 
might need to go back over so using that
I<00:03:31.750> believe<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.230> kids<00:03:32.469> are<00:03:32.739> more<00:03:32.950> apt<00:03:33.159> to<00:03:33.340> pay

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
I believe the kids are more apt to pay

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.569 
I believe the kids are more apt to pay
attention<00:03:33.819> they<00:03:34.359> loved<00:03:34.689> the<00:03:34.840> interaction<00:03:35.579> you
