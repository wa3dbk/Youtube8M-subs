00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
to keep it down to a modicum of thinness

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.679 
to keep it down to a modicum of thinness
now<00:03:02.519> that's<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.819> hard<00:03:02.939> part<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.450> flight

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
now that's the hard part of the flight
