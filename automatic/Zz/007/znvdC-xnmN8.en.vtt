great<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> bal<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.290> well<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.740> mean<00:01:16.770> check<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
great the bal is well I mean check that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.130 
great the bal is well I mean check that
out<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.360> know<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> proofs<00:01:18.960> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
out like that's you know the proofs in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.330 
out like that's you know the proofs in
the<00:01:19.200> pudding<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:19.950> thing<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the pudding there so this thing is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
the pudding there so this thing is
extremely<00:01:20.970> extremely<00:01:21.240> powerful<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.049> in

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
extremely extremely powerful now in

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
extremely extremely powerful now in
terms<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> rate<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> fire<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.119> shoots<00:01:24.630> at

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
terms of the rate of fire it shoots at

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.840 
terms of the rate of fire it shoots at
750<00:01:25.439> rounds<00:01:25.590> per<00:01:25.770> minute<00:01:25.979> which<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.460> pretty

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
750 rounds per minute which is pretty

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.160 
750 rounds per minute which is pretty
middle-of-the-road<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.720> assault<00:01:27.900> rifles

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
middle-of-the-road for assault rifles

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.630 
middle-of-the-road for assault rifles
not<00:01:28.350> necessarily<00:01:28.799> extremely<00:01:29.189> fast<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.520> not

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
not necessarily extremely fast but not

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.149 
not necessarily extremely fast but not
slow<00:01:29.970> either<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.630> recoil<00:01:31.159> unfortunately

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
slow either the recoil unfortunately

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.160 
slow either the recoil unfortunately
this<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.579> where<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.909> weapon<00:01:33.299> kind<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> falls

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this is where this weapon kind of falls

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.990 
this is where this weapon kind of falls
short<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.770> bit<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:35.549> very

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
short a little bit it's it's very very

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 
short a little bit it's it's very very
high<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.600> kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> unpredictable<00:01:37.079> so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
high and it's kind of unpredictable so

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
high and it's kind of unpredictable so
there's<00:01:38.310> lots<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.700> upward<00:01:39.180> movement<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:39.900> it's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
there's lots of upward movement but it's

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
there's lots of upward movement but it's
also<00:01:40.259> got<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> decent<00:01:40.920> amount<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.310> side-to-side

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
also got a decent amount of side-to-side

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
also got a decent amount of side-to-side
no<00:01:42.210> lateral<00:01:42.420> movement<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.020> well<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.829> have

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
no lateral movement as well so you have

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
no lateral movement as well so you have
to<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.340> careful<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.939> yet<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.509> know

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
to be careful with that yet the you know

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.999 
to be careful with that yet the you know
burst<00:01:45.810> fire<00:01:46.079> at<00:01:46.200> those<00:01:46.350> mediums<00:01:46.649> longer

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
burst fire at those mediums longer

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.170 
burst fire at those mediums longer
ranges<00:01:47.310> otherwise<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.119> away

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
ranges otherwise it's gonna get away

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
ranges otherwise it's gonna get away
from<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.799> used

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
from you one thing that it can be used

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.590 
from you one thing that it can be used
to<00:01:50.220> benefit<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> though<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.450> you're

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
to benefit you though is if you're

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420 
to benefit you though is if you're
aiming<00:01:52.049> sinner<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:52.890> could<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.189> mass

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
aiming sinner you know could have mass

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.249 
aiming sinner you know could have mass
is<00:01:53.820> sometimes<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.570> will<00:01:54.630> kick<00:01:54.869> straight<00:01:55.110> up

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
is sometimes it will kick straight up

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.780 
is sometimes it will kick straight up
and<00:01:55.439> give<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.649> headshots<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.369> help<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> kill

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and give you headshots and help you kill

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.310 
and give you headshots and help you kill
even<00:01:57.090> faster<00:01:57.479> especially<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:57.930> those<00:01:58.049> medium

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
even faster especially if those medium

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.020 
even faster especially if those medium
ranges<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.009> pretty<00:01:59.100> useful<00:01:59.280> but

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
ranges so that can be pretty useful but

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.179 
ranges so that can be pretty useful but
overall<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.079> recoil<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:01.979> pretty

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
overall the recoil can be pretty

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.190 
overall the recoil can be pretty
difficult<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.729> manage<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.210> next<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
think it's in like the the top 3 assault

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.500 
think it's in like the the top 3 assault
rifles<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:59.220> game<00:02:59.400> ok<00:02:59.700> they<00:02:59.940> were<00:03:00.060> messing
