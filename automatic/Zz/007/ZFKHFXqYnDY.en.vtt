00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
out the open it all right hold on let's

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.720 
out the open it all right hold on let's
try<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.780> way<00:02:38.110> hopefully<00:02:38.980> let<00:02:39.670> me

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
try it so this way hopefully let me

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.450
