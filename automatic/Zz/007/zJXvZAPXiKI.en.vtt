right here do you see how there's much

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.349 
right here do you see how there's much
more<00:02:45.019> tread<00:02:45.319> on<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.760> outside<00:02:46.760> edge<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.239> there

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
more tread on the outside edge and there

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.750 
more tread on the outside edge and there
is<00:02:47.480> on<00:02:47.659> the<00:02:47.750> inside<00:02:48.109> edge<00:02:48.349> this<00:02:49.099> is<00:02:49.159> a<00:02:49.340> left

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
is on the inside edge this is a left

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.360 
is on the inside edge this is a left
rear<00:02:49.939> tire<00:02:50.469> and<00:02:51.469> if<00:02:51.620> we<00:02:51.739> look<00:02:51.950> at<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.159> right

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
rear tire and if we look at the right

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.979 
rear tire and if we look at the right
rear<00:02:52.549> tire<00:02:52.579> it's<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.329> same<00:02:53.569> way<00:02:53.750> much<00:02:53.959> more

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
rear tire it's the same way much more

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.039 
rear tire it's the same way much more
tread<00:02:54.790> inside<00:02:55.790> edges<00:02:56.620> not<00:02:57.620> quite<00:02:57.889> showing

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
tread inside edges not quite showing

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.270 
tread inside edges not quite showing
still<00:03:01.000> bred<00:03:02.000> yet<00:03:02.359> but<00:03:02.599> still<00:03:03.500> as<00:03:03.799> you<00:03:03.980> can<00:03:04.099> see

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
still bred yet but still as you can see

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.759 
still bred yet but still as you can see
it's<00:03:04.400> very<00:03:04.689> slick<00:03:05.689> and<00:03:05.719> smooth<00:03:06.109> on<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.439> inside

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
it's very slick and smooth on the inside

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.899 
it's very slick and smooth on the inside
edge<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.310> car<00:03:08.209> definitely<00:03:08.599> needs<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:09.909> minimum

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
edge so car definitely needs a minimum

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.759 
edge so car definitely needs a minimum
two<00:03:11.209> rear<00:03:11.480> tires<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.139> Front's<00:03:12.500> are<00:03:12.590> not

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
two rear tires and the Front's are not

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.010 
two rear tires and the Front's are not
much<00:03:12.980> better
