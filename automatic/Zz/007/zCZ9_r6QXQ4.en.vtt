okay to use the bazooka oh it's an air

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.170 
okay to use the bazooka oh it's an air
pressure<00:03:12.920> demonstration<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:13.880> if<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.030> take

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
pressure demonstration so if you take

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.420 
pressure demonstration so if you take
the<00:03:14.270> ball<00:03:14.420> sneak<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.260> there<00:03:15.290> all<00:03:16.040> right<00:03:16.160> try

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
the ball sneak it in there all right try

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.190 
the ball sneak it in there all right try
to<00:03:16.460> seal<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.940> down<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.390> see<00:03:17.540> how<00:03:17.570> high<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:17.960> can
