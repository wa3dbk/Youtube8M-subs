against<00:01:17.700> friends<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.150> well<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.500> i<00:01:19.530> don't

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
against friends as well so that i don't

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.590 
against friends as well so that i don't
think<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:19.950> counts<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.400> record<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.360> let's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600

finish<00:04:27.569> our<00:04:27.719> up<00:04:27.900> top<00:04:28.229> so<00:04:29.129> that's<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.699> first

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
finish our up top so that's the first

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.939 
finish our up top so that's the first
striker<00:04:30.539> and<00:04:30.930> as<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.229> can<00:04:31.379> probably<00:04:31.409> see<00:04:31.740> the

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
striker and as you can probably see the

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.489 
striker and as you can probably see the
second<00:04:32.550> striker<00:04:32.819> is<00:04:33.090> Podolski<00:04:33.810> I<00:04:33.990> haven't

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:34.499 
second striker is Podolski I haven't

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.200 
second striker is Podolski I haven't
used<00:04:34.680> podolsky<00:04:35.159> this<00:04:35.310> year<00:04:35.460> but<00:04:35.639> I<00:04:35.669> decided<00:04:35.999> to

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
used podolsky this year but I decided to

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.159 
used podolsky this year but I decided to
just<00:04:36.240> because<00:04:36.599> I've<00:04:36.719> heard<00:04:36.870> great<00:04:37.050> things

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
just because I've heard great things

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.290 
just because I've heard great things
about<00:04:37.469> his<00:04:37.740> left<00:04:37.979> foot<00:04:38.129> and<00:04:38.249> I<00:04:38.400> suppose<00:04:39.029> it<00:04:39.180> is

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
about his left foot and I suppose it is

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.689 
about his left foot and I suppose it is
