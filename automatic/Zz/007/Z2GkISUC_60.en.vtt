00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.140
 good afternoon, today we are going to prepare 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.040
 a chicken grenadine 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:14.100
 for the guarantee of edit 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:18.650
 a farce eggs and can boned 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.560
 bean carrot celery 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.080
 for cooking for the talks of the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.349
 farce we use a hash of 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.710
 vegetables for I also know the farce 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.030
 it is generally used of the meat of 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.780
 web of everything is even more beef veal 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.059
 more meats already 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.360
 for the preparation of this we take the 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.410
 chicken 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.340
 beautifully 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 bone 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:57.090
 the farce already previously list we took it 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.260
 and we give it a cylinder shape 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.260
 this in order 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.180
 and our rolled chicken 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.320
 we open small incisions 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.220
 to introduce our eggs the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 Eggs are usually placed whole 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.740
 because they do not split so that at the time of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.650
 split our chicken guarantee those do not 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.900
 undergo a transformation 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.770
 we close our club our our 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.450
 phase 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.390
 but month of the false 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.939
 we closed our farce and started 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.840
 introduce our vegetables that 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.600
 previously they were bleached 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.270
 and cut into sticks this we do 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.079
 so introducing them in the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.079
 composed as such 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.620
 it was attributed to the chef marquÃ©s de 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.870
 white bar 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.710
 is 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.290
 Garanti na 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.350
 of chicken can also be 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.600
 make of vegetables or fish in your 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.319
 point after introducing the vegetables 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.400
 we continue 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.709
 to close our galantine 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.709
 we take the upper ends 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.090
 always giving it a cylindrical shape 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.630
 we take filipe 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.110
 with which we are going to roll up rolled 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.780
 after this we take a mesh that in 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.620
 this case is in the most practical way 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.360
 We can introduce our guarantee 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.360
 to give you more 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.950
 give more texture 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.950
 as a pact 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.330
 right after that guarantee is 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.840
 made and wrapped in the we call a 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.400
 short bath 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.189
 and I talked to him possible to find sides 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.860
 for about three hours for 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.460
 roll our galantina we go the mini 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.170
 p 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:27.270
 we go around 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.270
 in a very sustained way 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.480
 always looking for that it is not us 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.920
 leave your 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.920
 its composed as a tanger 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.040
 after being 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.820
 in return 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.450
 cylindrical shape this is the party the 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.990
 way that the guarantee to keep 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.990
 we take the mesh 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.519
 and we introduce our grace 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.920
 at that point we were able to tie 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.320
 and sustain and give strength so that 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.360
 be sure have that form means 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.360
 the most ideal way 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.490
 we tied with force 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.860
 and texture 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.330
 we have a bathroom with scissors 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.590
 and we cut 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.610
 this part safe 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:00.270
 realistic our guarantee we take it to 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.810
 a short bath to process it I have a 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.810
 short sleep 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.199
 but nuanced 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.199
 I'm going to introduce our canteen 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.350
 we cover 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.600
 for three hours approximately 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.090
 temperature is going to be checking 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.050
 with a thermometer until it reaches 85 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.050
 degrees Celsius
