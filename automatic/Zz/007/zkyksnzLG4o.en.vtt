00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello everyone today we are going to make chocolates 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.849
 of eyes for halloween ingredients that 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.800
 we will need to do the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 chocolates are white chocolate and the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.100
 little house here we have the lacasitos and the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.390
 chocolate coverage 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.620
 The first thing we are going to do is fungible 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.620
 the chocolate in the microwave 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.850
 then we cast melted chocolate 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.660
 in the hemisphere mold 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.660
 and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.410
 ah 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.420
 at the time of throwing it we cover the base and 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.740
 all the contour leaving the space 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.740
 enough to fill it 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:14.690
 then let it cool in the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.810
 freezer for about 10 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.810
 minutes 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.340
 now we fill the chocolates with the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.090
 cottage in my case as the seed 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.080
 They are small 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.080
 I had to chop what 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.090
 do not 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.490
 Y 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.960
 and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.149
 then we put an ounce of chocolate 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 white on top and we left with coverage 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.560
 melted with the help of a sleeve 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.560
 pastry 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.299
 now let it cool the freezer 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.299
 for about 10 minutes 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 to decorate the sheet we will need 40 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.530
 grams of rust leysin powder water 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.360
 black and red blue coloring and heifers 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.360
 of the number 805 and 12 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.650
 and there are the 20 grams of royal there's zinc 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:23.189
 Another 20 grams of royal and zinc water 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.069
 the blue dye the black dye the 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.849
 red coloring the mouthpiece 12 and the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.849
 of 8 105 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.150
 mixing the royal there is zinc with 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.390
 approximately one and a half tablespoons of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.390
 Water 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.860
 the royal is undone at its point 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.900
 when leaving it with the spoon 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.150
 disappears the way he does in five 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.170
 seconds that is to say it takes five seconds 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.170
 in homogenize I know 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.220
 once we have the bike bike rolled 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.230
 we incorporate the coloring in one 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.230
 we will put the black and in the other the cover 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.810
 now we take the chocolates out of the mold and 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.810
 we remove the remaining edges 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.150
 ah 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:58.160
 then with the help of the 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.160
 nozzles we mark the pupil and when going 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.160
 Then with the help of a toothpick 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.690
 that we have removed the tip 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.220
 we started by painting the pupil with the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.760
 royal and without black 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.760
 Y 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 Y 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.910
 com 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.410
 and let dry at room temperature 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.560
 the pupil for 30 minutes 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.560
 approximately 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.810
 As you can see, I could make the pupils more 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.370
 large or smaller 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.240
 the next step is to paint the iris with 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.240
 the royal and without blue 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.320
 to me 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.580
 dry bed temperature lilly 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.409
 environment for about 30 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.419
 minutes 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.019
 finally we paint the veins of the eye 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.019
 with red coloring 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.009
 As you can see here, you have a delicious and 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.009
 original chocolates for halloween 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.060
