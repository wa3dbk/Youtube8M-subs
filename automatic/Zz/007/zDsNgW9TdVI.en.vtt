one<00:00:01.199> person<00:00:01.589> in<00:00:01.709> comment<00:00:02.070> though<00:00:02.220> did<00:00:02.460> say<00:00:02.639> he

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
one person in comment though did say he

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.760 
one person in comment though did say he
actually<00:00:03.149> did<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.419> math<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:04.380> it<00:00:04.500> looks<00:00:04.710> like

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
actually did the math and it looks like

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.579 
actually did the math and it looks like
the<00:00:04.980> death<00:00:05.190> effect<00:00:05.520> takes<00:00:05.759> off<00:00:06.259> 75%<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.379> their

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
the death effect takes off 75% of their

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.730 
the death effect takes off 75% of their
remaining<00:00:07.980> hit<00:00:08.309> points<00:00:09.230> so<00:00:10.230> they<00:00:10.380> may<00:00:10.530> have

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
remaining hit points so they may have

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.999 
remaining hit points so they may have
10,000<00:00:11.670> max<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.540> only<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:12.929> 4,000<00:00:13.889> hit

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
10,000 max but we only have 4,000 hit

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.180 
10,000 max but we only have 4,000 hit
points<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.880> left<00:00:15.379> death<00:00:16.379> effect<00:00:16.740> will<00:00:16.949> do

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
points of that left death effect will do

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.090 
points of that left death effect will do
3000<00:00:18.180> damage<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.990> maybe<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.350> should<00:00:19.680> set

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100

there<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:43.980> infection<00:00:44.550> rates<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.820> little

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
there we are infection rates a little

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.850 
there we are infection rates a little
worse<00:00:45.180> I'm<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.570> solid<00:00:46.110> green<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> little

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
bit of yellow in the middle I think that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.990 
bit of yellow in the middle I think that
mine<00:00:49.050> means<00:00:49.320> my<00:00:49.559> infection<00:00:49.860> rate<00:00:50.220> is<00:00:50.370> at<00:00:51.230> 30%

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
mine means my infection rate is at 30%

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.579 
mine means my infection rate is at 30%
maybe<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.350> don't<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.589> don't<00:00:55.949> honestly<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
maybe I don't know I don't honestly I

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.020 
maybe I don't know I don't honestly I
tend<00:00:58.589> I<00:00:58.739> try<00:00:59.040> not<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> high<00:00:59.790> in<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
tend I try not to get that high in the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.400 
tend I try not to get that high in the
infection<00:01:00.449> rate<00:01:00.480> anyway<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.290> I<00:01:01.620> don't<00:01:02.160> know<00:01:02.280> I

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
infection rate anyway so I don't know I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.899 
infection rate anyway so I don't know I
could<00:01:04.410> check<00:01:04.769> if<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.040> wanted<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.790> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
could check if I wanted to but that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.050 
could check if I wanted to but that
