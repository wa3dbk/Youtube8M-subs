 overweight from the head weight loss center 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.950
 Dr. Bormental 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.950
 because 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 and now you see here now 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.630
 clean table and since many of us 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.840
 many have already gone through fire and water and copper 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.949
 pipes experienced a lot of diets then 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.410
 such a word as a medical quote 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.750
 fasting she sometimes sounds and still 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.820
 so far loud enough and today I 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 I want to just talk about 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.390
 therapeutic fasting 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.489
 wife do you ever dobbi goal i'm sure 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 that you had alienated me so yes I 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.620
 it seems that you have definitely gone through everything 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.300
 different yes then I was young I was exactly 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.160
 a week of the city of lodz and the case is only on 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 water you know what happens to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.739
 by the human body when it starts 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.899
 starve 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.300
 well now i know let me tell you 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.680
 details Tresa certainly interesting but 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.699
 Imagine 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.250
 human body it is balanced and in 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.020
 it all has its meaning and suddenly you're on 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.200
 he collapses this state 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.869
 starvation what happens the human brain 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.020
 can not be without glucose approximately 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.850
 7 8 minutes hypoglycemia occurs and for 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 order to get this glucose 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.479
 begins to split years and own 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 body squirrels 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.950
 there are such a glitch individual amino acids 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 from which he can get glucose 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.960
 but the rest are pieces of protein somewhere 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.990
 disappear they decompose and form 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.270
 such acetone bad breath from the skin and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.520
 here are the medical starvation professionals 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.290
 doctors they always clearly feels he 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.390
 enters the room if the patient does not 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.900
 smells like acetone and that means you are somewhere along 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.980
 move understandably meaning you start 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.350
 each yourself 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.850
 Shoot your own body cells that 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.490
 cells in the human body are constantly 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.410
 Thousands of cells are updated every day 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.960
 born thousands updated 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.660
 they are building material you have 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.730
 building and building material is not 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.070
 what makes the body starts good 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.710
 disrupt neighboring house neighboring body 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.830
 liver cells intestinal cells from this 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.700
 the material begins to build your home 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.070
 new organism turns out what you eat 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 actually speak themselves and it 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.270
 called healing to improve 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.130
 healthier starvation but it is clear that 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.030
 no 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.570
 healthy effect but not here 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.960
 maybe there is a feeling of lightness of euphoria 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.820
 which comes for you on the third day 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.520
 after a long break when you 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.170
 tormented for three days they altered that year on 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.210
 third day lightness and spotlight 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.670
 it is due to the fact that the blood 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.100
 poisons and toxins from these 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.070
 pieces of building materials cells and 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.350
 these poisons poison your body and here 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.190
 this headlight sensation is associated with toxication 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.540
 of the body 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.390
 you understand, yes, the rules for those who 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.870
 losing weight long fasting leads to 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.750
 body poisoning 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.069
 overweight from the head weight loss center 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.909
 Dr. Bormental 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.909
 because 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.860
 farther your 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.810
 the organism is rebuilt and start 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.790
 to work in an entirely different mode and 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.130
 then you quit hunger 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.100
 and again everything in the body turns and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.140
 such fasting is not fasting leads to 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.910
 destruction of all lipid mechanics 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.190
 which you have in the whole body 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.050
 hormonal system it turns out that it 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.870
 a big strange organism is not only 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.840
 great stress this and enormous harm 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.630
 for your body fasting can 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.910
 treat autoimmune diseases for example 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.380
 bronchial asthma rolls more diseases 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.380
 which is associated with the immune system but 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.220
 fasting can never be treated 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.950
 obesity 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.230
 I ask you to take a notebook and write down 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:58.590
 in the main rule of the day 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.510
 fasting can not be treated obesity further 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.820
 happens more interesting when you 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.320
 fast 10 12 hours 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.880
 your body remembers this function and 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.940
 begins to produce such an enzyme with 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.570
 a terrible name like that 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.140
 lipoprotein cinema for 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.049
 and this is either a protein kinase is responsible for 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.810
 the fact that all you do not eat further 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.210
 will be transformed again into fats and you 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.370
 after this fasting course you will 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.530
 to gain weight even from a leaf of lettuce and 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.260
 when people come to our clinic 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.140
 who have gone so fast to 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.300
 lose weight we even stop this weight not 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.370
 can they gain this colossal weight 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.100
 the strength of the task we at least keep this 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.760
 weight you know how bad it is 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.960
 that is, well, it is impossible to starve and lose weight 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.960
 it is necessary to understand and accept 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.800
 lasso but there you have it 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.740
 therapeutic fasting 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.500
 who came up with a vampire or doctors but for 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.199
 treating certain diseases they for 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.419
 slimming treatments certain 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.009
 diseases of autoimmune diseases 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.380
 sight 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.330
 bronchial asthma but by no means 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.580
 never shive ever therapeutic fasting 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.979
 not used to treat obesity 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.800
 what about rough days rough 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.590
 saying that itâ€™s impossible to starve for three days 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.050
 it can be a bad day at all 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.330
 done once and fasting day 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.849
 needed when before it was bootable 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.310
 day for example i passed new year 5 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.509
 give a holiday belly and the next 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.270
 day you feel that all new 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.340
 intestine is full of food for days where 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.199
 there still have you here need to do 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.389
 fasting day to unload 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:42.370
 not an organism from extra cells but 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.770
 unload proper intestines this 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.960
 normal and plum fasting days go 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.270
 for weeks this is the very thing 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.639
 starvation from which then as 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:58.539
 the rebound will only draw water 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:01.449
 I'm starving that everyone understands everything and we donâ€™t 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.599
 We are starving for what is not said of course I 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:08.800
 proudly there is a question for what period 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:10.630
 time is not dangerous not to eat food but 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.000
 10 hours while you sleep 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.419
 it's not dangerous but you are even at bedtime and 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.639
 give proteins 2 egg whites these 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.599
 proteins are these amino acids that 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.849
 contain protein 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:24.250
 they support your cells which 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:26.530
 At night, too, they fall apart 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.150
 utayki holes and you do not lose muscle 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.270
 mass and why do we need muscle 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.820
 masses for burning fat 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.490
 3-4 grapes of bananas except plum grapes 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.320
 Unlimited vegetables are very fond of 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.900
 repeat the phrase that said his 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.600
 time academician pokrovsky our food 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.330
 everything must be balanced 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.530
 forget the end of the phrase it should 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.740
 be balanced for each patient 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.500
 excess weight
