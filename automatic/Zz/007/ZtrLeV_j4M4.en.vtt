made avalanche finally for all these
years<00:01:13.220> alright<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.369> break<00:01:14.580> point<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
years alright so break point is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
years alright so break point is
definitely<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> largest<00:01:16.380> map<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> noble

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
definitely the largest map in the noble

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
definitely the largest map in the noble
map<00:01:17.400> pack<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:18.090> designed<00:01:18.270> primarily<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
map pack it's designed primarily for the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
map pack it's designed primarily for the
invasion<00:01:19.619> game<00:01:19.950> type<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.970> also<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.390> used

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
invasion game type but will also be used

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
invasion game type but will also be used
in<00:01:21.960> big<00:01:22.170> team<00:01:22.350> battle<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> challenges

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
in big team battle one of the challenges

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.910 
in big team battle one of the challenges
on<00:01:23.850> these<00:01:24.000> maps<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:25.080> having<00:01:25.350> them<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.650> as

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
on these maps just having them be as

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
on these maps just having them be as
large<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.369> they<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> lot

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
large as they are is that you get a lot

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
large as they are is that you get a lot
of<00:01:28.400> viewpoints<00:01:29.400> where<00:01:29.549> you're<00:01:29.640> looking<00:01:29.759> back

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
of viewpoints where you're looking back

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
of viewpoints where you're looking back
across<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> map<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.049> we're<00:01:31.229> constantly

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
across the map and so we're constantly

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.219 
across the map and so we're constantly
having<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.979> balance<00:01:32.189> memory<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.270> budgets<00:01:34.020> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
having to balance memory and budgets to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.600 
having to balance memory and budgets to
give<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> same<00:01:34.680> level<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.040> fidelity<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
give the same level of fidelity that you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.740 
give the same level of fidelity that you
get<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> smaller<00:01:36.150> map<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.570> think

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
get in a smaller map and I think

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.609 
get in a smaller map and I think
especially<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.320> when<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> have

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
especially like when you have

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.560 
especially like when you have
architectural<00:01:38.220> elements<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.640> buildings<00:01:39.030> on

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
architectural elements like buildings on

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
architectural elements like buildings on
a<00:01:39.630> large<00:01:39.840> map<00:01:40.140> think<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.680> becomes<00:01:40.799> even<00:01:41.040> more

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
a large map think it becomes even more

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.789 
a large map think it becomes even more
of<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> problem<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:42.030> terrain<00:01:42.689> allows<00:01:43.470> me<00:01:43.680> so

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
of a problem this terrain allows me so

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
of a problem this terrain allows me so
detailed<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.909> human<00:01:45.750> skill

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
detailed and you see like a human skill

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.270 
detailed and you see like a human skill
building<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.680> expect<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.189> a

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
building you expect there to be a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.620 
building you expect there to be a
certain<00:01:47.460> level<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.790> detail<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.210> other<00:01:48.360> words<00:01:48.570> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
certain level of detail in other words I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.210 
certain level of detail in other words I
got<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> easy<00:01:48.990> job<00:01:49.140> no<00:01:51.770> this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> way<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
got the easy job no this is the way to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550 
got the easy job no this is the way to
do<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.240> visual<00:01:54.630> look<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> entire

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
do of the visual look of the entire

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.109 
do of the visual look of the entire
level<00:01:55.770> kind<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.070> rested<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.399> racial<00:01:56.850> ders<00:01:57.000> as

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
level kind of rested on racial ders as

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
level kind of rested on racial ders as
far<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> train<00:01:57.719> goes<00:01:57.750> absolutely<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
far as the train goes absolutely the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.319 
far as the train goes absolutely the
train<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> definitely<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.670> hero<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.119> map

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
train is definitely the hero this map

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.539 
train is definitely the hero this map
yeah<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> from<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.290> high<00:02:01.469> level<00:02:01.770> design<00:02:02.340> goal

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
yeah and from a high level design goal

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.389 
yeah and from a high level design goal
was<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.969> make<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.960> an<00:02:04.170> invasion<00:02:04.439> map<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
was to make in this an invasion map that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.730 
was to make in this an invasion map that
is<00:02:05.729> big<00:02:06.149> enough<00:02:06.180> for<00:02:06.420> invasion<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.619> we

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
is big enough for invasion but that we

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.979 
is big enough for invasion but that we
use<00:02:07.979> more<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> space<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.330> there's<00:02:09.599> some

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
use more of the space so there's some

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.390 
use more of the space so there's some
cool<00:02:10.140> circuits<00:02:10.649> through<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.039> for

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
cool circuits through it for

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.039 
cool circuits through it for
Gekko<00:02:11.610> combat<00:02:12.060> yeah<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.569> definitely<00:02:12.720> want<00:02:13.019> to

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
Gekko combat yeah we definitely want to

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.420 
Gekko combat yeah we definitely want to
be<00:02:13.200> make<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.620> where<00:02:13.769> you<00:02:13.890> could<00:02:14.040> still<00:02:14.250> drive

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
be make it where you could still drive

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.100 
be make it where you could still drive
around<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.879> fun<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.360> actually<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.870> enough

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
around have fun and actually have enough

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.179 
around have fun and actually have enough
space<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.680> don't<00:02:16.829> feel<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:16.980> you're

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
space that you don't feel like you're

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:18.319 
space that you don't feel like you're
getting<00:02:17.220> cramped<00:02:17.730> or<00:02:17.819> you're<00:02:17.939> running<00:02:18.180> into

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
getting cramped or you're running into

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.839 
getting cramped or you're running into
anything<00:02:18.599> that's<00:02:18.810> going<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.110> slow<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.739> down

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
anything that's going to slow you down

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.819 
anything that's going to slow you down
there<00:02:20.849> are<00:02:21.000> plenty<00:02:21.420> vehicles<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.379> elites<00:02:22.590> get

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
there are plenty vehicles the elites get

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.759 
there are plenty vehicles the elites get
ghost<00:02:23.340> some<00:02:23.579> old<00:02:23.879> rates<00:02:24.329> with<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> banshee<00:02:25.470> in

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
ghost some old rates with a banshee in

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.759 
ghost some old rates with a banshee in
the<00:02:25.860> third<00:02:26.069> phase<00:02:26.310> while<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.659> Spartans<00:02:28.170> get

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
the third phase while the Spartans get

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.759 
the third phase while the Spartans get
the<00:02:28.950> Falcon<00:02:29.220> as<00:02:29.640> well<00:02:30.180> as<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> rocket<00:02:30.870> hog<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.470> a

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
the Falcon as well as a rocket hog and a

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.429 
the Falcon as well as a rocket hog and a
standard<00:02:32.459> warthog<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.659> rocket<00:02:34.019> hog<00:02:34.140> makes

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
standard warthog the rocket hog makes

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.550 
standard warthog the rocket hog makes
its<00:02:34.620> Tramp<00:02:34.950> matchmaking<00:02:35.790> debut<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.840> invasion

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
its Tramp matchmaking debut and invasion

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.800 
its Tramp matchmaking debut and invasion
it's<00:02:37.890> been<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.220> forge<00:02:38.459> world<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.599> just

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it's been in forge world but it's just

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.569 
it's been in forge world but it's just
too<00:02:39.870> much<00:02:40.079> fun<00:02:40.260> actually<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.189> of<00:02:41.280> all<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
too much fun actually out of all the

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.289 
too much fun actually out of all the
like<00:02:42.450> large-scale<00:02:43.319> big<00:02:43.560> teen<00:02:43.739> Style<00:02:44.099> maps<00:02:44.970> I

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
like large-scale big teen Style maps I

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.330 
like large-scale big teen Style maps I
think<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.599> one's<00:02:45.810> my<00:02:45.870> favorite<00:02:46.170> for<00:02:46.379> aerial

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
think this one's my favorite for aerial

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.789 
think this one's my favorite for aerial
combat<00:02:47.489> between<00:02:47.909> like<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:49.319> Banshee<00:02:49.680> in

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
combat between like the the Banshee in

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.220 
combat between like the the Banshee in
the<00:02:49.950> Falcon<00:02:50.519> definitely<00:02:51.239> alright<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:51.900> in

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the Falcon definitely alright so in

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.140 
the Falcon definitely alright so in
breakpoint<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:53.069> elites<00:02:53.489> are<00:02:53.700> trying<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
breakpoint the elites are trying to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.229 
breakpoint the elites are trying to
basically<00:02:55.079> get<00:02:55.470> at<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> UNSC<00:02:56.310> science

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
basically get at the UNSC science

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.210 
basically get at the UNSC science
installation<00:02:57.930> Spartans<00:02:58.530> don't<00:02:58.739> want<00:02:58.889> that<00:02:59.040> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
installation Spartans don't want that to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.039 
installation Spartans don't want that to
happen<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.579> course<00:02:59.609> I<00:03:00.090> think<00:03:00.629> it's<00:03:00.750> also<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
happen of course I think it's also the

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.589 
happen of course I think it's also the
first<00:03:01.079> time<00:03:01.409> we've<00:03:01.530> seen<00:03:01.709> like<00:03:02.299> UNSC<00:03:03.299> really

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
first time we've seen like UNSC really

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.539 
first time we've seen like UNSC really
tapping<00:03:03.870> into<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.319> forerunner<00:03:04.650> stuff<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:05.370> far

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
tapping into the forerunner stuff as far

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.619 
tapping into the forerunner stuff as far
as<00:03:05.609> fiction<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.090> stuff<00:03:06.239> like<00:03:06.329> that<00:03:06.389> you've

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
as fiction and stuff like that you've

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.539 
as fiction and stuff like that you've
never<00:03:06.689> really<00:03:06.840> seen<00:03:06.959> any<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.069> UNSC

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
never really seen any kind of like UNSC

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.729 
never really seen any kind of like UNSC
this<00:03:09.120> close<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.019> forerunner<00:03:10.349> except<00:03:10.709> for

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
this close to the forerunner except for

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.250 
this close to the forerunner except for
like<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.129> Oni<00:03:11.280> buildings<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.329> whatnot<00:03:12.599> also

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
like the Oni buildings and whatnot also

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.720 
like the Oni buildings and whatnot also
fictionally<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.189> is<00:03:14.340> all<00:03:14.489> tied

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
fictionally this is this is all tied

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.879 
fictionally this is this is all tied
into<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.209> Oni<00:03:15.480> base<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:16.379> is<00:03:16.500> basically<00:03:16.769> like

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
into the Oni base this is basically like

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.189 
into the Oni base this is basically like
another<00:03:17.190> it's<00:03:17.699> basically<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.030> site<00:03:18.299> B<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:19.019> that

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
another it's basically a site B to that

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.009 
another it's basically a site B to that
this<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:19.949> where<00:03:20.129> they<00:03:20.599> siphon<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.690> beautiful

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
this is where they siphon the beautiful

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.930 
this is where they siphon the beautiful
science<00:03:22.410> out<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.829> forerunner<00:03:23.489> structure

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
science out of the forerunner structure

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.309 
science out of the forerunner structure
yeah<00:03:24.299> this<00:03:24.540> one<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.780> really<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.049> I<00:03:25.139> guess

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
yeah this one that really like I guess

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.689 
yeah this one that really like I guess
Roger<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:25.799> how<00:03:25.889> he<00:03:25.949> made<00:03:26.099> science<00:03:26.489> into<00:03:26.669> a

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
Roger that's how he made science into a

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.869 
Roger that's how he made science into a
noun<00:03:26.959> exactly<00:03:27.959> now<00:03:28.139> still<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.680> science<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
noun exactly now still in science it

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.559 
noun exactly now still in science it
knows<00:03:30.060> what's<00:03:30.389> unknown<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.909> concrete<00:03:33.359> no

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
knows what's unknown it's a concrete no
