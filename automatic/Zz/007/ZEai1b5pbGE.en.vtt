we'd<00:00:01.469> like<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.740> demonstrate<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.490> technology

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
we'd like to demonstrate the technology

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.050 
we'd like to demonstrate the technology
of<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.360> safe<00:00:03.570> key<00:00:03.840> system<00:00:04.730> once<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.850> have<00:00:05.970> the
