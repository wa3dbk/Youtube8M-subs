Cinema Camera
I<00:00:43.739> needed<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.820> EDF<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.719> had<00:00:45.899> SD<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:47.629> otherwise

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
I needed an EDF that had SD I otherwise

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.910 
I needed an EDF that had SD I otherwise
I'd<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.200> some<00:00:49.320> sort<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> converter

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
I'd have to get some sort of converter

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.650 
I'd have to get some sort of converter
and<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.280> want<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:51.149> another<00:00:51.390> piece<00:00:51.629> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and you want to have another piece of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.500 
and you want to have another piece of
gear<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> kind<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.800> all<00:00:53.010> built-in<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:54.390> at

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
gear this is kind of all built-in but at

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
gear this is kind of all built-in but at
the<00:00:54.570> same<00:00:54.719> time<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.170> still<00:00:55.260> has<00:00:55.469> HDMI<00:00:55.980> input<00:00:56.340> so

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the same time it still has HDMI input so

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.729 
the same time it still has HDMI input so
it<00:00:56.730> still<00:00:56.940> works<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.329> any<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:57.660> DSLRs<00:00:58.469> even

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it still works with any of my DSLRs even

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.400 
it still works with any of my DSLRs even
something<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.280> gh3<00:01:00.140> whatever<00:01:01.140> so

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
something like the gh3 whatever so

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.979 
something like the gh3 whatever so
there's<00:01:01.559> HDMI<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.219> SDI<00:01:02.969> N<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.870> actually

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
there's HDMI in SDI N and it actually

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.500 
there's HDMI in SDI N and it actually
has<00:01:04.290> SDI<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> pass<00:01:05.909> through<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
has SDI out which is a pass through I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.770 
has SDI out which is a pass through I
haven't<00:01:07.439> tried<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:07.979> supposedly<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.420> will

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
haven't tried it but supposedly it will

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.670 
haven't tried it but supposedly it will
do<00:01:09.960> HDMI<00:01:10.590> HDMI<00:01:10.640> in<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.000> pass<00:01:12.479> through<00:01:12.689> SDI<00:01:13.320> so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
do HDMI HDMI in and pass through SDI so

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
do HDMI HDMI in and pass through SDI so
it's<00:01:13.830> kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.610> converter<00:01:15.030> there

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it's kind of a little converter there

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
it's kind of a little converter there
for<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.780> well<00:01:16.009> there<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.040> optional

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
for you as well there are optional

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.060 
for you as well there are optional
battery<00:01:18.180> plates<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.810> work<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.409> they

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
battery plates that work with this they

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.070 
battery plates that work with this they
do<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> bag<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
do have that in the bag here I have a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.600 
do have that in the bag here I have a
Canon<00:01:22.500> lp6<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:24.570> does<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.400> external<00:01:26.400> power

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
Canon lp6 it does have a external power

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.929 
Canon lp6 it does have a external power
here<00:01:27.000> for<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.330> DTaP<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> jog<00:01:29.729> dial

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
here for like DTaP you have a jog dial

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.520 
here for like DTaP you have a jog dial
that<00:01:30.210> gets<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> menu<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.380> can

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that gets you in the menu and you can

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
that gets you in the menu and you can
depress<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.130> jog<00:01:32.340> dial<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:32.939> similar<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
depress that jog dial so it's similar to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.359 
depress that jog dial so it's similar to
some<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> other<00:01:33.960> EVF<00:01:34.350> sout<00:01:34.530> there<00:01:34.740> there's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
some of the other EVF sout there there's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.609 
some of the other EVF sout there there's
four<00:01:35.970> buttons<00:01:36.329> here<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.960> programmable

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
four buttons here that are programmable

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.130 
four buttons here that are programmable
so<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.299> use<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.600> many<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
so you can use it for many of the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.690 
so you can use it for many of the
different<00:01:40.409> features<00:01:40.560> typically<00:01:41.520> you're

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
different features typically you're

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.330 
different features typically you're
using<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.119> focus<00:01:42.720> peaking<00:01:42.930> false-color<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
using like focus peaking false-color and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.940 
using like focus peaking false-color and
you<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.030> uh<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:45.990> one-to-one<00:01:46.530> pixel

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you know uh you know one-to-one pixel

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.850 
you know uh you know one-to-one pixel
mapping<00:01:47.790> there's<00:01:48.570> headphone<00:01:48.960> outs<00:01:49.229> too<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
mapping there's headphone outs too so

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.850 
mapping there's headphone outs too so
you<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.100> monitor<00:01:50.579> from<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.140> on

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
you can monitor from here as well so on

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249 
you can monitor from here as well so on
the<00:01:53.100> loop<00:01:53.490> portion<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> blue

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the loop portion of this I put a blue

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.249 
the loop portion of this I put a blue
star<00:01:55.470> cushion<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:57.659> doesn't<00:01:57.960> come<00:01:58.110> with

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
star cushion but this doesn't come with

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.219

this<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.710> Anti<00:01:59.280> Fog<00:01:59.630> there's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> few<00:02:00.899> ports

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
this it is Anti Fog there's a few ports

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.740 
this it is Anti Fog there's a few ports
here<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.619> let<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.890> eye<00:02:01.920> breathe<00:02:02.600> but<00:02:03.600> once

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
here that let your eye breathe but once

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.999 
here that let your eye breathe but once
you<00:02:03.840> put<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.049> blue<00:02:04.259> star<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.530> kind<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.740> covers

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
you put the blue star it kind of covers

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.130 
you put the blue star it kind of covers
that<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:05.850> anyways<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.360> haven't<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.110> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that up so but anyways I haven't had a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.529 
that up so but anyways I haven't had a
problem<00:02:07.350> with<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> fogging<00:02:08.239> there<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.479> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
problem with the fogging there is a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.589 
problem with the fogging there is a
diopter<00:02:10.349> here<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.790> there<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.330> additional

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
diopter here and there are additional

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.910 
diopter here and there are additional
frames<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.260> come<00:02:13.470> with

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
frames that come with

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.559 
frames that come with
it's<00:02:14.040> oh<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.370> stack<00:02:14.700> frames<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
it's oh you can stack frames here and

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.140 
it's oh you can stack frames here and
that<00:02:15.660> gives<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> more<00:02:16.080> diopter<00:02:16.650> range<00:02:17.150> so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
that gives you more diopter range so

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.479 
that gives you more diopter range so
there<00:02:18.300> there<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.260> frames<00:02:19.530> there<00:02:19.890> now

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
there there are the frames there now

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.420 
there there are the frames there now
this<00:02:20.730> does<00:02:20.970> pop<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.190> if<00:02:23.340> you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
this does pop up just like that if you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.280 
this does pop up just like that if you
just<00:02:23.610> want<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> work<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.959> as<00:02:25.050> an<00:02:25.140> LCD

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
just want to work with it as an LCD

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
to work with that you know you're

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.300 
to work with that you know you're
working<00:02:43.860> indoors<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.670> don't<00:02:44.849> need<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.260> so

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
working indoors you don't need this so

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.250 
working indoors you don't need this so
that's<00:02:47.310> kind<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.819> real<00:02:48.330> quick<00:02:48.360> look<00:02:48.750> at<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.080> I

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that's kind of a real quick look at it I

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.470 
that's kind of a real quick look at it I
don't<00:02:50.160> want<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.340> really<00:02:50.519> jump<00:02:50.880> into<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.209> menu

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
don't want to really jump into the menu

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.090 
don't want to really jump into the menu
too<00:02:51.630> much<00:02:51.810> they<00:02:52.019> have<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> good<00:02:52.530> video<00:02:52.920> online

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
too much they have a good video online

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.070 
too much they have a good video online
that's<00:02:53.519> going<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.730> show<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:53.940> how<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.720> use<00:02:54.930> this

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
that's going to show you how to use this

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.630 
that's going to show you how to use this
thing<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.650> everything<00:02:56.370> that's<00:02:56.519> available

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
thing and everything that's available

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.690 
thing and everything that's available
but<00:02:57.630> basically<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.230> do<00:02:58.530> get<00:02:58.799> your<00:02:58.890> waveforms

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
but basically you do get your waveforms

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.259 
but basically you do get your waveforms
you<00:03:00.390> see<00:03:00.780> your<00:03:00.930> left<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.290> right<00:03:01.470> up<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.799> down

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
you see your left and right up and down

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.009 
you see your left and right up and down

there's<00:03:04.410> tons<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.980> features<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.970> CBF<00:03:06.420> and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
there's tons of features in the CBF and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.270 
there's tons of features in the CBF and
it's<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.870> it's<00:03:07.410> well<00:03:07.650> worth<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.010> again

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
it's just it's well worth it again

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.789 
it's just it's well worth it again
