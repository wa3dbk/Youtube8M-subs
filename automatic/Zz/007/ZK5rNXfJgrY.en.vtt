00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.749
 How about friends and welcome to a new 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.039
 video the day vÃ©lez I bring a small 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.830
 tutorial on how to play in mode 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.540
 multiplayer and minecraft looking for it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.180
 so the first thing we have to do 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.580
 is to create a server or can be 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.070
 another world can be any world in 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.980
 actually all are servers themselves but 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 the difference not percent is that 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.570
 they have to give him pause and give him here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.489
 on server and it's visible because of what 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.730
 they will not be able to find their 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.739
 server to play online 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.330
 then the back to game version has 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 to give here the server and without seeing 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.019
 bowling so you can not see it and in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.839
 view just like if you can join with 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.510
 us this is for you to join this 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.460
 to our server at this time I 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.750
 I'm going to join from my phone I think 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.450
 I will be lost 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.730
 and the worst thing is that in survival 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.030
 so I looked at the beginning I guess it is 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.680
 over there over there 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.930
 well I think we have here what 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.210
 we will do in creative mode 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.730
 put here would be fine 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.730
 a creative way 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.970
 no, this is not my house, sorry 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.610
 that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 that a new contest I think here is 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.780
 you will find fast 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:31.040
 then we will appear d 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.350
 another one of that device on my server 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.090
 in this case it would be my iphone 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.280
 that then I'm going into that 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.990
 moment for being a house that builds 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.740
 the one that uses the dynamite 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.940
 yes very creative ok we already have my other 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.410
 I 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.610
 so to speak and that's how someone is 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.940
 can 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.260
 a leader to your server although in that 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.650
 moment I will show you how you can 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.110
 you are joining a server too 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.560
 what they have to do is practically 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.970
 the same only as in another way in the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.150
 other then in the will create your server 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.860
 be your world just to be clear 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.870
 Well, here he does not know 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.690
 we will not create if at that moment 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.410
 we will give join game 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.550
 and here we will have the 7 or the server 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.220
 the other person 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.830
 we'll do it there and that's how easy we are going to 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.470
 be playing in multiplayer mode in 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
 minecraft gration with other people and 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.740
 this would be all friends I hope there's 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.870
 liked do not forget to give it that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.700
