00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.639
 in a trance here at the top of the 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.550
 best girls and matrix in halo reach in 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.810
 halo 4 this time is volume 3 and then 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.039
 well, I recommend you stay with 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.380
 end of the video because there will be as a 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.230
 type in exchange for mechanics in this that is 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.640
 this tops will be doing the same 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.169
 label but good this I'm going to say 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.999
 at the end of the video so well then 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.999
 let's start with this top once 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.899
 in move number one we have blake 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.940
 or what is on the map of power house 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.890
 it ends up making a matrix here 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.239
 consists of a matrix with this red see 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.859
 that arrived not here down the stairs 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.629
 then it ends up being a third 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.659
 matrix as another arrives but does not pass 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.659
 nothing 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.550
 on move number 2 we have ninja 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.620
 ray that is on the countdown map 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.260
 grab throws egg happy makes a 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.550
 kind of ninja with the cannon then 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.410
 see that one comes again here I'm going to 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.390
 use the barrel and terminals being another 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.040
 ninja to this red sees that he won from behind 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.990
 of him ends up making him a ninja 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.850
 this blue then here we go to 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.920
 overtake the play a little then 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.660
 still has the cannon she said a lot 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.340
 then this termination of the here one 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.140
 ninja this blue see that and one here 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.140
 but nothing happens again 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.820
 this time we have a striped ninja is here 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.550

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.980
 peasant ninjas 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.210
 played the number 4 we have here sonic 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.250
 that makes a murder here is locked 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.680
 a little looks at it then ends up 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.659
 juliÃ¡n the subject here makes a kind 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.399
 of valve or matrix or do not know what stool 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.140
 I want to do a ninja and here 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.790
 It ends up being subject to an array of 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.280
 get their particular although they have not 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.720
 I was late nor did I wait very randomly 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.390
 the play 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.070
 this technically is not a ninja but 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.260
 I'm very bastard is murder that made 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.290
 ninja rays rises to the top of the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.700
 map goes with the backpack propeller 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.920
 then it rises is in the account 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.230
 regressive once one arrives here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.150
 ends up murdering the truth is not a 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.860
 ninja but he was very bastard the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.640
 murder and I like it and that's why I put it 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.640
 in this play 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.470
 in move number 6 we have ninja 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.210
 stone that is in a custom in 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.040
 custom then it goes spinning it goes spinning and 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.210
 it ends up falling here to a white one that 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.280
 it is on the top 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.870
 championing that percent thorn he used 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.850
 what is a bit modified and ends 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.420
 going around doing that 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.420
 murder 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.500
 in move number 7 we have onix 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.150
 ninja that makes a ninja 360 21 by the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.280
 back and ends up making him another ninja 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.720
 360 that the truth that I do not answer 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.720
 walking but net that he deserved 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.980
 play 8 is to confess on the map of 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.820

 ball here jumps and is a ninja 540 are 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.060
 his friends realize then ends 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.050
 making it an array of the subject 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.050
 getting his double 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.710
 on the move number 9 we have a star 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.150
 friends and that here makes a matrix of 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.610
 that arrived not here ends up being the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.080
 another matrix but here I do not understand how 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.180
 he was killed by the sword guy very 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.530
 clueless and see that a red comes 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.340
 here and it only does an action to everything 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.500
 to get his were kings 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.660
 we have blake or back on the map 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.879
 page short active mediation here 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.830
 makes a murder this red that came 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.349
 one up here tries to make a 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.730
 you kill but the guy is pretty stupid 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.590
 then he returns it and makes a 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.840
 matrix b that reaches one down here 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.760
 then it ends up making a matrix 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.290
 of subject b that reaches another red of 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.450
 new over here and he does a second 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.370
 matrix sees that the blues are 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.379
 directing on the left side does 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.100
 a matrix here and then the other is seen 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.530
 he really only killed him 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.840
 I ran out of the images played 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.030
 number one again then here is 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.160
 onyx ninja again this is our 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.930
 mark on a personalized map forgiveness 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.030
 here a matrix sees that one arrives 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.920
 with a sword here ends up being a 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.660
 matrix there is another with sword that comes 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.160
 for here then it ends up being another 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.500
 matrix but it was loaded because the 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.540
 truth murdered the nothing and are set 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.340
 all the matrices he made are not 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.650
 he counted I do not know why 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.690
 in the next play we have to itar 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.690
 friends and again it's here on a map 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.220
 of the match making on King of the Hill 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.620
 I think then ends up being here a 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.260
 line 540 this guy who was in the 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.210
 hill on the play to number 3 we have 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.010
 here to pulse a sumo bus I do not know how to 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.570
 pronounce that is on the map of 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.880
 invasion then your guest help 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.650
 with the cannon voice vox Felix I do not know 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.949
 how the truth is told and then the 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.690
 help you make your ninja 360 is the cabbage 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.880
 of play with shots of luck because the 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.400
 guy that he looked with the sniper in fact 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.250
 no you are not the one who killed it was one that 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.050
 he went away and his friend went 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.790
 here we have a time that the truth does not 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.220
 I know how to produce a gamertag but I 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.900

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.620
 here on the map of s'illot then it goes 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.120
 spinning around confessing that it reaches a 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.100
 blue below then it's in the 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.470

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.050
 that subject 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.930
 and here we have ninja pot that is 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.700
 on the silos map then what is going to 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.410
 to do is to use the webos elite spear 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.390
 then they see that one arrives here 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.270
 elevator has the ball and ends 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.960

 a matrix b that arrives red one here 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.810
 back then it ends up making it a 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.200
 matrix the same subject to get his 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.200
