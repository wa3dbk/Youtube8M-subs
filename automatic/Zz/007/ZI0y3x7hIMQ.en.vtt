00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.380
 hello I am a consultant Marcelo cristian 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.110
 development and we are 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.689
 here at the invitation of content to speak 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.680
 about hiring good professionals 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.680
 to your pharmacy 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.750
 Let's talk a little bit about how 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.360
 interview that candidate 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.380
 the first thing is to have a local 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.020
 suitable to meet these candidates 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.560
 I already saw the owner of pharmacy 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.080
 do interviews a standing stock 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.510
 You will not be able to know and 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.140
 recognize talents in this way 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.040
 separate a place a time turn off your 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.100
 cell phone 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.800
 stay tuned for that professional 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.410
 that is in front of you can be a 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.869
 person or a person who is going to 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.800
 bring harm to your faith but remain 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.440
 attentive 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.290
 the second tip tell a little about your 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.290
 make that wanted candidate 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.979
 work with you let the candidate 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.110
 Will offer you water and coffee and if he 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.850
 tense shows he wants only one 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.150
 job interview 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.860
 look into your eyes the eyes reveal 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.039
 much about who this person is - 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.100
 Listen, this is very important. 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.479
 and in the face of all these questions observe 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.420
 the behavior 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.350
 see how he talks to realize is 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.929
 lying, asking him to tell and observe 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.009
 how is your body this you will see 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:03.050
 which will also give you important tips before 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.080
 the ability to know if he knows 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.200
 whether or not he knows how to apply the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.900
 Do not check the behavior 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.540
 This is more important than the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.340
 abiliity 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.310
 sometimes we have doubts about the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.319
 questions to ask and all 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.950
 these questions 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.690
 ask open-ended questions for example and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.480
 tell an experience of a good 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.000
 that you did at your last meeting. 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.090
 job let the candidate talk 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.580
 The second question that I quit tipped 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.870
 for you what you need to 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.209
 work happy 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.760
 You know why this question because we 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.860
 we need happy employees 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.710
 imagine you hire an employee 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.530
 for service but he does not like 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.830
 people he complains about the customer he is evil 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.070
 and many candidates are like this. 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.150
 stay tuned another question what do you 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.690
 do not like what you like and leave it 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.180
 speech 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.110
 are simple questions but demonstrate 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.890
 a lot of what the candidate has to offer 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.820
 summarizing then during the interview 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.220
 note the character 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.980
 observe the skills and the more 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.880
 important to note if he is willing to 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.120
 learn 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.890
 many times we do not know everything but 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.670
 your candidate has the will to 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.490
 learn 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.690
 it will be a success in your company a lot 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.690
 Thank you and see you next time
