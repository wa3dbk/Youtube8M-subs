00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it just takes a little bit of practice

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.330 
it just takes a little bit of practice
of<00:01:28.890> course<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.570> everything<00:01:30.570> does<00:01:30.950> let's<00:01:31.950> begin

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
of course as everything does let's begin

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.180 
of course as everything does let's begin
it's<00:01:32.610> all<00:01:32.910> chords<00:01:33.479> all<00:01:33.990> chords<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.800> just<00:01:35.009> have

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
it's all chords all chords you just have

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.820 
it's all chords all chords you just have
to<00:01:35.280> change<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.970> chord<00:01:36.270> every<00:01:36.690> half<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.320> second<00:01:37.680> or

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
to change a chord every half a second or

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:49.120 
to change a chord every half a second or
so<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.850> begins<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:47.240> okay<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
so so it begins like this okay it's a

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.230 
so so it begins like this okay it's a
minor<00:01:51.680> G<00:01:53.750> slide<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:55.020> an<00:01:55.110> F<00:01:55.260> then<00:01:56.190> G<00:01:56.220> again<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
minor G slide into an F then G again you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.160 
minor G slide into an F then G again you
just<00:01:57.510> don't<00:01:57.780> pick<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.229> first<00:01:58.500> string<00:01:59.870> then<00:02:00.870> F

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
just don't pick the first string then F

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:11.750 
just don't pick the first string then F
G<00:02:04.790> okay<00:02:05.790> so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.300 

then<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.450> next<00:02:13.780> life<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:14.140> this

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
D string G over be a minor G over b c g

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.290

over

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.150 

then<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.750> face<00:02:59.930> again<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.860> do<00:03:01.010> this

then the face again and you do this
again<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:07.150> then<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.930> line

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.449 

it's<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.310> same<00:03:16.550> line<00:03:16.819> only<00:03:17.480> ending<00:03:18.050> on<00:03:18.319> C<00:03:19.220> and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
then D minor so a minor G C D minor then

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:48.710 
then D minor so a minor G C D minor then
the<00:03:35.810> B<00:03:35.930> part<00:03:36.730> G<00:03:37.730> minor

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720
