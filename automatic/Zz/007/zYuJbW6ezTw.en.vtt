 [Music] 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.170
 very by his heirs I am smart and ready 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.210
 welcome to the temple of time in the 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.430
 today's video we're going to talk about all the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.009
 different links in the saga 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.480
 zelda that is to say all the reincarnations 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.149
 of the hero of the saga 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.309
 As you may know, it is not always the same link 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.500
 in all the games but as we will see 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.600
 later the same hero may 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.120
 appear in more than one title of the 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.440
 legend of zelda to organize and 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.050
 understand everything more easily 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.089
 we will talk about each link according to the order 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.950
 of the games of the official chronology 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.290
 from nintendo 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.270
 first we go with the skate word link 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.580
 this link is the first hero we will see 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.890
 and only appear in the game of wii 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.720
 this link has a great friendship with 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.850
 Zelda and start the adventure with no 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.019
 kind of dress that I remember cheerful 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.689
 until it reaches a certain point in the game 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.060
 after skywork we go with minis cap 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.700
 this is the second link of technology 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.310
 and it's another completely different link 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.869
 to that of sky wars work even though 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.969
 They also have a great friendship with the 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.920
 princess zelda there are those who say that in the 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.130
 prologue of my escape only from the hero of 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.360
 skywork but nothing confirmed the 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.209
 hero of this game has a familiar 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.150
 yours smith which is the blacksmith of the 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:33.150
 jairo real house 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.890
 the next link is fox words a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.590
 despite having a graphic style force 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.490
 identical to that of an escape is another link 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.110
 different 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.790
 this game shares the story of 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.040
 bhatti and although I also have a view 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.130
 with zelda is another link different to me 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.890
 escape with this and we have three games of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.520
 3 different links but we'll see how 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.740
 this changes we go with ocarina of time 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.440
 where we will see that there may be more than one 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.120
 link in different games this link does not 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.729
 have any kind of friendship in a 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.830
 beginning with princess zelda this ere 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.660
 was abandoned in the calkini forest by 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.869
 his mother so that the big ccoo tree 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.240
 Take charge is the only link that 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.790
 grows over the course of the game in this 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.830
 case to break the master sword 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.990
 when they get to defeat ghana cell 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.120
 send link to your childhood and it is then 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.970
 when link goes in search of her friend 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.310
 nobody later the link goes into action 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.880
 of older must which is the same link 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.250
 than that of ocarina of time just that this 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.730
 Once this game takes place in the lands 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.670
 determined 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.709
 [Music] 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.660
 then we find the link of 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.910
 toilette princess this link 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.459
 biden order and the same as it was that wason 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.319
 his clothes have nothing to do with 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.110
 those of the hero until he gets them in 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.489
 a certain point of the game does not have 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.950
 any kind of friendship with Princess 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.260
 zelda this is a hero completely 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.900
 different from ocarina of time and in 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.209
 greater is more however in this game 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.450
 we find a star fox known 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.430
 as the spirit of the hero this is the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.430
 spirit of the ocarina time hero 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.350
 of time and majora's mask which can not 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.930
 rest in peace by not being able to transmit 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.940
 the lessons of life to which 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.620
 they came after him since he was 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.989
 sent back to the time of the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.090
 childhood also regrets the fact 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.160
 that he is not remembered as a hero with 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.530
 in order to ease their grief and finally 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.209
 transmit your knowledge teaches you the 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.730
 seven hidden skills to his 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.730
 descendant the flower link esprinters 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.819
 to end this era let's go comfort 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.130
 the objects which is a lic that does not 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.670
 have nothing to do with any of the 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.670
 previous 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.780
 now we change era and we go with the 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.430
 of the adult link of ocarina of time or 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.910
 also known as the era of the great 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.220
 flood the hero of wind waker no 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.580
 has no relation to the doctrine 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.410
 of time n of time is mentioned in the 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.930
 prologue where the story of 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.170
 the events of ocarina of time with the 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.410
 lic 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.870
 defeat pagan here liquidate that not 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.360
 you know the princess truth not even 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.210
 She knows she is a princess having 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.950
 a pirate role 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.740
 this hero has a sister called 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.780
 April and a grandmother some say that the 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.700
 estelÃ­ angle and be active 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.370
 descendant of cell and for that reason 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.730
 we get hero casualties the shield of 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.510
 r &amp; b 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.820
 [Music] 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.670
 the next game is about phantom 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.760
 classrooms where we have again the same 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.830
 link of the previous game wind waker ya 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.540
 that this story continues directly 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.570
 with the events of the game of 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.370
 gamecube where link and zelda are shipped 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.770
 in an adventure with the goal of 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.440
 find a place where to forge the new 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.900
 iron 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.850
 however it is not until spirit tracks 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.730
 where you see the new lands of jairo 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.800
 anyway this link and zelda are 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.520
 descendants of the wind heroes 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.100
 waker and phantom hourglass so they are 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.650
 characters different from those of the 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.260
 previous games and here reads that zelda 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.870
 they are great friends 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.970
 [Music] 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.090
 now we change again from era 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.580
 let's say with aline club up to this game 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.860
 It is also located just after 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.710
 ocarina of time but it's another link 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.100
 completely different from the water minis 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.650
 chap 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.380
 lr also has an uncle who dies 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.280
 when trying to save that cell at the same time 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.950
 end the game 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.140
 this same link is transported to the 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.940
 lands of life and hollow of the 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.160
 worlds of the saga now and with so 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.930
 the leader to link to the past is the same 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.700
 that the of these games when olic 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.850
 finish your adventures on the hour and with 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.340
 I leave and they embark again until 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.920
 that a ray shakes his bow and appears in 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.810
 the lands of iconix so it is the 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.420
 the first time we check the same 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.870
 nick in three different breath games 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.950
 of peace now and with them and seasons and 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.450
 lynch aouate min 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.460
 after these games we have the most 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.590
 recent linguistic words then a 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.970
 link completely different from that of a 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.440
 link to the past 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.420
 [Music] 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.520
 and to finish we have a link 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.530
 completely new and that of the games 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.170
 of nes with the legend of zelda the 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.260
 adventures of link which is the same 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.920
 hero for both games in short 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.110
 We have 11 different links as we can 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.270
 see there is a same link that is repeated in 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.130
 more than one game yet great 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.220
 most are completely heroes 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.840
 different from each other I hope 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.880
 that you liked this video which 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.350
 surely in a few years he will leave 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.030
 to make sense since the saga 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.740
 Continually advancing and going 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.480
 appearing a new heroes that change 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.270
 completely the course of the 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.070
 chronology but today these are 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.080
 heroes that we can find in the saga 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.450
 zelda obviously I have not put the 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.250
 clean spin-off of the saga since no 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.290
 have a great impact on the 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.540
 technology I hope you liked it 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.940
 this video and you have taken questions to more 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.050
 from one you can follow me if you want in 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.550
