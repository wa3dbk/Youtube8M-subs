alright so first you have a little model
this<00:00:33.890> isn't<00:00:34.250> going<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:34.400> move<00:00:34.580> around<00:00:34.730> in<00:00:35.120> this

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239

tutorial<00:00:35.510> what<00:00:36.410> we're<00:00:36.530> going<00:00:36.650> to<00:00:36.680> do<00:00:36.830> in<00:00:36.949> this

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
tutorial what we're going to do in this

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.470 
tutorial what we're going to do in this
is<00:00:37.340> um<00:00:39.100> give<00:00:40.100> it<00:00:40.220> a<00:00:40.280> camera<00:00:40.790> which<00:00:41.090> will<00:00:41.269> rotate

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
is um give it a camera which will rotate

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.290 
is um give it a camera which will rotate
around<00:00:41.900> it<00:00:42.410> because<00:00:42.980> that's<00:00:43.100> simple<00:00:44.030> it's

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
around it because that's simple it's

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.930 
around it because that's simple it's
easy<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:44.690> learn<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:46.070> just<00:00:46.309> going<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.550> use<00:00:46.910> a

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
easy to learn so just going to use a

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.110 
easy to learn so just going to use a
target<00:00:47.450> camera<00:00:47.660> not<00:00:48.170> a<00:00:48.230> free<00:00:48.530> camera<00:00:49.120> all

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
target camera not a free camera all

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.700 
target camera not a free camera all
right<00:00:50.210> we're<00:00:50.480> going<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.630> go<00:00:50.750> ahead<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.230> use<00:00:51.469> a

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
right we're going to go ahead and use a

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.040 
right we're going to go ahead and use a
target<00:00:52.399> camera<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:53.920> little<00:00:54.920> easier<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.550> use

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
target camera a little easier to use

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.240 
target camera a little easier to use
better<00:00:57.050> for<00:00:57.350> rotating<00:00:57.860> around<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.430> object<00:01:00.250> so

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
better for rotating around the object so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.550 
better for rotating around the object so
click<00:01:01.520> I<00:01:02.260> bet<00:01:03.260> fuzzy<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:05.360> click<00:01:05.660> and<00:01:05.930> then

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
click I bet fuzzy so click and then

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.130 
click I bet fuzzy so click and then
choose<00:01:07.190> where<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.550> want<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.759> to<00:01:07.880> look<00:01:08.060> but<00:01:08.869> see

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
choose where you want it to look but see

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.440 
choose where you want it to look but see
in<00:01:09.380> here<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.580> looks<00:01:10.759> like<00:01:10.910> it's<00:01:11.060> looking<00:01:11.270> right

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
in here it looks like it's looking right

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.330 
in here it looks like it's looking right
at<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.840> these<00:01:12.380> views<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:12.830> can<00:01:12.979> see<00:01:13.190> that's

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
at it in these views you can see that's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.219 
at it in these views you can see that's
right<00:01:13.640> under<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:14.390> it's<00:01:14.539> not<00:01:14.720> really

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
right under it so it's not really

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.410 
right under it so it's not really
working<00:01:15.830> right<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:17.000> we're<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:17.119> going<00:01:17.360> to

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
working right so we're just going to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.139 
working right so we're just going to
move<00:01:17.569> it<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:21.399> with<00:01:22.399> this<00:01:22.580> camera<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:22.970> also

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
move it and with this camera you also

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.029 
move it and with this camera you also
have<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.479> move<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:23.869> little<00:01:24.020> box<00:01:24.470> right<00:01:24.619> here

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
have to move this little box right here

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.859 
have to move this little box right here
because<00:01:26.030> that's<00:01:26.179> what<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.479> camera<00:01:26.840> is

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
because that's what the camera is

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.550 
because that's what the camera is
looking<00:01:27.770> directly<00:01:27.920> at<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.869> make<00:01:30.229> sure<00:01:30.440> it

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.999 
looking directly at and make sure it
fits<00:01:30.800> on<00:01:31.039> both<00:01:31.520> views<00:01:34.240> let's<00:01:35.240> go<00:01:35.420> ahead<00:01:35.539> and

tutorial and we're just going to drag
this<00:02:27.110> out<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:28.570> it's<00:02:29.570> going<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.810> record

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
this out here and it's going to record

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.570 
this out here and it's going to record
the<00:02:32.150> place<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.630> we<00:02:32.720> just<00:02:32.900> put<00:02:33.080> it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
the place that we just put it

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.500 
the place that we just put it
automatically<00:02:34.580> because<00:02:34.880> we<00:02:35.000> have<00:02:35.120> Auto<00:02:35.270> key

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
automatically because we have Auto key

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.500 
automatically because we have Auto key
set<00:02:35.890> now<00:02:36.890> if<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.130> if<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.670> didn't<00:02:37.940> want<00:02:37.970> it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
set now if you if you didn't want it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.750 
set now if you if you didn't want it
Auto<00:02:38.660> key<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.140> any<00:02:39.320> one<00:02:39.440> set<00:02:39.800> key<00:02:40.040> then<00:02:40.640> you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
Auto key on any one set key then you

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.180 
Auto key on any one set key then you
move<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.180> out<00:02:41.240> anywhere<00:02:41.960> else<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.980> when<00:02:43.100> you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
move it out anywhere else and when you

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.070 
move it out anywhere else and when you
moved<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.550> nothing<00:02:43.940> what<00:02:44.060> happened<00:02:44.480> until<00:02:44.990> you

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
moved it nothing what happened until you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.210 
moved it nothing what happened until you
click<00:02:45.380> this<00:02:45.590> little<00:02:45.800> key<00:02:46.100> button<00:02:46.400> right<00:02:46.520> here

click this little key button right here

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.320 
click this little key button right here
but<00:02:49.220> we're<00:02:49.340> going<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.490> use<00:02:49.640> I'm<00:02:49.820> gonna<00:02:50.210> use

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
but we're going to use I'm gonna use

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.040 
but we're going to use I'm gonna use
Auto<00:02:50.510> key

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
Auto key

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.620 
Auto key
I<00:02:51.080> don't<00:02:51.380> know<00:02:51.440> about<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:52.360> alright<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:53.510> let's

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
I don't know about you alright so let's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.440 
I don't know about you alright so let's
go<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> 20<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:56.890> move<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.100> here<00:02:58.270> give<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.360> a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
go to 20 and move it out here give it a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.860 
go to 20 and move it out here give it a
little<00:02:59.840> view<00:03:01.060> 30<00:03:03.760> behind<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:06.790> 40<00:03:07.790> we're<00:03:08.720> gonna

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
little view 30 behind it 40 we're gonna

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.740 
little view 30 behind it 40 we're gonna
move<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.260> behind<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.190> camera<00:03:10.640> from<00:03:11.330> front<00:03:11.660> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
move it behind the camera from front of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.540 
move it behind the camera from front of
you<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:13.130> then<00:03:14.120> we're<00:03:14.480> gonna<00:03:14.570> skip<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:16.040> about

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
you and then we're gonna skip to about

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.640 
you and then we're gonna skip to about
70<00:03:17.510> because<00:03:18.320> we<00:03:18.560> want<00:03:18.740> it<00:03:18.800> to<00:03:18.860> slowly<00:03:20.230> pass<00:03:21.230> by

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
70 because we want it to slowly pass by

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.060 
70 because we want it to slowly pass by
and<00:03:22.690> look<00:03:23.690> at<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.990> model<00:03:26.500> alright<00:03:27.500> then<00:03:27.980> we're

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
and look at the model alright then we're

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.320 
and look at the model alright then we're
going<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.250> go<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.370> 80

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.960 

because<00:03:33.020> when<00:03:33.170> it's<00:03:33.290> if<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:34.100> skip<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.640> bunch

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
because when it's if you skip a bunch

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.020 
because when it's if you skip a bunch
numbers<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.470> going<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.680> go<00:03:36.770> fast<00:03:37.010> this<00:03:37.790> is

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
numbers this is going to go fast this is

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.380 
numbers this is going to go fast this is
going<00:03:38.210> to<00:03:38.270> go<00:03:38.360> slowly<00:03:39.280> or<00:03:40.280> slower<00:03:40.820> in<00:03:41.090> this

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
going to go slowly or slower in this

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:52.960 
going to go slowly or slower in this
part<00:03:43.600> just<00:03:44.600> move<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:44.960> here<00:03:48.490> and<00:03:50.410> 490<00:03:51.970> just

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
part just move this here and 490 just

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.800 
part just move this here and 490 just
move<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:53.990> over<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.290> don't<00:03:54.530> know<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:55.150> still<00:03:56.150> move

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
move it over I don't know I still move

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.770 
move it over I don't know I still move
this<00:03:56.930> one<00:03:57.080> right<00:03:57.200> in<00:03:57.350> front<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:58.090> this<00:03:59.090> one<00:03:59.360> at

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
this one right in front and this one at

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.650 
this one right in front and this one at
100<00:04:00.340> will<00:04:01.340> be<00:04:01.460> at<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.700> angle<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.180> started

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
100 will be at the angle that it started

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.550 
100 will be at the angle that it started
around<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.830> angle<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.220> it<00:04:04.340> started<00:04:05.560> all

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
around the angle that it started all

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.040 
around the angle that it started all
right<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:09.320> make<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.160> doesn't<00:04:11.050> start

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
right so to make it so it doesn't start

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.230 
right so to make it so it doesn't start
as<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.260> single<00:04:12.800> frame<00:04:13.040> or<00:04:13.580> you<00:04:13.610> press<00:04:13.820> render

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
as a single frame or you press render

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.390 
as a single frame or you press render
and<00:04:14.960> all<00:04:15.320> you<00:04:15.410> see<00:04:15.620> is<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:16.390> I'm<00:04:17.390> looking<00:04:17.480> run

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and all you see is that I'm looking run

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.820 
and all you see is that I'm looking run
okay<00:04:19.400> now<00:04:19.549> if<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:19.820> press<00:04:20.000> render<00:04:20.380> all<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:21.650> see

okay now if you press render all you see

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.360 
okay now if you press render all you see
is<00:04:21.950> this

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
is this

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.880 
is this
it<00:04:22.430> doesn't<00:04:22.820> animate<00:04:23.300> or<00:04:23.450> anything<00:04:23.890> we're

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
it doesn't animate or anything we're

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.300 
it doesn't animate or anything we're
going<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.100> change<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.550> time<00:04:25.850> output<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
going to change the time output in the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.630 
going to change the time output in the
common<00:04:28.670> parameters<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:30.020> either<00:04:30.320> active<00:04:30.950> range

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
common parameters to either active range

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.370 
common parameters to either active range
segment<00:04:32.150> which<00:04:32.240> will<00:04:32.360> go<00:04:32.480> automatically<00:04:33.140> from

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
segment which will go automatically from

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.030 
segment which will go automatically from
zero<00:04:33.770> frame<00:04:34.430> zero<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:35.090> find<00:04:35.300> 100<00:04:35.830> which<00:04:36.830> I'm

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
zero frame zero to find 100 which I'm

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.159 
zero frame zero to find 100 which I'm
gonna<00:04:37.160> use<00:04:37.220> or<00:04:37.490> range<00:04:38.270> which<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.780> can<00:04:38.930> choose

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
gonna use or range which you can choose

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.090 
gonna use or range which you can choose
what<00:04:39.470> numbers<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:40.010> goes<00:04:40.160> from<00:04:40.460> like<00:04:41.060> 1<00:04:41.480> to<00:04:41.630> 20

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
what numbers it goes from like 1 to 20

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.530 
what numbers it goes from like 1 to 20
20<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.130> 30<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:43.550> don't<00:04:43.820> know<00:04:44.200> or<00:04:45.200> frames<00:04:46.190> and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
20 to 30 I don't know or frames and

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.510 
20 to 30 I don't know or frames and
frames<00:04:47.540> will<00:04:47.720> let<00:04:47.840> you<00:04:47.930> go<00:04:48.110> just<00:04:48.380> select<00:04:49.310> any

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
frames will let you go just select any

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.940 
frames will let you go just select any
random<00:04:50.030> thing<00:04:50.240> like<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:51.140> can<00:04:51.290> be<00:04:51.380> like<00:04:51.530> 10<00:04:51.800> to

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
random thing like you can be like 10 to

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.760 
random thing like you can be like 10 to
20<00:04:52.310> then<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.240> can<00:04:53.390> skip<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.750> go<00:04:54.050> from<00:04:54.260> 40<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.650> 60

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
20 then you can skip to go from 40 to 60

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.570 
20 then you can skip to go from 40 to 60
on<00:04:56.140> so<00:04:57.140> we'll<00:04:57.320> just<00:04:57.410> do<00:04:57.590> active<00:04:58.100> time<00:04:58.340> segment

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580

what<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:19.640> have<00:05:19.850> hidden<00:05:20.270> is<00:05:20.450> on<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:21.260> reference

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680

image I used to make this model and

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.240 
image I used to make this model and
we're<00:05:25.970> going<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:26.120> choose<00:05:26.270> where<00:05:26.480> to<00:05:26.510> save<00:05:26.780> it

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
we're going to choose where to save it

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.060 
we're going to choose where to save it
so<00:05:28.250> I'm<00:05:28.310> going<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.460> go<00:05:28.550> files<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:30.620> we'll<00:05:30.890> name

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
so I'm going to go files and we'll name

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.670 
so I'm going to go files and we'll name
this

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:41.430

and save choose the quality okay and

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.820 
and save choose the quality okay and
that<00:05:53.510> looks<00:05:53.750> about<00:05:53.840> right<00:05:54.139> so<00:05:54.650> we're<00:05:54.770> just

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
that looks about right so we're just

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.140 
that looks about right so we're just
going<00:05:55.010> to<00:05:55.070> go<00:05:55.220> ahead<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.790> either<00:05:55.850> press

render or Shift Q and the screen will
come<00:06:00.500> up<00:06:00.820> you'll<00:06:01.820> see<00:06:01.910> over<00:06:02.270> here<00:06:02.300> it's

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
come up you'll see over here it's

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.879 
come up you'll see over here it's
loading<00:06:03.590> every<00:06:03.860> image<00:06:04.250> six<00:06:05.060> of<00:06:05.270> 100<00:06:06.260> right<00:06:06.380> now

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.189 

tells<00:06:09.889> you<00:06:10.760> how<00:06:11.000> much<00:06:11.150> times<00:06:11.419> past<00:06:11.750> how<00:06:12.050> much

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
tells you how much times past how much

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.770 
tells you how much times past how much
each<00:06:12.380> frame<00:06:12.680> is<00:06:12.860> taking<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:14.360> settings

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
each frame is taking the settings

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.090 
each frame is taking the settings
yeah<00:06:17.780> but<00:06:18.080> we're<00:06:18.199> going<00:06:18.350> to<00:06:18.440> probably<00:06:18.710> skip

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
yeah but we're going to probably skip

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:34.720 
yeah but we're going to probably skip
over<00:06:19.280> this<00:06:19.490> part<00:06:20.080> or<00:06:21.080> fast-forward

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.230 

all<00:06:35.730> right

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
all right

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.310 
all right
yeah<00:06:37.110> it's<00:06:37.320> about<00:06:37.530> done<00:06:37.830> now<00:06:38.030> about<00:06:39.030> done<00:06:39.360> now

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
yeah it's about done now about done now

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.470 
yeah it's about done now about done now
so<00:06:40.880> we<00:06:41.880> can<00:06:42.000> just<00:06:42.030> close<00:06:42.540> this<00:06:42.780> and<00:06:43.070> close<00:06:44.070> this

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
so we can just close this and close this

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.030 
so we can just close this and close this
and<00:06:45.480> we're<00:06:46.080> going<00:06:46.200> to<00:06:46.230> look<00:06:46.350> for<00:06:46.500> that<00:06:46.560> file<00:06:46.830> so

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
and we're going to look for that file so

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.950 
and we're going to look for that file so
we're<00:06:47.130> going<00:06:47.220> to<00:06:47.280> go<00:06:47.450> to<00:06:48.450> wherever<00:06:48.570> you<00:06:48.750> saved

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
we're going to go to wherever you saved

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.710 
we're going to go to wherever you saved
it<00:06:49.260> the<00:06:49.470> default<00:06:49.950> would<00:06:50.070> be<00:06:50.130> 3ds<00:06:51.090> Max<00:06:51.450> and

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
it the default would be 3ds Max and

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.590 
it the default would be 3ds Max and
render<00:06:52.710> output<00:06:53.210> and<00:06:54.210> then<00:06:54.300> you<00:06:54.390> have<00:06:54.480> your

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
render output and then you have your

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.880 
render output and then you have your
file<00:06:54.840> set<00:06:55.380> of<00:06:55.470> sniper<00:06:55.740> example<00:06:56.990> and<00:06:57.990> we<00:06:58.590> open

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
file set of sniper example and we open

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:05.660 
file set of sniper example and we open
that<00:07:01.280> alright<00:07:02.960> so<00:07:03.960> see<00:07:04.170> it<00:07:04.260> speeds<00:07:04.740> by<00:07:05.010> on<00:07:05.370> the

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.670 
that alright so see it speeds by on the

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.290 
that alright so see it speeds by on the
right<00:07:05.820> side<00:07:06.440> it's<00:07:07.440> actually<00:07:07.970> freezing<00:07:08.970> up<00:07:09.210> a

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
right side it's actually freezing up a

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.900 
right side it's actually freezing up a
little<00:07:09.510> bit<00:07:10.070> it<00:07:11.070> speeds<00:07:11.400> by<00:07:11.580> on<00:07:11.700> the<00:07:11.760> right

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
little bit it speeds by on the right

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.710 
little bit it speeds by on the right
side<00:07:12.180> and<00:07:12.630> slows<00:07:13.200> down<00:07:13.470> on<00:07:13.590> this<00:07:13.680> side<00:07:14.690> or<00:07:15.690> I

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
side and slows down on this side or I

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.140 
side and slows down on this side or I
should<00:07:15.930> say<00:07:16.080> the<00:07:16.200> left<00:07:16.380> side<00:07:16.620> speeds<00:07:17.130> up<00:07:17.340> the

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
should say the left side speeds up the

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:24.610 
should say the left side speeds up the
right<00:07:18.330> side<00:07:18.570> slows<00:07:18.840> down

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.580 

all<00:07:25.100> right<00:07:25.250> and<00:07:25.870> what<00:07:26.870> we<00:07:26.990> could<00:07:27.140> have<00:07:27.200> done<00:07:27.410> is

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:27.590 
all right and what we could have done is

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.230 
all right and what we could have done is
we<00:07:27.740> could<00:07:27.890> have<00:07:28.010> put<00:07:28.190> more<00:07:28.370> detail<00:07:28.880> into<00:07:29.060> it

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
we could have put more detail into it

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.910 
we could have put more detail into it
like<00:07:30.140> made<00:07:30.410> this<00:07:31.220> night<00:07:31.550> I'm<00:07:32.050> sorry<00:07:33.050> like<00:07:33.680> made

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:33.920 
like made this night I'm sorry like made

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.430 
like made this night I'm sorry like made
the<00:07:34.070> camera<00:07:34.460> go<00:07:34.610> in<00:07:34.820> more<00:07:35.630> look<00:07:36.020> at<00:07:36.170> each

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
the camera go in more look at each

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.620 
the camera go in more look at each
little<00:07:36.740> spot<00:07:37.070> we<00:07:37.850> could<00:07:38.000> have<00:07:38.120> made<00:07:38.210> it<00:07:38.330> go<00:07:38.420> up

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:38.630 
little spot we could have made it go up

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.530 
little spot we could have made it go up
down<00:07:38.960> wherever<00:07:39.590> we<00:07:39.830> wanted<00:07:40.100> if<00:07:40.280> we<00:07:41.210> made<00:07:41.390> it

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:41.540 
down wherever we wanted if we made it

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.990 
down wherever we wanted if we made it
move<00:07:42.470> these<00:07:42.740> little<00:07:42.860> time<00:07:43.190> lines<00:07:43.460> around<00:07:43.730> like

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 
move these little time lines around like

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.720 
move these little time lines around like
we<00:07:44.120> could<00:07:44.330> move<00:07:44.960> them<00:07:45.140> all<00:07:45.230> right<00:07:45.440> now<00:07:45.700> to<00:07:46.700> a

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:46.730 
we could move them all right now to a

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:51.820 
we could move them all right now to a
confined<00:07:47.240> area<00:07:47.480> and<00:07:47.810> add<00:07:48.200> on<00:07:48.410> after<00:07:48.680> that<00:07:50.830> but

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:51.830 
confined area and add on after that but

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.350 
confined area and add on after that but
for<00:07:52.010> this<00:07:52.070> tutorial<00:07:52.280> this<00:07:52.730> just<00:07:52.970> worked<00:07:53.180> out

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 
for this tutorial this just worked out
