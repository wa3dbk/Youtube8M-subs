00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:16.560
 Good child Fes 2 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.150
 Hmm 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.320
 So we will start 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:29.660
 We will start from foundation of bag case this time 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.740
 Lebron color stay whipped sera make-up released on October 7 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.740
 I will use it 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.760
 This is because it is excellent in very moisturizing power perfect for bread in the season to dry cold from this 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.760
 Retardation of I 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:04.899
 And since it is also very good on the day, it fits gently on the skin and keeps the fine skin texture all day 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.899
 Will 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:36.480
 The foundation makeup is ok with just the foundation but this time it is light 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.480
 Apply mineral foundation powder to finish 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.530
 Not 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.799
 Next move on to eye makeup First, let's start with Urban Decay eye shadow primer 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.799
 We will come out to the entire eye hole 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:13.640
 Next, I put a mocha brown shadow in the hollow of the eye to blur the edge well 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.540
 Next, apply the boss green of the light over the entire eyehole 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.250
 And I will apply even more light green shadow to 1/3 eyes 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:15.040
 And next, I will put a dark moss green roadway and put it in the upper and lower eyes in the maze 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:03.210
 And I will put a very light moss green to the whole of my eyes 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.050
 And it is the brightest in the lower eye corner 1/3 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.050
 Let's paint a steaming green shadow 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.670
 And your Majesty's highlights paint matte beige white 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.750
 And then I put the upper and lower mucous membrane with a dark brown eye pencil 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.629
 Next, let's draw an eyeline with the liquid eyeliner 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.470
 And if I put up the eyelashes with the Buhler 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.470
 I will paint a lot of mascara up and down 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:49.650
 And next move to teak This time I will paint dark orange beige 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:49.650
 Saison cloth teak is Puchipura, but I 'm in the range very well because the coloring is good 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:08.250
 And next move to the lip This time dark orange to link with the color of teak 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.250
 I will apply a beige lip 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150

 me 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:30.989
 Finally, the makeup is complete by lightly rubbing the orange gloss . 

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:30.989
