choose lighter weight balls I think from

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.330 
choose lighter weight balls I think from
ten<00:01:24.330> pounds<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.320> right<00:01:25.650> thing<00:01:25.890> yeah<00:01:26.100> it's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
ten pounds up the right thing yeah it's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
ten pounds up the right thing yeah it's
hard<00:01:26.550> to<00:01:26.700> find<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.030> house<00:01:27.150> ball<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> fit<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
hard to find a house ball to fit the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.600 
hard to find a house ball to fit the
hand<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.590> grown<00:01:28.830> person<00:01:28.860> even<00:01:29.430> though

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
hand of a grown person even though

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.010 
hand of a grown person even though
they're<00:01:29.790> aging<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.300> maybe<00:01:30.720> they<00:01:30.870> don't

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
they're aging and maybe they don't

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
they're aging and maybe they don't
handle<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> heavy<00:01:31.620> weight<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.760> also<00:01:33.090> their

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
handle the heavy weight and also their

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.539 
handle the heavy weight and also their
hand<00:01:33.570> flexibility<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> factor<00:01:35.010> in<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.280> too

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
hand flexibility is a factor in that too

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.210 
hand flexibility is a factor in that too
so<00:01:35.940> we<00:01:36.090> always<00:01:36.240> recommend<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:37.409> any<00:01:37.560> adult<00:01:37.890> to
