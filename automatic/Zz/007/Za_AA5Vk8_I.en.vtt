00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Good day, ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.799
 welcome to another geography 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.940
 hour on the cello washboard you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.550
 may remember 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.580
 our first location like us because in the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.470
 last consequence have shown 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.560
 first finger is standing for a whole day 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.830
 then on the teacher side follow three 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.990
 semitones and so I can at the end of the sound 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.390
 the guitar of the next page I can 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.599
 then playing with four fingers sounds 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.599
 then so 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.350
 which I can not play now 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.080
 is the halftone here between the empty one 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.430
 side and the first finger to reach 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.350
 by extending my finger 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.239
 and then I'm at the far first 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.239
 arrived situation that sounds like that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.079
 as far as room last time come so 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.089
 But we still lack a goal 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.089
 namely between the fourth finger 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.620
 the next page 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.590
 that's a whole tone and is missing here 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.520
 We also have half a turn 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.549
 we can so they achieve it seen 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 what i have just done i have 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.110
 my hand moved 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.450
 At the new place they are seeing this 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.610
 exactly here a whole hand 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.950
 whole room shifts one 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.659
 Halftone that does not work over 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.860
 against that you just have a finger 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.690
 to spread 1 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.520
 you can not do that because of the gaps 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.630
 too big and the finger too weak 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.390
 and usually too short 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 they slip with the whole story 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.530
 one more position 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.899
 usually I do that with the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.229
 stretched first finger and then I'm 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.119
 I am here in the raised first wide 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.119
 location are now they can 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.150
 one and a half do below the next 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.009
 play side 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.140
 and now they really have all of them 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.610
 Sounds done you see yourself 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.710
 once in the schema to which 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.800
 Tune them in detail on the fingerboard 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.600
 play 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.170
 I still remember them 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.810
 once the picture of the first location 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.310
 shown remember 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.950
 this was about the first finger 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.360
 When are they spread that to the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:42.780
 second finger on the whole distance like that and 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:46.150
 now you have the sounds dsf foot and g 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.860
 from the fourth finger goes to the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.420
 next gate it is a whole sound it 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.520
 So we are missing this halftone step 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.459
 and now I'll show you something 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:00.190
 now watch now 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.489
 we just slip the whole hand 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.690
 around a finger so where the fourth 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.790
 was the third one now 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.480
 there it was now the third one 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.860
 second the first finger is funnier 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.440
 because she's back in his old place 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.970
 But now it was always outstretched 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.930
 even from the second finger a really great 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.760
 they want again I still see times 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:28.150
 Undo we have the old one again 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.690
 and the new picture and you see us 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.220
 like to go back and like that 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.959
 whole hand has gone forward 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.480
 let us now in each case 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.930
 look how the sounds are called then we 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.140
 Let's start playing on the a side 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.530
 On the one hand we now have that on her 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.180
 page 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.269
 Only the finger plays a hair that 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.190
 whole as the Englishman is so and the new one 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.709
 now that the second finger is the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.049
 cis the third fingerplay plays that 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.380
 the and with four fingers we can be a 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.060
 So play it half a tone higher 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.090
 as we have so far with the fourth finger 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.580
 can play 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:10.350
 this means he will do it on the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.050
 b page the teacher page degen the first 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.120
 finger plays the e 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.630
 the second finger plays the fis the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.400
 third the g here too you see that 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.989
 they have to get used to where they are 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.760
 see a fis and do not play anymore 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.590
 third finger but now second 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.270
 finger and thereby they have the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.650
 possibility with the fourth finger 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.170
 to play gis 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.600
 and now you can see that this sound 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.850
 only half a tone from the next 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.020
 higher empty side away that is 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.030
 means we all really have 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:45.390
 keep on going on the b-side 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.970
 here you play teacher page g first 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.860
 finger a 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.350
 the second finger is now playing the truck 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.820
 but the hair of the third finger 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:00.720
 takes over the goal and increases again with 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.960
 the fourth finger the cis combi 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.380
 conclusion still to the target page here 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.410
 play blank page c first finger 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.690
 d the second finger again 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.810
 So again the place of the old third 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.630
 Fingers third finger play the f and 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.010
 the fourth finger of the fis see her and 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.919
 We have really done that now 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.890
 all semitones between the pages too 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.060
 play 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.500
 Now I want you one too 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.990
 to draw attention to the matter 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.660
 those of many students at the moment 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.860
 it will be reversed at the beginning 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.410
 the information is downright 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.450
 Shipping will you try the hand too 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.590
 slip and let the thumb 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:46.740
 where you are holding your finger 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.990
 distance only if the thumb one 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.880
 fixed place to the fingers taken 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.500
 has and now if they slip the hand 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.250
 must please to see that the 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.300
 Thumb member are thumbs go here 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.409
 exactly with 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.749
 when I slide forward 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.459
 this time you can work and through 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:06.189
 slip around one finger and she 

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:09.339
 see the whole hand has run with it 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:12.399
 that really be trained exactly that 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:14.289
 you can really see that and that you can 

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:16.689
 that can really feel that you are with 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.999
 told the thumb it is such a 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.159
 typical thing the one at the beginning 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:23.319
 one always feels such a need 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.939
 for security money and then tried 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:27.550
 You look back with your thumb 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.909
 stay that way again that comes back 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.089
 But if it is against misunderstanding 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:36.789
 in principle they should really learn 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:40.529
 Introduced here feels with the whole arm 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.529
 to develop how far that should be 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.839
 so you come to the high, wide location 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:49.089
 they should so really a 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:52.059
 train and I wish them 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:55.949
 all good base good and lots of fun 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.949
 to see each other in their exercises
