00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
hydrolysed there and Lita is he might be

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.500 
hydrolysed there and Lita is he might be
getting<00:00:17.430> his<00:00:17.520> upper<00:00:17.760> age<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.119> his<00:00:18.210> Marines

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
they kind of cut away very quickly

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.040 
they kind of cut away very quickly
before<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.850> could<00:00:21.060> figure<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.300> out<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:21.750> looks

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
before I could figure that out but looks

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.070 
before I could figure that out but looks
like<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:23.000> race<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.240> still<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.600> trying<00:00:24.990> to

up<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.689> Lita<00:00:30.840> again<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.470> leaders<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
up for Lita again so leaders going to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
up for Lita again so leaders going to
try<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> do<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> same<00:00:32.880> thing<00:00:33.120> he<00:00:33.270> did<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
try to do the same thing he did in the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.260 
try to do the same thing he did in the
last<00:00:33.719> game<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> Zerg<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:36.000> for

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
last game but the Zerg is not going for

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.150 
last game but the Zerg is not going for
his<00:00:36.570> same<00:00:36.809> build<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.530> he<00:00:37.649> went<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
his same build that he went for in the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.650 
his same build that he went for in the
last<00:00:38.280> game<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.120> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> very

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
last game so this is going to be a very

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.380 
last game so this is going to be a very
different<00:00:39.870> game<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.200> believe<00:00:40.790> since<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> Zerg

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
different game I believe since the Zerg

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630 
different game I believe since the Zerg
he's<00:00:42.690> getting<00:00:43.020> out<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.620> couple<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.219> scared

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
he's getting out a couple of scared

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
he's getting out a couple of scared
right<00:00:44.910> now<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.840> land<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.710> those<00:00:47.039> rays<00:00:48.800> but

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
right now to land on those rays but

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
right now to land on those rays but
scourge<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> great

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
scourge are actually not that great

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
scourge are actually not that great
great<00:00:51.809> against<00:00:52.079> rays<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.680> rays<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.129> so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
great against rays because rays are so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.389 
great against rays because rays are so
fast<00:00:53.579> Zerg<00:00:54.379> scourge<00:00:55.379> can't<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> whole<00:00:56.370> lot

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
fast Zerg scourge can't get a whole lot

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.540 
fast Zerg scourge can't get a whole lot
done<00:00:56.730> against<00:00:57.000> rates<00:00:57.949> they're<00:00:58.949> much<00:00:59.370> better

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
done against rates they're much better

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
done against rates they're much better

repairing his race he's going to get

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.090 
repairing his race he's going to get
them<00:01:09.420> grouped<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> ready<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:10.920> another

them grouped up and ready for another
attack<00:01:11.369> run<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.689> pick<00:01:12.990> off<00:01:13.200> drones<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
attack run here to pick off drones just

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.820 
attack run here to pick off drones just
try<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> contain<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.960> zerk<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.530> his<00:01:16.650> two

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
try to contain the zerk into his two

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
try to contain the zerk into his two
bases<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.490> long<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.670> possible<00:01:17.960> building

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
bases for as long as possible building

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.270 
bases for as long as possible building
more<00:01:19.140> barracks<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.159> are

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
more barracks here so I think we are

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.130 
more barracks here so I think we are
going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.640> another<00:01:20.850> medica<00:01:21.570> marine<00:01:21.810> force

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
going to see another medica marine force

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.030 
going to see another medica marine force
with<00:01:22.890> rays<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:24.049> we'll<00:01:25.049> see<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> zerk<00:01:25.799> has

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
with rays and we'll see if the zerk has

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.910 
with rays and we'll see if the zerk has
learned<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> cope<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.240> last<00:01:27.450> game

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
learned how to cope from that last game

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.200 
learned how to cope from that last game
maybe<00:01:28.920> try<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> get<00:01:29.310> out<00:01:29.400> some<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:29.759> lurkers

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
maybe try to get out some more lurkers

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.289 
maybe try to get out some more lurkers
this<00:01:30.390> time<00:01:30.630> oh<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.229> cloak<00:01:31.439> coming<00:01:31.770> up<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.299> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
gas so he got quite a few drone kills

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.990 
gas so he got quite a few drone kills
there<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:50.100> he's<00:01:50.250> backing<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.880> his

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
can back off and just I group up more

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.160 
can back off and just I group up more
repairs<00:01:56.670> race<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.420> go<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:57.990> another

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
repairs race and then go in for another

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.130 
repairs race and then go in for another
attack<00:01:58.530> run<00:01:59.450> if<00:02:00.450> he<00:02:00.509> keeps<00:02:00.719> doing<00:02:00.990> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
attack run if he keeps doing that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.109 
attack run if he keeps doing that
eventually<00:02:01.770> he<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.130> win<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.759> he'll<00:02:02.969> be

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
eventually he will win because he'll be

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.819 
eventually he will win because he'll be
able<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.450> out<00:02:03.479> his<00:02:03.869> medical<00:02:04.290> marine<00:02:04.530> force

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
here and push into the natural because

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.930 
here and push into the natural because
the<00:02:07.560> Zerg<00:02:07.740> will<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.190> far<00:02:08.399> behind<00:02:08.550> because

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the Zerg will be so far behind because

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.740 
the Zerg will be so far behind because
of<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> drones<00:02:09.539> he<00:02:09.750> lost

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
of all the drones he lost

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.560 
of all the drones he lost
here<00:02:11.500> come<00:02:11.740> here<00:02:12.430> comes<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.790> Academy<00:02:13.360> and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
here come here comes the Academy and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.520 
here come here comes the Academy and
another<00:02:13.810> supply<00:02:14.170> depot<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.710> think<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.670> uh

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
another supply depot I think and uh

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.170 
another supply depot I think and uh
looks<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.740> circus<00:02:18.010> stop<00:02:18.430> mining<00:02:18.760> gasps

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
looks like the circus stop mining gasps

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
and the butyl is here but I think there

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.390 
and the butyl is here but I think there
are<00:02:58.300> way<00:02:58.600> more<00:02:58.630> race<00:02:59.080> here<00:02:59.410> but<00:02:59.739> lateis<00:03:00.130> got<00:03:00.280> to

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
back off now that the hydrilla star

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.199 
back off now that the hydrilla star
coming<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.530> leaders<00:03:03.220> actually<00:03:03.370> losing<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.970> lot

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
coming in leaders actually losing a lot

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
fight with these Ray's but I don't think

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.110 
fight with these Ray's but I don't think
he's<00:03:08.200> going<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.440> win<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:08.709> battle<00:03:09.120> desert

coming<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.570> with<00:03:10.720> an<00:03:10.810> awful<00:03:11.230> lot<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.500> mutis

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
coming in with an awful lot of mutis

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.050 
coming in with an awful lot of mutis
there<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:13.110> Lita<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.230> left<00:03:14.650> with<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.250> fraction

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
there and Lita is left with a fraction

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.449 
there and Lita is left with a fraction
of<00:03:16.180> his<00:03:16.840> race<00:03:17.080> squad<00:03:17.530> although<00:03:17.950> he<00:03:17.980> still<00:03:18.130> has

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
of his race squad although he still has

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.350 
of his race squad although he still has
so<00:03:19.000> many<00:03:19.269> rays<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:21.580> he's<00:03:21.910> going<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.180> have<00:03:22.330> to

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
so many rays and he's going to have to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.060 
so many rays and he's going to have to
bring<00:03:22.570> in<00:03:22.720> more<00:03:22.840> SUVs<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.440> repair<00:03:23.769> them<00:03:23.980> I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
bring in more SUVs to repair them I

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.460 
bring in more SUVs to repair them I
think<00:03:24.340> now<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.630> Zerg<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.959> getting<00:03:26.200> up<00:03:26.320> a

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
think now that the Zerg is getting up a

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.380 
think now that the Zerg is getting up a
much<00:03:26.680> stronger<00:03:27.010> economy<00:03:27.640> now<00:03:27.820> he's<00:03:28.030> mine<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
much stronger economy now he's mine and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.970 
much stronger economy now he's mine and
gas<00:03:28.540> so<00:03:29.140> he's<00:03:29.260> going<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.440> be<00:03:29.560> able<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.799> support

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
gas so he's going to be able to support

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.070 
gas so he's going to be able to support
more<00:03:30.580> muta<00:03:31.299> lyst<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:33.750> eventually<00:03:34.750> might<00:03:34.989> be

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
more muta lyst and eventually might be

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.720 
more muta lyst and eventually might be
able<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.290> get<00:03:35.410> lurkers<00:03:35.769> out<00:03:35.890> as<00:03:36.040> well<00:03:36.190> we'll

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
able to get lurkers out as well we'll

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.340 
able to get lurkers out as well we'll
see<00:03:36.880> what<00:03:37.000> he<00:03:37.060> does<00:03:37.090> with<00:03:37.390> those<00:03:37.570> hydrolyse<00:03:38.230> if

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
see what he does with those hydrolyse if

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.569 
see what he does with those hydrolyse if
he<00:03:38.440> just<00:03:38.650> keeps<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.950> hydrolysed<00:03:39.370> there<00:03:39.549> I

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
he just keeps the hydrolysed there I

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:40.949 
he just keeps the hydrolysed there I
think<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:40.060> would<00:03:40.150> actually<00:03:40.180> be<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.690> good

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
think that would actually be a good

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.229 
think that would actually be a good
investment<00:03:41.530> since<00:03:42.190> you'll<00:03:42.310> be<00:03:42.340> able<00:03:42.519> to<00:03:42.820> pick

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
investment since you'll be able to pick

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.210 
investment since you'll be able to pick
at<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.920> Rays<00:03:44.920> from<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.370> ground<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.980> think

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
at the Rays from the ground and I think

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.710 
at the Rays from the ground and I think
the<00:03:48.370> zerk<00:03:48.579> just<00:03:48.880> got<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.150> scout<00:03:49.390> with<00:03:49.570> that

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
the zerk just got the scout with that

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.539 
the zerk just got the scout with that
zergling<00:03:50.170> scout<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.920> ran<00:03:51.100> into<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.430> base

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
zergling scout that ran into the base

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.360 
zergling scout that ran into the base
and<00:03:51.760> saw<00:03:51.970> those<00:03:52.269> barracks<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.799> he<00:03:53.890> knows<00:03:54.100> about

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
and saw those barracks so he knows about

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.430 
and saw those barracks so he knows about
all<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:55.000> Marines<00:03:55.540> that<00:03:55.660> are<00:03:55.810> right<00:03:55.930> out<00:03:56.170> right

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
all the Marines that are right out right

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.259 
all the Marines that are right out right
now<00:03:56.620> but<00:03:56.890> still<00:03:57.160> no<00:03:57.370> medics<00:03:57.700> okay<00:03:58.000> there's<00:03:58.180> a

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
now but still no medics okay there's a

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.360 
now but still no medics okay there's a
couple<00:03:58.510> medics<00:03:58.930> out<00:03:59.110> now<00:03:59.290> for<00:03:59.860> Lita<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:00.340> I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
couple medics out now for Lita so I

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.009 
couple medics out now for Lita so I
think<00:04:00.459> Lita<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:00.880> going<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.239> push<00:04:01.450> soon<00:04:01.690> as<00:04:01.870> soon

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
think Lita is going to push soon as soon

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.650 
think Lita is going to push soon as soon
as<00:04:02.170> his<00:04:02.350> razor<00:04:02.980> repaired<00:04:03.549> is<00:04:04.090> repairing<00:04:04.540> those

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
as his razor repaired is repairing those

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.270 
as his razor repaired is repairing those
race<00:04:04.870> right<00:04:05.140> now<00:04:05.170> getting<00:04:05.530> them<00:04:05.709> all<00:04:05.829> prepared

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
race right now getting them all prepared

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.740 
race right now getting them all prepared
and<00:04:06.489> ready<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.820> push<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.600> front<00:04:09.209> but<00:04:10.209> race<00:04:10.450> are

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
and ready to push the front but race are

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.030 
and ready to push the front but race are
about<00:04:11.380> as<00:04:11.530> fragile<00:04:11.829> as<00:04:12.420> origami<00:04:13.420> paper<00:04:13.840> I<00:04:14.320> mean

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
about as fragile as origami paper I mean

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.560 
about as fragile as origami paper I mean
you<00:04:15.130> could<00:04:15.220> make<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.579> wraith<00:04:15.850> out<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.180> work<00:04:16.329> on

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
you could make a wraith out of work on

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.330 
you could make a wraith out of work on
me<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:17.049> would<00:04:17.229> be<00:04:17.260> just<00:04:17.530> as<00:04:17.739> strong<00:04:17.829> as<00:04:18.220> the

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
me it would be just as strong as the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.520 
me it would be just as strong as the
Wraith<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.729> starcraft

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
Wraith in starcraft

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.560 
Wraith in starcraft
it<00:04:21.040> looks<00:04:21.190> like<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.850> Zerg<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.240> don't<00:04:22.360> think<00:04:22.510> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
it looks like the Zerg I don't think the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.150 
it looks like the Zerg I don't think the
Zerkers<00:04:22.900> expanded<00:04:23.410> again<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:23.800> he<00:04:23.889> might<00:04:24.010> be

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
Zerkers expanded again so he might be

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.640 
Zerkers expanded again so he might be
stuck<00:04:24.460> in<00:04:24.610> his<00:04:24.730> two<00:04:25.660> bases<00:04:26.020> here<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.350> zerk<00:04:26.530> is

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
stuck in his two bases here the zerk is

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.170 
stuck in his two bases here the zerk is
actually<00:04:26.950> in<00:04:27.040> huge<00:04:27.400> trouble<00:04:27.670> here<00:04:27.940> since

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
actually in huge trouble here since

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.270 
actually in huge trouble here since
there<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.389> a<00:04:28.420> big<00:04:28.780> force<00:04:29.110> outside<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:30.160> his

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
there is a big force outside of his

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.850 
there is a big force outside of his
natural<00:04:30.490> expansion<00:04:31.139> he's<00:04:32.139> got<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.560> keep<00:04:32.800> his

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
natural expansion he's got to keep his

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.220 
natural expansion he's got to keep his
butyl<00:04:33.370> as<00:04:33.460> close<00:04:33.790> he's<00:04:34.389> got<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.720> do<00:04:34.840> something

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
butyl as close he's got to do something

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.440 
butyl as close he's got to do something
about<00:04:35.350> this<00:04:35.620> but<00:04:35.980> if<00:04:36.160> he<00:04:36.310> if<00:04:36.610> this<00:04:36.910> if<00:04:37.150> things

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
about this but if he if this if things

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.140 
about this but if he if this if things
go<00:04:37.690> too<00:04:38.680> much<00:04:38.830> like<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.220> last<00:04:39.430> game<00:04:39.700> he's<00:04:39.970> just

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
go too much like the last game he's just

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.700 
go too much like the last game he's just
going<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.330> be<00:04:40.480> contained<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.290> eventually

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
going to be contained in and eventually

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.740 
going to be contained in and eventually
pushed<00:04:41.980> by<00:04:42.190> lita<00:04:42.460> leaders<00:04:43.210> come<00:04:43.419> with<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.600> very

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
pushed by lita leaders come with a very

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.690 
pushed by lita leaders come with a very
strong<00:04:43.840> game<00:04:44.290> plan<00:04:44.500> today<00:04:44.680> only<00:04:44.950> going<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.610> be

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
strong game plan today only going to be

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.700 
strong game plan today only going to be
intercepted<00:04:46.210> by<00:04:46.240> cloaked<00:04:46.660> race<00:04:46.900> here<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.320> the

intercepted by cloaked race here and the
Overlord<00:04:48.100> coming<00:04:48.400> in<00:04:48.490> for<00:04:48.700> a<00:04:48.760> very<00:04:48.940> late<00:04:49.230> I'm

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
Overlord coming in for a very late I'm

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.350 
Overlord coming in for a very late I'm
surprised<00:04:50.800> mute<00:04:51.460> elastic<00:04:51.820> go<00:04:51.940> down<00:04:52.150> there<00:04:52.330> I

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
surprised mute elastic go down there I

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.970 
surprised mute elastic go down there I
don't<00:04:52.419> think<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.930> saw<00:04:53.140> a<00:04:53.169> new<00:04:53.380> mutants<00:04:53.740> pop

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
don't think I saw a new mutants pop

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.720 
don't think I saw a new mutants pop
there<00:04:55.380> from<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.500> Zerg<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.860> Zerg<00:04:57.040> still<00:04:57.520> has

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
there from the Zerg the Zerg still has

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.310 
there from the Zerg the Zerg still has
his<00:04:57.910> hydrolyse<00:04:58.360> in<00:04:58.510> here<00:04:58.660> trying<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:58.960> pick<00:04:59.169> at

his hydrolyse in here trying to pick at

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
those raised with hydrolysed this is

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.240 
those raised with hydrolysed this is
looking<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.390> lot<00:05:01.570> like<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.990> last<00:05:02.200> game<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:02.770> the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
looking a lot like the last game and the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.550 
looking a lot like the last game and the
rate<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:04.030> Zerg<00:05:04.480> is<00:05:04.660> going<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:04.990> have<00:05:05.230> to

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
it he's going to try to group up enough

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.420 
it he's going to try to group up enough
circlings<00:05:19.030> to<00:05:19.150> eventually<00:05:19.540> push<00:05:19.780> out<00:05:19.990> and

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
circlings to eventually push out and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.280

right now he's pushing out now which is
actually<00:05:28.330> a<00:05:28.540> good<00:05:28.900> idea<00:05:28.960> i<00:05:29.320> think<00:05:29.350> but<00:05:29.620> he's

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
actually a good idea i think but he's

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.350 
actually a good idea i think but he's
still<00:05:29.950> got<00:05:30.010> a<00:05:30.160> fight<00:05:30.460> with<00:05:30.640> these<00:05:30.790> rays<00:05:31.090> he

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
with the same strategy again but it was

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.900 
with the same strategy again but it was
a<00:06:03.729> very<00:06:03.910> nice<00:06:04.270> strategy<00:06:05.010> did<00:06:06.010> not<00:06:06.039> allow<00:06:06.580> a<00:06:06.610> lot

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
a very nice strategy did not allow a lot

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.000 
a very nice strategy did not allow a lot
of<00:06:07.030> options<00:06:07.450> for<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.780> Zerg<00:06:07.990> to<00:06:08.320> break<00:06:08.590> out<00:06:08.800> or

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
of options for the Zerg to break out or

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.830 
of options for the Zerg to break out or
do<00:06:09.160> anything<00:06:09.400> different<00:06:09.940> and<00:06:10.330> I<00:06:10.390> think<00:06:10.690> the

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
do anything different and I think the

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.620 
do anything different and I think the
zurich<00:06:11.110> he<00:06:11.470> was<00:06:11.620> just<00:06:11.830> a<00:06:12.010> few<00:06:12.370> zergling<00:06:13.210> short

there a few muta lyst shorter's he was

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.909 
there a few muta lyst shorter's he was
just<00:06:15.820> a<00:06:15.910> few<00:06:16.150> troops<00:06:16.450> short<00:06:16.810> of<00:06:16.960> being<00:06:17.590> able<00:06:17.770> to

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
just a few troops short of being able to

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.050 
just a few troops short of being able to
break<00:06:18.160> out<00:06:18.340> of<00:06:18.370> that<00:06:18.490> because<00:06:18.789> he<00:06:18.880> almost

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060
