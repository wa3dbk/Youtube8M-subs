for<00:00:24.150> better<00:00:24.359> graphics<00:00:24.750> now<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
for better graphics now this is going to

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.609 
for better graphics now this is going to
be<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> short<00:00:26.519> video<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:27.029> membrane<00:00:27.990> dynamics

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
be a short video on membrane dynamics

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.429 
be a short video on membrane dynamics
and<00:00:28.830> mobility<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.939> membrane<00:00:30.599> components

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and mobility of membrane components

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.500 
and mobility of membrane components
so<00:00:31.980> how<00:00:32.130> components<00:00:32.820> within<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.300> cell

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so how components within the cell

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.690 
so how components within the cell
membrane<00:00:33.899> move<00:00:34.260> around<00:00:34.559> we<00:00:35.280> talked<00:00:35.550> about

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
membrane move around we talked about

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
membrane move around we talked about
cholesterol<00:00:36.149> before<00:00:36.809> moving<00:00:37.110> around<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:37.649> we

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
cholesterol before moving around now we

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.500 
cholesterol before moving around now we
can<00:00:37.950> talk<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> lipids<00:00:38.940> moving<00:00:39.329> around

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
can talk about the lipids moving around

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.069 
can talk about the lipids moving around
so<00:00:40.200> membrane<00:00:40.800> lipid<00:00:41.250> dynamics<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.899> I'll

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
so membrane lipid dynamics so here I'll

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.380 
so membrane lipid dynamics so here I'll
draw<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> lipid<00:00:43.770> bilayer<00:00:43.950> again<00:00:46.789> we<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:48.000> um

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
draw the lipid bilayer again we have um

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.740 
draw the lipid bilayer again we have um
the<00:00:49.320> extracellular<00:00:49.920> fluid<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:50.879> outside<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the extracellular fluid here outside and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.290 
the extracellular fluid here outside and
the<00:00:51.870> intracellular<00:00:52.320> fluid<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.890> inside<00:00:53.340> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the intracellular fluid the inside so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
the intracellular fluid the inside so
there<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.539> two<00:00:54.840> mechanisms<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.559> membrane

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
there are two mechanisms of membrane

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
there are two mechanisms of membrane
lipid<00:00:56.250> dynamics<00:00:56.670> there's<00:00:56.910> uncatted<00:00:57.420> eyes<00:00:57.690> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
lipid dynamics there's uncatted eyes in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.250 
lipid dynamics there's uncatted eyes in
there<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.440> catalyzed<00:00:59.000> uncut<00:01:00.000> alized<00:01:00.270> or

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
there and is catalyzed uncut alized or

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
there and is catalyzed uncut alized or
in<00:01:01.620> uncut<00:01:02.160> alized<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.940> what's<00:01:03.239> called

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
in uncut alized we have what's called

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.440 
in uncut alized we have what's called
the<00:01:03.660> trans<00:01:04.140> by<00:01:04.530> layer<00:01:04.830> diffusion<00:01:05.369> also<00:01:06.150> called

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the trans by layer diffusion also called

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.920 
the trans by layer diffusion also called
flip<00:01:06.869> flop<00:01:07.159> which<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> funny<00:01:08.729> name<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.119> this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
flip flop which is a funny name and this

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.109 
flip flop which is a funny name and this
process<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> actually<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.400> slow<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.850> takes

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
process is actually very slow and takes

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.230 
process is actually very slow and takes
days<00:01:12.650> this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.799> essentially<00:01:14.430> when<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> lipid

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
days this is essentially when a lipid

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.950 
days this is essentially when a lipid
from<00:01:15.570> one<00:01:15.869> layer<00:01:16.110> moves<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.100> another<00:01:17.400> layer

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
from one layer moves to another layer

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.039 
from one layer moves to another layer
the<00:01:18.960> second<00:01:19.439> type<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.650> uncatted<00:01:20.250> eyes<00:01:20.549> are

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
the second type of uncatted eyes are

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.539 
the second type of uncatted eyes are
movement<00:01:22.110> dynamics<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> what's<00:01:23.159> called<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
movement dynamics is what's called the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.730 
movement dynamics is what's called the
lateral<00:01:23.820> diffusion<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:25.080> process<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
lateral diffusion and this process is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.359 
lateral diffusion and this process is
very<00:01:26.130> fast<00:01:26.580> because<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:28.320> lipid<00:01:28.770> structure

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
very fast because the lipid structure

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.249 
very fast because the lipid structure
essentially<00:01:30.030> moves<00:01:30.270> within<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> same<00:01:30.869> plane

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
essentially moves within the same plane

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
essentially moves within the same plane
on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.250> same<00:01:32.520> layer<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.540> why<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.780> is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
on the same layer and that is why it is

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.749 
on the same layer and that is why it is
fast<00:01:34.909> now<00:01:35.909> let's<00:01:36.119> look<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> catalyzed<00:01:37.110> our

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
fast now let's look at the catalyzed our

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.910 
fast now let's look at the catalyzed our
membrane<00:01:38.759> lipid<00:01:39.030> dynamics<00:01:39.479> which<00:01:40.470> uses

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
membrane lipid dynamics which uses

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.569 
membrane lipid dynamics which uses
proteins<00:01:41.579> enzymes<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.960> move<00:01:43.140> lipids<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:44.310> one

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
proteins enzymes to move lipids from one

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.999 
proteins enzymes to move lipids from one
layer<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.119> other<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:46.200> will<00:01:46.799> obviously

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
layer to the other which will obviously

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.580 
layer to the other which will obviously
lower<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.970> activation<00:01:48.119> energy<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:49.200> this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
lower the activation energy so this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.319 
lower the activation energy so this
process<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.159> be<00:01:50.189> faster<00:01:50.790> than<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> tribes

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
process will be faster than the tribes

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
process will be faster than the tribes
by<00:01:51.659> layer<00:01:51.899> diffusion<00:01:52.470> process<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.310> very

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
by layer diffusion process which is very

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.870 
by layer diffusion process which is very
slow<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.799> example<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.759> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
slow so for example if we have the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
slow so for example if we have the
extracellular<00:01:57.270> fluid<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> enzyme

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
extracellular fluid here the enzyme

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.039 
extracellular fluid here the enzyme
lipase<00:01:59.070> which<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.479> process<00:02:00.689> also

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
lipase which is a the process also

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.469 
lipase which is a the process also
called<00:02:01.320> flip<00:02:01.530> base<00:02:01.649> requires<00:02:02.340> ATP<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
called flip base requires ATP and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.300 
called flip base requires ATP and
essentially<00:02:04.020> moves<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.350> lipid<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.130> outer

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
essentially moves a lipid on the outer

two<00:03:06.370> things<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.700> want<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.910> point<00:03:06.970> out<00:03:07.240> here<00:03:07.390> one

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
two things I want to point out here one

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.920 
two things I want to point out here one
is<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.310> lipid<00:03:09.760> can<00:03:10.090> move<00:03:10.360> around<00:03:10.630> on<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
is that the lipid can move around on the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.540 
is that the lipid can move around on the
same<00:03:11.200> plane<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.830> this<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.190> sort<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.490> like

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
same plane and this is sort of like

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.640 
same plane and this is sort of like
lateral<00:03:13.210> diffusion<00:03:13.510> from<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.870> uncut<00:03:14.410> alized

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
lateral diffusion from the uncut alized

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.260 
lateral diffusion from the uncut alized
version<00:03:15.040> but<00:03:15.550> essentially<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:16.150> move

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
version but essentially can move

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.199 
version but essentially can move
anywhere<00:03:16.870> within<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.620> same<00:03:17.830> layer<00:03:18.209> around

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
anywhere within the same layer around

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.190 
anywhere within the same layer around
the<00:03:19.330> same<00:03:19.540> plane<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.330> lipid<00:03:22.750> itself

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
the same plane and to the lipid itself

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.670 
the same plane and to the lipid itself
can<00:03:23.620> rotate<00:03:24.900> obviously<00:03:25.900> because<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.560> in

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
can rotate obviously because it is in

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.699 
can rotate obviously because it is in
constant<00:03:26.950> motion<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.440> finally<00:03:29.440> I<00:03:29.470> would<00:03:29.620> like

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
constant motion and finally I would like

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.220 
constant motion and finally I would like
to<00:03:29.830> mention<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.730> fatty<00:03:31.390> acid<00:03:31.810> chain<00:03:32.020> can

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
to mention that the fatty acid chain can

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.170 
to mention that the fatty acid chain can
actually<00:03:32.530> flex<00:03:32.860> can<00:03:33.220> move<00:03:33.400> around<00:03:33.520> because

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
actually flex can move around because

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.060 
actually flex can move around because
there's<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.870> sort<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.470> fluid<00:03:35.890> environment

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
there's a sort of a fluid environment

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.990 
there's a sort of a fluid environment
within<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.880> bilayer<00:03:37.950> interesting<00:03:38.950> now<00:03:39.850> let's

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
within the bilayer interesting now let's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.310 
within the bilayer interesting now let's
talk<00:03:40.150> about<00:03:40.209> how<00:03:40.540> membrane<00:03:41.020> fluidity

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
talk about how membrane fluidity

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.780 
talk about how membrane fluidity
fluidity<00:03:42.250> itself<00:03:42.820> is<00:03:42.970> influenced<00:03:43.980> now<00:03:44.980> what

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
fluidity itself is influenced now what

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.970 
fluidity itself is influenced now what
influences<00:03:46.360> membrane<00:03:46.720> fluidity<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.290> most

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
influences membrane fluidity it most

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.390 
influences membrane fluidity it most
importantly<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.940> two<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.390> temperature<00:03:50.140> and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
importantly the two is temperature and

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.000 
importantly the two is temperature and
also<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.670> fatty<00:03:51.940> acid<00:03:52.540> composition<00:03:52.980> what<00:03:53.980> I

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
also the fatty acid composition what I

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.310 
also the fatty acid composition what I
mean<00:03:54.220> by<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.400> is<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.450> fatty<00:03:55.660> acid<00:03:56.080> length

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
mean by this is the fatty acid length

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.140 
mean by this is the fatty acid length
for<00:03:56.590> example<00:03:56.950> or<00:03:57.130> if<00:03:57.340> they<00:03:57.459> can<00:03:57.670> stain

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
for example or if they can stain

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.980 
for example or if they can stain
unsaturated<00:03:58.990> and<00:03:59.170> saturated<00:03:59.470> double<00:04:00.190> bonds

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
unsaturated and saturated double bonds

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.380 
unsaturated and saturated double bonds
so<00:04:01.990> to<00:04:02.560> do<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.950> show<00:04:03.459> you<00:04:03.520> an<00:04:03.580> example<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:04.180> would

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
so to do to show you an example I would

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.630 
so to do to show you an example I would
like<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.630> draw<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.110> two<00:04:05.760> membrane<00:04:06.760> by<00:04:06.970> layers

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
like to draw you two membrane by layers

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.210 
like to draw you two membrane by layers
so<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:10.050> interior<00:04:11.050> consists<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.680> some<00:04:11.920> form<00:04:12.160> of

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
so the interior consists of some form of

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.550 
so the interior consists of some form of
fluid<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:12.760> it's<00:04:12.910> in<00:04:13.000> constant<00:04:13.270> motion<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:14.260> if

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
fluid and it's in constant motion so if

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.920 
fluid and it's in constant motion so if
you<00:04:14.650> can<00:04:14.800> imagine<00:04:14.920> that<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:16.270> fatty<00:04:16.510> acid

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
you can imagine that the fatty acid

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.440 
you can imagine that the fatty acid
chain<00:04:17.169> is<00:04:17.440> just<00:04:18.040> moving<00:04:18.370> within<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:19.120> bilayer

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
chain is just moving within the bilayer

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.800 
chain is just moving within the bilayer
and<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.530> also<00:04:21.250> enhanced<00:04:21.880> with<00:04:22.360> increased

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
and this is also enhanced with increased

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.950 
and this is also enhanced with increased
temperature<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.500> also<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.720> important<00:04:25.720> feature

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
temperature and also a important feature

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.260 
temperature and also a important feature
is<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.710> fatty

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
is the fatty

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.150 
is the fatty
composition<00:04:27.780> because<00:04:28.710> if<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:29.009> have

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
composition because if you have

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.589 
composition because if you have
unsaturated<00:04:29.970> fatty<00:04:30.479> acids<00:04:30.930> it's<00:04:31.310> more

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
unsaturated fatty acids it's more

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:36.469 
unsaturated fatty acids it's more
flexible<00:04:33.599> because<00:04:34.229> it<00:04:34.710> melts<00:04:35.280> quicker<00:04:35.909> than

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
flexible because it melts quicker than

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.600 
flexible because it melts quicker than
saturated<00:04:36.750> fatty<00:04:37.349> acids<00:04:37.710> just<00:04:38.340> think<00:04:38.490> about

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
saturated fatty acids just think about

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.680 
saturated fatty acids just think about
it<00:04:38.819> now<00:04:39.750> if<00:04:40.050> we<00:04:40.500> for<00:04:41.159> example<00:04:41.389> decrease<00:04:42.389> the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
it now if we for example decrease the

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.790 
it now if we for example decrease the
temperature<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:43.490> within<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.789> membrane<00:04:45.800> this

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
temperature of within the membrane this

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.339 
temperature of within the membrane this
will<00:04:47.430> cause<00:04:47.759> the<00:04:48.180> whole<00:04:48.599> structure<00:04:49.110> to

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
will cause the whole structure to

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.129 
will cause the whole structure to
stiffen<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:50.099> can<00:04:50.280> say<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.729> so<00:04:51.419> it's<00:04:51.690> not<00:04:51.930> as

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
stiffen you can say and so it's not as

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.070 
stiffen you can say and so it's not as

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
protip protect protectant molecules and

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.100 
protip protect protectant molecules and
this<00:05:56.400> will<00:05:56.610> help<00:05:56.789> obviously<00:05:57.389> protect<00:05:57.840> the

this will help obviously protect the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.110 
this will help obviously protect the
membrane<00:05:58.590> and<00:05:58.800> also<00:05:59.490> the<00:05:59.639> cell's<00:05:59.940> energy

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
membrane and also the cell's energy

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.959 
membrane and also the cell's energy
status<00:06:00.659> and<00:06:00.960> metabolism<00:06:01.409> so<00:06:02.310> whether<00:06:02.550> the

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
status and metabolism so whether the

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.019 
status and metabolism so whether the
cell<00:06:03.240> needs<00:06:03.569> energy<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:04.289> so<00:06:04.889> this<00:06:05.219> influences

00:06:06.019 --> 00:06:06.029 
cell needs energy and so this influences

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:08.659 
cell needs energy and so this influences
our<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.719> permeability<00:06:07.169> etc<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.009> another

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
our the permeability etc and another

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.510 
our the permeability etc and another
important<00:06:09.539> thing<00:06:09.719> which<00:06:10.319> is<00:06:10.529> also<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.310> do<00:06:11.490> with

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
important thing which is also to do with

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.159 
important thing which is also to do with
basically<00:06:12.360> everything<00:06:12.840> that<00:06:12.870> I<00:06:12.990> just

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
basically everything that I just

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.519 
basically everything that I just
mentioned<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.680> membrane<00:06:14.370> proteins<00:06:15.529> because

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529 
mentioned is membrane proteins because

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.370 
mentioned is membrane proteins because
membrane<00:06:16.949> proteins<00:06:17.490> are<00:06:17.669> enzymes

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
membrane proteins are enzymes

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.589 
membrane proteins are enzymes
transporters<00:06:19.380> and<00:06:19.969> also<00:06:20.969> essentially

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
transporters and also essentially

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.200 
transporters and also essentially
increases<00:06:22.050> permeability<00:06:22.560> of<00:06:23.130> certain<00:06:23.759> ions

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
increases permeability of certain ions

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.870 
increases permeability of certain ions
and<00:06:24.710> basically<00:06:25.710> helps<00:06:26.039> maintain<00:06:26.219> the

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
and basically helps maintain the

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.689 
and basically helps maintain the
membrane<00:06:27.300> structure<00:06:28.069> as<00:06:29.069> a<00:06:29.130> vital<00:06:29.520> role<00:06:29.639> in

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
membrane structure as a vital role in

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.430 
membrane structure as a vital role in
protecting<00:06:30.539> the<00:06:30.659> membrane<00:06:30.990> structure<00:06:31.259> as

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
protecting the membrane structure as

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.559 
protecting the membrane structure as
well<00:06:31.560> so<00:06:32.340> membrane<00:06:32.729> proteins<00:06:33.180> now<00:06:33.509> the

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:33.569 
well so membrane proteins now the

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:37.249 
well so membrane proteins now the
fluidity<00:06:35.000> must<00:06:36.000> be<00:06:36.180> optimal<00:06:36.630> for<00:06:36.899> the

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
fluidity must be optimal for the

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.800 
fluidity must be optimal for the
function<00:06:37.710> of<00:06:37.830> membrane<00:06:38.219> proteins<00:06:38.250> and<00:06:38.909> we'll

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
function of membrane proteins and we'll

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.640 
function of membrane proteins and we'll
look<00:06:40.080> into

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
look into

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.040 
look into
proteins<00:06:41.220> in<00:06:41.310> the<00:06:41.370> next<00:06:41.610> video<00:06:41.940> in<00:06:42.150> more

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
proteins in the next video in more

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.409 
proteins in the next video in more
detail<00:06:43.470> but<00:06:44.250> let's<00:06:44.430> just<00:06:44.580> look<00:06:44.850> at<00:06:45.000> a<00:06:45.060> quick

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
detail but let's just look at a quick

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.840 
detail but let's just look at a quick
overview<00:06:45.810> what<00:06:46.350> our<00:06:46.470> membrane<00:06:46.740> proteins<00:06:47.130> well

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
overview what our membrane proteins well

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.730 
overview what our membrane proteins well
there<00:06:48.120> can<00:06:48.270> be<00:06:48.300> transporters<00:06:48.990> they<00:06:49.470> can<00:06:49.650> be

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
there can be transporters they can be

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.610 
there can be transporters they can be
receptors<00:06:50.220> energy<00:06:51.150> transducers<00:06:51.840> they<00:06:52.380> can<00:06:52.560> be

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
receptors energy transducers they can be

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.460 
receptors energy transducers they can be
enzymes<00:06:53.160> and<00:06:53.960> obviously<00:06:54.960> that<00:06:55.080> can<00:06:55.199> influence

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
enzymes and obviously that can influence

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.820 
enzymes and obviously that can influence
permeability<00:06:56.780> so<00:06:57.780> this<00:06:58.139> video<00:06:58.410> was<00:06:58.560> talking

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
permeability so this video was talking

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.320 
permeability so this video was talking
about<00:06:58.889> membrane<00:06:59.310> dynamics<00:06:59.759> and<00:07:00.030> lipid

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
about membrane dynamics and lipid

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.999 
about membrane dynamics and lipid
membrane<00:07:00.660> dynamics<00:07:01.050> our<00:07:01.289> next<00:07:01.650> video<00:07:01.860> we'll

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009 
membrane dynamics our next video we'll

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.180 
membrane dynamics our next video we'll
look<00:07:02.100> at<00:07:02.160> the<00:07:02.310> membrane<00:07:02.940> proteins<00:07:03.479> in<00:07:03.690> more

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
look at the membrane proteins in more
