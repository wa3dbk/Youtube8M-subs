ridiculous amounts of money on at hobby
shops<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> online<00:01:35.430> stores<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.180> actually

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
shops and online stores but I actually

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.530 
shops and online stores but I actually
like<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.770> figure<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.820> don't<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
like this figure I don't think you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
like this figure I don't think you
should<00:01:39.689> pay<00:01:39.869> more<00:01:40.170> than<00:01:40.950> what<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:41.939> for

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
should pay more than what it's going for

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.170 
should pay more than what it's going for
on<00:01:42.420> Rita<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.020> think<00:01:43.320> again<00:01:44.030> maybe<00:01:46.490> $20<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.909> think

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
on Rita I think again maybe $20 I think

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.609 
on Rita I think again maybe $20 I think
is<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> most<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.780> should<00:01:48.960> pay<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
is the most you should pay for this

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
is the most you should pay for this
figure<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> don't<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> should<00:01:50.880> pay<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
figure I don't think you should pay the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.550 
figure I don't think you should pay the
$40<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.170> some<00:01:52.380> collectors<00:01:52.799> and

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
$40 at some collectors and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.460 
$40 at some collectors and
Lancers<00:01:53.890> are<00:01:54.009> asking<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:54.460> but<00:01:55.420> he<00:01:55.689> is<00:01:56.140> very

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
Lancers are asking for but he is very

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.380 
Lancers are asking for but he is very
difficult<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.100> find<00:01:57.130> now<00:01:57.729> because<00:01:58.149> some<00:01:58.360> of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
difficult to find now because some of

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.359 
difficult to find now because some of
the<00:01:58.570> Marvel<00:01:58.960> Universe<00:01:58.990> waves<00:01:59.619> did<00:01:59.979> not<00:02:00.159> make

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
the Marvel Universe waves did not make

the Marvel Universe waves did not make
it<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:00.610> retail<00:02:01.090> but<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.799> thought<00:02:02.799> you<00:02:03.039> know

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
it on retail but I thought you know

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.999 
it on retail but I thought you know
she's<00:02:04.119> not<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.570> best<00:02:04.750> figure<00:02:04.990> in<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.770> line

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
she's not the best figure in the line

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.859 
she's not the best figure in the line
but<00:02:06.340> she's<00:02:06.939> not<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.420> bad

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
but she's not that bad

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.100 
but she's not that bad
anyway<00:02:08.220> she<00:02:09.220> comes<00:02:09.429> with<00:02:09.610> one<00:02:09.819> accessory<00:02:10.479> is

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
anyway she comes with one accessory is

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.370 
anyway she comes with one accessory is
