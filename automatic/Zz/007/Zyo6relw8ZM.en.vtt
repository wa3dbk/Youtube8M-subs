win<00:00:48.890> hey<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.100> got<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> car<00:00:50.489> now<00:00:56.480> all<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.570> uh

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
win hey we got a car now all right uh

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.160 
win hey we got a car now all right uh
first<00:00:58.230> thing<00:00:58.350> we're<00:00:58.440> gonna<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.710> is<00:01:00.050> see<00:01:01.050> what

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
first thing we're gonna do is see what

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770 
first thing we're gonna do is see what
upgrades<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> apply<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.149> car<00:01:03.329> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
upgrades we can apply for the car so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.990 
upgrades we can apply for the car so
first<00:01:04.769> engine<00:01:05.100> upgrades<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.820> go<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
first engine upgrades we go to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.960 
first engine upgrades we go to
conversion<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.840> us<00:01:07.159> go<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> engine<00:01:08.670> swap

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
conversion for us go to the engine swap

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.770 
conversion for us go to the engine swap

if if you want to swap the engine but I

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.640 
if if you want to swap the engine but I
rather<00:01:13.320> leave<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.130> stock<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.060> car<00:01:15.650> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
rather leave it stock in this car the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.399 
rather leave it stock in this car the

don't<00:01:20.220> need<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.430> change<00:01:20.640> anything<00:01:20.850> else<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
don't need to change anything else do it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
don't need to change anything else do it
it's<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.049> already<00:01:22.409> real<00:01:22.920> Drive<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.520> that's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it's like already real Drive so that's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.810 
it's like already real Drive so that's
what<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.180> need<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.220> aspiration<00:01:26.220> composite

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
what we need and aspiration composite

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.469 
what we need and aspiration composite
conversion<00:01:28.670> let's<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.850> put<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> single

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
conversion let's just put a single

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.190 
conversion let's just put a single
turbocharger<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.759> don't<00:01:33.600> upgrade<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
turbocharger in it the don't upgrade it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530 
turbocharger in it the don't upgrade it
go<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.799> will<00:01:34.920> cost<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.329> will

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
go it will cost more like and they will

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.060 
go it will cost more like and they will
give<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.930> too<00:01:37.170> much<00:01:37.290> horsepower<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:37.979> this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
give you too much horsepower for this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
give you too much horsepower for this
little<00:01:38.220> car<00:01:39.799> it's<00:01:40.799> only<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.100> small<00:01:41.369> lightweight

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
little car it's only a small lightweight

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.960 
little car it's only a small lightweight
cards<00:01:42.659> did<00:01:42.960> Allah<00:01:43.170> Akbar<00:01:43.680> yeah<00:01:44.220> turbos<00:01:44.759> is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
cards did Allah Akbar yeah turbos is

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.240 
cards did Allah Akbar yeah turbos is
gonna<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.540> bit<00:01:45.630> overkill<00:01:46.049> for

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
gonna be a little bit overkill for

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.280 
gonna be a little bit overkill for
specially<00:01:47.250> ugly<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.990> let's<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
specially ugly one let's go to the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.179 
specially ugly one let's go to the
engine<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.619> power<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:51.020> just<00:01:52.189> gonna

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
engine and power and just just gonna

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.569 
engine and power and just just gonna
give<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> car<00:01:53.579> around<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.170> 220<00:01:55.170> horsepower

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
give the car around like 220 horsepower

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.429 
give the car around like 220 horsepower
so<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.030> good<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:58.049> amount<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
so it's a good that's a good amount of

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.920 
so it's a good that's a good amount of
horsepower<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.729> beginner<00:02:00.680> but<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> Hachi

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:22.800 

I<00:02:19.920> take<00:02:20.920> quite<00:02:21.459> nope<00:02:21.820> quicker

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
I take quite nope quicker

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.740 
I take quite nope quicker
no<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:23.320> who<00:02:23.560> else<00:02:23.709> busy<00:02:24.130> doing<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
no there who else busy doing that the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.180 
no there who else busy doing that the
reason<00:02:25.990> we<00:02:26.050> don't<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.380> count<00:02:26.620> shaft<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
reason we don't be a count shaft in the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.770 
reason we don't be a count shaft in the
car<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:30.060> whilst<00:02:31.060> you're<00:02:31.240> upgrading<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
car is that whilst you're upgrading the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.720 
car is that whilst you're upgrading the
camshafts<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.590> will<00:02:32.680> give<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.040> maybe<00:02:33.220> 60

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
camshafts that will give you maybe 60

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.120 
camshafts that will give you maybe 60
horsepower<00:02:33.959> but<00:02:34.959> I'll<00:02:35.110> only<00:02:35.230> give<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.770> maybe

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
horsepower but I'll only give you maybe

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.110 
horsepower but I'll only give you maybe
ten<00:02:36.910> foot<00:02:37.239> pounds<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.630> torque<00:02:37.690> which<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:39.120> just

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
ten foot pounds of torque which is just

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.760 
ten foot pounds of torque which is just
not<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.720> best<00:02:40.840> idea

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
not the best idea

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.820 
not the best idea
yeah<00:02:42.520> torque<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.360> really<00:02:43.989> really<00:02:44.260> useful<00:02:44.709> when

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
yeah torque is really really useful when

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.240 
yeah torque is really really useful when
you<00:02:44.950> drift<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.450> yeah<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.690> got<00:02:46.840> around<00:02:47.250> 225

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
you drift it yeah we got around 225

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.560 
you drift it yeah we got around 225
horsepower<00:02:48.640> now<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.120> should<00:02:49.270> be<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> good

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
horsepower now that should be a good

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.110 
horsepower now that should be a good
amount<00:02:49.780> for<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.170> week<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> car<00:02:50.850> let's<00:02:51.850> just<00:02:52.000> go

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
amount for a week in a car let's just go

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.860 
amount for a week in a car let's just go
to<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.300> platform<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.870> handling<00:02:53.140> right<00:02:53.290> now

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
to the platform and handling right now

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.260 
to the platform and handling right now
upgraded<00:02:55.870> brakes<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.440> race<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:57.400> makes<00:02:58.180> you

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
upgraded brakes to race just makes you

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.510 
upgraded brakes to race just makes you
call<00:02:58.450> idle<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:58.930> it's<00:02:59.290> yeah<00:03:00.070> gives<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.370> better

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
call idle and it's yeah gives you better

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.410 
call idle and it's yeah gives you better
brakes<00:03:00.820> obviously<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:03.610> then<00:03:04.180> go<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.360> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
brakes obviously and then go to the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.550 
brakes obviously and then go to the
springs<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.959> dampers<00:03:07.320> springs<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.440> dampers

springs and dampers springs and dampers
we<00:03:09.040> gonna<00:03:09.670> pick<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.269> race<00:03:10.480> ones<00:03:10.840> for<00:03:11.049> that

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
we gonna pick the race ones for that

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.830 
we gonna pick the race ones for that
because<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:12.100> can<00:03:12.130> upgrade<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:13.060> basically

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
because you can upgrade and basically

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.870 
because you can upgrade and basically
everything<00:03:14.260> with<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:15.010> like<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.459> spring

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
everything with it so like the spring

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.660 
everything with it so like the spring
stiffness<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.980> gamble<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.100> all<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.400> sort

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
stiffness and gamble and all that sort

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.289 
stiffness and gamble and all that sort
of<00:03:18.730> stuff

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.520 

if<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.420> anti-roll<00:03:25.930> bars<00:03:27.959> make<00:03:28.959> them<00:03:29.110> race<00:03:29.320> as

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
if the anti-roll bars make them race as

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:39.660 
if the anti-roll bars make them race as
well<00:03:33.390> we<00:03:34.390> went<00:03:34.570> from<00:03:36.360> roll<00:03:37.360> cage<00:03:38.610> now<00:03:39.610> you

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
well we went from roll cage now you

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.789 
well we went from roll cage now you
should<00:03:40.000> use<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> race<00:03:40.540> roll<00:03:40.810> cage<00:03:40.989> that's<00:03:41.440> just

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
should use a race roll cage that's just

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.199 
should use a race roll cage that's just
what<00:03:42.489> most<00:03:43.030> most<00:03:43.480> people<00:03:43.840> use<00:03:44.290> it's<00:03:44.709> also<00:03:45.209> most

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
what most most people use it's also most

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.750 
what most most people use it's also most
unmowed<00:03:46.630> most<00:03:47.590> tournaments<00:03:47.799> is<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.579> need<00:03:48.730> to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
unmowed most tournaments is you need to

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.390 
unmowed most tournaments is you need to
raise<00:03:49.269> roll<00:03:49.510> cage<00:03:49.750> like<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.530> stock<00:03:50.980> roll<00:03:51.190> Kate

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
raise roll cage like a stock roll Kate

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.940 
raise roll cage like a stock roll Kate
or<00:03:51.549> whatever<00:03:51.790> it's<00:03:51.970> not<00:03:52.120> allowed<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.260> most<00:03:53.829> of

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
or whatever it's not allowed and most of

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.569 
or whatever it's not allowed and most of
the<00:03:54.040> tournament<00:03:56.040> you're<00:03:57.040> very<00:03:57.160> using<00:03:57.519> the

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
the tournament you're very using the

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.310 
the tournament you're very using the
roll<00:03:57.760> cage<00:03:57.910> anyway<00:03:58.329> is<00:03:58.420> that<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.930> gives<00:03:59.170> you

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
roll cage anyway is that it gives you

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.479 
roll cage anyway is that it gives you
car<00:03:59.530> along<00:03:59.769> for<00:03:59.950> stability

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
car along for stability

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.620 
car along for stability
yeah<00:04:00.880> but<00:04:01.150> it's<00:04:01.299> really<00:04:01.360> helpful

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.569
