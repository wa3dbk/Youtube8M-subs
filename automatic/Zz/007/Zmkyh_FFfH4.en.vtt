00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
decent area to actually record vlogs and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.270 
decent area to actually record vlogs and
now<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.570> may<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:41.159> not

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
now and what may do actually I'm not

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.359 
now and what may do actually I'm not
sure<00:01:41.369> about<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> by<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
sure about this is by a

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.710 
sure about this is by a
what-do-you-call-it<00:01:44.369> camcorder<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.630> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
what-do-you-call-it camcorder with a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.109 
what-do-you-call-it camcorder with a
tripod<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.409> sit<00:01:47.130> down<00:01:47.250> somewhere<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:47.909> back

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
tripod and sit down somewhere right back

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.700 
tripod and sit down somewhere right back
there<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.470> actually<00:01:50.009> spin<00:01:50.759> around<00:01:50.850> like

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
there and then actually spin around like

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.920 
there and then actually spin around like
this<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.880> camera<00:01:54.540> from<00:01:54.780> me

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
this and then have the camera from me

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.660 
this and then have the camera from me
we're<00:01:55.530> quoting<00:01:55.649> me<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.460> i<00:01:56.490> think

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
we're quoting me like this and i think

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.039 
we're quoting me like this and i think
they<00:01:56.790> triple<00:01:57.210> monitors<00:01:57.570> would<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> nice

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
they triple monitors would be a nice

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.130 
they triple monitors would be a nice
backdrop<00:01:58.799> for<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.780> speaking<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.840> triple

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
backdrop for that speaking of triple

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.350 
backdrop for that speaking of triple
monitors<00:02:01.530> I've<00:02:02.009> got<00:02:02.280> an<00:02:02.369> issue<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.640> those<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
monitors I've got an issue with those so

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.810 
monitors I've got an issue with those so
basically<00:02:03.719> i<00:02:04.219> bought<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:05.610> nice

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
basically i bought this really nice

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.570 
basically i bought this really nice
triple<00:02:06.299> monitor<00:02:06.630> stand<00:02:06.950> which<00:02:07.950> sits<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.489> my

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
triple monitor stand which sits on my

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.110 
triple monitor stand which sits on my
desk<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.599> got<00:02:10.289> these<00:02:10.470> steel<00:02:11.190> metal<00:02:11.790> arms

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
desk and it's got these steel metal arms

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.370 
desk and it's got these steel metal arms
that<00:02:12.360> come<00:02:13.020> out<00:02:13.170> like

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that come out like

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.790 
that come out like
that<00:02:13.680> Tyler<00:02:14.220> side<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.200> they<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.320> support<00:02:16.470> all

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
that Tyler side and they can support all

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.590 
that Tyler side and they can support all
the<00:02:16.920> monitors<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.550> fine<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.120> problem<00:02:18.480> is

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
the monitors just fine the problem is

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.630 
the monitors just fine the problem is
since<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.960> have<00:02:19.050> three<00:02:19.410> different<00:02:19.830> 24<00:02:20.490> inch

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
since I have three different 24 inch

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.120 
since I have three different 24 inch
monitors<00:02:21.090> they<00:02:21.990> don't<00:02:22.200> line<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:22.500> properly<00:02:22.680> at

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
monitors they don't line up properly at

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.980 
monitors they don't line up properly at
all<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.030> wasn't<00:02:24.240> even<00:02:24.360> thinking<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.900> was

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
all like I wasn't even thinking that was

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.150 
all like I wasn't even thinking that was
going<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.260> an<00:02:25.320> issue<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.980> base

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
going to be an issue with the base

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to be an issue with the base
amounts<00:02:26.580> would<00:02:26.640> line<00:02:26.820> up<00:02:26.850> five<00:02:27.240> or<00:02:28.050> I'd<00:02:28.290> be

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
amounts would line up five or I'd be

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.840 
amounts would line up five or I'd be
able<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.680> height<00:02:29.070> adjust<00:02:29.400> them<00:02:29.550> individually

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
able to height adjust them individually

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.760 
able to height adjust them individually
but<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.660> turns<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.200> only<00:02:31.350> hide<00:02:31.620> them

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
but it turns out you can only hide them

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.760 
but it turns out you can only hide them
adjust<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.220> all<00:02:32.430> together<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:34.050> because<00:02:34.560> I

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
adjust them all together so because I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.950 
adjust them all together so because I
can't<00:02:34.980> hide<00:02:35.130> adjusted<00:02:35.490> individually<00:02:35.960> they're

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
can't hide adjusted individually they're

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.810 
can't hide adjusted individually they're
all<00:02:37.110> at<00:02:37.260> different<00:02:37.440> levels<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.460> I've<00:02:38.550> got<00:02:38.670> this

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
all at different levels so I've got this

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.930 
all at different levels so I've got this
monitor<00:02:39.180> over<00:02:39.360> here<00:02:39.860> which<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.040> way<00:02:41.700> lower

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
monitor over here which is way lower

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.700 
monitor over here which is way lower
than<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.300> one<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> middle<00:02:42.720> which<00:02:43.530> is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
than the one in the middle which is

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.470 
than the one in the middle which is
slightly<00:02:44.130> lower<00:02:44.400> than<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.820> one<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.450> right

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
slightly lower than the one on the right

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.230 
slightly lower than the one on the right
so<00:02:46.110> that's<00:02:46.500> rather<00:02:46.740> annoying<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.400> what<00:02:48.060> may

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
so that's rather annoying and what may

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.420 
so that's rather annoying and what may
end<00:02:48.450> up<00:02:48.570> doing<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:49.100> returning<00:02:50.100> two<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.340> these

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
end up doing is returning two of these

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.400 
end up doing is returning two of these
monitors<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.150> getting<00:02:51.690> free<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.140> same

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
monitors and getting free of the same

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.610 
monitors and getting free of the same
monitor<00:02:53.180> because<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.270> got<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.570> sous<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:55.380> over

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
monitor because I got this sous one over

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.820

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
here which is a two millisecond monitor

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.500 
here which is a two millisecond monitor
which<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.730> really<00:02:59.940> nice<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:01.470> got<00:03:01.680> that

won't try to resume or anything so I'm
having<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.979> really<00:04:50.160> hard<00:04:50.250> time<00:04:50.430> beating<00:04:50.729> that

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
know maybe I'll find a different way of

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.060 
know maybe I'll find a different way of
doing<00:04:57.539> that<00:04:57.870> where<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.229> upload<00:04:58.530> will<00:04:58.560> be<00:04:58.889> able

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
doing that where the upload will be able

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.060 
doing that where the upload will be able
to<00:04:59.160> resume<00:04:59.490> when<00:05:00.210> my<00:05:00.330> internet<00:05:00.509> goes<00:05:00.810> out<00:05:01.070> but

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
right now it's really great oh and one

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.560 
right now it's really great oh and one
last<00:06:43.800> thing<00:06:43.949> I<00:06:44.130> wanted<00:06:44.310> to<00:06:44.370> mention<00:06:44.430> is<00:06:44.880> that

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
last thing I wanted to mention is that

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.749 
last thing I wanted to mention is that
at<00:06:46.050> some<00:06:46.259> point<00:06:46.289> in<00:06:46.680> the<00:06:46.830> near<00:06:47.009> future<00:06:47.070> I<00:06:47.430> might

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
at some point in the near future I might

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.969 
at some point in the near future I might
be<00:06:47.940> getting<00:06:48.210> a<00:06:48.479> huge<00:06:48.900> internet<00:06:49.229> upgrade<00:06:49.560> which

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
be getting a huge internet upgrade which

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.070 
be getting a huge internet upgrade which
would<00:06:50.190> multiply<00:06:50.520> the<00:06:50.759> my<00:06:51.150> upload<00:06:51.479> speed<00:06:51.630> by

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
would multiply the my upload speed by

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.999 
would multiply the my upload speed by
like<00:06:52.919> eight<00:06:53.210> so<00:06:54.210> i<00:06:54.600> would<00:06:55.530> have<00:06:55.560> roughly<00:06:55.919> a

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:56.009 
like eight so i would have roughly a

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.270 
like eight so i would have roughly a
five<00:06:56.520> upload<00:06:56.970> which<00:06:57.449> means<00:06:57.690> i<00:06:57.990> would<00:06:58.860> be<00:06:59.009> able

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
five upload which means i would be able

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.640 
five upload which means i would be able
to<00:06:59.400> stream<00:06:59.820> 720p<00:07:00.539> on<00:07:00.750> Twitch<00:07:01.080> which<00:07:01.350> would<00:07:01.500> be

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
to stream 720p on Twitch which would be

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.439 
to stream 720p on Twitch which would be
really<00:07:01.830> nice<00:07:02.070> so<00:07:02.820> that's<00:07:02.970> something<00:07:03.150> that<00:07:03.270> I'm

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
really nice so that's something that I'm

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:05.360 
really nice so that's something that I'm
definitely<00:07:03.600> going<00:07:03.900> to<00:07:03.990> look<00:07:04.110> into<00:07:04.259> anima<00:07:05.220> mean

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
definitely going to look into anima mean

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.010 
definitely going to look into anima mean
I<00:07:05.400> could<00:07:05.580> upload<00:07:05.820> videos<00:07:06.150> a<00:07:06.180> lot<00:07:06.270> faster<00:07:06.780> so<00:07:06.990> i

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
render of it renders 20 minute videos in

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.089 
render of it renders 20 minute videos in
like<00:07:11.610> a<00:07:11.639> minute<00:07:11.940> and<00:07:12.349> 10<00:07:13.349> they<00:07:13.500> take<00:07:13.740> 10<00:07:14.070> hours

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:14.099 
like a minute and 10 they take 10 hours
