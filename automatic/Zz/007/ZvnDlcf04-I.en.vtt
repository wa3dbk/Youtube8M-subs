finding<00:00:08.700> critical<00:00:09.179> points<00:00:09.740> critical<00:00:10.740> points

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
finding critical points critical points

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.110 
finding critical points critical points
is<00:00:11.400> defined<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.210> 1<00:00:12.570> X<00:00:13.070> derivative<00:00:14.070> equal<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.880> 0

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
is defined as 1 X derivative equal to 0

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.640 
is defined as 1 X derivative equal to 0
so<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.660> course<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.080> will<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.470> find

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
so of course we will have to find

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.000 
so of course we will have to find
derivative<00:00:17.369> first<00:00:17.670> 1<00:00:18.630> plus<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
derivative first 1 plus this is

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.820 
derivative first 1 plus this is
relatively<00:00:20.609> easy<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.119> fun<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.930> derivative<00:00:22.350> for

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
relatively easy to fun so derivative for

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.759 
relatively easy to fun so derivative for
the<00:00:22.890> top<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.550> zero<00:00:23.820> okay<00:00:24.570> -<00:00:25.260> leave<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the top it's a zero okay - leave the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.210 
the top it's a zero okay - leave the
first<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.220> alone<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.789> then<00:00:27.920> comes<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
first one alone and then comes the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.450 
first one alone and then comes the
bottom<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.420> 1<00:00:31.550> minus<00:00:32.960> 1<00:00:33.960> over<00:00:33.989> X<00:00:34.980> minus

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
bottom so I have 1 minus 1 over X minus

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.139 
bottom so I have 1 minus 1 over X minus
1<00:00:36.860> having<00:00:37.860> gotten<00:00:38.100> over<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.000> need<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
1 having gotten over there we need to

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
1 having gotten over there we need to
set<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.600> equal<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.989> 0<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.040> go<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> Y<00:00:41.579> minus

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
set this equal to 0 as you go to Y minus

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.250 
set this equal to 0 as you go to Y minus
1<00:00:42.329> over<00:00:42.480> X<00:00:43.320> minus<00:00:43.440> 1<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
1 over X minus 1 and then we have I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.619 
1 over X minus 1 and then we have I
think<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.100> missed<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> square<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.120> some<00:00:48.300> more

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.220 

derivative<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:52.050> 1<00:00:52.350> plus<00:00:53.449> 0<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> first<00:00:54.989> 1

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
derivative of 1 plus 0 to the first 1

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.939 
derivative of 1 plus 0 to the first 1
over<00:00:55.410> 0

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
over 0

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
over 0
-<00:00:56.579> leave<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.910> first<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.449> derivative<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
- leave the first one derivative but the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.590 
- leave the first one derivative but the
second<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.390> around

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
second one I got that this one around

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.850 
second one I got that this one around
it's<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.309> just<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.460> 1<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:06.409> that's<00:01:07.409> minus

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
it's actually just a 1 here that's minus

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's actually just a 1 here that's minus
1<00:01:08.280> square<00:01:09.270> ok<00:01:09.840> -<00:01:10.110> there's<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> square<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.729> ok

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
1 square ok - there's a square here ok

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.190 
1 square ok - there's a square here ok
that's<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.720> missing

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that's what I was missing

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.730 
that's what I was missing
oh<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.979> Saturday<00:01:14.689> I'm<00:01:15.689> getting<00:01:16.020> slower<00:01:16.409> here

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
oh it's Saturday I'm getting slower here

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.039 
oh it's Saturday I'm getting slower here
alright<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.360> supposed<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> equal<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
alright so one is supposed to equal to

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.260 
alright so one is supposed to equal to
let's<00:01:22.049> say<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.380> LS<00:01:22.650> o<00:01:24.229> 0<00:01:25.229> equal<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> Y<00:01:25.920> minus<00:01:26.430> X

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
let's say what LS o 0 equal to Y minus X

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.550 
let's say what LS o 0 equal to Y minus X
minus<00:01:27.930> 1<00:01:28.140> squared<00:01:29.180> really<00:01:30.180> slow<00:01:30.509> day<00:01:30.720> here<00:01:30.990> 1

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
minus 1 squared really slow day here 1

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.370 
minus 1 squared really slow day here 1
is<00:01:31.590> equal<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.600> X<00:01:33.600> minus<00:01:34.380> 1<00:01:34.909> squared<00:01:35.909> that's

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
is equal to X minus 1 squared that's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.899 
is equal to X minus 1 squared that's
what<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> meant<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> say<00:01:37.799> cuz<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.369> one<00:01:38.430> it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
what I meant to say cuz this one it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.170 
what I meant to say cuz this one it's
the<00:01:39.000> same<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:39.869> above<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.920> right

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
the same as the one above it all right

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.469 
the same as the one above it all right
having<00:01:42.180> gotten<00:01:42.420> over<00:01:42.810> here<00:01:43.049> basically<00:01:44.479> we're

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
having gotten over here basically we're

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.249 
having gotten over here basically we're
saying<00:01:45.720> X<00:01:45.990> minus<00:01:46.530> 1<00:01:47.090> squared<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.270> equal<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> 1

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
saying X minus 1 squared is equal to 1

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.560 
saying X minus 1 squared is equal to 1
because<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.310> only<00:01:50.460> place<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.360> can

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
because the only place that's one can

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.389 
because the only place that's one can
equal<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.990> 1<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.470> whole<00:01:52.950> thing<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
equal to 1 is the whole thing on the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.819 
equal to 1 is the whole thing on the
bottom<00:01:53.579> equal<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.180> 1<00:01:54.390> okay<00:01:55.049> having<00:01:55.409> having

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
bottom equal to 1 okay having having

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.499 
bottom equal to 1 okay having having
done<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.570> there's<00:01:57.570> equal<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.049> plus<00:01:58.290> minus<00:01:58.320> 1

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
done that there's equal to plus minus 1

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.200 
done that there's equal to plus minus 1
which<00:02:00.509> means<00:02:00.840> X<00:02:01.140> minus<00:02:01.649> 1<00:02:01.860> equal<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> 1<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:02.969> X

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
which means X minus 1 equal to 1 or X

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.029 
which means X minus 1 equal to 1 or X
equal<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.780> 2<00:02:04.100> or<00:02:05.100> X<00:02:06.090> minus<00:02:06.540> 1<00:02:06.780> equal<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> minus<00:02:07.590> 1

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
equal to 2 or X minus 1 equal to minus 1

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.610 
equal to 2 or X minus 1 equal to minus 1
X<00:02:08.369> equal<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.940> 0

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.500 

as<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.860> did<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> slow<00:02:14.670> day<00:02:14.730> let<00:02:15.030> me<00:02:15.060> make<00:02:15.330> sure

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
as I did a slow day let me make sure

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.500 
as I did a slow day let me make sure
everything<00:02:15.930> looks<00:02:16.319> fun<00:02:17.060> okay<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.120> once<00:02:18.390> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
everything looks fun okay so once you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.900 
everything looks fun okay so once you
get<00:02:18.690> over<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.290> setting<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.310> equalizer

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
get over here setting you the equalizer

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.210 
get over here setting you the equalizer
oh<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.300> know<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.080> what<00:02:22.290> trip<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.650> me<00:02:22.769> over<00:02:23.040> I

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
oh I know this is what trip to me over I

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.550 
oh I know this is what trip to me over I
was<00:02:23.700> moving<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.209> one<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.599> minus<00:02:24.959> 1<00:02:25.170> here<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
was moving this one to minus 1 here and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.410 
was moving this one to minus 1 here and
then<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.769> stumbled<00:02:26.280> because<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.819> have<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> square

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
then I stumbled because I have a square

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.050 
then I stumbled because I have a square
here<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.890> they<00:02:28.980> turned<00:02:29.250> out<00:02:29.370> at<00:02:29.519> both<00:02:29.640> minus

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
here but they turned out at both minus

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.600 
here but they turned out at both minus
ient<00:02:30.269> cancels<00:02:30.870> so<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.769> 1<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.280> quoted

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
ient cancels so I have a 1 you quoted

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.550 
ient cancels so I have a 1 you quoted
this<00:02:32.760> whole<00:02:32.970> thing<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.390> having<00:02:33.989> gotten<00:02:34.170> over

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
this whole thing and having gotten over

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.600 
this whole thing and having gotten over
here<00:02:35.900> then<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:37.170> take<00:02:37.349> screws<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
here then I can take screws so the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.729 
here then I can take screws so the
answer<00:02:38.880> for<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.660> critical<00:02:40.140> points<00:02:40.470> are<00:02:40.560> X

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
answer for the critical points are X

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.460 
answer for the critical points are X
equal<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.160> 2<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.670> X<00:02:42.180> equal<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.750> 0<00:02:43.940> all<00:02:44.940> right

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
equal to 2 and X equal to 0 all right

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.170 
equal to 2 and X equal to 0 all right
