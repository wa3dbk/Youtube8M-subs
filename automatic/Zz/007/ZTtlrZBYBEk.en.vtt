00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
pretty much if you want to you know

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.069 
pretty much if you want to you know
about<00:01:52.560> eight<00:01:52.860> seconds<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.520> 10<00:01:53.869> seconds<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:54.930> so

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
about eight seconds or 10 seconds or so

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.530 
about eight seconds or 10 seconds or so
you<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.500> put<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.939> when<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
you just put it up here and then when it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.819 
you just put it up here and then when it
gets<00:01:57.600> down<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> 8<00:01:58.049> seconds<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.740> will

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
gets down to 8 seconds it will

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.380 
gets down to 8 seconds it will
automatically<00:01:59.280> cross<00:01:59.880> wait<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
automatically cross wait and do the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.510 
automatically cross wait and do the
other<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.799> said<00:02:01.829> earlier<00:02:02.009> it

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
other one now like I said earlier it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.880

think<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.820> just<00:02:33.940> type<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.270> all<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.480> BPM

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
think you can just type in all the BPM

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.170 
think you can just type in all the BPM
and<00:02:34.930> then<00:02:35.320> find<00:02:35.590> one<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.310> hopefully
