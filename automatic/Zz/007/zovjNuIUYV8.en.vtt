are a modern-day invention intended for
modern<00:00:34.950> day<00:00:35.100> products<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> wager

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
modern day products I'm going to wager

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.750 
modern day products I'm going to wager
however<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> first<00:00:37.800> battery<00:00:38.250> known<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
however that the first battery known to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.569 
however that the first battery known to
exist<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.719> invented<00:00:40.140> over<00:00:40.410> 2,000<00:00:41.190> years<00:00:41.430> ago

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.360 

so<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> story<00:00:44.969> goes<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:46.010> 1983<00:00:47.010> some

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
so the story goes that in 1983 some

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
so the story goes that in 1983 some
terracotta<00:00:47.940> pots<00:00:48.300> were<00:00:48.840> discovered<00:00:49.500> within

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
terracotta pots were discovered within

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.920 
terracotta pots were discovered within
the<00:00:50.010> collection<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> National<00:00:51.300> Museum<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the collection of the National Museum of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
the collection of the National Museum of
Iraq<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.920> reason<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.430> these<00:00:53.550> pots<00:00:53.789> were<00:00:53.969> so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
Iraq the reason that these pots were so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.700 
Iraq the reason that these pots were so
interesting<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.020> they<00:00:55.350> dated

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
interesting is because they dated

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.209 
interesting is because they dated
somewhere<00:00:56.129> between<00:00:56.280> 250<00:00:56.910> AD<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.719> 250<00:00:58.530> BC<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
somewhere between 250 AD and 250 BC and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.180 
somewhere between 250 AD and 250 BC and
they<00:00:59.550> contained<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.239> copper<00:01:00.719> pipe<00:01:00.989> an<00:01:01.289> iron<00:01:01.920> rod

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
they contained a copper pipe an iron rod

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.240 
they contained a copper pipe an iron rod

the top and an acidic liquid on the
inside<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.520> design<00:01:08.939> led<00:01:09.270> researchers<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
inside this design led researchers to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.510 
inside this design led researchers to
believe<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.530> perhaps<00:01:10.650> these<00:01:11.040> pots<00:01:11.310> were

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
believe that perhaps these pots were

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000 
believe that perhaps these pots were
used<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:11.939> galvanic<00:01:12.180> cells<00:01:12.900> which<00:01:13.530> brings<00:01:13.860> us

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
used as galvanic cells which brings us

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
used as galvanic cells which brings us
back<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.250> modern-day<00:01:14.760> batteries<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
back to modern-day batteries the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.899 
back to modern-day batteries the
principle<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.439> operation<00:01:16.710> behind<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.610> pots

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
principle of operation behind these pots

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.120 
principle of operation behind these pots
and<00:01:18.240> modern-day<00:01:18.600> batteries<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.380> very<00:01:19.619> similar

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and modern-day batteries is very similar

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
and modern-day batteries is very similar
due<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.790> many<00:01:21.090> people<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.420> use<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
due to this many people just use the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.010 
due to this many people just use the
term<00:01:22.200> Baghdad<00:01:22.890> battery<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.640> parthian<00:01:24.630> battery

I<00:02:26.310> believe<00:02:26.519> that<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.060> batteries<00:02:27.450> were

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
I believe that the batteries were

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.809 
I believe that the batteries were
created<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.379> special<00:02:28.799> purpose<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.459> that

created for a special purpose and that

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.699 
created for a special purpose and that
it<00:02:29.910> wasn't<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.209> coincidence<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.200> can't

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
it wasn't just coincidence I can't

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.830 
it wasn't just coincidence I can't
exactly<00:02:32.040> say<00:02:32.430> what<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.910> use<00:02:33.150> might<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.599> been

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
exactly say what the use might have been

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.839 
exactly say what the use might have been
but<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.140> believe<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.980> shock<00:02:35.250> was<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.549> known

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
but I believe that the shock was a known

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.119 
but I believe that the shock was a known
result<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.599> they<00:02:37.349> had<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> purpose<00:02:38.010> in

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
result and that they had a purpose in

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.830 
result and that they had a purpose in
mind<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:38.640> why<00:02:38.760> they<00:02:38.940> created<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.510> that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840
