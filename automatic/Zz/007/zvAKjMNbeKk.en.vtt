five to five six and when it's zoomed
all<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:29.100> widest<00:01:29.579> they<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
all the way in the widest they can go is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
all the way in the widest they can go is
five<00:01:30.180> six<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.659> during<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> day<00:01:31.140> you're<00:01:31.680> going

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
to get good pictures at five six then

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.520 
to get good pictures at five six then
you<00:01:34.860> want<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> set<00:01:35.310> your<00:01:35.400> camera<00:01:35.930> if<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.380> have

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
an automatic digital camera you can set

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.460 
an automatic digital camera you can set
your<00:01:40.439> camera<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.890> aperture<00:01:41.430> priority<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.470> set

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
your camera on aperture priority and set

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.800 
your camera on aperture priority and set
it<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:44.009> wide<00:01:44.280> open<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.640> possible<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
it to as wide open as possible so that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.420 
it to as wide open as possible so that
means<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.530> light<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:46.770> possible<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
means that as much light as possible and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.859 
means that as much light as possible and
then<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.700> will<00:01:47.820> adjust<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> shutter<00:01:48.630> speed

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
then it will adjust the shutter speed

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
then it will adjust the shutter speed
according<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.649> how<00:01:49.890> much<00:01:50.040> light<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.549> coming<00:01:50.790> in

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
according to how much light is coming in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
according to how much light is coming in
so<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:51.540> you're<00:01:51.840> letting<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> lot<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.530> light<00:01:52.710> in

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so if you're letting a lot of light in

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.830 
so if you're letting a lot of light in
then<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> camera<00:01:53.880> will<00:01:53.909> automatically<00:01:54.540> set

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
then the camera will automatically set

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.539 
then the camera will automatically set
itself<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> very<00:01:55.680> fast<00:01:56.009> shutter<00:01:56.250> speed<00:01:56.520> so

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
itself at a very fast shutter speed so

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
itself at a very fast shutter speed so
it<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:56.850> stop<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> action<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.320> also

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
it will stop the action now you can also

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.800 
it will stop the action now you can also
set<00:01:58.799> your<00:01:58.950> camera<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.310> shoot<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.450> certain

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
set your camera to shoot at a certain

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.660 
set your camera to shoot at a certain
shutter<00:02:01.079> speed<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
shutter speed if you know that the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.039 
shutter speed if you know that the
action<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.180> going<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> stop<00:02:03.600> at<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:03.810> shutter

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
action is going to stop at this shutter

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.170 
action is going to stop at this shutter
speed<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.040> will<00:02:05.159> adjust<00:02:05.490> your

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
speed and then it will adjust your

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.839 
speed and then it will adjust your
aperture<00:02:06.540> according<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.409> how<00:02:07.979> how<00:02:08.399> much<00:02:08.550> light

is<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.300> area<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.879> open<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.300> of

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
do it manually which if you know your

do it manually which if you know your
camera<00:02:15.209> and<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.599> have<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> good<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.530> know

light meter in the camera or whatnot and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.250 
light meter in the camera or whatnot and
you<00:02:18.180> want<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.750> way<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.989> can<00:02:19.140> set

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
you want to do it that way you can set

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.839 
you want to do it that way you can set
it<00:02:19.380> up<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.620> way<00:02:19.739> but<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.190> easiest<00:02:20.489> way<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.670> do

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
it up that way but the easiest way to do

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.720 
it up that way but the easiest way to do
it<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.150> think<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.959> shoot<00:02:22.170> with<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:22.920> aperture

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
it I think is to shoot with the aperture

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.820 
it I think is to shoot with the aperture
priority<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.569> wide-open<00:02:25.080> responsibles

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830

pothinus wide open as your lens will get

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.570 
pothinus wide open as your lens will get

and that will give your camera the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.360 
and that will give your camera the
ability<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:29.970> shoot<00:02:30.239> at<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.690> fastest<00:02:31.380> aprica

there then your automatic lens will do

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.240 
there then your automatic lens will do
it<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.530> if<00:03:22.799> you<00:03:22.890> don't<00:03:22.980> have<00:03:23.160> an

it for you if you don't have an
automatic<00:03:23.310> lens<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:24.480> get<00:03:25.350> your<00:03:25.530> light

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
automatic lens then get your light

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.440 
automatic lens then get your light
