00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the video again and seems that might

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
have disappeared into YouTube hell but

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.180 
have disappeared into YouTube hell but
what<00:00:35.880> he<00:00:36.059> had<00:00:36.210> done<00:00:36.469> was<00:00:37.469> kind<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.860> too

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
what he had done was kind of this too

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.520 
what he had done was kind of this too
wide<00:00:38.460> two<00:00:39.090> deep<00:00:39.170> configuration<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.320> too

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
wide two deep configuration that's too

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.020 
wide two deep configuration that's too
deep<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.160> got<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.430> know<00:00:41.520> course<00:00:41.820> two

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
deep because you got you know course two

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.119 
deep because you got you know course two
blocks<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.750> when<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.500> whole<00:00:43.680> assembly

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
blocks up here when this whole assembly

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.729 
blocks up here when this whole assembly
turns<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.850> raises<00:00:45.270> everything<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.020> when

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
turns on it raises everything up to when

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.740 
turns on it raises everything up to when
it<00:00:46.860> shuts<00:00:47.100> back<00:00:47.309> off<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.879> sand<00:00:48.149> comes<00:00:48.480> down

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it shuts back off the sand comes down

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
it shuts back off the sand comes down
the<00:00:48.989> pistons<00:00:49.379> retract<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:50.129> works<00:00:50.370> great

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the pistons retract it all works great

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
the pistons retract it all works great
and<00:00:51.149> we'll<00:00:51.270> turn<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:51.750> here<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> can

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and we'll turn it on right here you can

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.889 
and we'll turn it on right here you can
see<00:00:52.410> how<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.590> works<00:00:53.360> everything<00:00:54.360> raises<00:00:54.750> up

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
see how it works everything raises up

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.319 
see how it works everything raises up
like<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.230> said<00:00:55.440> using<00:00:56.190> redstone<00:00:56.670> repeaters

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
like I said using redstone repeaters

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
like I said using redstone repeaters
these<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.719> time<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.170> three<00:00:58.500> ticks<00:00:58.739> down<00:00:58.949> at

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
these are time to three ticks down at

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.000 
these are time to three ticks down at
the<00:00:59.190> bottom<00:00:59.660> one<00:01:00.660> tick<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> top<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the bottom one tick up at the top and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
the bottom one tick up at the top and
what<00:01:02.160> happens<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.449> blocks<00:01:03.989> right

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
what happens is is these blocks right

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.130 
what happens is is these blocks right
here<00:01:04.710> receive<00:01:05.430> their<00:01:05.610> power<00:01:05.790> first<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.510> these

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
here receive their power first and these

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
here receive their power first and these
these<00:01:07.799> ones<00:01:08.100> receive<00:01:08.820> them<00:01:09.000> afterwards<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
these ones receive them afterwards and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.740 
these ones receive them afterwards and
that's<00:01:09.990> why<00:01:10.170> they're<00:01:10.320> times<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.360> this<00:01:12.360> allows

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that's why they're times and this allows

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.800 
that's why they're times and this allows
this<00:01:13.470> top<00:01:13.799> row<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> Pistons<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.060> retract<00:01:15.570> into

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
this top row of Pistons to retract into

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.080 
this top row of Pistons to retract into
itself<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.710> allow<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> bottom<00:01:17.909> row<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
itself and allow the bottom row of

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
itself and allow the bottom row of
pistons<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.750> these<00:01:18.930> are<00:01:19.080> sticky<00:01:19.350> these<00:01:19.650> are

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
pistons and these are sticky these are

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.340 
pistons and these are sticky these are
regular<00:01:20.360> allows<00:01:21.360> them<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> pull<00:01:21.960> them<00:01:22.140> back

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
regular allows them to pull them back

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.920 
regular allows them to pull them back
down<00:01:22.619> sand<00:01:23.310> drops<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.790> its<00:01:23.909> own<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.360> let's<00:01:24.750> see

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
down sand drops on its own and let's see

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.539 
down sand drops on its own and let's see
that<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.790> everything<00:01:26.790> works<00:01:26.909> great<00:01:27.150> I

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
that right now everything works great I

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.310 
that right now everything works great I
wasn't<00:01:29.549> able<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.150> use<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.020> though

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
wasn't able to actually use this though

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.580 
wasn't able to actually use this though
because<00:01:31.560> again<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.280> only<00:01:32.490> two<00:01:32.670> wide<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.590> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
because again it's only two wide in the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
because again it's only two wide in the
doorway<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.310> entranceway<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:36.030> front<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
doorway in the entranceway in front of

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.230 
doorway in the entranceway in front of
my<00:01:36.390> castle<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:37.220> was<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> bit<00:01:38.520> wider<00:01:38.759> than<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
my castle here was a bit wider than that

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.840 
my castle here was a bit wider than that
I<00:01:39.420> actually<00:01:39.750> needed<00:01:40.110> something<00:01:40.560> five<00:01:40.799> wide<00:01:41.130> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
I actually needed something five wide so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.719 
I actually needed something five wide so
the<00:01:42.000> first<00:01:42.210> thing<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.570> had<00:01:42.720> tried<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.640> like<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the first thing I had tried and like I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.399 
the first thing I had tried and like I
said<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.149> am<00:01:45.299> new<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.350> of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
said I am new to this so I kind of

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.870 
said I am new to this so I kind of
didn't<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.189> what<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.369> was<00:01:47.490> doing<00:01:47.759> at

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
didn't really know what I was doing at

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.389 
didn't really know what I was doing at
first<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.390> set<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.470> something<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
first I set up something like this is a

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.880 
first I set up something like this is a
test<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:51.659> three<00:01:51.930> wide<00:01:52.110> by<00:01:52.409> three<00:01:52.590> wide

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
test and it was three wide by three wide

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.859 
test and it was three wide by three wide
again<00:01:53.310> sticky<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.909> at<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> bottom<00:01:54.299> regular

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
again sticky down at the bottom regular

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.139 
again sticky down at the bottom regular
pistons<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.290> top<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.829> set<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.060> these

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
pistons up top I set up one of these

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.300 
pistons up top I set up one of these
kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.570> contraptions<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.890> turned<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> on

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
kind of contraptions and I turned it on

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.600 
kind of contraptions and I turned it on
and<00:02:00.200> that's<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> realized<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.369> those

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
and that's when I realized that those

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.700 
and that's when I realized that those
metal<00:02:03.090> pistons<00:02:03.600> don't<00:02:04.020> actually<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.530> any

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
metal pistons don't actually get any

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.830 
metal pistons don't actually get any
power<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.280> thats<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.390> kind<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.600> stays

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
power and thats and just kind of stays

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.190 
power and thats and just kind of stays
exactly<00:02:07.049> where<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:08.509> not<00:02:09.509> really<00:02:09.840> handy

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
exactly where it is not really handy

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.020 
exactly where it is not really handy
because<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.979> was<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:11.849> know

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
because if I was to I don't know

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.080 
because if I was to I don't know
I<00:02:12.090> guess<00:02:12.890> go<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.220> air<00:02:14.250> build<00:02:14.610> my<00:02:14.760> way<00:02:14.910> up

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
I guess go up in the air build my way up

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.280 
I guess go up in the air build my way up
in<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.270> air<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.450> some<00:02:15.720> dirt<00:02:15.900> right<00:02:16.080> now<00:02:16.230> you

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
in the air with some dirt right now you

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.870 
in the air with some dirt right now you
see<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.560> actually<00:02:16.950> looks<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.310> donut<00:02:17.580> up

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
see that actually looks like a donut up

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.880 
see that actually looks like a donut up
there's<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.300> hole<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.720> middle<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.200> just

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
there's a hole in the middle of it just

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.250 
there's a hole in the middle of it just
get<00:02:20.010> stuck<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.520> wouldn't<00:02:20.880> work<00:02:20.940> too<00:02:21.180> well

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
get stuck in that wouldn't work too well

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.920 
get stuck in that wouldn't work too well
so<00:02:22.400> what<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.430> ended<00:02:23.520> up<00:02:23.790> figuring<00:02:24.060> out<00:02:24.420> I'd

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
so what I ended up figuring out I'd

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.809 
so what I ended up figuring out I'd
looked<00:02:25.260> online<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.160> too<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.520> couldn't

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
looked online and you too but I couldn't

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.400 
looked online and you too but I couldn't
find<00:02:26.970> any<00:02:27.180> tutorials<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> kind<00:02:28.350> of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
find any tutorials for this I to kind of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.590 
find any tutorials for this I to kind of
figured<00:02:28.680> out<00:02:28.739> on<00:02:28.860> my<00:02:28.890> own<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.340> ended<00:02:30.270> up<00:02:30.330> doing

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
figured out on my own I ended up doing

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.080 
figured out on my own I ended up doing
something<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.760> i'm<00:02:32.760> using

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
something like this and i'm using

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.860 
something like this and i'm using
multiple<00:02:33.510> floors<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:35.040> basically<00:02:35.459> get<00:02:36.450> as<00:02:36.630> wide

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
multiple floors to basically get as wide

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.199 
multiple floors to basically get as wide
as<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.319> want<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.680> be<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.400> first<00:02:38.670> floor<00:02:38.940> down

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
as I want it to be the first floor down

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.760 
as I want it to be the first floor down
here<00:02:39.420> at<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.569> bottom<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.350> see<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.650> only

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
here at the bottom you can see I only

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.370 
here at the bottom you can see I only
have<00:02:41.190> one<00:02:41.730> row<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.120> Pistons<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.260> as

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
have one row of Pistons you can go as

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.990 
have one row of Pistons you can go as
long<00:02:43.590> as<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.830> want<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.850> know<00:02:44.940> I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
long as you want to with this you know I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.520 
long as you want to with this you know I
could<00:02:45.209> come<00:02:45.360> out<00:02:45.390> way<00:02:45.630> out<00:02:45.660> here<00:02:46.019> if<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.230> wanted

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
could come out way out here if I wanted

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.650 
could come out way out here if I wanted
to<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> tutorial<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.450> figured

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
to but for the tutorial I just figured

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.340 
to but for the tutorial I just figured
this<00:02:48.780> was<00:02:48.930> good<00:02:49.050> enough<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:51.660> world<00:02:51.930> like

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
this was good enough and this world like

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.840 
this was good enough and this world like
again<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.830> bottom<00:02:53.100> floor<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.430> usually<00:02:53.730> only

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
again the bottom floor is usually only

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.090 
again the bottom floor is usually only
going<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.090> have<00:02:54.209> one<00:02:54.769> same<00:02:55.769> thing<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
going to have one same thing with the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.140 
going to have one same thing with the
redstone<00:02:56.519> repeaters<00:02:57.080> you've<00:02:58.080> got<00:02:58.790> six<00:02:59.790> blocks

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
redstone repeaters you've got six blocks

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.120 
redstone repeaters you've got six blocks
of<00:03:00.420> sand<00:03:00.690> actually<00:03:01.200> all<00:03:01.350> these<00:03:01.560> pistons<00:03:01.980> are

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
of sand actually all these pistons are

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.130 
of sand actually all these pistons are
pushing<00:03:02.430> up<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.060> then<00:03:03.239> we<00:03:03.330> go<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.810> second

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
pushing up and then we go to the second

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.090 
pushing up and then we go to the second
floor<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:08.269> I've<00:03:09.269> got<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.870> outside<00:03:10.860> rows

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
floor here and I've got the outside rows

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.520 
floor here and I've got the outside rows
here<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.580> have<00:03:11.850> two<00:03:12.150> blocks<00:03:12.480> each<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:13.080> sand<00:03:13.380> on

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
here I have two blocks each of sand on

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.300 
here I have two blocks each of sand on
top<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.890> them<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.610> got<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> nice<00:03:14.970> even<00:03:16.310> three

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
top of them so I got a nice even three

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.670 
top of them so I got a nice even three
wide<00:03:17.519> piston<00:03:18.060> bridge<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:19.110> I<00:03:19.200> come<00:03:19.380> back<00:03:19.500> down

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
wide piston bridge if I come back down

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.110 
wide piston bridge if I come back down
here<00:03:19.709> without<00:03:19.980> falling<00:03:20.579> off<00:03:20.670> hurting<00:03:21.000> myself

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
here without falling off hurting myself

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.270 
here without falling off hurting myself
that<00:03:21.480> was<00:03:21.570> close<00:03:21.950> turn<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:25.100> as<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.220> can

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
that was close turn this on as you can

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.449 
that was close turn this on as you can
see<00:03:26.430> everything<00:03:26.790> rises<00:03:27.000> up<00:03:27.180> nice<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.570> equal

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
see everything rises up nice and equal

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.240 
see everything rises up nice and equal
nice<00:03:29.459> three<00:03:29.880> wide<00:03:30.120> bridge<00:03:30.450> up<00:03:30.720> there<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:32.100> I

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
nice three wide bridge up there and if I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.539 
nice three wide bridge up there and if I
shut<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.579> back<00:03:32.790> off<00:03:33.860> again<00:03:34.860> everything

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
shut this back off again everything

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.720 
shut this back off again everything
drops<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.329> equivalent<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.780> two<00:03:36.959> blocks<00:03:37.730> so

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
drops the equivalent of two blocks so

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.920 
drops the equivalent of two blocks so
we'll<00:03:38.850> come<00:03:38.970> over<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.269> castle<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.810> can

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
we'll come over the castle and I can

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.599 
we'll come over the castle and I can
actually<00:03:40.049> show<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.590> five<00:03:40.829> wide<00:03:41.160> set<00:03:41.489> up

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
actually show you the five wide set up

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.569 
actually show you the five wide set up
and<00:03:41.790> i'm<00:03:41.880> using<00:03:42.510> right<00:03:42.540> now<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.200> five<00:03:44.040> wide<00:03:44.310> is

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
and i'm using right now and five wide is

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.620 
and i'm using right now and five wide is
as<00:03:45.030> wide<00:03:45.299> as<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.630> can<00:03:45.660> go<00:03:45.959> with<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:46.799> setup<00:03:47.630> if

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
as wide as you can go with this setup if

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.720 
as wide as you can go with this setup if
you<00:03:48.840> were<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.019> go<00:03:49.230> any<00:03:50.420> floors<00:03:51.420> lower<00:03:52.489> let's<00:03:53.489> JT

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
you were to go any floors lower let's JT

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.039 
you were to go any floors lower let's JT
you<00:03:53.880> wanted<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> try<00:03:54.329> something<00:03:54.359> like<00:03:54.630> six<00:03:54.930> or

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
you wanted to try something like six or

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.680 
you wanted to try something like six or
seven<00:03:55.230> wide<00:03:55.609> if<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.820> problem<00:03:57.030> becomes<00:03:57.209> you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
seven wide if the problem becomes you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.410 
seven wide if the problem becomes you
can<00:03:57.840> only<00:03:58.019> have<00:03:58.320> so<00:03:59.250> much<00:03:59.430> sand<00:03:59.850> on<00:04:00.090> top<00:04:00.150> of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
can only have so much sand on top of

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.030 
can only have so much sand on top of
these<00:04:00.480> pistons<00:04:00.930> they'll<00:04:01.079> only<00:04:01.260> push<00:04:01.530> up<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.799> max

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
these pistons they'll only push up a max

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.039 
these pistons they'll only push up a max
of<00:04:02.280> 12<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:04.070> right<00:04:05.070> here<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.400> 7<00:04:05.820> with<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> 5<00:04:06.750> wide

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
of 12 and right here is 7 with a 5 wide

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.840 
of 12 and right here is 7 with a 5 wide
you<00:04:07.290> actually<00:04:07.590> end<00:04:07.709> up<00:04:07.739> with<00:04:07.890> 11<00:04:08.280> blocks<00:04:08.549> on

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
you actually end up with 11 blocks on

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.190 
you actually end up with 11 blocks on
top<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.269> bottom<00:04:09.600> piss<00:04:09.780> them<00:04:09.930> it's<00:04:10.049> going

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
top of that bottom piss them it's going

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.009 
top of that bottom piss them it's going
to<00:04:10.260> push<00:04:10.410> up<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.829> you're<00:04:11.010> at<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.310> max<00:04:11.549> they're

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
to push up so you're at the max they're

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.150 
to push up so you're at the max they're
right<00:04:13.019> here<00:04:13.049> i<00:04:13.320> just<00:04:13.530> got<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.680> simple<00:04:14.040> little

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
right here i just got a simple little

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.280 
right here i just got a simple little
xor<00:04:14.640> gate<00:04:14.720> hitting<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.780> fence

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.960 

keeps<00:04:20.290> all<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.590> chickens<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.640> farm

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
keeps all the chickens and the farm

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.150 
keeps all the chickens and the farm
animals<00:04:22.420> out<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.900> yeah<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.620> guess<00:04:23.920> it<00:04:23.950> keeps

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
animals out of it yeah I guess it keeps

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.800 
animals out of it yeah I guess it keeps
the<00:04:24.310> creepers<00:04:24.670> in<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.850> zombies<00:04:25.210> out<00:04:25.360> too<00:04:25.570> but

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
the creepers in the zombies out too but

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.450 
the creepers in the zombies out too but
I<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:25.990> got<00:04:26.350> sick<00:04:26.560> of<00:04:26.590> hearing<00:04:26.920> all<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.250> farm

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
I just got sick of hearing all the farm

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.700 
I just got sick of hearing all the farm
animals<00:04:27.850> moving<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.570> clucking<00:04:29.170> all<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.530> time

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
animals moving and clucking all the time

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.680 
animals moving and clucking all the time
so<00:04:30.370> we'll<00:04:30.640> turn<00:04:30.790> this<00:04:30.970> on<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.210> here's<00:04:31.540> the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
so we'll turn this on and here's the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.540 
so we'll turn this on and here's the
five<00:04:31.870> wide<00:04:32.140> bridge<00:04:32.440> operates<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.250> door<00:04:33.460> as

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
five wide bridge operates the door as

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.030 
five wide bridge operates the door as
well<00:04:33.730> from<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.060> switch<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.860> let's<00:04:35.860> go

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
well from that switch and let's go

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.770 
well from that switch and let's go
inside<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.670> maintenance<00:04:36.880> area<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.630> can

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
inside to the maintenance area and I can

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.800 
inside to the maintenance area and I can
actually<00:04:37.930> show<00:04:38.230> you<00:04:38.260> how<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.440> did<00:04:38.560> this<00:04:39.810> you

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
actually show you how I did this you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.970 
actually show you how I did this you
probably<00:04:41.020> already<00:04:41.230> have<00:04:41.380> an<00:04:41.530> idea<00:04:41.620> right<00:04:41.950> now

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
probably already have an idea right now

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.890 
probably already have an idea right now
at<00:04:42.250> this<00:04:42.340> point<00:04:42.550> come<00:04:43.270> on<00:04:43.420> get<00:04:43.600> down<00:04:43.720> there

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
at this point come on get down there

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.190 
at this point come on get down there
again<00:04:44.890> little<00:04:45.520> XOR<00:04:45.910> gate<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.450> got<00:04:46.900> one<00:04:47.050> input

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
again little XOR gate I got one input

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.530 
again little XOR gate I got one input
right<00:04:47.470> here<00:04:47.800> switch<00:04:48.670> on<00:04:48.880> this<00:04:49.030> piece<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.420> red

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
right here switch on this piece of red

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.030 
right here switch on this piece of red
carpet<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.170> then<00:04:50.260> there's<00:04:50.410> another<00:04:50.620> one<00:04:50.830> I

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
carpet and then there's another one I

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.930 
carpet and then there's another one I
can<00:04:51.610> jump<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.910> high<00:04:53.670> coming<00:04:54.670> from<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:54.910> other

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
can jump that high coming from the other

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.020 
can jump that high coming from the other
side<00:04:55.150> of<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.510> bridge<00:04:56.370> get<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.490> output<00:04:57.640> coming

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
side of the bridge get the output coming

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.080 
side of the bridge get the output coming
out<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.660> use<00:04:59.410> this<00:04:59.620> torch<00:04:59.950> to<00:05:00.190> power<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.820> door

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
out I use this torch to power the door

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.960 
out I use this torch to power the door
