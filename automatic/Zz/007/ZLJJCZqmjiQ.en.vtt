percent of that image coming out it's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.990 
percent of that image coming out it's
really<00:03:00.109> what<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.859> coating<00:03:01.280> process<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.879> the

really what the coating process on the

really what the coating process on the
lenses<00:03:02.359> that<00:03:02.389> allows<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.169> get<00:03:03.319> that<00:03:03.379> true

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.240 
when we first started to come out with
these<00:03:10.790> e/l<00:03:11.329> as<00:03:11.540> far<00:03:12.079> as<00:03:12.230> comfort<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:12.980> field

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
these e/l as far as comfort in the field

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.039 
these e/l as far as comfort in the field
and<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.639> first<00:03:13.879> place<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.299> started<00:03:14.720> was<00:03:14.870> with

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
and the first place we started was with

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.710 
and the first place we started was with
the<00:03:15.439> magnesium<00:03:15.859> itself<00:03:16.489> these<00:03:16.730> housings<00:03:17.599> are

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
the magnesium itself these housings are

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.899 
the magnesium itself these housings are
constructed<00:03:18.290> of<00:03:18.379> magnesium<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.669> much

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
constructed of magnesium it's a much

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.240 
constructed of magnesium it's a much
more<00:03:20.150> durable<00:03:20.689> much<00:03:20.930> more<00:03:21.139> lightweight<00:03:21.859> metal

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
more durable much more lightweight metal

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.969 
more durable much more lightweight metal
to<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:22.579> so<00:03:22.909> as<00:03:23.090> far<00:03:23.599> as<00:03:23.659> the<00:03:23.989> overall<00:03:24.260> light

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:24.979 
to you so as far as the overall light

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:26.500 
to you so as far as the overall light
weight<00:03:25.159> of<00:03:25.280> these<00:03:25.400> binoculars<00:03:25.669> and<00:03:26.030> magnesium

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
weight of these binoculars and magnesium

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.059 
weight of these binoculars and magnesium
really<00:03:26.810> contributes<00:03:27.349> to<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:27.829> then<00:03:27.919> it's

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
really contributes to that but then it's

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.309 
really contributes to that but then it's
also<00:03:28.250> just<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:28.879> ergonomics<00:03:29.569> of<00:03:29.720> them<00:03:29.900> how

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
also just the ergonomics of them how

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.780 
also just the ergonomics of them how
comfortable<00:03:30.919> they<00:03:31.069> are<00:03:31.220> when<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.489> put<00:03:31.699> them

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
comfortable they are when you put them

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.159 
comfortable they are when you put them
up<00:03:31.909> when<00:03:32.060> you're<00:03:32.150> out<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.389> field<00:03:32.479> you've

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
up when you're out in the field you've

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.899 
up when you're out in the field you've
got<00:03:33.349> a<00:03:33.379> backpack<00:03:33.680> you've<00:03:34.159> got<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> rifle<00:03:34.579> and

got a backpack you've got a rifle and
you've<00:03:35.060> got<00:03:35.209> all<00:03:35.359> this<00:03:35.479> kind<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.810> gear<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:36.319> you

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
you've got all this kind of gear and you

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.289 
you've got all this kind of gear and you
still<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.310> be<00:03:37.459> able<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.790> use<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
still have to be able to use the

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.300 
still have to be able to use the
binocular<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.079> have<00:03:39.290> all<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:39.680> gear<00:03:39.859> on<00:03:40.099> and

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.640 
binocular and have all that gear on and
that<00:03:40.879> really<00:03:41.150> comes<00:03:41.419> down<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.780> how

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
that really comes down to how

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.899 
that really comes down to how
comfortable<00:03:43.159> are<00:03:43.220> going<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.430> be<00:03:43.549> in<00:03:43.669> how<00:03:43.790> much

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
comfortable are going to be in how much

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.140 
comfortable are going to be in how much

that you're your pupil should be away

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:02.830 
that you're your pupil should be away
from<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.250> lens<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.669> get<00:04:01.909> that<00:04:02.090> full<00:04:02.389> field<00:04:02.659> of

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
from the lens to get that full field of

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.750 
from the lens to get that full field of
view<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.199> these<00:04:03.799> eye<00:04:03.829> cups<00:04:04.280> are<00:04:04.430> designed

so<00:04:11.449> now<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:11.989> we<00:04:12.139> know<00:04:12.169> we've<00:04:12.409> got<00:04:12.439> a

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
so now that we know we've got a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.929 
so now that we know we've got a
comfortable<00:04:12.979> Binaca<00:04:13.400> in<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.669> field<00:04:13.849> the

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:13.939 
comfortable Binaca in the field the

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.670 
comfortable Binaca in the field the
other<00:04:14.120> thing<00:04:14.299> to<00:04:14.449> look<00:04:14.479> at<00:04:14.750> is<00:04:14.959> ease<00:04:15.259> of<00:04:15.439> use

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
other thing to look at is ease of use

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.620 
other thing to look at is ease of use
and<00:04:15.949> you<00:04:16.310> know<00:04:16.400> over<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.729> years<00:04:16.759> anyone<00:04:17.449> who

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
and you know over the years anyone who

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.939 
and you know over the years anyone who
had<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.870> but<00:04:17.989> not<00:04:18.079> pair<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.380> binoculars<00:04:18.590> when

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
had it but not pair of binoculars when

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.319 
had it but not pair of binoculars when
they<00:04:19.039> were<00:04:19.099> kids<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:19.519> had<00:04:19.699> to<00:04:19.820> adjust<00:04:20.150> that

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
they were kids and had to adjust that

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.029 
they were kids and had to adjust that
diopter<00:04:20.900> on<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.109> right<00:04:21.320> side<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.799> be<00:04:21.889> out

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
diopter on the right side and be out

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.680 
diopter on the right side and be out
using<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.699> and<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.880> would<00:04:23.000> always<00:04:23.150> get<00:04:23.449> messed

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
using it and it would always get messed

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.320 
using it and it would always get messed
up<00:04:23.870> that's<00:04:24.770> what<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.159> locking<00:04:25.610> diopter<00:04:26.150> does

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
up that's what a locking diopter does

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.390 
up that's what a locking diopter does
and<00:04:26.539> on<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.719> e<00:04:26.750> L<00:04:27.050> we<00:04:27.229> designed<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:28.010> diopter

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
and on the e L we designed the diopter

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.189 
and on the e L we designed the diopter
and<00:04:28.700> what<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.969> diopter<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.570> is<00:04:29.750> everyone

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
and what the diopter is is everyone

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.899 
and what the diopter is is everyone
I<00:04:30.229> sees<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> little<00:04:31.099> bit<00:04:31.310> different<00:04:31.729> and<00:04:31.849> it

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
I sees a little bit different and it

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.239 
I sees a little bit different and it
allows<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.539> adjust<00:04:32.770> for<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:33.830> difference

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:34.249 
allows you to adjust for that difference

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.100 
allows you to adjust for that difference
