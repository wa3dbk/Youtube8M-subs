we've spent a lot of time breaking down
the<00:00:10.530> offense<00:00:10.980> cuz<00:00:11.190> that's<00:00:11.429> where<00:00:11.670> people<00:00:11.940> want

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
because I was celebrating them after the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.200 
because I was celebrating them after the
Colts<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:17.010> well<00:00:17.220> so<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.640> had<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> break<00:00:18.180> down

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
Colts as well so we had to break down

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.240 
Colts as well so we had to break down
some<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> offensive<00:00:19.410> plays<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.949> game

as<00:00:20.430> well<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:21.119> today<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.660> finally<00:00:22.199> focused<00:00:22.619> on

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
as well but today we finally focused on

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.040 
as well but today we finally focused on
the<00:00:22.920> defensive<00:00:23.519> line<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.060> how<00:00:24.810> they've

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the defensive line and how they've

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.019 
the defensive line and how they've
gotten<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.560> timing<00:00:26.070> down<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.670> how<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
gotten the timing down and how the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.820 
gotten the timing down and how the
complexity<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.050> schemes<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.590> they're

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
complexity of the schemes that they're

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400 
complexity of the schemes that they're
using<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.550> helping<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.420> create<00:00:30.599> holes<00:00:31.140> in

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
using are helping to create holes in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.139 
using are helping to create holes in
offensive<00:00:31.920> lines<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.460> allow<00:00:32.700> them<00:00:32.940> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
offensive lines to allow them to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.569 
offensive lines to allow them to
successfully<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.219> consistently<00:00:35.219> provide

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
successfully and consistently provide

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.119 
successfully and consistently provide
pressure<00:00:36.120> versus<00:00:36.630> opposing<00:00:37.110> quarterbacks<00:00:37.559> so

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
pressure versus opposing quarterbacks so

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.340
