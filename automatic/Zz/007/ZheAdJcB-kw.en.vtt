00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
much time we wasted trying to pull that
card<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.230> people<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.130> me<00:02:23.340> who<00:02:23.550> can't<00:02:23.790> pull

card and people like me who can't pull

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.090 
card and people like me who can't pull
it<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.420> had<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.810> give<00:02:24.960> up<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.230> big<00:02:25.380> card<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.950> it

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
it and had to give up a big card for it

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.940 
it and had to give up a big card for it
so<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.700> didn't<00:02:27.600> give<00:02:27.690> up<00:02:27.840> anything<00:02:28.110> super<00:02:28.710> big

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
so I didn't give up anything super big

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.970 
so I didn't give up anything super big
but<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.550> was<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.870> rare<00:02:30.870> collection<00:02:31.500> ghost<00:02:31.740> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
but it was a rare collection ghost that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.190 
but it was a rare collection ghost that
I<00:02:32.010> had<00:02:32.250> next<00:02:32.610> graph<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.190> didn't<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.700> a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
I had next graph that I didn't have a

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
I had next graph that I didn't have a
need<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.230> per<00:02:37.770> se<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.370> probably<00:02:38.610> overpaid

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
need for per se but I probably overpaid

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.750 
need for per se but I probably overpaid
for<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.570> card<00:02:39.860> but<00:02:40.860> we'll<00:02:41.040> see<00:02:41.220> we'll<00:02:41.460> see<00:02:41.490> if

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
for the card but we'll see we'll see if

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.710 
for the card but we'll see we'll see if
that<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.360> surprises<00:02:43.200> weather<00:02:44.300> well<00:02:45.300> what

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
that if that surprises weather well what

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170 
that if that surprises weather well what
we're<00:02:45.870> all<00:02:45.960> thinking<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.970> nobody<00:02:47.970> really

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
we're all thinking it is nobody really

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.850 
we're all thinking it is nobody really
knows<00:02:48.330> exactly<00:02:48.660> what<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:49.590> hoping

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860
