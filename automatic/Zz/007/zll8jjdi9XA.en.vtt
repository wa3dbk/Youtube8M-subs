00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
that's a common issue on these bikes

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.410 
that's a common issue on these bikes
that<00:00:26.990> the<00:00:27.170> front<00:00:27.440> forks<00:00:27.860> are<00:00:28.100> really<00:00:28.490> soft<00:00:28.760> so

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
that the front forks are really soft so

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.650 
that the front forks are really soft so
I'm<00:00:29.540> going<00:00:29.780> to<00:00:29.870> upgrade<00:00:30.020> the<00:00:30.470> fork<00:00:30.710> oil<00:00:30.920> to<00:00:31.660> 15

weight pork oil that's what I have and

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.690 
weight pork oil that's what I have and
the<00:00:36.649> belt<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:38.390> most<00:00:39.010> proper<00:00:40.010> way<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.280> do<00:00:40.520> this

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
the belt the most proper way to do this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.190 
the belt the most proper way to do this
is<00:00:40.910> basically<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:41.540> know<00:00:41.570> replace<00:00:41.990> the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
is basically you know replace the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.010 
is basically you know replace the
springs<00:00:42.560> and<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.130> fork<00:00:43.340> oil<00:00:43.630> but<00:00:44.630> the<00:00:44.810> cheap

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
springs and the fork oil but the cheap

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.780 
springs and the fork oil but the cheap
route<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.440> just<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.739> replace<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.070> fork<00:00:46.640> oil

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
route is just to replace the fork oil

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.240 
route is just to replace the fork oil
and<00:00:47.090> that's<00:00:47.810> what<00:00:47.989> I'm<00:00:48.110> going<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.320> do<00:00:48.500> this<00:00:49.070> is

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
and that's what I'm going to do this is

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.450 
and that's what I'm going to do this is
my<00:00:49.370> commuter<00:00:49.820> bike<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:50.720> that<00:00:50.750> should<00:00:51.410> make<00:00:52.399> a

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
my commuter bike so that should make a

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.940 
my commuter bike so that should make a
difference<00:00:52.880> I<00:00:52.970> think<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.210> stock<00:00:53.540> oil<00:00:53.870> that<00:00:54.350> in

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
difference I think the stock oil that in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.220 
difference I think the stock oil that in
the<00:00:55.070> bike<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.399> about<00:00:55.520> 5<00:00:55.880> weight<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:56.960> I'm<00:00:57.020> going

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
the bike is about 5 weight so I'm going

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.860 
the bike is about 5 weight so I'm going
to<00:00:57.290> upgrade<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:58.090> 15<00:00:59.090> weight<00:00:59.270> the<00:00:59.630> first

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
to upgrade it to 15 weight the first

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.090 
to upgrade it to 15 weight the first
thing<00:00:59.989> I'm<00:01:00.079> going<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:00.290> do<00:01:00.410> what<00:01:00.620> I've<00:01:00.739> done<00:01:00.770> is

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
thing I'm going to do what I've done is

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.580 
thing I'm going to do what I've done is
I've<00:01:01.370> marked<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.510> position<00:01:02.660> of<00:01:03.020> my<00:01:03.170> handlebar

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
I've marked the position of my handlebar

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.889 
I've marked the position of my handlebar
on<00:01:03.770> both<00:01:04.159> the<00:01:04.309> sides<00:01:04.519> with<00:01:05.299> some<00:01:05.449> little<00:01:05.719> duct

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
on both the sides with some little duct

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.190 
on both the sides with some little duct
little<00:01:06.619> tape<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.329> markings<00:01:08.329> right<00:01:08.450> here<00:01:08.719> I'm

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
little tape and markings right here I'm

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.230 
little tape and markings right here I'm
going<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.500> open<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.860> handlebars<00:01:10.280> up<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.820> I'm

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
going to open the handlebars up and I'm

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.950 
going to open the handlebars up and I'm
going<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.510> use<00:01:11.720> my<00:01:11.930> straps<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:13.130> are<00:01:13.420> I've<00:01:14.420> put

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
going to use my straps that are I've put

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.810 
going to use my straps that are I've put
over<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.409> beam<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.159> I'm<00:01:16.310> going<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.549> pull<00:01:16.700> the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
over the beam and I'm going to pull the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.510 
over the beam and I'm going to pull the
handlebar<00:01:17.330> off<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.229> hangs<00:01:18.620> right<00:01:19.250> about

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
handlebar off so it hangs right about

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.850 
handlebar off so it hangs right about
here<00:01:19.790> face<00:01:20.360> out<00:01:20.540> of<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.750> way<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:21.470> can<00:01:21.619> do<00:01:21.710> it

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
here face out of the way you can do it

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.010 
here face out of the way you can do it
without<00:01:21.979> doing<00:01:22.549> this<00:01:22.700> but<00:01:23.090> it'll<00:01:23.690> just<00:01:23.900> make

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
without doing this but it'll just make

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.840 
without doing this but it'll just make
the<00:01:24.229> job<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.530> little<00:01:24.770> easier<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:25.310> I'm<00:01:25.640> going<00:01:25.790> to

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
the job a little easier so I'm going to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.420 
the job a little easier so I'm going to
go<00:01:25.970> ahead<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.270> take<00:01:26.840> off<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.020> handlebars<00:01:27.430> so

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
go ahead and take off the handlebars so

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.000 
go ahead and take off the handlebars so
the<00:01:28.970> handlebars<00:01:29.450> are<00:01:29.630> now<00:01:29.810> all<00:01:30.049> out<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.890> the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
the handlebars are now all out of the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.370 
the handlebars are now all out of the
way<00:01:31.159> what<00:01:31.820> I'm<00:01:31.940> going<00:01:32.150> to<00:01:32.180> do<00:01:32.330> next<00:01:32.570> is<00:01:32.930> go

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
way what I'm going to do next is go

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.510 
way what I'm going to do next is go
ahead<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.590> open<00:01:34.100> these<00:01:35.740> fork<00:01:37.360> top<00:01:38.360> covers<00:01:38.810> and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
ahead and open these fork top covers and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.070 
ahead and open these fork top covers and
I'm<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.880> going<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.060> loosen<00:01:41.450> them<00:01:41.540> up<00:01:41.720> I'm<00:01:41.930> not

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
I'm just going to loosen them up I'm not

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.450 
I'm just going to loosen them up I'm not
going<00:01:42.260> to<00:01:42.320> necessarily<00:01:42.650> take<00:01:42.920> them<00:01:43.100> off<00:01:43.280> and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
going to necessarily take them off and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.539 
going to necessarily take them off and
then<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.600> will<00:01:45.260> go<00:01:45.650> ahead<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.010> lift<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.369> bike

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
then I will go ahead and lift the bike

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.520 
then I will go ahead and lift the bike
up<00:01:46.850> from<00:01:47.450> here<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.020> front<00:01:48.320> wheel<00:01:48.500> is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
up from here so that the front wheel is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.170 
up from here so that the front wheel is
off<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.070> ground<00:01:49.310> because<00:01:49.759> we're<00:01:50.000> going<00:01:50.119> to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
off the ground because we're going to

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.429 
off the ground because we're going to
have<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.390> remove<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.780> front<00:01:50.900> wheel<00:01:51.080> as<00:01:51.320> well

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
have to remove the front wheel as well

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.920 
have to remove the front wheel as well
so<00:01:54.439> now<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:55.009> bike<00:01:55.220> is<00:01:55.460> securely<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.689> front

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
so now the bike is securely the front

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.530 
so now the bike is securely the front
wheel<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.229> securely<00:01:57.530> off<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.040> ground<00:01:58.540> next

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
wheel is securely off the ground next

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
triple clamp bolts to take out the slide

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.930 
triple clamp bolts to take out the slide
out<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.709> forks<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:51.140> with<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.440> wheel<00:02:51.620> off<00:02:51.950> now

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
out the forks so with the wheel off now

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.039

it's<00:02:53.239> time<00:02:53.599> to<00:02:54.970> unscrew<00:02:55.970> these<00:02:56.180> pinch<00:02:56.629> bolts

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
it's time to unscrew these pinch bolts

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.690 
it's time to unscrew these pinch bolts
right<00:02:57.290> here<00:02:57.349> there's<00:02:57.890> one<00:02:58.069> right<00:02:58.250> here<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
right here there's one right here and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.949 
right here there's one right here and
then<00:02:59.329> there<00:02:59.660> are<00:03:00.549> there's<00:03:01.549> one<00:03:01.910> right<00:03:02.629> under

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
then there are there's one right under

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.630 
then there are there's one right under
here<00:03:05.349> probably<00:03:06.349> hard<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.620> see<00:03:06.739> right<00:03:07.190> here<00:03:07.370> but

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
here probably hard to see right here but

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.180 
here probably hard to see right here but
it's<00:03:07.790> right<00:03:08.150> over<00:03:08.870> here<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.920> we're<00:03:10.010> going<00:03:10.129> to

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
it's right over here so we're going to

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
go ahead and unscrew these and then I'm

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.449 
go ahead and unscrew these and then I'm
going<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.810> slide<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.230> Forks<00:03:12.560> out<00:03:12.709> I'm<00:03:13.129> going

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
going to slide that Forks out I'm going

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.479 
going to slide that Forks out I'm going
to<00:03:13.519> also<00:03:13.760> mark<00:03:14.109> each<00:03:15.109> side<00:03:15.409> of<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.620> fork<00:03:15.890> it's

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
to also mark each side of the fork it's

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.059 
to also mark each side of the fork it's
really<00:03:16.760> hard<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.810> mess<00:03:17.989> these<00:03:18.170> up<00:03:18.230> but<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:18.980> just

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
really hard to mess these up but I just

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.059 
really hard to mess these up but I just
like<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.549> do<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:19.700> just<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:21.470> be<00:03:21.620> safe

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
like to do it just to be safe

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.710 
like to do it just to be safe
left<00:03:22.579> and<00:03:22.760> right<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.239> I'm<00:03:23.299> going<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.480> go<00:03:23.599> ahead

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
left and right so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.960 
left and right so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:23.870> take<00:03:23.989> those<00:03:24.109> off<00:03:24.319> now<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.549> forks<00:03:25.880> are

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
and take those off now so the forks are

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.599 
and take those off now so the forks are
off<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.419> bike<00:03:26.630> now<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.769> as<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:27.980> remember<00:03:28.220> we

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.479 
off the bike now and as you remember we
already<00:03:28.819> loosened<00:03:29.480> these<00:03:30.109> caps<00:03:30.500> up<00:03:30.769> so<00:03:31.400> I'm

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
already loosened these caps up so I'm

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.250 
already loosened these caps up so I'm
going<00:03:31.639> to<00:03:31.700> go<00:03:31.819> ahead<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.239> open<00:03:32.450> those<00:03:32.959> caps

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260

going to go ahead and open those caps
out<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.769> then<00:03:33.859> drain<00:03:34.129> oil<00:03:34.910> from<00:03:35.569> both<00:03:35.720> the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
out and then drain oil from both the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.740 
out and then drain oil from both the
forks<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:38.139> have<00:03:39.139> both<00:03:39.379> my<00:03:39.410> Forks<00:03:40.040> draining

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
forks I have both my Forks draining

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.180 
forks I have both my Forks draining
right<00:03:41.750> here<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.169> have<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.440> pop<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.650> forks<00:03:43.099> a

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
right here you have to pop the forks a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.099 
right here you have to pop the forks a
few<00:03:43.370> times<00:03:43.639> to<00:03:43.849> get<00:03:44.000> all<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.419> oil<00:03:44.450> out<00:03:44.870> and

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
few times to get all the oil out and

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.140 
few times to get all the oil out and
just<00:03:45.889> leave<00:03:46.099> them<00:03:46.280> sitting<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:48.709> drain<00:03:49.060> for<00:03:50.060> a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
just leave them sitting to drain for a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.849 
just leave them sitting to drain for a
couple<00:03:50.389> of<00:03:50.449> minutes<00:03:50.750> I'm<00:03:51.410> going<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.590> leave<00:03:51.739> it

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
couple of minutes I'm going to leave it

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.830 
couple of minutes I'm going to leave it
for<00:03:51.889> at<00:03:52.099> least<00:03:52.129> half<00:03:52.310> an<00:03:52.579> hour<00:03:52.699> so<00:03:53.030> that<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.510> can

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
for at least half an hour so that I can

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.009 
for at least half an hour so that I can
get<00:03:53.989> most<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.560> oil<00:03:54.739> out<00:03:55.329> so<00:03:56.329> these<00:03:56.780> are<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
get most of the oil out so these are the

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.720 
get most of the oil out so these are the
springs<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.470> came<00:03:57.650> out<00:03:57.769> of<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:57.949> forks<00:03:58.549> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
springs that came out of the forks the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.449 
springs that came out of the forks the
tight<00:03:59.660> round<00:04:00.199> end<00:04:00.650> goes<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.549> first<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.269> then

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
tight round end goes in first and then

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.659 
tight round end goes in first and then
we<00:04:04.459> have<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.419> spacer<00:04:06.220> right<00:04:07.220> here<00:04:07.459> and

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
we have the spacer right here and

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.479 
we have the spacer right here and
there's<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.299> washer<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.319> then<00:04:09.859> there's<00:04:10.069> a<00:04:10.190> cap

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
there's a washer and then there's a cap

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.569 
there's a washer and then there's a cap
so<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:11.720> good<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:12.230> keep<00:04:12.410> all<00:04:13.010> of<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.340> things

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
so it's good to keep all of the things

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.210 
so it's good to keep all of the things
in<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.180> same<00:04:14.359> order<00:04:14.569> that<00:04:14.720> they<00:04:14.959> came<00:04:15.109> out

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
in the same order that they came out

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.539 
in the same order that they came out
they<00:04:16.220> can<00:04:16.400> be<00:04:16.940> put<00:04:17.150> together<00:04:17.530> easier<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:19.160> I'm

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
they can be put together easier so I'm

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.009 
they can be put together easier so I'm
going<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.789> go<00:04:19.940> ahead<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.329> leave<00:04:20.449> these<00:04:20.690> alone

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
going to go ahead and leave these alone

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.439 
going to go ahead and leave these alone
let<00:04:22.010> them<00:04:22.160> drain<00:04:22.370> for<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.669> little<00:04:22.940> bit<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.240> then

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
let them drain for a little bit and then

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.700 
let them drain for a little bit and then
come<00:04:23.720> back<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.229> finish<00:04:24.289> off<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.490> filling

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
come back and finish off the filling

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.500 
come back and finish off the filling
okay<00:04:27.710> so<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.039> forks<00:04:28.430> are<00:04:28.520> back<00:04:28.760> together<00:04:28.969> I've

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
okay so the forks are back together I've

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.930 
okay so the forks are back together I've
already<00:04:30.020> put<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.770> oil

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
already put the oil

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.440 
already put the oil
in<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.810> right<00:04:33.320> fork<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.950> I've<00:04:34.610> got<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.000> cap

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
in the right fork and I've got the cap

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.720 
in the right fork and I've got the cap
on<00:04:35.720> as<00:04:35.900> well<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.650> final<00:04:36.920> tightening<00:04:37.460> will

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
on as well the final tightening will

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.430 
on as well the final tightening will
take<00:04:37.910> place<00:04:38.150> once<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.600> forks<00:04:39.080> are<00:04:39.170> on<00:04:39.320> the

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
take place once the forks are on the

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.220 
take place once the forks are on the
bike<00:04:39.620> this<00:04:40.220> one<00:04:40.460> is<00:04:40.580> still<00:04:40.790> going<00:04:41.210> in<00:04:41.360> once

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
bike this one is still going in once

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.570 
bike this one is still going in once
that<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.500> done<00:04:42.650> I'm<00:04:42.800> going<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.980> put<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.190> cap<00:04:43.370> in

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
and then put the forks back on the worst

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.580 
and then put the forks back on the worst
