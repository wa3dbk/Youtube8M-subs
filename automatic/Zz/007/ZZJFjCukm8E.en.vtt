00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.590
 hi today, let's talk about cold milk 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.230
 in dairy like we are 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.320
 gone 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.150
 around 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.400
 we bought a part of those 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.230
 products that are on the shelf 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.869
 not all, however, but those that are sold 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.750
 more and we have divided it into four 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.119
 types of organic product the product 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.550
 of the big brands the milk with the 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.410
 supermarket brand is a kind of 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.680
 milk of unknown brand that costs about 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.559
 less 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.780
 let's start from this this is milk 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.670
 fresh not high quality then at a 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.970
 little bit of protein and less but still always 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.210
 Italian side and costs 0 75 euros per liter 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.860
 in sold by esselunga 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.899
 then we have the second group these 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.480
 second group of installments includes i 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.030
 supermarket brands or sold 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.770
 with the brand name and we have 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.070
 coop 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.530
 in second place we have esselunga e 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.550
 then you see a little bit but anyway 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.220
 carrefour brand 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.960
 this is high quality milk therefore 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.960
 the best milk found in Italy 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.520
 is Italian and at a price varying from 1 to 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.710
 1.5 to 1.1 euros per liter 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.770
 the third group instead includes milk 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.150
 brand-name major local brands 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.150
 but still known that they do 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.220
 We have two types of advertising 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.060
 central of milan milk and milk 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.259
 Milan 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.650
 the price is around 14 15 euros per liter yes 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.740
 find everywhere and let's say the most 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.220
 always known high quality milk 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.180
 whole and now we are in the fourth group 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.740
 we wanted to put it because it is a 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.590
 produced a little niche in the milk 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.899
 biological but Milan sells well 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.350
 we have esselunga milk and coop milk 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.799
 the two major Italian brands coast 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.790
 like branded milk therefore 14 15 euros 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.680
 per liter 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.579
 and here is a content from cows that have 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.170
 ate organic food 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:10.009
 what are the differences between these 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.690
 types of milk it is important to understand it 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.630
 given that the price of milk in 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.430
 italy ranges from 0 30 0 35 more or less 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.980
 for everyone 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.390
 the differences concern the distribution 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.549
 in this case it is the one that costs the least 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.640
 but it means that it really makes both 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.530
 distributor that the manufacturer 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.080
 the supply chain is very spartan 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.970
 packaging is cheap and in any case that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.440
 more convenient and good milk 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.180
 definitely a good price 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.420
 even the milk from the supermarket is of good quality 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.770
 it is cheap because it comes directly to the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.959
 platform and is distributed in 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.520
 wind and win points and little expense of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.980
 shipping the supply chain is very short 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.160
 very short price for a lot 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 interesting one euro or 10 hours brands 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.400
 the big brands have problems with 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.570
 distribution advertisements are 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.360
 certainly interesting to be found 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.959
 always everywhere and have a price that 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.030
 from 14 to 15 significantly high 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.250
 organic milk a niche milk 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.590
 interesting, however, at a price 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.260
 high what do I do when at the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.320
 supermarket exchange we are supermarket 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.030
 I choose one for each type once one 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.190
 noticed and I guarantee you that they are all 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.190
 good quality sides to the next
