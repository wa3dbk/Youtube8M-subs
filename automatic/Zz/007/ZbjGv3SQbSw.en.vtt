 design usually not very good thing 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.730
 we also do not have this content 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.740
 first no specialist of course though 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.850

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.700
 class is of course it's about 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.560
 make it harder 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.030
 but yes you know what is just going to try 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.560
 to complete so you were allowed to do this 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.480
 basically like it to you 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.830

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.119

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.710
 let 's say i'm fucking noobs tomorrow 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.229

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.790
 the 2000 list channel so that super fat 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.530
 find disaster that looks like when you get it 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.729
 want to see more often and then we just go 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.320
 someone on it and then we just go there 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.890
 Now one only when that man pick up note 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.540

 only those strings I have nothing I had 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.210

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.100
 Here he will dress my first instance 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.570
 no one but him would meet him too 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.580
 just blurry and the chance of getting caught anyway 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.990
