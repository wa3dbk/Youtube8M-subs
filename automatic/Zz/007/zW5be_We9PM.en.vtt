the<00:00:32.399> first<00:00:32.640> thing<00:00:32.790> you'll<00:00:33.000> notice<00:00:33.420> when<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the first thing you'll notice when I

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
the first thing you'll notice when I
come<00:00:34.200> down<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.380> now<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> bottom

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
come down here now this is the bottom

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.450 
come down here now this is the bottom
area<00:00:35.550> right<00:00:35.790> before<00:00:36.030> your<00:00:36.149> hatch<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:37.860> these

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
area right before your hatch is these

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.720 
area right before your hatch is these
lighting<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> walls<00:00:40.100> what<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.280> these<00:00:41.460> are

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
lighting in the walls what all these are

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.650 
lighting in the walls what all these are
really<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:43.010> to<00:00:44.010> redstone<00:00:44.489> lamps<00:00:45.090> above<00:00:45.480> each

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
really is to redstone lamps above each

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
really is to redstone lamps above each
other<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.710> some<00:00:46.890> slabs<00:00:47.190> across<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> bottom

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
other with some slabs across the bottom

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
other with some slabs across the bottom
two<00:00:48.149> slabs<00:00:48.390> across<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> bottom<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.590> top

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
two slabs across the bottom at the top

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.250 
two slabs across the bottom at the top
and<00:00:50.219> what<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.270> they<00:00:51.510> essentially

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and what they do is they essentially

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.529 
and what they do is they essentially
glitch<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> light<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> looks<00:00:54.149> like

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
glitch out the light so it looks like

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.049 
glitch out the light so it looks like
it's<00:00:54.809> giving<00:00:55.110> light<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.760> it<00:00:56.760> does<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> little

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it's giving light and it does a little

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's giving light and it does a little
bit<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.690> really<00:00:58.079> all<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.350> really

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
bit but it's not really all it really

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.349 
bit but it's not really all it really
that<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.850> really<00:00:59.940> escapes

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that all the way that really escapes

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.599 
that all the way that really escapes
through<00:01:00.629> those<00:01:00.870> slabs<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.579> two

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
through those slabs is about one or two

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.579 
through those slabs is about one or two
light<00:01:03.210> level<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:03.960> enough<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.379> block

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
light level so it's not enough to block

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.039 
light level so it's not enough to block
mob<00:01:04.890> spawning<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:06.150> given<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> compactness

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
mob spawning but given the compactness

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.340 
mob spawning but given the compactness
of<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.530> whole<00:01:07.770> area<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.580> spawn<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.360> mean<00:01:10.229> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
of this whole area the spawn I mean the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
of this whole area the spawn I mean the
nether<00:01:10.590> portal<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> end<00:01:12.080> portal<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
nether portal the end portal and the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
nether portal the end portal and the
system<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.820> shouldn't<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
system down there you shouldn't have to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.330 
system down there you shouldn't have to
you're<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.259> within<00:01:16.619> distance<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you're really not within distance to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
you're really not within distance to
really<00:01:17.580> spawn<00:01:17.909> too<00:01:18.150> many<00:01:18.360> monsters<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
really spawn too many monsters so it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.990 
really spawn too many monsters so it
shouldn't<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.920> too<00:01:20.009> much<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.430> an<00:01:20.640> issue<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
shouldn't be too much of an issue and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.910 
shouldn't be too much of an issue and
I'm<00:01:21.090> sure<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.960> mess<00:01:22.320> around<00:01:22.350> with<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I'm sure if you mess around with it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.210 
I'm sure if you mess around with it
being<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> genius<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.810> are

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
being the genius that this as you are

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.789 
being the genius that this as you are
you'll<00:01:26.220> figure<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.030> basically

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
you'll figure it out so basically

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.260 
you'll figure it out so basically
starting<00:01:28.799> off<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> way<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.460> world<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
starting off the way your world was as a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.420 
starting off the way your world was as a
download<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> there'd<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.439> two<00:01:31.650> spaces<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
download it there'd be two spaces and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.390 
download it there'd be two spaces and
then<00:01:32.700> there's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> wall<00:01:33.530> what<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.560> did<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.950> push

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
then there's a wall what I did is I push

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.760 
then there's a wall what I did is I push
the<00:01:35.610> wall<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.430> in<00:01:38.430> front<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
the wall out one and in front of that I

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.160 
the wall out one and in front of that I
added<00:01:40.770> another<00:01:41.220> layer<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.670> n<00:01:42.270> stone<00:01:42.869> let<00:01:43.110> me

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
added another layer of n stone let me

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.330 
added another layer of n stone let me
get<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:43.409> stuff<00:01:43.439> situated<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.979> then<00:01:46.979> below<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
get my stuff situated and then below it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.990 
get my stuff situated and then below it

I put a line of a nether goddang nether

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.399 
I put a line of a nether goddang nether

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
brick slabs on the very ends are stairs

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.249 
brick slabs on the very ends are stairs
stairs<00:01:58.409> upward<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.430> stairs<00:01:59.719> abdus<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.810> down<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
stairs upward and stairs abdus I down to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.770 
stairs upward and stairs abdus I down to
give<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.500> kind<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.829> nice<00:02:02.009> end<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:03.600> just

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
give it kind of a nice end and it just

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.219 
give it kind of a nice end and it just
wraps<00:02:04.049> all<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.409> way<00:02:04.590> around<00:02:05.030> now<00:02:06.049> between<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
wraps all the way around now between the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
wraps all the way around now between the
stairs<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> side<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.489> actually<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
stairs on the side this was actually a

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.479 
stairs on the side this was actually a
three<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.119> space<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.709> all<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.890> had<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.310> cut

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
three of space so all I had to do is cut

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.890 
three of space so all I had to do is cut
out<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> little<00:02:11.879> bit<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.180> wall<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.599> put

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
out a little bit of wall to put

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.089 
out a little bit of wall to put
a<00:02:13.159> redstone<00:02:14.159> lamps<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.090> then<00:02:15.629> I<00:02:15.750> added

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
a redstone lamps in and then I added

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.780 
a redstone lamps in and then I added
above<00:02:17.099> it<00:02:17.310> some<00:02:18.150> more<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.480> end<00:02:18.689> stone<00:02:19.790> so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
above it some more this end stone so

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.330 
above it some more this end stone so
rest<00:02:21.030> I'll<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.569> looks<00:02:21.750> really<00:02:21.930> nice<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.560> was

like<00:02:23.489> kind<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.879> glitchy<00:02:24.150> excuse<00:02:24.989> me<00:02:25.200> if<00:02:25.439> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
like kind of the glitchy excuse me if it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.289 
like kind of the glitchy excuse me if it
froze<00:02:25.980> about<00:02:26.220> they're<00:02:26.370> always<00:02:26.879> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.209> like

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
froze about they're always kind of like

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.970 
froze about they're always kind of like
the<00:02:27.390> glitchy<00:02:27.629> lighting<00:02:28.079> that<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.349> gave<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the glitchy lighting that this gave and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.410 
the glitchy lighting that this gave and
it<00:02:29.370> hasn't<00:02:29.670> been<00:02:29.730> patched<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> while<00:02:30.329> i've

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
it hasn't been patched for a while i've

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.319 
it hasn't been patched for a while i've
been<00:02:30.480> using<00:02:30.689> this<00:02:30.870> for<00:02:30.930> several<00:02:31.260> versions<00:02:31.530> now

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
been using this for several versions now

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.599 
been using this for several versions now
and<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:34.170> works<00:02:34.319> exceedingly<00:02:34.950> well<00:02:35.280> with<00:02:35.489> the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
and it works exceedingly well with the

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.210 
and it works exceedingly well with the
netherrack<00:02:36.290> for<00:02:37.290> some<00:02:37.470> reason<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.980> dark

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
netherrack for some reason is the dark

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.589 
netherrack for some reason is the dark
colored<00:02:38.730> netherrack<00:02:39.090> scenes<00:02:39.359> that<00:02:39.420> work

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
colored netherrack scenes that work

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.020 
colored netherrack scenes that work
really<00:02:40.079> well<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:40.439> it<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:41.670> simple

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
really well for it so it's really simple

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.789 
really well for it so it's really simple
but<00:02:42.450> particularly<00:02:42.930> given<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.349> fact<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.650> can

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
but particularly given the fact you can

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.309 
but particularly given the fact you can
farm<00:02:44.090> with<00:02:45.090> your<00:02:45.239> which<00:02:45.389> form<00:02:45.659> that<00:02:45.870> materials

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
farm with your which form that materials

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.280 
farm with your which form that materials
needed<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.620> these<00:02:46.829> lamps<00:02:47.389> so<00:02:48.389> it<00:02:48.959> gives<00:02:49.109> it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
needed for these lamps so it gives it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.680 
needed for these lamps so it gives it
some<00:02:49.440> flavor<00:02:49.680> gives<00:02:50.129> us<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.269> wassam

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
some flavor gives us up is the wassam

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.990 
some flavor gives us up is the wassam

difficult<00:02:57.000> part<00:02:57.030> will<00:02:57.420> probably<00:02:57.720> begin<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
difficult part will probably begin the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
have your hatch which I moved back

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.809 
have your hatch which I moved back
toward<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.959> nth<00:03:07.319> further<00:03:08.069> wall<00:03:08.430> further<00:03:08.700> away

toward the nth further wall further away
from<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.510> don't<00:03:10.109> know<00:03:10.230> why<00:03:10.379> I'm<00:03:10.470> freezing

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
from this I don't know why I'm freezing

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.690 
from this I don't know why I'm freezing
so<00:03:10.889> badly<00:03:11.689> moved<00:03:12.689> away<00:03:12.780> from<00:03:12.900> your<00:03:13.139> spawner

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
so badly moved away from your spawner

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.920 
so badly moved away from your spawner
I'm<00:03:14.700> going<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:14.939> one<00:03:15.150> over<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.569> kind<00:03:15.840> of

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
I'm going to one over so it kind of

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.300 
I'm going to one over so it kind of
lines<00:03:16.379> up<00:03:16.530> with<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.739> stairwell<00:03:17.419> and<00:03:19.310> down

lines up with the stairwell and down
below<00:03:20.959> symbols<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.379> think<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.280> put<00:03:23.459> this

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
below symbols that I think I put this

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.939 
below symbols that I think I put this
trapdoor<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.209> backwards<00:03:24.569> I<00:03:24.780> sure<00:03:25.049> did<00:03:27.949> there

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
trapdoor on backwards I sure did there

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:34.610 
trapdoor on backwards I sure did there
we<00:03:29.069> go<00:03:29.190> Oh<00:03:30.560> freezing<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.739> madman<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.530> you

could<00:03:34.709> just<00:03:34.829> walk<00:03:35.099> up<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:35.639> just<00:03:35.760> push

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
could just walk up it and you just push

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.460 
could just walk up it and you just push
forward<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.449> immediately<00:03:36.900> get<00:03:37.109> out<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.349> it

have them showing in the middle of

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.980 
have them showing in the middle of

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.230 
here and if I'd stop freezing for a
second<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:40.470> got<00:04:40.590> your<00:04:40.710> enchanter<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.850> blow

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240

the spawner I've checked out and
triple-checked<00:04:47.700> everything<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.620> it'll

triple-checked everything and it'll

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.920 
triple-checked everything and it'll
actually<00:04:49.920> shine<00:04:50.340> through<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.180> enchanting

here anywhere else and have it really
makes<00:05:39.450> sense<00:05:39.840> I<00:05:39.990> guess<00:05:40.020> and<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:41.180> say<00:05:42.180> keep<00:05:42.330> up<00:05:42.450> no

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
makes sense I guess and I say keep up no

makes sense I guess and I say keep up no
put<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.250> back<00:05:44.340> here<00:05:45.170> maybe<00:05:46.170> if<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.410> had<00:05:46.590> like

another block like here you can put your

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.590 
another block like here you can put your
