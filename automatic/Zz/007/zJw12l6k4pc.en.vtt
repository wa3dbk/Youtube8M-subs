00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.130
 the interview a bit even himself 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 then antonio then vittorio la 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:23.580
 company this if nations we will go 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:26.820
 to fully see RAI cinema at 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.430
 chart from well then let's see 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.649
 a day of the six nations that will be 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.410
 as usual very exciting for 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:43.590
 we saw a discovery promo 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.719
 among the things that were said was never 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.250
 too late to change 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.559
 we say that we are part of this 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.789
 watch category and proper lines for 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.890
 short short and well I got there I 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.809
 I think it is lucky because it is over where it is known 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.449
 physicists a world like that of archives 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.040
 and yet it has had so many opportunities too 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.240
 that of being associated with people who 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.490
 he won a lot and so I also had 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.830
 luck in this, however, discovery has us 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
 put a great enthusiasm are not the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.869
 unique to gangs in the past there are people who 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.750
 he believed in sport and rugby and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.810
 still glimpses are great 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.970
 engaging enthusiasm 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.300
 believes in this rugby message is 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.940
 obvious that a national team that wins helps 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.570
 but I believe that the agreement we must make the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.630
 thing 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.940
 paolo who was more antonio dio does us 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.490
 pleasure flatters us and when we meet 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.050
 people and is in stadiums like this and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.690
 tell us ah look made me 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.720
 to know rugby i would watch because you 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.990
 and this is the biggest compliment e 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.940
 so if we can still participate 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.060
 to the spread of the sport we love 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.000
 which is the most beautiful thing 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.140
 plus they pay us even though I believe that 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.600
 el other positive thing and if of max 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.550
 with this wonderful project will be released in 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.160
 become as important as it was sky 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.929
 for Italian rugby I believe that 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.450
 the goal is one of the objectives 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.580
 they would be added then of course there is 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.190
 that of the gerlando division of ideas 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.510
 old success is the last question 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.740
 beautiful revolution from the point of view 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.820
 television this your passage 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.540
 transshipment move let's call it how 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.590
 you want 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:33.100
 a shock for what concerns me yes 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.930
 because we have so many memories related to 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.380
 sky 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.940
 I personally have a lot to thank 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.160
 of the opportunity given to me 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.040
 to talk about oneself rei di via skype 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.960
 and it is also a move, however 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.690
 that's why it's not the thing anymore 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.980
 simple to do was made in two are 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.640
 somehow we help each other 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.100
 of course, everyone in his house in the evening 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.470
 as would be more or less a thing is 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.700
 so that for me I have a boyfriend then 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.980
 now more than twenty years of 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.930
 sky the opportunities what they are 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.650
 professionally I definitely owe it to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.430
 to sky and that led me to have like 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.750
 sorry then give opportunity 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.690
 naturally I don't leave a little heart 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.710
 there but now I'm in this team 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.760
 new desire for many perfect results 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:33.030
