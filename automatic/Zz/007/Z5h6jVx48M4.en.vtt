00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.439
 good hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.589
 video tutorial where I will show you how 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:14.209
 solve the error 12 that gives us this 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:16.219
 I play the sims 3 and then we do not 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.529
 allows to save all the advances that 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.830
 we have so far does not allow us 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.750
 make a 6 of the game and losing of 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.570
 this way everything we had done 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.539
 so far this error is quite 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.870
 common to date unfortunately already 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.000
 many users have a little poquillo 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.910
 deranged because after being 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.480
 some hours we are advancing in the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.120
 this game does not allow us to make a 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.690
 saved from everything we've done 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.250
 and it is quite unnerving this 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.250
 tutorial I do it especially for the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.710
 forum sims where users like 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.160
 merche say they have the same 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.010
 problem that I and well here I bring you the 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.710
 solution first of all to begin with I've 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.009
 put a link that will take us to mega in 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.990
 the same post I've uploaded to you where I've 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.619
 uploaded this program that you will need 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.659
 to solve the error for it 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.780
 baixos go to the link that I have posted 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.750
 do you enter into mega and click 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.660
 download I already have it downloaded here 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.630
 obviously and once you download it 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.640
 you will be like weird joel and take the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.280
 program that is inside and what 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.610
 we drag to the desk we can 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.500
 close the rack and now we go to the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.970
 program that we have on the desktop 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.670
 we click right on it and we 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.770
 we will go to run as administrator 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.050
 although the program and directly what 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.740
 do us in case the flies are going to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.500
 click 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.630
 in executing as an administrator we do 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.100
 click you want to allow this program to 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.439
 an unknown publisher perform 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.439
 changes in the team we click on yes 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.810
 and here we have the program open as 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.120
 you will see the first box is empty and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.350
 we will go to this little button with 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.620
 three dots we will click on it 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.370
 and we should look for the sims file 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.110
 3 I already have it here because 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.120
 because I 've done it before but 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.560
 for users who do not have it 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.770
 we went to local disk team c 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:38.660
 electronic arts program files 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:42.010
 the sims 3 game bin once here inside 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.460
 we must locate the file 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.020
 ts 3w as you see here if you guys 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.150
 you want I can do as I have 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.470
 made backup copies of the file 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.850
 just in case 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.940
 simply copying and pasting the 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.540
 file and you too well what 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.849
 you can do if you wish 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.020
 once the file is located we do 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.590
 click on it 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.690
 we click on open and as you see what 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.120
 we have selected the executable here 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.520
 up when we have it selected 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.370
 we check that this box is 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.319
 checked that the box is marked 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.780
 Once we check it, we will click on save 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.450
 and you will see that it has disappeared from above and 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.540
 that gives us a message that tells us that 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.939
 has been the operation has been correct 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.389
 when we do this we can close the 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:37.750
 program and finally we come to 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.849
 start all the programs we are going to 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.549
 accessories 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.889
 Once in accessories we look for a symbol 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.569
 of the system we click again 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:50.290
 secondary mouse right click on 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:54.870
 him and run as administrator on his own 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.700
 maybe we press on this button press 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.129
 we click on yes 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.430
 and here depending on the ram memory of 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.250
 your system 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.450
 you must enter a code or another I 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.790
 in my case I have to put this in the 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.530
 same post I've already put the codes 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:19.220
 possible but I in my case to the duty of 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.100
 put times of edit space bar set 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.050
 space 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.050
 and you believe 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:35.450
 and be a space 3 072 we click on 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.580
 enter 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.950
 press the enter key and we see that the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.240
 operation completed successfully 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.210
 now we can close 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.060
 and finally we're going to start and 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.830
 We restart our computer 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.110
 this is all to solve this 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.069

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.319
