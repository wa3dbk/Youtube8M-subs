those ones such as shit so basically
this<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:17.940> nearly<00:00:18.359> mostly<00:00:18.779> patch<00:00:18.960> blocker<00:00:19.170> that

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
this is nearly mostly patch blocker that

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.200 
this is nearly mostly patch blocker that
you'll<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.619> using<00:00:19.650> well<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.550> was<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.939> the

you'll be using well that was it the
patch<00:00:21.600> blocker<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.650> code<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.279> tried

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
patch blocker and the code that I tried

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.269 
patch blocker and the code that I tried
to<00:00:24.240> hide<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.830> need<00:00:25.980> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
to hide out is one that we need you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.419 
to hide out is one that we need you
right<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> proxy<00:00:27.330> settings<00:00:27.720> here<00:00:28.470> well<00:00:29.220> in

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
right in the proxy settings here well in

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.040 
right in the proxy settings here well in

I<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:43.890> writing<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.399> mine<00:00:45.239> was<00:00:45.420> already<00:00:45.660> put

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I was writing there mine was already put

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.990 
I was writing there mine was already put
in<00:00:45.930> their<00:00:46.230> side<00:00:46.440> entry<00:00:46.710> into<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.190> oh<00:00:47.340> yeah<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in their side entry into it oh yeah and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.510 
in their side entry into it oh yeah and
the<00:00:48.090> port<00:00:48.390> needs<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.809> 80<00:00:49.110> 80<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:50.129> whatever

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the port needs to be 80 80 or whatever

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.180 
the port needs to be 80 80 or whatever
its<00:00:50.760> I'm<00:00:51.180> not<00:00:51.329> too<00:00:51.449> sure<00:00:51.600> everyone<00:00:52.289> whatever

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
its I'm not too sure everyone whatever

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.189 
its I'm not too sure everyone whatever
it<00:00:53.340> says<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.879> elite<00:00:54.420> mossy<00:00:54.629> patch<00:00:54.750> poker

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
it says on the elite mossy patch poker

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.060 
it says on the elite mossy patch poker
so<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.940> port<00:00:57.270> needs<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
so that is what the port needs to be and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.939 
so that is what the port needs to be and
my<00:00:59.420> thing<00:01:00.420> took<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.809> long<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.320> sign<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.859> for

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
my thing took really long to sign up for

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
my thing took really long to sign up for
some<00:01:02.070> reason<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> kind<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.850> trim<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> video

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
some reason so I kind of trim the video

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
some reason so I kind of trim the video
a<00:01:03.660> bit<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.619> could<00:01:04.769> sign<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.820> why

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
a bit so I could sign in so that's why

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600 
a bit so I could sign in so that's why
the<00:01:06.750> background<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:08.189> whatever<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the background of the thing whatever it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
the background of the thing whatever it
is<00:01:08.790> whenever<00:01:09.540> thing<00:01:10.110> oh<00:01:10.320> yeah<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:10.799> one<00:01:10.950> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
is whenever thing oh yeah that's one you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.030 
is whenever thing oh yeah that's one you
might<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> comment<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.790> well<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.950> you

need<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> gain<00:01:14.850> data<00:01:15.180> utility

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
need to do is go to gain data utility

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690 
need to do is go to gain data utility
and<00:01:15.960> delete<00:01:16.650> whatever<00:01:16.860> call<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.310> duty<00:01:17.580> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and delete whatever call of duty you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
and delete whatever call of duty you
would<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.060> bypass<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.680> two<00:01:19.950> for

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
would like to bypass so one or two for

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.160 
would like to bypass so one or two for
example<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:20.850> bypass<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> 128<00:01:21.840> 11

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
example that would bypass you to 128 11

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.950 
example that would bypass you to 128 11
and<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:23.040> best<00:01:23.250> join<00:01:23.520> 1.11<00:01:24.119> chance<00:01:24.659> lobbies

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and your best join 1.11 chance lobbies

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.429 
and your best join 1.11 chance lobbies
and<00:01:25.280> what<00:01:26.280> more<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.939> bypass<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.509> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and what more you can bypass that you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.440 
and what more you can bypass that you
can<00:01:28.650> delete<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.490> best<00:01:29.670> join<00:01:30.030> old

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
can delete that and you best join old

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.679 
can delete that and you best join old
light<00:01:31.200> smoke<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:32.250> whatever<00:01:33.000> patch<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.630> is

you how it works when you gone to 142 if

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.550 
you how it works when you gone to 142 if
you<00:01:39.150> go<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.290> again

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you go there you have to do that again

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.520 
you go there you have to do that again
