life changing our goals as a team this
year<00:03:52.090> are<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.600> win<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.810> Central<00:03:53.140> Division

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
year are to win the Central Division

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.470 
year are to win the Central Division
which<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.519> arguably<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.970> toughest<00:03:55.330> division

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
which is arguably the toughest division

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.260 
which is arguably the toughest division
in<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> league

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
in the league

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.700 
in the league
I<00:03:56.330> think<00:03:56.570> we<00:03:56.660> could<00:03:56.810> definitely<00:03:56.930> do<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.320> and

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
I think we could definitely do that and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.030 
I think we could definitely do that and
from<00:03:58.130> there<00:03:58.340> when<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.120> Robertson<00:03:59.540> cup<00:03:59.720> and<00:04:00.040> we

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
from there when the Robertson cup and we

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.890 
from there when the Robertson cup and we
got<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.220> chemistry<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.940> work<00:04:02.420> ethic<00:04:02.600> in

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
got the chemistry and the work ethic in

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.040 
got the chemistry and the work ethic in
this<00:04:03.020> room<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.590> do<00:04:03.710> that<00:04:03.890> I<00:04:04.070> believe

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
this room to do that I believe

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.830 
this room to do that I believe
individually<00:04:06.050> my<00:04:06.470> goals<00:04:06.710> are<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.690> make<00:04:08.690> my
