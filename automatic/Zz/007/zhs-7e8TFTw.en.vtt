00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.870
 Game characters the ice peas cannon 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.309
 is a variant of the peas can without 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.860
 she shoots frozen peas the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.350
 zombies freeze and slows down the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.180
 card comes as a fire kt therefore you 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.860
 causes more harm than the regular one 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.420
 characters that hit zombies 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.220
 suffer fire damage over time 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.290
 which zombie evening you still meet 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.220
 in this mode in the later waves 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.989
 the player meets many 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.579
 different zombie bosses we have the 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.079
 song build slot machines the all four 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.530
 appears to five cases and after the 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.239
 Random boss characters selects 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.110
 First, the gravestone on the zombies 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.270
 be saved 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.679
 that appears somewhere on the map and 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.929
 the plants have to eliminate it 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:12.550
 the middle one is a new guaranteed 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.280
 Typus we extra for garden warfare 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.110
 the agency last created the agency 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.850
 there is still a bonus the plants 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.500
 So get some extra money this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.479
 it went pretty well for her 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.940
 now you can see how gary us drone the 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.319
 giga garant clock shoot down the gigant 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.940
 Watch wears like the normal watch 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.289
 Although the power pole can do with it but 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.600
 really strong and dangerous 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.190
 Power surges are different jason terry 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.640
 just play as characters and peas 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.979
 cannon 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.330
 what's your favorite cafe and peas 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.050
 Cannons are a good offensive 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.280
 combination 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.200
 I still like one 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.819
 sunflower in the team helps with healing 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.319
 and so on, but there is also the 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.550
 boss mode with which you have a missing one 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.920
 sunflower can balance 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.110
 the boss mode works with smart 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.310
 glass and the kinect motion control 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.080
 it practically uses a television 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.209
 as an overview card and can thanks kinect 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.050
 with hand movements extras on certain 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.330
 drop points 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.800
 but above all we find the smartcast 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.239
 Variation is great because it can be 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.080
 sit right in the action 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:06.399
 bring in the co-op mode in the bus 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.319
 You play in one mode 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.450
 flying camper cocked the over 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.129
 the battlefield flies in principle 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.840
 So you the pi dave of the plants 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.069
 lofty altitude helps you collect 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.360
 but you can choose a number of different 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.510
 skills on the battlefield 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.569
 what can you do so ex factory 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.980
 an extra are the playstation the 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.629
 enemies are caught near the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.250
 base of his team are located and show 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.170
 on the resin and the boss mode 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.610
 and then there are healing stations 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.470
 a teammate fit for the fight 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.060
 You can hold directly at the base 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.319
 or wherever the team is right now 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.020
 stops being dropped 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.180
 My favorit is the air strike a 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.230
 massive cherry bomb attack the per 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.690
 drag and drop on the battlefield 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.310
 can be let go if under the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.870
 you can kill him 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.590
 with exploding cherry bombs 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.239
 einheizen 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.800
 another is the extra 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.750
 resurrection becomes one in the team 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.550
 the teammates shot down 15 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.870
 up to 20 seconds to get to them 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.790
 rush and revive them 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.290
 but if the ko has gone player for 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.580
 His team can not be reached 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.290
 the boss in boss mode one 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.970
 Resuscitation station next to him 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.390
 place him and fight him back 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.850
 pick up 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.590
 the mode ends with both players 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.970
 Fighting are exactly when both are 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.470
 players go ko and no one again 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.120
 Neither the boss can be revived 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.350
 The timer is running from a team member 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.730
 and the game is lost 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.530
 but you can also lose if the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.000
 garden is destroyed so the goal is so 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.319
 the garden as long as possible 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.380
 Defend and live on it 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.380
 stay
