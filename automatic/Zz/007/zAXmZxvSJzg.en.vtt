it from autozone for like ten bucks and
the<00:01:02.730> cool<00:01:02.879> thing<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:05.309> has

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the cool thing about this is that it has

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.630 
the cool thing about this is that it has
these<00:01:06.110> different<00:01:07.110> types<00:01:07.500> inside<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> has

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
these different types inside of it has

these different types inside of it has
three<00:01:08.850> different<00:01:09.150> types<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.380> ranges<00:01:11.540> for

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
three different types so it ranges for

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.490 
three different types so it ranges for
whichever<00:01:12.869> bolt<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
whichever bolt it is and then if it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.990 
whichever bolt it is and then if it
doesn't<00:01:16.650> fit<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> first<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.670> it'll<00:01:17.880> fit

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
doesn't fit the first one then it'll fit

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.450 
doesn't fit the first one then it'll fit
the<00:01:18.090> second<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.080> on

you don't have to remove the battery I

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.900 
you don't have to remove the battery I
think<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.440> older<00:02:12.709> models<00:02:13.069> you<00:02:13.190> do<00:02:13.340> but<00:02:13.700> not

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
in these models you won't have to remove

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.240 
in these models you won't have to remove
the<00:02:15.860> battery<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.800> see<00:02:18.950> what<00:02:19.100> your

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
the battery but you see what your

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.960 
the battery but you see what your
coolant<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:20.500> wherever<00:02:21.500> your<00:02:21.620> coolant<00:02:22.070> is<00:02:22.280> it's

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
coolant is wherever your coolant is it's

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.040 
coolant is wherever your coolant is it's
like<00:02:23.410> right<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.670> don't<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.750> can<00:02:26.780> see

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
like right and then I don't you can see

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.100 
like right and then I don't you can see

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
the the lines right here where the coils

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.490 
the the lines right here where the coils
are<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.530> covered<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:32.030> know<00:02:32.060> whatever<00:02:32.500> but

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
it's right in there so I'm going to go

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.170 
it's right in there so I'm going to go
deep<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:40.269> there<00:02:41.269> it<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.480> right<00:02:41.690> there<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:43.180> is

to replace so the first thing you do is

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.729 
to replace so the first thing you do is
you<00:02:52.660> see<00:02:53.660> if<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.810> can<00:02:53.930> get<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.140> better<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:57.530> first

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
you see if I can get it better the first

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.440 
you see if I can get it better the first
thing<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.040> want<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.250> do<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.820> pull<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.239> red

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
tab up with a big big part is facing out

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.630 
tab up with a big big part is facing out
after<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.970> um<00:03:05.540> you'll<00:03:06.500> notice<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.160> the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
after that um you'll notice that the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.670 
after that um you'll notice that the
where<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.450> wire<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.690> there's<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.380> little

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
where the wire is there's like a little

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.190 
where the wire is there's like a little
clamp<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.549> push<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.000> down<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.600> pull<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:11.930> out

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
clamp you push that down and pull it out

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.259 
clamp you push that down and pull it out
and<00:03:12.500> then<00:03:12.920> you'll<00:03:13.070> be<00:03:13.130> set<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.519> go<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:17.239> just

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
and then you'll be set to go so you just

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.270 
and then you'll be set to go so you just
push<00:03:17.600> down<00:03:17.780> on<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:17.989> little<00:03:18.140> clamp<00:03:18.470> that's<00:03:19.070> in

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
push down on that little clamp that's in

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.830 
push down on that little clamp that's in
front<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.700> black<00:03:19.910> little<00:03:20.269> housing<00:03:20.690> wire

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
front of the black little housing wire

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.190 
front of the black little housing wire
and<00:03:21.590> pull<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.400> out<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:23.630> going<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.810> be<00:03:23.900> hard<00:03:24.079> at

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
and pull it out it's going to be hard at

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.569 
and pull it out it's going to be hard at
first<00:03:24.380> because<00:03:25.390> it's<00:03:26.390> covered<00:03:26.780> up<00:03:26.870> in<00:03:26.989> grease

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
first because it's covered up in grease

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.930 
first because it's covered up in grease
or<00:03:28.579> oil<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:29.150> should<00:03:29.360> say<00:03:30.220> from<00:03:31.220> all<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.730> times

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
or oil I should say from all the times

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.289 
or oil I should say from all the times
you've<00:03:32.180> driven<00:03:32.600> this<00:03:32.810> car

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
you've driven this car

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.710 
you've driven this car
so<00:03:35.299> my<00:03:36.079> best<00:03:36.260> advice<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:37.180> get<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.239> paper<00:03:38.450> towel

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
so my best advice is get a paper towel

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.000 
so my best advice is get a paper towel
and<00:03:39.670> just<00:03:40.840> clean<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.870> up<00:03:42.049> little<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.769> that<00:03:42.860> way

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
and just clean it up little so that way

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.259 
and just clean it up little so that way
it'll<00:03:43.100> be<00:03:43.160> easier<00:03:43.250> for<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.880> or<00:03:44.030> if<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.180> have

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
it'll be easier for you or if you have

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.770 
it'll be easier for you or if you have
gloves<00:03:44.920> get<00:03:45.920> some<00:03:46.100> gloves<00:03:46.630> mechanics<00:03:47.630> gloves

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
gloves get some gloves mechanics gloves

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.750 
gloves get some gloves mechanics gloves
don't<00:03:48.769> use<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.500> doctor<00:03:51.500> gloves<00:03:51.799> or<00:03:52.130> the

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
don't use like the doctor gloves or the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.930 
don't use like the doctor gloves or the
blue<00:03:53.000> whatever<00:03:53.810> gloves<00:03:54.320> they<00:03:54.470> are<00:03:54.790> don't<00:03:55.790> use

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
blue whatever gloves they are don't use

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.860 
blue whatever gloves they are don't use
those<00:03:56.120> because<00:03:56.299> you'll<00:03:56.420> be<00:03:56.450> constantly

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
those because you'll be constantly

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.220 
those because you'll be constantly
slipping<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:59.329> won't<00:03:59.510> get<00:03:59.630> a<00:03:59.660> good<00:03:59.720> grip<00:04:00.049> on<00:04:00.170> it

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
slipping you won't get a good grip on it

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.150 
slipping you won't get a good grip on it
but<00:04:01.010> once<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.060> do<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.620> once<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.709> take<00:04:03.950> that

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
but once you do that once you take that

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.910 
but once you do that once you take that
wire<00:04:04.489> off<00:04:04.730> just<00:04:05.000> kind<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.530> set<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.620> off<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.829> the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
wire off just kind of set it off to the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.449 
wire off just kind of set it off to the
side<00:04:07.329> because<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:08.450> don't<00:04:08.660> want<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:08.900> break<00:04:09.079> it

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
side because you don't want to break it

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.080 
side because you don't want to break it
and<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.420> safer<00:04:11.930> form<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:13.400> what<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:13.939> is

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
and in a safer form so what you do is

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.949 
and in a safer form so what you do is
you<00:04:14.180> take<00:04:14.359> your<00:04:14.480> big<00:04:14.689> socket<00:04:16.389> and<00:04:17.389> you<00:04:17.660> kind<00:04:17.900> of

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
you take your big socket and you kind of

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.170 
you take your big socket and you kind of
have<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:18.259> follow<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:18.769> route<00:04:19.070> if<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.030> have

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
have to follow this route if you have

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.439 
have to follow this route if you have
like<00:04:20.329> bigger<00:04:20.600> arms<00:04:20.870> or<00:04:20.989> whatever<00:04:22.150> so<00:04:23.150> you<00:04:23.210> go

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
like bigger arms or whatever so you go
