00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:09.100
 yes 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.139
 well I bring you a new video and this 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.949
 video should be the first one that I do 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.080
 I think it's related to hair 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.330
 It takes more or less things a month 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.000
 using a product for hair and 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.570
 the product in question is this shampoo 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.199
 dry batista brand 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.400
 what dry shampoos do 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.640
 basically to give a more 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.150
 clean to the hair and also to give 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 volume 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.520
 the little prince just used it for 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.960
 Give the hair a cleaner look 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.270
 because it is the truth that there are times that 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.170
 likewise they have a little hair grease and 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.170
 you do not have time to 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.350
 it is a product that for those occasions 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.930
 it comes very well, it comes very well 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.570
 if you have a hair that tends to be 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.210
 quite greasy the truth is that what 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.780
 you are 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.510
 the result we're going to hallucinate is because the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 greasy appearance removes in a moment 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.300
 how this type of shampoo applies 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.150
 almost all dry shampoos so 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.580
 less those that are 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.470
 So what you have to do is 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.840
 camps on your camel to a 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.280
 distance of 30 centimeters 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.280
 after that, how are you going to be 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.170
 hair with product rest now what 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.320
 you will see because I am going to teach you you have 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.970
 to massage it and if you want to style it 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.420
 as I do not floor my hair because 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.980
 almost always I wear it wavy 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.770
 I just massage it or until I see 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.230
 that the product is no longer seen here 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.800
 where I live in the beginning I've only seen 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.200
 this one called blas and then 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.960
 you also have another one that is like in shades 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.030
 green that is the original I know that 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.670
 quite is more especially good if 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.360
 look on English pages you can 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.940
 find many models well 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.510
 let's apply it I'm going to remove the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.510
 pigtail 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.570
 I'm going to apply it because I already have my hair 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.970
 a little greasy especially in this area and 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.170
 so I do not know if you will see how it is going to 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.080
 remain the result but 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.450
 so you can see more or less how 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.890
 use 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.890
 and 30 centimeters less 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.260
 do not worry a click is the hair 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.440
 very white do not worry because this 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.440
 it goes 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.490
 I especially did it on this 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:56.490
 area that is where I get the most where 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:03:01.430
 happened down here also the smell here 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.430
 It puts floral seduction is a smell 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.840
 if equal to flowers it does not turn back 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:14.110
 pretty good and it gives a feeling of 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.320
 clean of fresh good good as you see 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.410
 I'm divine right now it's worth it 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.320
 What we do is massage the hair to 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.000
 you do not see white hair basically 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.000
 with which it is necessary to do so 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.460
 moving it with your hands 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.200
 if you can also you can crouch the 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.110
 head as if you were washing the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.860
 hair but good for you to see it well 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.860
 I do it like that 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.510
 and be careful with your ears be careful with 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.090
 ears because also as I go to 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.800
 fight for this area primarily as 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.160
 be careful with the ears that stay 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.160
 white 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.910
 the result is instantaneous is that I the 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.570
 truth is that when I tried it I hallucinated 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.000
 because you happen to see hair pretty 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.100
 fatty 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.240
 as if it were washed at the time 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.760
 it is a product that more or less the price 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.560
 about 3 of the 50 four euros depends 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.110
 from where you buy it you can also 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.160
 buy online left us some link 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.880
 some page where you can find it 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.130
 what I tell you is a product that does not 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.880
 it's expensive, it's going to spread a lot because 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.490
 I tell you what floor and not use all 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.820
 days but when I see that the hair 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.130
 already tend to put a little fat this 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.860
 it takes away from washing our hair like 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.250
 habitually you go it or that is not 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.590
 replaces a hair wash in 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.870
 wet with your shampoo and yours 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.480
 mask is not this to give a 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.030
 cleaner appearance to the hair is a 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.460
 product that I recommend 100% of 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.740
 true to prove it because 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.330
 it's worth it and it really works 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.389
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.380
 this product encourage you to try it and we 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.380
 we see in the following video
