00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.720
 So everyone halved to a new video and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.210
 today it's time again 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.040
 minecraft redstone tutorial yes right 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.469
 No illusion belongs to a minecraft council 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.769
 the tutorial and it is about a 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.809
 minecraft blockade changer at sand like that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.160
 that's normal sand in the red 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.090
 sand to switch or exchange 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.070
 can transform 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.020
 and of course also red sand in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.029
 normal sand that goes out and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.320
 back again the whole is here from 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.400
 a little circuit made 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.349
 I will give you the same again 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 show how to build and first on 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.740
 the one who came up with the idea that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.480
 was not nice build underlined mcd 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 Correspond to channel is the description 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 link and yes I have the easy times 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.660
 rebuilt and you will be very short 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.280
 show how it works because I have something 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.899
 never imagined the other one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.129
 hundreds of tutorials not yet and 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.969
 that's why it's time for the series 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.100
 is nothing new 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.090
 well next I have it once 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.440
 demonstrate like the whole thing 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.550
 works we have one here 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.860
 built a small machine that is now 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.989
 not too big but it changes us 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 normal santin red sand just around 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.280
 make it a little bit small 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.010
 high I know now the researchers is out 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.960
 that just and secondly the one with each other 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 play blocks into each other in press 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.490
 a special frequency and then 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.840
 It does not make a blog out of it 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.850
 should actually have a small one 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 made web where practically the eaves 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 Rabbit show jumping in and then goes into it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.659
 clean the box as you know when sand 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.549
 falls on a sap then flopped and the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.930
 all round collect the ding pure and 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.259
 they do not know so pure 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.270
 surprise 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.560
 normal then we here I 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.820
 Just press the butler to see what 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.110
 you have to go a bit to the left 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 then look into the picture half 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.329
 Danger 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.369
 i hope you can see and co and who 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.930
 and golf and you now see just the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 block the here or the block after 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.049
 pressed front is actually a 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.880
 normal sand blog when the work 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.560
 together with these sand blog here in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.180
 the middle collides changes 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.100
 directly to the normal his blog and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.329
 The slopes here are taking over 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 or on the spot so fast again 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.329
 back that he does not do it on time 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.920
 manages to pull the block out again 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.840
 learns down and then stays 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.850
 red sand if and how then seek it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.640
 are red sun use but use 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 only here are these normal sand formats 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.259
 You can go through it completely once 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.259
 heat 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.760
 which is now turned down here 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.490
 then here yet 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.840
 the blocks or so two blocks a blog 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.940
 now one last one 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.140
 normal sand blog that others already know 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.760
 be as a red to the red 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.650
 have been transformed and then I already do 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.370
 take a look and then it will be 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.270
 Rotandsand underneath the round as well as me 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.180
 can theoretically do it again 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.550
 that I just have that or that 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.450
 hv so that the sand remains and 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.460
 then I'll see right away 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 that's normal yesterday 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.670
 sand the online we have red sand 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.970
 completely full 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.020
 and yes, I'll say it for a minute 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.910
 I show like that or shows like that 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.260
 conversion works next to one 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.820
 safari still and that you can do that too 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.010
 can do differently that one 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.240
 red sand to make one again 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.410
 which of course is logical because 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.210
 to be more normal threw christi 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.130
 the red sand is a bit rarer 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.990
 and then do it all over again 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.459
 but here and the whole is not 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.340
 with gremmel the handle another 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.840
 blogger has and not such a back 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.950
 Small addition worth than it is all 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.320
 here the number 001 2/1 and that is the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.830
 12 and back / 03 attack many 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.200
 other 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.030
 that's why it's not possible and twice 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.400
 normal otherwise made out to our red 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.420
 then how do you build the thing up 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.550
 I'll just do it again 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.730
 make a complete ball so we need 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.430
 a small platform that is five times 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.000
 seven blocks with the square one two 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.070
 three four five and put them backwards 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.410
 so 3567 then just simply short 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.610
 before so I will be a little 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.140
 A little bit over here 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.830
 does not look a bit off that 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.480
 not surprised 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.680
 up front then the button must ever 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.030
 after and you can too 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.050
 but automate that now again 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.260
 the simple principle 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.160
 because you can still make emerged moderately 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.570
 that you did not have to do it anymore 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.150
 that was too exaggerated 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.850
 I think good first, first need 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.150
 the middle comes the button there 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.350
 Much can happen expression like that and 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.330
 behind this button comes a repeater 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.959
 which is headed forward at the time 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.550
 to get a short blog now 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.019
 where a runway is underneath and yourself 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.519
 each just barely out otherwise 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.859
 laptop currently up is a stick 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.260
 shows such slopes upwards 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.750
 there comes a blog talk to him 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.730
 well then from the side there are 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.710
 once each redstone redstone and 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.300
 henrik petre and a repeater that has to 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.550
 once delayed 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.080
 because the piste does not press both without complaint 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.490
 but should first and then 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.770
 again other block of converted 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.630
 should be in the other already rad 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.400
 pushed is pushed in because of it 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.380
 short delays at the slopes in front 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.770
 then it turns out later good skiing 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.300
 They go there until after 90 also 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.530
 to the back and again after 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.820
 in the back and here a small staircase 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.530
 top down like that and muzzles down 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.490
 because he has to fight there 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.310
 she then and then once so forward 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.170
 then we have the front here between the 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.940
 then both run the hole where the whole 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.590
 100 drops and we can do that 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.110
 actually down here with relish 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.810
 I'll do some small boxes with the hopper 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.510
 Turn on it without slap over it then falls 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.950
 he thought parts will be collected 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.210
 should be quite good and accordingly 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.860
 that would be it already 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.970
 been 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.890
 I think I did not forget anything but 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.270
 we'll just test it that means you 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.920
 red sand comes in and that means here 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.940
 comes again as an antenna and then 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.070
 Let's press the button 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.930
 and as you can see the user will be back 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.420
 transformed and below accordingly 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.640
 then a small one can be collected as well 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.550
 bell after wemmer short 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.110
 regrets what he wants and then 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.970
 we'll get the red out and 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.770
 can bag the red sand 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.850
 she is a really nice idea and 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.080
 perhaps yes useful winter 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.350
 maybe he needs another or 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.690
 others of you and i hope it was good 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.830
 and informative presents itself as much more 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.940
 I do not do the video 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.430
 unnecessarily lengthen 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.800
 how it looks like that's the sand 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.090
 converter then yes we have been better 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.800
 see us for the next video until then 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.800
 last crash and low 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.770
 on
