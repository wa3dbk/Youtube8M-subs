00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
hey guys what's going on it's 96 Donna

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.430 
hey guys what's going on it's 96 Donna
here<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.680> have<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.240> unboxing<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.390> the<00:00:09.570> AMD

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
here and I have the unboxing of the AMD

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.270 
here and I have the unboxing of the AMD
a-series<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.520> 850<00:00:12.360> 500<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.770> quad<00:00:14.010> core

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
a-series a 850 500 it's a quad core

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.830 
a-series a 850 500 it's a quad core
processing<00:00:14.820> unit

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
processing unit

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.990 
processing unit
it's<00:00:16.170> an<00:00:16.260> APU<00:00:16.530> so<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.950> has<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.220> GPU<00:00:17.700> and<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
it's an APU so it has the GPU and the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.850 
it's an APU so it has the GPU and the
CPU<00:00:18.570> into<00:00:19.380> one

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
CPU into one

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.750 
CPU into one
so<00:00:20.220> over<00:00:20.610> here<00:00:21.650> we<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.860> clearly<00:00:23.100> see<00:00:23.400> some<00:00:23.640> of

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
so over here we can clearly see some of

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.050 
so over here we can clearly see some of
the<00:00:24.680> graphics<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.800> come<00:00:25.980> with<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.550> a8

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the graphics that come with it so the a8

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
the graphics that come with it so the a8
that<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.360> have<00:00:27.690> can<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.440> classified<00:00:28.860> with<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.160> 65

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
that I have can be classified with a 65

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.770 
that I have can be classified with a 65
70<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> 66<00:00:30.930> 60<00:00:31.350> and<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.369> a6<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.630> guys

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
70 and a 66 60 and the a6 and you guys

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.860 
70 and a 66 60 and the a6 and you guys
can<00:00:33.960> read<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.260> yourself<00:00:34.320> too<00:00:34.710> right

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
can read it for yourself too right

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.030 
can read it for yourself too right
you<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> processor<00:00:37.650> in<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> box

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
you can see the processor in the box

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.150 
you can see the processor in the box
here<00:00:38.280> some<00:00:39.000> useful<00:00:39.329> information<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> back

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
here some useful information on the back

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.580 
here some useful information on the back
I've<00:00:41.160> already<00:00:41.489> opened<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.149> let's<00:00:42.720> unbox<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
I've already opened it so let's unbox it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100 
I've already opened it so let's unbox it
when<00:00:43.800> when<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.640> first<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.660> when<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
when when you first do on but when you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.729 
when when you first do on but when you
first<00:00:46.380> embarks<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.010> you'll<00:00:47.489> discover<00:00:48.739> what

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
first embarks it you'll discover what

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.960 
first embarks it you'll discover what
will<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.489> find

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
will you find

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.660 
will you find
so<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.730> nd<00:00:53.730> manual<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:55.489> highly<00:00:56.489> suggest

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so we have a nd manual I highly suggest

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
so we have a nd manual I highly suggest
that<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.149> guys<00:00:57.270> read<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> tells<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.290> how

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that you guys read it it tells you how

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.900 
that you guys read it it tells you how
to<00:00:58.649> insert<00:00:59.309> it<00:01:00.469> what<00:01:01.469> else<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.829> have<00:01:01.910> if

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
to insert it what else do we have if

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.299 
to insert it what else do we have if
you'd<00:01:03.570> sink<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.679> the<00:01:04.769> heat<00:01:04.979> sink<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you'd sink so this is the heat sink that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.929 
you'd sink so this is the heat sink that
comes<00:01:05.459> with<00:01:05.819> our<00:01:07.459> it's<00:01:08.459> not<00:01:08.579> tell<00:01:08.789> me<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:10.939> guess

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
comes with our it's not tell me I guess

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.520 
comes with our it's not tell me I guess
you<00:01:12.090> could<00:01:12.240> say<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.569> very<00:01:12.780> big<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.350> not

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you could say it's not very big it's not

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.279 
you could say it's not very big it's not
very<00:01:13.709> nice<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.639> not<00:01:14.819> the<00:01:14.880> best<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.959> already

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
very nice it's not the best some already

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.769 
very nice it's not the best some already
far<00:01:17.159> more<00:01:17.279> compound<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.939> I've<00:01:18.539> just

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:18.779 
far more compound there I've just

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.419 
far more compound there I've just
touched<00:01:18.959> that<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.469> kind<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.889> ruined<00:01:20.219> it

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
touched that and kind of ruined it

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.480 
touched that and kind of ruined it
whoops<00:01:21.439> trying<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.499> put<00:01:22.679> this<00:01:22.770> over<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.069> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
whoops trying to put this over here it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.459 
whoops trying to put this over here it
has<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.240> four<00:01:24.539> pin<00:01:25.639> it's<00:01:26.639> four<00:01:27.329> pins<00:01:27.569> so<00:01:28.049> yeah

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
has the four pin it's four pins so yeah

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.330 
has the four pin it's four pins so yeah
that's<00:01:28.799> fine<00:01:30.529> what<00:01:31.529> does<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> say<00:01:31.889> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.099> fan

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that's fine what does it say on the fan

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.919 
that's fine what does it say on the fan
on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.609> fan<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.149> just<00:01:33.329> has<00:01:33.479> some<00:01:33.659> random<00:01:34.490> stuff

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
on the fan it just has some random stuff

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.499 
on the fan it just has some random stuff
random<00:01:36.929> numbers<00:01:37.499> and<00:01:37.529> letters<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.969> CPU

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
random numbers and letters and the CPU

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.199 
random numbers and letters and the CPU
itself<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:40.109> right<00:01:40.319> here<00:01:40.619> time<00:01:41.609> to<00:01:41.759> take<00:01:41.969> it<00:01:42.090> out

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
itself is right here time to take it out

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
itself is right here time to take it out
of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.450> box<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.169> is<00:01:46.319> this<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.249> the<00:01:47.399> CPU

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
of the box so here it is this is the CPU

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.440 
of the box so here it is this is the CPU
so<00:01:49.229> what<00:01:49.349> about<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.590> open<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.979> baby<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:06.080 

whoa<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.289> go

so<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.420> here<00:02:07.690> guys<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.500> AMD<00:02:10.050> chip<00:02:11.050> that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
so this here guys is the AMD chip that

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.440 
so this here guys is the AMD chip that
you<00:02:11.440> guys<00:02:11.620> are<00:02:11.800> buying<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:13.000> depending<00:02:13.330> where

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
you guys are buying so depending where

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.420 
you guys are buying so depending where
you<00:02:13.510> buy<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:13.930> about<00:02:14.110> 70<00:02:14.680> pounds<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:15.160> got

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
you buy it it's about 70 pounds I got

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.870 
you buy it it's about 70 pounds I got
mine<00:02:15.580> for<00:02:15.820> 78<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:17.410> it's<00:02:18.190> not<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.490> bad<00:02:18.610> you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
mine for 78 but it's not that bad you

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.210 
mine for 78 but it's not that bad you
guys<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.270> see<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.540> from<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> distance<00:02:20.260> all<00:02:21.010> of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
guys can see it from the distance all of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.000 
guys can see it from the distance all of
the<00:02:21.340> pins<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.880> back<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.800> guys<00:02:23.950> can

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the pins on the back and you guys can

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.560 
the pins on the back and you guys can
probably<00:02:24.400> tell<00:02:24.760> there's<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> little<00:02:25.090> triangle

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
probably tell there's a little triangle

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.100
