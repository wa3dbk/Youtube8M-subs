didn't you you know it over this so well
that's<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.780> motley<00:04:52.290> had<00:04:52.560> anthrax<00:04:53.190> oh<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:54.420> did<00:04:54.600> it

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
that's a motley had anthrax oh it did it

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.230 
that's a motley had anthrax oh it did it
cracked<00:04:54.960> itself<00:04:55.380> out<00:04:55.590> right<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.800> we<00:04:59.700> got<00:04:59.880> a<00:04:59.910> few

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
cracked itself out right so we got a few

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.810 
cracked itself out right so we got a few
cool<00:05:00.480> snakes<00:05:00.900> here<00:05:01.170> for<00:05:01.410> our<00:05:01.470> future<00:05:01.890> dream

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
cool snakes here for our future dream

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.270 
cool snakes here for our future dream
projects<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:03.780> it'll<00:05:04.530> be<00:05:04.620> interesting<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:05.070> see

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
projects and it'll be interesting to see

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.250 
projects and it'll be interesting to see
what<00:05:05.460> we<00:05:05.580> can<00:05:05.700> get<00:05:05.820> out<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.120> them<00:05:06.210> they<00:05:07.050> look

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
what we can get out of them they look

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.880 
what we can get out of them they look
good<00:05:07.470> they're<00:05:07.890> nice-looking<00:05:08.100> snakes<00:05:09.830> got<00:05:10.830> a

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
good they're nice-looking snakes got a

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.940 
good they're nice-looking snakes got a
cool<00:05:11.700> selection<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.420> genes<00:05:12.630> in<00:05:12.840> them<00:05:13.020> we<00:05:13.650> can't

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
cool selection of genes in them we can't

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.740 
cool selection of genes in them we can't
wait<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.340> go<00:05:14.520> backwards<00:05:15.030> on<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:15.600> see

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
wait to go backwards on this and see

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.560 
wait to go backwards on this and see
what<00:05:15.840> we<00:05:15.930> can<00:05:16.110> make<00:05:16.140> with<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:16.640> we<00:05:17.640> got<00:05:17.880> it<00:05:18.120> looks

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
what we can make with it we got it looks

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.950 
what we can make with it we got it looks
like<00:05:18.750> three<00:05:19.440> or<00:05:19.950> four<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.370> them<00:05:20.720> that's<00:05:21.720> one

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
like three or four of them that's one

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.610 
like three or four of them that's one
right<00:05:22.110> there

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
right there

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:30.440 
right there
let's<00:05:23.190> see<00:05:26.510> mmm<00:05:27.570> that's<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.170> weird<00:05:28.410> color<00:05:29.450> kind

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
let's see mmm that's a weird color kind

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.030 
let's see mmm that's a weird color kind
of<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.660> bluey<00:05:30.990> color<00:05:31.380> huh<00:05:31.680> yep<00:05:33.410> they<00:05:34.410> vary<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.830> lot

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
of a bluey color huh yep they vary a lot

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.920 
of a bluey color huh yep they vary a lot
so<00:05:35.880> it'll<00:05:36.060> be<00:05:36.150> interesting<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.630> see<00:05:36.810> what

so it'll be interesting to see what

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.560 
so it'll be interesting to see what
these<00:05:37.080> do<00:05:37.260> when<00:05:37.410> they<00:05:37.500> come<00:05:37.680> out<00:05:40.490> yeah<00:05:41.570> good

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
these do when they come out yeah good

looking snake there you go guys playing
with<00:05:46.590> some<00:05:46.830> new<00:05:46.980> genes<00:05:47.480> should<00:05:48.480> make<00:05:48.690> some

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
with some new genes should make some

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.630 
with some new genes should make some
we'll<00:05:49.020> get<00:05:49.230> you<00:05:49.440> later<00:05:49.650> right<00:05:50.010> remember<00:05:50.520> about
