00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.320
 with difficulties to transport 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.630
 users of route 4 of 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.270
 buses that thin city leads 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.850
 to the center of San Salvador to early 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.640
 hours in the morning another driver suffered 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.920
 an attack by presumed gang members 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.070
 he was transferred to a hospital center 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.070
 where he died 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.829
 in which we are right now passing here 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.829
 in this country also trittico 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.079
 they are afraid but they are right 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.570
 because to be afraid of how to kill a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.120
 our partner today can be us 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.550
 tomorrow we can be us then 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 that to this fear assumes the murder 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.420
 from a driver on the same route 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 happened last Monday 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.899
 All very well 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.899
 the experience 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.500
 the minibuses are guarded by 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.830
 police officers throughout the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.420
 travel of fear but clear that the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 colleagues asking for security in the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.009
 minibuses is everything so they go out to work 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.409
 while there is no security they are not with 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.110
 I was afraid to work and I told them 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 that you can not want to work that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.649
 work that does not see it go but 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.000
 did not stay have the things because 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.000
 I really tell you to trust in God 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.700
 travel the entire travel goes go to 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.280
 projects but go for the good 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.409
 fear insecurity also affects 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.719
 users who have tackled routes 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.119
 alternate to accomplish their errands 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.759
 they are worried about the risk situation 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.370
 key that are right people because the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.740
 fear the fear of life 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.979
 they have to find a way to protect you 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.070
 the user but then also the government 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.830
 should take alternatives to find a 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.050
 exit to these problems because they are not 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.020
 still affecting what at the national level 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.670
 it goes because these ways are 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.769
 Salvadorans and we have to walk on foot 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.860
 and look for the job well what do I do other 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.110
 means to work and forward the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.590
 irregular service will remain for the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.590
 moment 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.470
 units leave later than usual 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.840
 and guarded by elements of the pn ce 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.210
 and the armed forces that monitor the 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.210
 thin city areas with images of 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.210
