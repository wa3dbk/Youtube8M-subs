we've<00:00:01.050> all<00:00:01.199> heard<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.469> term<00:00:01.560> rust<00:00:02.280> never

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
we've all heard the term rust never

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.460 
we've all heard the term rust never
sleeps<00:00:02.700> and<00:00:03.270> it's<00:00:03.389> true<00:00:03.629> especially<00:00:03.870> on<00:00:04.290> your

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
sleeps and it's true especially on your

car<00:00:04.710> once<00:00:05.580> Russ<00:00:05.850> gets<00:00:06.120> started<00:00:06.629> he<00:00:06.990> has<00:00:07.109> a

car once Russ gets started he has a
tendency<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.830> spread<00:00:08.189> all<00:00:08.460> over<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.910> car<00:00:09.150> but

tendency to spread all over the car but

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.330 
tendency to spread all over the car but
there<00:00:09.929> are<00:00:10.050> some<00:00:10.380> things<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:11.070> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
of panels and rust will start just like

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
of panels and rust will start just like
this<00:00:50.420> what<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.629> too<00:00:51.780> late<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.140> rust<00:00:52.320> has

this what if it's too late and rust has

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.770 
this what if it's too late and rust has
already<00:00:52.739> started<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.309> your<00:00:53.460> vehicle<00:00:53.940> first<00:00:54.570> of

already started on your vehicle first of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
already started on your vehicle first of
all<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.110> just<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.500> small<00:00:55.860> chip<00:00:56.219> or<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
all if it's just a small chip or a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
all if it's just a small chip or a
scratch<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.329> rust<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:58.109> minor

most<00:00:59.160> shops<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.670> take<00:00:59.879> care<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.270> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
most shops can take care of that and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.910 
most shops can take care of that and
just<00:01:00.570> refinish<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> panel<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.590> you're<00:01:01.710> good

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
just refinish the panel and you're good

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.209 
just refinish the panel and you're good
to<00:01:01.949> go

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
to go

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.939 
to go
now<00:01:02.910> rust<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.110> 30<00:01:04.320> started<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
now rust like this the 30 started to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.950 
now rust like this the 30 started to
bubble<00:01:05.129> through<00:01:05.430> from<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> backside<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
bubble through from the backside is a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260 
bubble through from the backside is a
whole<00:01:07.290> different<00:01:07.470> story<00:01:07.890> first<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
whole different story first of all you

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.969 
whole different story first of all you
never<00:01:09.450> want<00:01:09.750> somebody<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.380> grind<00:01:10.680> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
never want somebody just to grind this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
never want somebody just to grind this
panel<00:01:11.369> down<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.939> smear<00:01:12.390> some<00:01:12.570> filler<00:01:12.869> over

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
panel down and smear some filler over

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.630 
panel down and smear some filler over
the<00:01:13.229> top<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.189> rust<00:01:14.460> will

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the top of it because that rust will

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.100 
the top of it because that rust will
just<00:01:14.820> come<00:01:14.970> back<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.720> wasted

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
just come back and you will have wasted

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.890 
just come back and you will have wasted
your<00:01:16.170> money<00:01:16.549> I've<00:01:17.549> got<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.970> panel<00:01:18.360> cut<00:01:18.659> off

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
your money I've got this panel cut off

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.810 
your money I've got this panel cut off
so<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> inside<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.430> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.330 

that<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.000> rust<00:01:25.270> is<00:01:26.080> more<00:01:26.320> than<00:01:26.500> twice<00:01:26.830> as<00:01:26.890> much

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
that the rust is more than twice as much

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.660 
that the rust is more than twice as much
as<00:01:27.909> you<00:01:28.150> see<00:01:28.360> on<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:28.630> outside<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.280> as<00:01:30.370> you<00:01:30.520> can

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
as you see on the outside so as you can

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.120 
as you see on the outside so as you can
see<00:01:31.290> even<00:01:32.290> if<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.440> tried<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.770> fill<00:01:32.950> these

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
see even if you tried to fill these

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.310 
see even if you tried to fill these
holes<00:01:33.400> on<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.729> outside<00:01:34.210> all<00:01:34.510> of<00:01:34.690> this<00:01:34.840> rust<00:01:35.140> on

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
holes on the outside all of this rust on

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.469 
holes on the outside all of this rust on
the<00:01:35.470> inside<00:01:35.830> would<00:01:36.010> eventually<00:01:36.400> work<00:01:37.150> its<00:01:37.330> way

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
the inside would eventually work its way

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.510 
the inside would eventually work its way
back<00:01:37.659> out<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.290> rust<00:01:38.920> will<00:01:39.100> come<00:01:39.310> right

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
back out and that rust will come right

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.850 
back out and that rust will come right
back<00:01:39.760> what<00:01:40.690> someone<00:01:41.020> needs<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.350> do<00:01:41.530> is
