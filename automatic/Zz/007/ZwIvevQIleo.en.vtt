 although some believe that we are joking that there is an error in the title 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.660
 of the note are wrong because it is no joke or some error of the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.410
 annual hearing looks edition since the new disney family channel 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.160
 we talk about disney xd has acquired the license to issue naruto shippuden in 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.349
 Yankeeland 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.399
 in a press release the media view signed distributor 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.460
 that naruto shippuden was acquired by disney xd in gringolandia 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.109
 and will start broadcasting next month 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.789
 Naruto Shippuden was already being broadcast by many sites of 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.260
 star min as animen and us network and with chiroque 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.080
 the first season of the series was broadcast by shit network in 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.680
 gringolandia but decided to cancel it missing the last episodes 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.410
 after this bis media previously announced that the channel had not 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.570
 acquired the second part of the anime which probably means that shit 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.900
 network was not really interested in the series 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.570
 the director of acquisitions and co-productions for disney studios 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.710
 abc cable networks group according to the tony zone site said disney xd is trying 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.980
 to extend the reach to our target audience children between 6 and 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.450
 14 years old and we hope to take the naruto shippuden adventures to our 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.560
 lifetime 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.829
 in europe the local versions of jetix disney xd present in some countries has 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.070
 exposed in numerous times anime in his programming including the first 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 Naruto season 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.160
 with this naruto shippuden you can get to disney xd in latin america something that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.160
 it may be very possible taking by surprise those who believed that the series 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.820
 could be acquired by shit network today even by animax for 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.810
 latin america now disney xd is shaping up as the top candidate for 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.570
 its transmission 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.450
 this proves once and for all that disney xd is actually the intention 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.980
 to compete directly with shit network in addition to being a new blow to 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.660
 network fuck that apparently follows and without fear of failing I will say that it will continue 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.210
 losing against disney because apparently the management levels of a 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.259
 channel with others are abysmal since one does have identity and the other shit 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.330
 network lost it a long time ago
