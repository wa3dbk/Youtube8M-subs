00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
sense and they're actually expending far

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.710 
sense and they're actually expending far
more<00:00:26.130> energy<00:00:26.460> than<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.670> should<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.210> getting

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
more energy than they should and getting

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.630 
more energy than they should and getting
way<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.349> results<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.099> today's<00:00:29.189> video

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
ridiculous and actually how you could be

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.870 
ridiculous and actually how you could be
doing<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.630> way<00:00:33.930> better<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.590> getting<00:00:35.280> more

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880

doing it way better and getting more
results<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.540> less<00:00:36.570> effort

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:44.869 

okay<00:00:42.929> so<00:00:42.989> 80/20<00:00:43.710> what<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> heck<00:00:44.429> does<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.699> mean

okay so 80/20 what the heck does it mean

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.180 
okay so 80/20 what the heck does it mean
I<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.420> none<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.929> you<00:00:46.079> actually<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.739> history

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
despite the fact you can find every bit

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.700 
despite the fact you can find every bit
of<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.609> online<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> 80/20<00:00:52.469> principle

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
of it online but the 80/20 principle

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.219 
of it online but the 80/20 principle
it's<00:00:53.670> called<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> Pareto<00:00:54.329> principle<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.109> it

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
it's called the Pareto principle and it

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.319 
it's called the Pareto principle and it
actually<00:00:55.379> means<00:00:55.920> at<00:00:56.429> least<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.729> a<00:00:56.820> business

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
actually means at least in a business

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.779 
actually means at least in a business
setting<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> most<00:00:58.019> settings<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> spend

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
setting in most settings that you spend

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
setting in most settings that you spend
twenty<00:01:00.600> percent<00:01:01.019> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> efforts<00:01:01.589> to<00:01:01.769> get

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
twenty percent of the efforts to get

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.829 
twenty percent of the efforts to get
eighty<00:01:02.159> percent<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> results<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
eighty percent of the results so if you

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.179 
eighty percent of the results so if you
wanted<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.259> fishing<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:04.830> wanted<00:01:05.039> to<00:01:05.100> be

smart and evolved about it you would

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.679 
smart and evolved about it you would
actually<00:01:07.530> focus<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.520> twenty<00:01:09.299> percent<00:01:09.330> of

however<00:01:44.390> most<00:01:45.390> people<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.229> completely

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
however most people do it completely

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.179 
however most people do it completely
backwards<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.969> it<00:01:48.840> kills<00:01:49.229> me<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.590> if

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
backwards and it kills me because if

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.560 
backwards and it kills me because if
you're<00:01:50.340> doing<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.700> completely<00:01:50.820> backwards<00:01:51.420> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you're doing it completely backwards and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.330 
you're doing it completely backwards and
here's<00:01:51.780> what's<00:01:51.990> happening<00:01:52.409> you're<00:01:53.070> actually

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
here's what's happening you're actually

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.149 
here's what's happening you're actually
putting<00:01:53.609> in<00:01:53.960> four<00:01:54.960> times<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.649> effort<00:01:56.009> that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
putting in four times the effort that

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.399 
putting in four times the effort that
you<00:01:56.280> should<00:01:56.429> be<00:01:56.520> putting<00:01:56.789> in<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.420> you're

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
you should be putting in and you're

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.560 
you should be putting in and you're
probably<00:01:58.770> only<00:01:59.369> getting<00:01:59.640> about<00:01:59.820> 20%<00:02:00.450> of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
probably only getting about 20% of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.090 
probably only getting about 20% of
results<00:02:01.079> whereas<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.500> could<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.920> getting

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
results whereas you could be getting

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.849 
results whereas you could be getting
eighty<00:02:02.939> percent<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> results<00:02:04.109> so<00:02:04.679> for

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
eighty percent of the results so for

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:06.319 
eighty percent of the results so for
instance<00:02:05.189> when<00:02:05.700> most<00:02:05.850> people<00:02:06.119> say<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
instance when most people say that

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.210 
instance when most people say that
they're<00:02:06.570> 80/20<00:02:07.079> paleo<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:07.679> they<00:02:07.799> really

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
they're 80/20 paleo what they really

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.639 
they're 80/20 paleo what they really
mean<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.880> about<00:02:09.539> 80%<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.289> their<00:02:10.440> meals

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
mean is that about 80% of their meals

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.069 
mean is that about 80% of their meals
usually<00:02:11.070> less<00:02:11.459> they're<00:02:12.390> eating<00:02:12.750> quote

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
usually less they're eating quote

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.009 
usually less they're eating quote
unquote<00:02:13.170> paleo<00:02:13.680> foods<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.310> 20%<00:02:15.209> or<00:02:15.780> slightly

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
more they're eating junk food so often

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.539 
more they're eating junk food so often
on<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.780> weekends<00:02:19.260> people<00:02:19.440> eat<00:02:19.829> complete<00:02:20.250> junk

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
on the weekends people eat complete junk

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.280 
on the weekends people eat complete junk
or<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.000> whenever<00:02:21.209> they<00:02:21.570> feel<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.049> maybe

here's<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.000> problem<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:25.350> body

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
here's the problem with that your body

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.559 
here's the problem with that your body
doesn't<00:02:26.010> work<00:02:26.280> mill<00:02:26.670> by<00:02:26.819> mill<00:02:27.060> at<00:02:27.180> least<00:02:27.390> not

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
doesn't work mill by mill at least not

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.960 
doesn't work mill by mill at least not
in<00:02:27.600> every<00:02:28.019> way<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.859> instance<00:02:29.220> if<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.730> put

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
in every way so for instance if you put

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.430 
in every way so for instance if you put
certain<00:02:30.150> toxins<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.780> your<00:02:30.810> body<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.170> mean<00:02:31.290> think

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
certain toxins in your body I mean think

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
certain toxins in your body I mean think
about<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.769> way<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.280> eat<00:02:33.060> arsenic<00:02:33.660> for

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
about it this way if you eat arsenic for

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.120 
about it this way if you eat arsenic for
one<00:02:33.989> meal<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.470> doesn't<00:02:34.680> matter<00:02:34.799> that<00:02:34.859> you<00:02:35.010> only

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
one meal it doesn't matter that you only

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.650 
one meal it doesn't matter that you only
ate<00:02:35.340> at<00:02:35.459> Point<00:02:35.640> mill<00:02:35.880> it's<00:02:36.120> probably<00:02:36.569> gonna

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
ate at Point mill it's probably gonna

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.690 
ate at Point mill it's probably gonna
kill<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.049> if<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.230> ate<00:02:37.350> enough<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.889> with

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
kill you if you ate enough of it with

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.129 
kill you if you ate enough of it with
toxins<00:02:39.209> it's<00:02:39.389> similar<00:02:39.660> they're<00:02:39.930> going<00:02:40.049> to

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
toxins it's similar they're going to

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.379 
toxins it's similar they're going to
kill<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.680> at<00:02:40.889> least<00:02:41.069> not<00:02:41.280> initially<00:02:41.519> but<00:02:42.299> if

kill you at least not initially but if

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:43.670 
kill you at least not initially but if
you<00:02:42.510> eat<00:02:42.630> gluten<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.139> could<00:02:43.350> cause<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
you eat processed sugar it's going to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.030 
you eat processed sugar it's going to

than<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.580> meal<00:02:50.819> if<00:02:51.330> you're<00:02:51.690> eating

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
than just that meal if you're eating

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.550 
than just that meal if you're eating
omega-6<00:02:53.010> fats

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
unsaturated fats and they're going to

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.010 
unsaturated fats and they're going to
produce<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.459> lot<00:02:58.300> of<00:02:58.420> problems<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.900> lot<00:02:58.989> of

information for months at a time so

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.330 
information for months at a time so
although<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.870> might<00:03:02.230> think<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:03.220> you're

certain kinds of that junk fortunately

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.770 
certain kinds of that junk fortunately
there<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:18.370> solution<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:19.180> it's<00:03:19.390> not<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.720> a

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
there is a solution and it's not just a

there is a solution and it's not just a

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.150 
partial solution it's actually a really
good<00:03:21.340> solution<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.390> is<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.930> really<00:03:23.650> be

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
good solution and that is to really be

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.430 
good solution and that is to really be
80/20<00:03:24.700> paleo<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.300> say<00:03:25.480> really<00:03:25.750> what<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.140> mean

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
80/20 paleo and I say really what I mean

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.800 
80/20 paleo and I say really what I mean
is<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:27.310> would<00:03:27.400> actually<00:03:27.760> take<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.299> 8020

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
is that you would actually take the 8020

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.970 
is that you would actually take the 8020
principle<00:03:28.840> which<00:03:29.380> is<00:03:29.470> often<00:03:29.739> called<00:03:29.890> the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
principle which is often called the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.830 
principle which is often called the
Pareto<00:03:30.400> principle<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.569> were<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.780> apply

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
Pareto principle and you were to apply

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.559 
Pareto principle and you were to apply
it<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.380> your<00:03:32.470> Paleo<00:03:32.830> diet<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.400> when<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.299> do

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
it to your Paleo diet and when you do

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.970 
it to your Paleo diet and when you do
that<00:03:34.720> what<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.049> would<00:03:35.140> do<00:03:35.350> is<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.830> would

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
that what you would do is you would

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.339 
that what you would do is you would
forget<00:03:36.790> about<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.150> 80%<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.780> things<00:03:38.019> that

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
forget about the 80% of things that

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.050 
forget about the 80% of things that
don't<00:03:38.560> give<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:38.890> very<00:03:39.130> many<00:03:39.400> results<00:03:39.730> you

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
don't give you very many results you

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.000 
don't give you very many results you
would<00:03:40.420> focus<00:03:40.780> on<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.019> 20%<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.799> most

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
would focus on the 20% of the most

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.880 
would focus on the 20% of the most
important<00:03:42.489> things<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.630> would<00:03:43.750> get<00:03:43.959> 80%

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
important things and you would get 80%

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.390 
important things and you would get 80%
of<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.489> results<00:03:46.060> all<00:03:46.840> right<00:03:47.019> so<00:03:47.349> if<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:48.220> were

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
of the results all right so if I were

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.370 
of the results all right so if I were
trying<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.880> be<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.239> true<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.630> better<00:03:49.690> 80/20

paleo<00:03:50.680> here's<00:03:51.040> how<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.610> would<00:03:51.760> do<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.030> first<00:03:52.840> of

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
paleo here's how I would do it first of

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.080 
paleo here's how I would do it first of
all<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.410> would<00:03:53.769> ignore<00:03:54.099> all<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.610> things<00:03:54.910> that

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
all I would ignore all the things that

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.330 
all I would ignore all the things that
don't<00:03:55.630> give<00:03:56.049> me<00:03:56.290> most<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.739> results<00:03:57.040> and

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
don't give me most of the results and

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.699 
don't give me most of the results and
here's<00:03:57.579> just<00:03:58.090> my<00:03:58.269> personal<00:03:58.810> list<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.200> things

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
things about we're trying to be 80/20

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.770 
things about we're trying to be 80/20
paleo<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.850> would<00:04:54.970> just<00:04:55.150> forget<00:04:55.270> about<00:04:55.510> I

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
paleo that would just forget about I

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.480 
paleo that would just forget about I
would<00:04:55.870> never<00:04:56.260> ever<00:04:56.530> worry<00:04:57.039> about<00:04:57.280> them

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
would never ever worry about them

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.950 
would never ever worry about them
because<00:04:57.639> those<00:04:58.090> are<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.330> things<00:04:58.660> that

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
because those are the things that

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.540 
because those are the things that
they're<00:04:59.380> gonna<00:04:59.500> make<00:04:59.590> you<00:05:00.010> better<00:05:00.250> but

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
they're gonna make you better but

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.589 
they're gonna make you better but
probably<00:05:00.910> only<00:05:01.060> 20%<00:05:01.750> better

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.599 
probably only 20% better

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.619 
probably only 20% better
on<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.349> other<00:05:03.469> hand<00:05:03.800> I<00:05:04.009> would<00:05:04.639> really<00:05:05.089> worry

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
on the other hand I would really worry

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.079 
on the other hand I would really worry
and<00:05:05.869> would<00:05:05.960> be<00:05:06.110> super<00:05:06.649> strict<00:05:06.949> about<00:05:07.520> the

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:08.089 
and would be super strict about the

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.179 
and would be super strict about the
things<00:05:08.389> that<00:05:08.509> give<00:05:08.719> you<00:05:08.809> 80%<00:05:09.409> of<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.069> results

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:10.189 
things that give you 80% of the results

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:12.639 
things that give you 80% of the results
and<00:05:10.669> if<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.360> had<00:05:11.539> to<00:05:11.569> come<00:05:11.809> up<00:05:11.959> with<00:05:12.080> just<00:05:12.139> three

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:12.649 
and if I had to come up with just three

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:15.369 
and if I had to come up with just three
just<00:05:12.919> three<00:05:12.979> things<00:05:13.399> here's<00:05:14.360> what<00:05:14.869> I<00:05:14.899> would<00:05:15.110> do

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.379 
just three things here's what I would do

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.949 
just three things here's what I would do
first<00:05:15.949> of<00:05:16.159> all<00:05:16.279> I<00:05:16.520> would<00:05:16.909> avoid<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.629> hundred

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:17.959 
first of all I would avoid a hundred

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:18.820 
first of all I would avoid a hundred
percent<00:05:18.199> of<00:05:18.289> time

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
percent of time

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.449 
percent of time
all<00:05:18.949> major<00:05:19.789> toxins<00:05:20.719> and<00:05:20.929> in<00:05:21.830> terms<00:05:22.189> of<00:05:22.339> major

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:22.459 
all major toxins and in terms of major

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:24.579 
all major toxins and in terms of major
toxins<00:05:22.999> what<00:05:23.149> I<00:05:23.179> mean<00:05:23.449> is<00:05:23.749> I<00:05:23.959> would<00:05:24.319> avoid

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:24.589 
toxins what I mean is I would avoid

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:26.919 
toxins what I mean is I would avoid
processed<00:05:25.490> sugar<00:05:25.759> because<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.479> can<00:05:26.569> be<00:05:26.659> highly

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:26.929 
processed sugar because it can be highly

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:29.199 
processed sugar because it can be highly
toxic<00:05:27.139> to<00:05:27.469> your<00:05:27.559> body<00:05:27.770> I'd<00:05:28.189> avoid<00:05:28.610> gluten

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:29.209 
toxic to your body I'd avoid gluten

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:31.480 
toxic to your body I'd avoid gluten
containing<00:05:29.809> grains<00:05:30.199> so<00:05:30.529> I'd<00:05:30.649> avoid<00:05:30.860> all<00:05:31.189> wheat

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
containing grains so I'd avoid all wheat

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.609 
containing grains so I'd avoid all wheat
and<00:05:31.759> barley<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:32.779> rye<00:05:32.959> things<00:05:33.319> to<00:05:33.409> contain

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:33.619 
and barley and rye things to contain

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:36.639 
and barley and rye things to contain
gluten<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:34.159> I<00:05:34.189> would<00:05:35.059> avoid<00:05:35.180> all<00:05:35.649> omega-6

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:36.649 
gluten and I would avoid all omega-6

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:39.129 
gluten and I would avoid all omega-6
processed<00:05:37.369> seed<00:05:37.639> oils<00:05:37.999> so<00:05:38.509> corn<00:05:38.839> oil<00:05:39.080> canola

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
processed seed oils so corn oil canola

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.230 
processed seed oils so corn oil canola
oil<00:05:39.649> safflower<00:05:40.039> oil<00:05:40.369> because<00:05:40.849> that<00:05:40.879> stays<00:05:41.209> in

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
oil safflower oil because that stays in

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.579 
oil safflower oil because that stays in
your<00:05:41.389> body<00:05:41.569> for<00:05:41.809> a<00:05:41.869> while<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.229> it's<00:05:42.349> very

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
your body for a while and it's very

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:44.980 
your body for a while and it's very
toxic<00:05:42.860> also<00:05:43.669> makes<00:05:43.909> you<00:05:44.029> fat<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.330> hungry<00:05:44.779> and

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
toxic also makes you fat and hungry and

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.719 
toxic also makes you fat and hungry and
I<00:05:45.680> would<00:05:45.800> avoid<00:05:45.889> anything<00:05:46.369> else<00:05:46.520> that's

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:46.729 
I would avoid anything else that's

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:49.059 
I would avoid anything else that's
really<00:05:46.939> toxic<00:05:47.419> to<00:05:47.629> you<00:05:47.899> so<00:05:48.499> for<00:05:48.649> instance<00:05:48.949> if

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
really toxic to you so for instance if

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.100 
really toxic to you so for instance if
you<00:05:49.189> were<00:05:49.459> really<00:05:49.849> allergic<00:05:50.479> or<00:05:50.539> sensitive<00:05:50.959> to

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
you were really allergic or sensitive to

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.199 
you were really allergic or sensitive to
Dairy<00:05:51.319> then<00:05:51.949> I<00:05:52.039> would<00:05:52.189> avoid<00:05:52.399> that<00:05:52.699> but

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:53.209 
Dairy then I would avoid that but

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:55.269 
Dairy then I would avoid that but
otherwise<00:05:53.539> I<00:05:53.719> wouldn't<00:05:54.199> avoid<00:05:54.409> it<00:05:54.559> so<00:05:54.740> that

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:55.279 
otherwise I wouldn't avoid it so that

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:57.670 
otherwise I wouldn't avoid it so that
would<00:05:55.399> be<00:05:55.519> step<00:05:55.580> number<00:05:55.909> one<00:05:56.240> step<00:05:57.199> number<00:05:57.259> two

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
would be step number one step number two

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.920 
would be step number one step number two
would<00:05:58.009> be<00:05:58.069> sleep<00:05:58.759> I'd<00:05:58.999> say<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.330> would<00:05:59.599> sleep

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
would be sleep I'd say I would sleep

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.629 
would be sleep I'd say I would sleep
eight<00:06:00.169> hours<00:06:00.499> a<00:06:00.529> night<00:06:00.619> because<00:06:01.189> honestly

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 
eight hours a night because honestly

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.909 
eight hours a night because honestly
that's<00:06:01.969> at<00:06:02.089> least<00:06:02.119> as<00:06:02.629> important<00:06:03.229> as<00:06:03.349> your

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
that's at least as important as your

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.100 
that's at least as important as your
diet<00:06:04.129> and<00:06:04.429> if<00:06:04.849> you<00:06:04.999> do<00:06:05.209> that<00:06:05.419> that<00:06:05.719> actually

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
diet and if you do that that actually

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.209 
diet and if you do that that actually
might<00:06:06.259> get<00:06:06.469> you<00:06:06.619> more<00:06:06.830> than<00:06:06.949> eighty<00:06:07.129> percent

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
might get you more than eighty percent

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.129 
might get you more than eighty percent
of<00:06:07.699> the<00:06:08.059> results<00:06:08.419> you<00:06:08.509> want<00:06:08.689> to<00:06:08.839> begin<00:06:09.080> with

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
of the results you want to begin with

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.619 
of the results you want to begin with
and<00:06:09.589> the<00:06:10.490> third<00:06:10.789> step<00:06:11.029> I<00:06:11.149> would<00:06:11.209> say<00:06:11.479> is<00:06:11.599> that

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
and the third step I would say is that

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:14.320 
and the third step I would say is that
I'd<00:06:11.839> move<00:06:12.169> around<00:06:12.439> more<00:06:13.009> constantly<00:06:13.669> so<00:06:14.119> even

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
I'd move around more constantly so even

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.969 
I'd move around more constantly so even
if<00:06:14.419> I<00:06:14.479> weren't<00:06:14.629> exercising<00:06:15.139> a<00:06:15.529> lot<00:06:15.680> that<00:06:15.860> might

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
if I weren't exercising a lot that might

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.079 
if I weren't exercising a lot that might
be<00:06:16.069> one<00:06:16.219> of<00:06:16.249> the<00:06:16.369> things<00:06:16.459> I<00:06:16.610> don't<00:06:16.909> pay

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.089 
be one of the things I don't pay

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:19.239 
be one of the things I don't pay
attention<00:06:17.209> to<00:06:17.689> I<00:06:17.930> would<00:06:18.469> focus<00:06:18.680> on<00:06:18.949> making

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:19.249 
attention to I would focus on making

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:20.679 
attention to I would focus on making
sure<00:06:19.339> that<00:06:19.430> I<00:06:19.579> got<00:06:19.789> more<00:06:19.999> walking<00:06:20.449> in<00:06:20.569> or<00:06:20.659> just

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:20.689 
sure that I got more walking in or just

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.259 
sure that I got more walking in or just
more<00:06:20.990> moving<00:06:21.379> that<00:06:21.769> is<00:06:21.889> not<00:06:22.159> sitting<00:06:22.639> for<00:06:22.999> 12

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:23.269 
more moving that is not sitting for 12

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:25.749 
more moving that is not sitting for 12
to<00:06:23.360> 16<00:06:23.749> hours<00:06:23.930> at<00:06:24.139> a<00:06:24.199> time<00:06:24.459> so<00:06:25.459> there<00:06:25.639> you<00:06:25.729> have

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
to 16 hours at a time so there you have

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.089 
to 16 hours at a time so there you have
it<00:06:26.119> that's<00:06:26.899> what<00:06:27.110> I<00:06:27.139> would<00:06:27.319> do<00:06:27.439> if<00:06:27.559> you<00:06:27.800> really

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
it that's what I would do if you really
