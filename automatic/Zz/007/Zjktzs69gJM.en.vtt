hey guys welcome to mr. wall on gaming

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.970 
hey guys welcome to mr. wall on gaming
and<00:00:12.690> today<00:00:12.840> I'm<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> teach<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.830> how<00:00:13.950> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
make a 2 by 3 piston door it is very

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.840 
make a 2 by 3 piston door it is very
common<00:00:17.760> very<00:00:18.300> easy<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.960> make<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.890> don't

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
make this project is 2 redstone torches

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.569 
make this project is 2 redstone torches
6<00:00:31.650> sticky<00:00:32.189> pistons<00:00:32.669> 12<00:00:33.570> redstone<00:00:34.260> 10<00:00:35.100> block<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
6 sticky pistons 12 redstone 10 block of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.350 
6 sticky pistons 12 redstone 10 block of
quartz<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.300> 4<00:00:36.719> pressure<00:00:37.110> plates<00:00:37.969> okay<00:00:38.969> well

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
quartz and 4 pressure plates okay well

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.610 
quartz and 4 pressure plates okay well
first<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.840> wanna<00:00:40.079> dig<00:00:40.879> 2<00:00:41.879> year<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.450> -<00:00:43.260> yeah

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
first you wanna dig 2 year and - yeah

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.520 
first you wanna dig 2 year and - yeah
and<00:00:44.370> place<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.910> block<00:00:45.090> need<00:00:45.899> block<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> choice

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and place the block need block of choice

you want there and dig - down here and
clear<00:00:52.020> out<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.770> under<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> quartz<00:00:55.579> dig

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
clear out this bit under the quartz dig

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.770 
clear out this bit under the quartz dig
-<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> side<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> dig<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:02.780> looks

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
- on the side and dig one there so looks

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.820 
- on the side and dig one there so looks
like<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.680> pretty<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:06.260> then<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.650> wanna

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
like this and place two pressure plates

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.710 
like this and place two pressure plates
on<00:01:19.110> top<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.630> you

stand on this you'll activate the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.910 
stand on this you'll activate the
redstone<00:01:24.080> then<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.200> want<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> place<00:01:25.530> two
