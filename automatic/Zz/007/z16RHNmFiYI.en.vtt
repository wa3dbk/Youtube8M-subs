00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.780 

ok<00:00:51.970> this<00:00:52.810> is<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.080> float<00:00:53.350> tube<00:00:53.560> this<00:00:54.520> is<00:00:54.670> what

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
ok this is the float tube this is what

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.930 
ok this is the float tube this is what
we<00:00:54.880> need<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.090> do<00:00:55.210> next<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:57.640> inflatable

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
we need to do next and it's inflatable

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.219 
we need to do next and it's inflatable
by<00:00:59.970> fairly<00:01:00.970> cheap<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.890> electric<00:01:03.580> pump<00:01:03.850> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
by fairly cheap little electric pump and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.510 
by fairly cheap little electric pump and
runs<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.410> battery<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:05.979> can<00:01:06.160> take<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.400> out

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
runs on battery so you can take it out

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.940 
runs on battery so you can take it out
to<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.670> lake<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:08.200> pretty<00:01:08.440> easy<00:01:08.590> it

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
to the lake and it's pretty easy it

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:30.520 
to the lake and it's pretty easy it
takes<00:01:09.070> a<00:01:09.220> couple<00:01:09.340> seconds<00:01:09.790> so<00:01:09.910> let's<00:01:10.030> do<00:01:10.150> it

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.700 

usually<00:01:31.530> most<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.830> these<00:01:31.920> rafts<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:33.060> back

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
usually most of these rafts have a back

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
usually most of these rafts have a back
back<00:01:34.710> bladder<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.729> main<00:01:35.909> bladder<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
back bladder in a main bladder so the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.870 
back bladder in a main bladder so the
main<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.140> pops<00:01:37.440> this<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:37.880> theoretically

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
main one pops this one theoretically

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880 
main one pops this one theoretically
