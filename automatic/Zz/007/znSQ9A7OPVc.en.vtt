resolution<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.059> defined<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.019> smallest

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

so in practical terms this means that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
so in practical terms this means that

two points apart using a light

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.420 
two points apart using a light
microscope<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.600> 200<00:00:54.600> nanometers<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:56.370> an

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
microscope is 200 nanometers but for an

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.670 
microscope is 200 nanometers but for an
electron<00:00:57.000> microscope<00:00:57.359> it<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.469> much

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
electron microscope it can go much

further than that it has a higher
resolution<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.739> tell<00:01:01.980> apart<00:01:02.280> two<00:01:02.640> points

that<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.629> 0.1<00:01:04.460> nanometers<00:01:05.460> apart<00:01:05.720> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that are just 0.1 nanometers apart so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.930 
that are just 0.1 nanometers apart so
for<00:01:06.960> us<00:01:07.050> as<00:01:07.229> biologists<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.250> means<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.820> if

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
for us as biologists this means that if

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.300 
for us as biologists this means that if
we<00:01:09.090> use<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.300> light<00:01:09.660> microscope<00:01:09.929> we<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.100> view

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
we use a light microscope we can view

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
we use a light microscope we can view
cells<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.600> can't<00:01:13.080> view<00:01:13.409> organelles

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
cells but we can't view organelles

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010 
cells but we can't view organelles
because<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> organelles<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.210> too<00:01:15.360> small<00:01:15.720> if

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
because the organelles are too small if

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.740 
because the organelles are too small if
we<00:01:16.830> use<00:01:17.009> an<00:01:17.189> electron<00:01:17.790> microscope<00:01:18.090> however

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
we use an electron microscope however

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.080 
we use an electron microscope however
because<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> higher<00:01:20.070> resolution<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
because it has a higher resolution and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.210 
because it has a higher resolution and
is<00:01:21.270> able<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.720> distinguish<00:01:22.439> between<00:01:22.680> two

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
is able to distinguish between two

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.520 
is able to distinguish between two
points<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.060> much<00:01:24.360> closer<00:01:24.810> together

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
points that are much closer together

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.260 
points that are much closer together
we<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.950> see<00:01:26.189> organelles<00:01:26.939> such<00:01:27.210> as

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
we can see organelles such as

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.960 
we can see organelles such as
mitochondria<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.770> endoplasmic<00:01:29.040> reticulum

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
mitochondria the endoplasmic reticulum

and<00:01:30.090> membranes

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
and membranes

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.870

now<00:01:33.290> that's<00:01:33.619> as<00:01:33.829> much<00:01:34.009> as<00:01:34.189> you<00:01:34.310> really<00:01:34.579> need<00:01:34.759> to

now that's as much as you really need to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.609 
now that's as much as you really need to

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.779 
shortest wavelength of visible light is
approximately<00:02:03.170> 400<00:02:03.799> nanometers<00:02:04.369> actually

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
approximately 400 nanometers actually

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.639 
approximately 400 nanometers actually
little<00:02:05.420> lower<00:02:05.569> than<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.899> but<00:02:06.140> for<00:02:06.560> all

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
little lower than that but for all

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.320 
little lower than that but for all
intents<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.100> purposes<00:02:07.190> we'll<00:02:07.610> go<00:02:07.729> with<00:02:07.850> 400

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
intents and purposes we'll go with 400

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.050 
intents and purposes we'll go with 400
so<00:02:09.229> therefore<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.830> best<00:02:09.979> resolution<00:02:10.459> of<00:02:11.000> a

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
so therefore the best resolution of a

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.330 
so therefore the best resolution of a
light<00:02:11.360> microscope<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:12.200> half<00:02:12.799> of<00:02:13.100> that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
light microscope is half of that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.400 
light microscope is half of that
wavelength<00:02:13.549> which<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.180> 200<00:02:14.810> nanometers<00:02:15.290> and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
wavelength which is 200 nanometers and

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.309 
wavelength which is 200 nanometers and
that's<00:02:15.890> what<00:02:16.040> we<00:02:16.160> referred<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.489> earlier

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
that's what we referred to earlier

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.720 
that's what we referred to earlier
electron<00:02:18.319> beams<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> much<00:02:19.220> shorter

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
electron beams have a much shorter

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.059 
electron beams have a much shorter
wavelength<00:02:20.590> therefore<00:02:21.590> their<00:02:21.830> best

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
wavelength therefore their best

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.800 
wavelength therefore their best
resolution<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.880> going<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.239> be<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> much<00:02:23.569> shorter

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
resolution is going to be a much shorter

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
resolution is going to be a much shorter
distance<00:02:24.019> between<00:02:24.620> two<00:02:25.040> points<00:02:25.430> their<00:02:25.940> best

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
distance between two points their best

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.229 
distance between two points their best
resolution<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.930> 0.1<00:02:27.890> nanometers<00:02:28.549> in<00:02:28.730> fact

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
resolution is 0.1 nanometers in fact

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.180 
resolution is 0.1 nanometers in fact
there<00:02:29.599> are<00:02:29.750> apparently<00:02:30.260> some<00:02:30.530> electron

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
there are apparently some electron

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.300 
there are apparently some electron
microscopes<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.819> now<00:02:32.269> can<00:02:32.540> resolve<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.310> 0.05

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
microscopes that now can resolve to 0.05

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.940 
microscopes that now can resolve to 0.05
nanometers<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.269> if<00:02:36.260> you're<00:02:36.410> still<00:02:36.590> with<00:02:36.739> me<00:02:36.769> at

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
nanometers so if you're still with me at

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.650 
nanometers so if you're still with me at
this<00:02:37.100> point<00:02:37.400> let's<00:02:37.670> just<00:02:37.970> try<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.269> make<00:02:38.420> some

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
this point let's just try and make some

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.259 
this point let's just try and make some
meaning<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.140> these<00:02:39.350> units<00:02:39.799> of<00:02:39.980> nanometers<00:02:40.640> so

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
meaning of these units of nanometers so

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.630 
meaning of these units of nanometers so
one<00:02:41.660> nanometer<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.440> one<00:02:42.739> times<00:02:43.040> ten<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.609> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
one nanometer is one times ten to the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.330 
one nanometer is one times ten to the
minus<00:02:43.730> nine<00:02:44.540> meters<00:02:45.440> so<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.739> a<00:02:45.799> very<00:02:46.070> very

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
minus nine meters so it's a very very

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.360 
minus nine meters so it's a very very
small<00:02:46.910> distance<00:02:47.630> between<00:02:47.840> two<00:02:48.200> points<00:02:48.530> so

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
small distance between two points so

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.789 
small distance between two points so
therefore<00:02:49.700> two<00:02:49.910> nanometers<00:02:50.390> is<00:02:50.840> two<00:02:51.470> times

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
therefore two nanometers is two times

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.930 
therefore two nanometers is two times
ten<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.370> minus<00:02:52.489> nine<00:02:53.480> meters<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.819> so<00:02:55.819> if

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
ten to the minus nine meters and so if

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.539 
ten to the minus nine meters and so if
you<00:02:56.120> multiply<00:02:56.299> that<00:02:56.720> up<00:02:56.930> by<00:02:57.290> 100<00:02:57.549> 200

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
you multiply that up by 100 200

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.120 
you multiply that up by 100 200
nanometers<00:02:59.390> actually<00:03:00.350> ends<00:03:00.530> up<00:03:00.590> being<00:03:00.650> 2

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
nanometers actually ends up being 2

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.840 
nanometers actually ends up being 2
times<00:03:01.910> 10<00:03:02.359> to<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.630> minus<00:03:03.079> 7<00:03:03.500> meters<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.700> we're

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
times 10 to the minus 7 meters so we're

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.539 
times 10 to the minus 7 meters so we're
still<00:03:05.030> talking<00:03:05.180> very<00:03:05.569> small<00:03:06.019> values<00:03:06.440> here<00:03:06.620> now

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
still talking very small values here now

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.699 
still talking very small values here now
remember<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.239> 200<00:03:08.780> nanometers<00:03:09.350> was<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
remember that the 200 nanometers was the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.340 
remember that the 200 nanometers was the
resolution<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.430> our<00:03:10.549> light<00:03:10.819> microscope<00:03:11.450> if<00:03:11.690> we

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
resolution of our light microscope if we

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.390 
resolution of our light microscope if we
continue<00:03:12.829> here<00:03:13.600> 0.1<00:03:14.600> nanometers<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.680> 1<00:03:16.040> times

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
continue here 0.1 nanometers is 1 times

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.379 
continue here 0.1 nanometers is 1 times
10<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.030> minus<00:03:17.569> 10<00:03:18.100> meters<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.389> 0.1

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
10 to the minus 10 meters and 0.1

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.090 
10 to the minus 10 meters and 0.1
nanometers<00:03:20.930> was<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.200> resolution<00:03:21.859> of<00:03:21.950> our

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
nanometers was the resolution of our

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.970 
nanometers was the resolution of our
electron<00:03:22.790> microscope<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.350> here<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.769> playing

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
electron microscope so here just playing

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.860 
electron microscope so here just playing
with<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.280> units<00:03:25.639> you<00:03:25.819> can<00:03:26.030> see<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.420> 1<00:03:26.600> times

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
with the units you can see that 1 times

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.470 
with the units you can see that 1 times
10<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.530> minus<00:03:27.799> 10<00:03:28.040> meters<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.609> much<00:03:29.239> much

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
10 to the minus 10 meters is much much

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.020 
10 to the minus 10 meters is much much
smaller<00:03:29.769> for<00:03:30.769> our<00:03:30.889> electron<00:03:31.459> microscope

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
smaller for our electron microscope

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.670 
smaller for our electron microscope
which<00:03:32.180> has<00:03:32.389> that<00:03:32.600> much<00:03:32.930> higher<00:03:33.380> resolution

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
which has that much higher resolution

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.949 
which has that much higher resolution
because<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.579> can<00:03:34.760> distinguish<00:03:35.299> between<00:03:35.359> two

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
because it can distinguish between two

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.160 
because it can distinguish between two
points<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.799> are<00:03:36.980> much<00:03:37.190> closer<00:03:37.730> together

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
points that are much closer together

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.960 
points that are much closer together
than<00:03:39.170> our<00:03:39.319> light<00:03:39.590> microscope<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.730> has<00:03:40.939> a

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
than our light microscope that has a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.360 
than our light microscope that has a
resolution<00:03:41.360> of<00:03:41.720> 200<00:03:42.260> nanometers<00:03:42.799> this<00:03:43.189> is<00:03:43.340> a

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
resolution of 200 nanometers this is a

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.860 
resolution of 200 nanometers this is a
bigger<00:03:43.760> number<00:03:43.879> 2<00:03:44.750> times<00:03:45.049> 10<00:03:45.379> to<00:03:45.560> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
bigger number 2 times 10 to the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.130 
bigger number 2 times 10 to the
-<00:03:46.080> seven<00:03:46.440> meters<00:03:47.159> and<00:03:47.400> that's<00:03:48.000> because<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.900> can

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
- seven meters and that's because it can

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.890 
- seven meters and that's because it can
only<00:03:49.260> distinguish<00:03:49.920> between<00:03:50.370> two<00:03:50.909> points<00:03:51.360> that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
only distinguish between two points that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.680 
only distinguish between two points that
are<00:03:52.110> further<00:03:52.530> apart<00:03:52.799> than<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.909> two<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.540> the

are further apart than the two that the

are further apart than the two that the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
electron microscope can distinguish
