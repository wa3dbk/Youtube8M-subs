00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.899
 ramÃ­rez related building and with a series of small videos I want 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.139
 explain to declare between the rackets 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.289
 there is a lot of league and he asked him a lot to talk to 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.349
 very good respect 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.939
 but the reasons for bringing nothing new but because it is very many 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.550
 Doubts 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.779
 if it existed among most people who start 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.800
 or that he has any to the goal 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.840
 an experience playing the drums especially in a self-taught way and it is 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.560
 where more problems or other questions are presented 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.910
 with which with these small hamlets clear in a certain way to 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.710
 this kind of doubts 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.960
 we are going to focus on the modern grip a classic like catamarca 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.520
 percent and that employs in the bisnaga hilt in both hands 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.720
 we are going to do without the apple for the moment 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.520
 the traditional grip said the military compute whatever you want to call him 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.910
 let's see the interest for that positions and movements 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.200
 more or less common percent 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.770
 alastre way of touching 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.660
 that are arms free dolls 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.700
 so 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.690
 the position of the thumb and that of the index are very important especially to the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.290
 time to play by ear but remain the same for all three forms 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.200
 the town has to be ahead of the index 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.310
 where will it end? 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.030
 the point of support of the thumb which is where the index begins 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.570
 this returns exist a snack was invented 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.360
 They also stressed that he tried then when we play selling, we're going to 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.260
 see in another section 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.590
 the remaining duels 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.789
 just like her and that the index finger wrap around the sidewalk 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.190
 and all more or less by a hundred on the second home jordi I on the union of 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.660
 the first comedy with the second phalanx and knight 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.850
 This is very important 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.420
 one thing that we have to keep in mind that what we have to promote 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.570
 aldo puts the rebound down because that's what's going 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.100
 will remove the nuclear relay 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.599
 and in a greater amount of energy because we avoid almost 50% of the movement 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.919
 we are going to assign it to the rebound 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.479
 we understand that see 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.689
 what that boosts the bounce 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.909
 and there's a series of things to take percent 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.109
 in question 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.109
 one is the position of the fast one with respect to the surface that we are going to 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.429
 touch that in this case will be the box 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.669
 the model must always be parallel to the surface what we are going to 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:32.869
 touch 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:37.049
 and there is still bone distance rather the tip where it has to be at a 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.049
 Larger distance of legumes centimeter or two centimeters 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.129
 the further away from monsoon 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.110
 it's more the time we have to apply 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.320
 and that's not going to consume more energy and precision ability why do we have 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.129
 what to do a longer tour 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.730
 On the other hand, if we are between one and two centimeters away from the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.449
 Fat 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:57.739
 they also had it 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.810
 a foolish bounce attempt can be taken advantage of in a way 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.349
 smartest 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.920
 by the way another thing that we have to keep in mind is in principle we're going to 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.229
 catch the racket 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.279
 but let's do a very simple experiment 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.319
 let's sit down from 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.939
 leaving the end of the appointment coincides with the end of our hand and gave by 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.279
 ditched bounce in free fall etc 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:22.199
 one 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.209
 we see that there is a worse bounce they quickly died out let's leave 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.679
 one centimeter behind the hand 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:29.909
 putin 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.909
 what yesterday the glove is considerably more considerable 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.519
 and we are going to leave there will be five centimeters more or less 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:44.009
 of the forest we will follow a good bounce but the answer is the slowest one 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.169
 town has served us to remember 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.619
 in tucumÃ¡n 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:51.919
 that the rebound is intense but the fastest response 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:57.209
 with which I most suitable is that we leave more or less an inch for 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.689
 behind the hand 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.269
 then recapitulating 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.689
 the point of attack but it has to be beyond two centimeters with 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.899
 regarding the patch 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.819
 people have to train 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.009
 it has to be better said for it with respect to the surface which 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:14.419
 let's play 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.669
 and we have to leave a centimeter behind the environment the hand that 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.400
 excels 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.950
 it was a very important thing to keep in mind that she 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.360
 perpendicularity 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.129
 so the prd has to be totally perpendicular imposed 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.400
 the movement is not totally lost 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.300
 the surface that we are going to overturn 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.700
 if that forced us to have to correct the trajectory for a while 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.800
 an epic manuel pablo and joaquin morals there is nothing comfortable 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.719
 and it refers us to a bounced course with which we would have to be 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.800
 correcting you have the trajectory and that takes away 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.210
 precision and it takes away energy too 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.629
 which we do not have to avoid at all costs 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.629
 it may be that it's always perpendicular 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:09.300
 then this is what we have to encourage a good grip 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.460
 percent some positions 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.090
 percent and 2 years to favor and encourage rebound 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.860
 ignacio orchards relaxation 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.919
 you have to touch with a kiss you did not touch with force 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.669
 keep in mind that the battery or rather the battery components 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.669
 drummers cymbals cowbells whatever 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.740
 has a lot of volume sounding very strong the problem is not all force the 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.479
 drums 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.100
 is really the problem is to have enough domain to be able to play 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.370
 aaaa distinct range 5 of playing more dynamic 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.870
 frozen bankinter in the bass 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.510
 you can do the test by playing the drums accompanied by nicaragua and almost 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.620
 notification some photo audio clip 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.639
 and the bars realize that the hundred for this that now 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.129
 the incident is a very impulsive control 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.330
 from the thermal back 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.479
 more or less pure 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.210
 now the next step to make each of the movements by 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.620
 separated
