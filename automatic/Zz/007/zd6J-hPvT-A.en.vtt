00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.839
 [music] 

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.839
 [applause] 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello guys with you danil again 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 Bukreev and today we have an unusual product 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.870
 this is a fishing rod 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.000
 I have never seen this honestly to you 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.210
 i will say let's see cost 8 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.510
 dollars, tell me why open with a knife 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.939
 if you have a hand of 8 dollars 85 cents 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.359
 let's see what it spend 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.129
 I understand of course, together with you as a well 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.140
 the pen would not be small 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.379
 it seems in the photo it is a little smaller 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 talk and if you don't watch this 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.350
 here's a fishing rod handle i think we can 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.100
 neatly open it can 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.210
 neatly look and we are 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.440
 probably do so open so 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.920
 actually ore itself 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.750
 The rod itself is basically this. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.379
 probably more such a design to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.060
 I understand the decision , I guess 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.709
 I suspect maybe for winter fishing 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.899
 so how small are such fishing rods 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:13.740
 In my use there, I basically do not 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.899
 especially fish 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.080
 Here is such a coil smooth rotation 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.970
 everything seems to be working fine i am so 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.190
 I understand it is attached years. 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.420
 well damn well actually looks 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.770
 cool can't say anything 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.310
 removed or unscrewed and thats not 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.050
 will become 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.899
 Not so much she learn Hilenko not 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.800
 hiley so somewhere here fastened 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.619
 actually this is a reel somehow 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.500
 that's the way I'm trying to understand now 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.640
 a little bit in the picture but seemingly like that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.289
 something like this should be attached so 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.209
 so about fishing rods pens not guys who who 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.390
 generally understands exactly that 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:01.920
 right fishing right 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.649
 tell me in the comments why 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.679
 or does it even make sense as a general 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.220
 somehow it is fixed here 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:13.739
 Now I see 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.840
 it turns out like this 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:23.580
 here it is fixed of course she gathered 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.000
 while I was sitting here so that's really opa 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.400
 looks really cool i guys 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.110
 write in general how it works does 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.480
 for what are such fishing rods comments me 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.490
 really interesting but it looks like 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.430
 really cool well pretty 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.720
 compact I do not know in terms of reliability here 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.580
 this mount but the rotation of the coil 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.280
 calm and everything rotates easily no one 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.190
 nothing to sink in this plan seems to be 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.740
 everything is good in terms of quality that 's all 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.730
 mounting do not know what kind of fish on such 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.640
 wheelbarrow but hard for me hard to evaluate 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.920
 it is exactly the quality that seems to be 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.660
 not bad but I can not say that right 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.360
 monolith which is possible this thing 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.310
 should be so fragile in principle on 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.080
 this video is all so unusual here 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.450
