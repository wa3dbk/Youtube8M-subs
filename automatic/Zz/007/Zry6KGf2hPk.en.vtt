00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.809
 hey guys i admit dennis a chain 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.670
 sk and today you have for sale 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.170
 that coach game play and ice cream becomes the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.080
 free folk game club with floris 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 and it is with the mtx with sanne ceramic 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.439
 grip ' 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.640
 and I play here on the playstation 4 and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.170
 in all that the probably already in the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.449
 holes because of course sees less 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.160
 It's a shame and old place 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.170
 a virus if you expect replaces the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.359
 it is a next generation race 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.520
 next generation graphics and I have to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.200
 to look much better like this and one 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.640
 bit disappointing but that is coming 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.920
 of course that this is included with the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.090
 the chef buttons they function for free so they 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 can not be too much of 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.690
 but it is this I regret 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.579
 I personally think the game is not 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.539
 very disturbing because it is not very 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 ugly when you look 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.840
 it used to be a double such that 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.760
 are really not out so this looks like 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 are all pretty good but on and on 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 and pvv er er or an elgato looks natural 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.850
 many times better 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.170
 if it is good and January there will be 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.750
 update for the places again that you 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.719
 download call recorder with elgato so 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 then it becomes hdcp and it is deleted 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.420
 I ca n't wait for you 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.369
 probably also not level like that 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.510
 there I will be really much more we calf 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.860
 ethics and uploading because like you 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.299
 probably know 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.920
 I upload very little coffee the last 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.930
 tea and that is not because i lack it 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.790
 play because I play once more best 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.250
 young i am almost fascinated in this maxx 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.860
 fifteen or so you actually controlled and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.040
 this in itself is quite high so me 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.500
 I like to sit and yes to such a reach 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.970
 It's not that I play with little 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.729
 problem is i play a lot the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.890
 playstation 4 and on the playstation 4 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.810
 not so easy to play your ps3 course 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.100
 that I said and it was that you were not the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.119
 only reason you might be able to 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.740
 You think of it when you get there 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.990
 for a moment what wants those codes plovie 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.649
 playstation 3 then the problem is 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.509
 solved 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.790
 and that is true and that is also last 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.110
 said try and tweet a lot of people 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.689
 my last it also from hey i got you 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.450
 just in the match serve device co livia 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.520
 and that's why i put the game on me 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.899
 was a lobby example and after 5 seconds 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.299
 they have such is you know what this 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.340
 it is not and the reason is 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.750
 that on the playstation 3 I never met 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.100
 played the sound and the can still 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.479
 still no noise gets the place 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.190
 and someone yes of course your speakers 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.050
 you will say what you love 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.050
 but that's different i sound that myself 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.000
 very low together for you 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.650
 my and through speakers you don't just hear 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.210
 your naturally looks like and so all it 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.160
 sound you do not throw over 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.340
 speakers and that is all the moisture loud 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.720
 explosion are all that nonsense but real de 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.340
 details that you wanted to hear that you hear 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.710
 not some footsteps people who have weapons 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 which the load and so everything is that though 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.190
 you do not through your speakers unless he 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.450
 not really very hard on society 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.700
 nice to play 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.110
 so the problem is on the playstation 3 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.280
 game also no more sound and then them 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.870
 maybe think how you edge the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.760
 playstation 4 one 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.170
 have another tv paper headset wit wat 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.390
 The problem is 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.700
 or just don't take trouble it's so on 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.300
 the playstation 4 there is an option to you 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.710
 a 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.160
 earphones for your mobile you know that 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.380
 emotion live what do you say at the bottom or 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.060
 at the top of your phone you can there 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.680
 also include checking your places 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.630
 here and if you do that you can go for it 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.400
 get your king sound on and that is 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.100
 really only one solution 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.110
 and since I play with them and I notice 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.700
 really in the huge difference it really is 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.920
 much less power goes climbing peel 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.590
 but I was suddenly hear when I all 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.480
 footsteps I also load all people 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.130
 shoot and all that stuff and is 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.780
 quite funny because sometimes it was just 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.880
 places 3 that people are great in my rest 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.170
 do you know something at a school is still wrong 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.550
 one they would so I didn't see it on the 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.390
 cheese I just walked on and did not come 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.010
 by 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.600
 and you see the birds off because you 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.190
 have a good eye on it 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.830
 And you just aren't anymore 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.940
 coincidence i play constantly flared up 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.110
 and that is why i play this game 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.959
 used and what is a free especially 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.310
 gameplay completely and then has the plot 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.040
 I think that is of course a very nice thing 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.450
 we constantly play on a rat rat 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.190
 this area because I wanted top panel oh 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.870
 that's really my area then you have to 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.940
 just from afellay loved that area 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.140
 dominate and that is what they really do 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.970
 sees in the game I play with his 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.160
 gates makes it even easier but 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.440
 in this game day you can see very well 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.470
 that I use sound dog really 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.270
 90% of these with I play on sound and 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.489
 the remaining 10 percent quote to play 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.200
 that video who is nice but if I have to 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.970
 go to choose so now via like and 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.709
 I trained really choose because you have video 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.400
 only a few seconds and you have sound 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.130
 forever 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.680
 and since I really play with sound 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.940
 notice the big difference a big one 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.900
 advantage that you have when you are with 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.389
 sound image and 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.070
 and you just said i will constantly be you 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.690
 also see if I stand still for a moment then 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.919
 plug to listen low buy manager 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.930
 ms from 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.240
 why I walk them and then you wait or 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.410
 I know a lot, because that's how you can go for it 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.180
 Always win if you know someone 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.800
 on purpose you can get one and me and then 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.030
 you win no percent of the time you are 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.380
 just quality can be just you 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.940
 totally unable to shoot then again 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.080
 of course not but generally 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.520
 two wounded graphite 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.560
 but they will probably be in the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.150
 title go read this video 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.560
 in this video you talk about stalkers 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.780
 maybe think of why did you 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.310
 everywhere all that nonsense accompanies the under 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.650
 does not interest us when coming 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.750
 right on the foil point because like you 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.699
 really want to play well with equals 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.169
 2 pi and need and is dead silence 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.699
 and amplifies 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.260
 All this ensures that you own them 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.000
 footsteps or not whole 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.419
 gently and there is footsteps 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.250
 hard to hear and far the rest you have m 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.349
 provider ensures that you get the mri 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.060
 footstep better roles so yes 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:09.370
 says he can do another of beautiful ones 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.289
 demolish one and so are two plus you 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.910
 actually almost really need if 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.099
 you play with a headset because then you have 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.550
 So your real advantage already 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.470
 problem is 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.180
 of course you have an x number point i 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.960
 do not want so much that's out of my 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.280
 head 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.900
 when of you it's an x ​​number of points 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.639
 that I can use with a class and that 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.030
 if my chem-dry gets that 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.070
 fall 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.020
 so what do you do with the dot want 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.949
 usually you already have a little ideal class 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.979
 that you want to use 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.320
 so how expensive does that solve me 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.970
 it was that I stalked away and stalk 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.699
 there is a gate that i always whole 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.010
 Safe wounds were also happy with it 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.750
 stops when in principle seldom sticks and 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.370
 then I always use it personally 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.650
 almost start thinking is the already able in 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.599
 luxembourg is not something that is nice 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.220
 if you have it but not something you are 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.199
 need to continue when i get to my 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.310
 perth look because i see the mex expire 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.229
 market or fast 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.729
 i have quickdraw yes if you are quick duck 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.870
 You just have a much greater chance of it 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.310
 I win there something you almost 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.320
 always need it 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.789
 according to focus to that is also hear something 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.190
 where you need there are already two turn 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.500
 after that I have deadlines and amplify 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.909
 and then I also have two points left 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.710
 to you you can do whatever you want i have 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.680
 always opted for an injury pressure 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.870
 by the killed ivory and and ideal 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.490
 but that especially that is what i have had 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.199
 adapted i want you to think about it 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.150
 Stalk or I think it's a real luxury park
