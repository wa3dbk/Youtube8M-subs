00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
all i wanted to show you but I really

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.860 
all i wanted to show you but I really
don't<00:03:31.870> think<00:03:31.959> that's<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.620> good<00:03:33.209> hbu<00:03:34.209> or<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:34.810> a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
don't think that's a good hbu or it's a

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.150 
don't think that's a good hbu or it's a
good<00:03:35.019> boost<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.470> really<00:03:35.680> don't<00:03:35.859> think<00:03:35.950> that

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
good boost I really don't think that

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.460 
good boost I really don't think that
it's<00:03:36.430> like<00:03:36.930> necessary<00:03:37.930> though<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.079> think<00:03:38.380> it

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
it's like necessary though I think it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.860 
it's like necessary though I think it
should<00:03:38.680> be<00:03:38.980> either<00:03:39.609> fanatic<00:03:40.239> replay<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.840> game

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
should be either fanatic replay the game

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.220 
should be either fanatic replay the game
or<00:03:41.310> they<00:03:42.310> should<00:03:42.519> get<00:03:42.609> a<00:03:42.669> DQ<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.419> like<00:03:43.930> an

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
or they should get a DQ for like an

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.349 
or they should get a DQ for like an
exploit<00:03:44.739> or<00:03:44.889> something<00:03:45.220> like<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.370> that's

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
exploit or something like that that's

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.400
