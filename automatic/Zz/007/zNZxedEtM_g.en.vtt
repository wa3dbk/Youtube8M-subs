00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
there's a display case a bubble to place
over<00:00:34.600> our<00:00:34.930> work<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.560> stand<00:00:36.400> some<00:00:37.300> tools<00:00:37.720> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
over our work a stand some tools and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.610 
over our work a stand some tools and
five<00:00:39.270> really<00:00:40.270> vibrant<00:00:41.230> colors<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.550> play-doh

five really vibrant colors of play-doh

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.170 
five really vibrant colors of play-doh
first<00:00:44.620> let's<00:00:44.950> take<00:00:45.130> a<00:00:45.190> look<00:00:45.340> at<00:00:45.730> this<00:00:45.880> really

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
first let's take a look at this really

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.050 
first let's take a look at this really
nice<00:00:46.600> base<00:00:47.080> I<00:00:47.500> love<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.130> colors<00:00:48.550> that<00:00:48.820> they've

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
nice base I love the colors that they've

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.180 
nice base I love the colors that they've
used<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.750> it<00:00:50.140> looks<00:00:50.380> like<00:00:50.590> there<00:00:50.770> are<00:00:50.800> rocks

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
used and it looks like there are rocks

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.080 
used and it looks like there are rocks
and<00:00:51.700> it's<00:00:52.240> made<00:00:52.990> to<00:00:53.200> simulate<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:54.070> bottom<00:00:54.790> of

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
and it's made to simulate the bottom of

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.590 
and it's made to simulate the bottom of
an<00:00:55.480> aquarium<00:00:56.140> now<00:00:56.680> look<00:00:57.640> at<00:00:57.790> this<00:00:58.000> this<00:00:58.240> is<00:00:58.450> an

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
an aquarium now look at this this is an

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.570 
an aquarium now look at this this is an
extruder<00:00:59.110> and<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.740> thought<00:01:00.040> it<00:01:00.340> would<00:01:00.460> be

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
extruder and I thought it would be

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.690 
extruder and I thought it would be
really<00:01:00.820> fun<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.210> not<00:01:02.050> just<00:01:02.320> use<00:01:02.560> one<00:01:03.070> color<00:01:03.490> of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
really fun to not just use one color of

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.230 
really fun to not just use one color of
play-doh<00:01:04.390> but<00:01:04.809> two<00:01:05.260> colors<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:05.980> play-doh<00:01:06.520> to

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
play-doh but two colors of play-doh to

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.690 
play-doh but two colors of play-doh to
see<00:01:07.450> what<00:01:07.720> kind<00:01:08.050> of<00:01:08.230> sea<00:01:08.500> life<00:01:08.770> we<00:01:09.430> could

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
see what kind of sea life we could

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.870 
see what kind of sea life we could
create<00:01:10.060> so<00:01:10.870> let's<00:01:11.110> put<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:12.070> extruder

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
create so let's put that in the extruder

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.270 
create so let's put that in the extruder
right<00:01:13.090> there<00:01:13.360> and<00:01:13.630> then<00:01:14.440> let's<00:01:14.650> bring<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:15.040> over

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
right there and then let's bring it over

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.770 
right there and then let's bring it over
here<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:16.200> let's<00:01:17.200> see<00:01:17.500> what<00:01:17.710> happens<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:19.420> we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
here and let's see what happens when we

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.540 
here and let's see what happens when we
just<00:01:20.290> press<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.950> down<00:01:21.190> oh<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:23.470> neat<00:01:23.950> we<00:01:24.370> got

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
just press it down oh that's neat we got

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.899 
just press it down oh that's neat we got
two<00:01:24.940> different<00:01:25.360> colors<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.290> plant<00:01:27.220> life<00:01:27.550> for

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
two different colors of plant life for

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.540 
two different colors of plant life for
our<00:01:28.030> aquarium<00:01:28.720> I<00:01:29.050> thought<00:01:29.650> for<00:01:29.860> our<00:01:30.010> aquarium

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
our aquarium I thought for our aquarium

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.070 
our aquarium I thought for our aquarium
it'd<00:01:30.700> be<00:01:30.820> fun<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.240> add<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.420> little<00:01:31.810> bit<00:01:32.050> more

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
it'd be fun to add a little bit more

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.640 
it'd be fun to add a little bit more
plant<00:01:32.740> life<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.460> to<00:01:33.520> do<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:34.150> I've<00:01:35.080> just<00:01:35.409> taken

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
plant life so to do that I've just taken

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.080 
plant life so to do that I've just taken
a<00:01:35.950> little<00:01:36.159> bit<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.640> play-doh<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.930> then<00:01:38.740> just

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
a little bit of play-doh and then just

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.860 
a little bit of play-doh and then just
use<00:01:40.090> my<00:01:40.450> fingers<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.700> shape<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:42.970> into<00:01:43.600> this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
use my fingers to shape it into this

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.410 
use my fingers to shape it into this
shape<00:01:43.930> see<00:01:44.740> where<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.130> narrowed<00:01:45.760> down<00:01:45.790> here

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
shape see where it's narrowed down here

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.910 
shape see where it's narrowed down here
and<00:01:46.630> larger<00:01:47.290> up<00:01:47.530> there<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.330> that<00:01:49.330> will<00:01:49.690> be<00:01:50.020> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
and larger up there and that will be the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.539 
and larger up there and that will be the
beginning<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.700> our<00:01:51.850> plant<00:01:52.210> life<00:01:52.510> and<00:01:52.870> then<00:01:53.860> we

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
beginning of our plant life and then we

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.740 
beginning of our plant life and then we
just<00:01:54.760> stick<00:01:55.150> it<00:01:55.299> back<00:01:55.360> here<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:57.510> let's<00:01:58.510> add

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
just stick it back here and let's add

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.750 
just stick it back here and let's add
one<00:01:58.780> more<00:01:59.110> little<00:01:59.650> detail<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.340> think<00:02:00.640> will

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
one more little detail that I think will

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.240 
one more little detail that I think will
make<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.000> look<00:02:01.150> really<00:02:01.869> neat<00:02:02.110> let's<00:02:02.950> make<00:02:03.220> a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
make it look really neat let's make a

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.219 
make it look really neat let's make a
line<00:02:03.610> with<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.000> knife<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:04.270> they<00:02:04.720> gave<00:02:05.049> us

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
line with the knife that they gave us

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.660 
line with the knife that they gave us
down<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.799> middle<00:02:06.450> like

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
down the middle like

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.240 
down the middle like
that<00:02:11.500> doesn't<00:02:12.500> want<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.680> stay<00:02:12.920> there<00:02:13.130> but

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
that doesn't want to stay there but

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.790 
that doesn't want to stay there but
we'll<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.670> stay<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:16.900> then<00:02:17.900> let's<00:02:18.590> just

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
we'll have it stay and then let's just

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.940 
we'll have it stay and then let's just
make<00:02:18.980> some<00:02:19.010> little<00:02:19.250> marks<00:02:19.819> like<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.800> make

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
make some little marks like that to make

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.979 
make some little marks like that to make
it<00:02:22.099> look<00:02:22.280> more<00:02:22.310> like<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.760> plant<00:02:23.830> just<00:02:24.830> like<00:02:25.100> that

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
it look more like a plant just like that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
little bit elongated like a fish would

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.750 
little bit elongated like a fish would
be<00:02:44.900> elongated<00:02:45.769> means<00:02:46.100> just<00:02:46.810> longer<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:49.459> that

smooth<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.870> out<00:02:51.019> as<00:02:51.350> I<00:02:51.950> go<00:02:52.569> until<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.630> think<00:02:53.840> I

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
smooth it out as I go until I think I

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.309

for<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.840> minute

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
for a minute

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.100 
for a minute
while<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.440> make<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.069> tail<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.360> tail<00:03:08.390> I'm

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
while I make the tail and the tail I'm

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.059

gonna<00:03:09.290> shape<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.739> little<00:03:09.890> bit<00:03:10.040> differently

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.030 

it's<00:03:18.060> gonna<00:03:18.299> be<00:03:18.480> more<00:03:18.719> like<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> vidya<00:03:19.590> see<00:03:19.829> that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
it's gonna be more like a vidya see that

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.750 
it's gonna be more like a vidya see that
shape<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.500> then<00:03:22.500> I'm<00:03:23.189> gonna<00:03:23.430> put<00:03:23.670> them

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
shape and then I'm gonna put them

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.140 
shape and then I'm gonna put them
together<00:03:27.859> sometimes<00:03:28.859> you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.459> use<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.879> tools

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
together sometimes you can use the tools

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.410 
together sometimes you can use the tools
that<00:03:30.959> come<00:03:31.260> with<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:32.280> sets<00:03:32.579> to<00:03:32.849> help<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.209> put

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
things together like this or you can

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.390 
things together like this or you can
even<00:03:36.629> moisten<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.379> play-doh<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.829> little<00:03:38.220> bit

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
it'll stick together better there we go

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.039 
it'll stick together better there we go
now<00:03:44.459> we've<00:03:44.639> got<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.879> give<00:03:44.970> some<00:03:45.239> character<00:03:45.840> to
