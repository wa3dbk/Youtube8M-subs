00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
an ongoing conversation it's a practice

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.840 
an ongoing conversation it's a practice
where<00:01:25.450> we<00:01:25.660> talk<00:01:25.930> about<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:27.340> happened<00:01:27.730> in<00:01:27.760> the

where we talk about what happened in the
classroom<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.540> went<00:01:28.750> well<00:01:28.960> what<00:01:29.170> didn't<00:01:29.440> go

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
classroom we went well what didn't go

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.050 
classroom we went well what didn't go
well<00:01:29.590> how<00:01:30.220> are<00:01:30.310> we<00:01:30.370> going<00:01:30.520> to<00:01:30.640> do<00:01:30.730> it<00:01:30.850> better

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
well how are we going to do it better

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.880 
well how are we going to do it better
and<00:01:31.600> how<00:01:31.810> we<00:01:31.870> going<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.230> help<00:01:32.380> our<00:01:32.530> students

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
and how we going to help our students

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.220 
and how we going to help our students
achieve<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.880> that's<00:01:34.120> what<00:01:34.300> I<00:01:34.330> like<00:01:34.540> about<00:01:34.600> the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
achieve and that's what I like about the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.670 
achieve and that's what I like about the
framework<00:01:35.770> it's<00:01:36.580> not<00:01:36.880> about<00:01:37.330> what<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.170> think

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
framework it's not about what I think

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.860 
framework it's not about what I think
but<00:01:39.580> it's<00:01:39.700> about<00:01:40.000> what<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.630> practice

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
but it's about what the practice

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.740 
but it's about what the practice
actually<00:01:41.440> is<00:01:42.250> what<00:01:42.760> did<00:01:42.910> you<00:01:42.940> say<00:01:43.090> how<00:01:43.570> many

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
actually is what did you say how many

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.260 
actually is what did you say how many
students<00:01:44.200> did<00:01:44.350> you<00:01:44.410> engage<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.850> problem

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
students did you engage the problem

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.910 
students did you engage the problem
we've<00:01:46.420> had<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.840> past<00:01:46.870> particularly<00:01:47.530> with

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
we've had in the past particularly with

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.190 
we've had in the past particularly with
teacher<00:01:48.130> evaluation<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.390> everybody

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
teacher evaluation is that everybody

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.320 
teacher evaluation is that everybody
looked<00:01:50.500> at<00:01:50.650> good<00:01:50.950> compared<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.760> what<00:01:51.970> else<00:01:52.150> was

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
looked at good compared to what else was

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.420 
looked at good compared to what else was
going<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.750> in<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.050> building<00:01:53.410> right<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.950> so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
going on in the building right and so

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.640 
going on in the building right and so
what<00:01:54.610> we've<00:01:54.730> seen<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.060> far<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:55.960> recognition

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
what we've seen so far is a recognition

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.460 
what we've seen so far is a recognition
that<00:01:57.010> that's<00:01:57.700> not<00:01:57.940> good<00:01:58.240> enough<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:59.260> there

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
that that's not good enough that there

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.500 
that that's not good enough that there
