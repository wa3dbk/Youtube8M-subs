I'm on my single-player world another

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.230 
I'm on my single-player world another
parkour<00:00:16.440> course<00:00:16.680> although<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.609> built<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.180> one

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
parkour course although I built this one

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.590 
parkour course although I built this one
in<00:00:18.720> advanced<00:00:19.260> because<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:20.279> did<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.090> film<00:00:21.359> any

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
in advanced because I did not film any

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.990 
in advanced because I did not film any
of<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.590> being<00:00:22.859> made<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.369> I'm<00:00:23.550> ill<00:00:23.730> sit<00:00:23.910> in

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
of it like being made so I'm ill sit in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.700 
of it like being made so I'm ill sit in
advance<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.800> this<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.070> how<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:27.260> it's<00:00:28.260> just

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
advance and this is how it is it's just

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.380 
advance and this is how it is it's just
like<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.490> you're<00:00:29.849> supposed<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.179> run

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
like that and you're supposed to run

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.389 
like that and you're supposed to run
across<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.230> jump<00:00:31.560> across<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:32.009> even<00:00:32.219> walk

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
across you can jump across or even walk

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.700 
across you can jump across or even walk
across<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> jump<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.329> still<00:00:33.600> works<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
across and jump it still works and you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010 
across and jump it still works and you
save<00:00:34.890> your<00:00:35.010> spawn<00:00:35.280> point<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> end<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.149> so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
save your spawn point at the end and so

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.410 
save your spawn point at the end and so
how<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.410> works<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.920> there's<00:00:38.460> redstone<00:00:39.030> under

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
how this works is there's redstone under

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
how this works is there's redstone under
that<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.930> I'll<00:00:40.710> show<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.129> it's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that and I'll show you right here it's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.520 
that and I'll show you right here it's
that<00:00:42.239> piece<00:00:42.450> right<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:42.899> my<00:00:43.020> crosshairs

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that piece right there at my crosshairs

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.700 
that piece right there at my crosshairs
and<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:44.010> over<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.750> build<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.230> 3<00:00:46.530> by

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and you go over for and you build a 3 by

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.660 
and you go over for and you build a 3 by
10<00:00:46.920> room<00:00:47.719> 3<00:00:48.719> high<00:00:48.899> 10<00:00:49.200> wide<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.800> you're<00:00:50.550> going

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
10 room 3 high 10 wide and you're going

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.389 
10 room 3 high 10 wide and you're going
to<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.510> tick<00:00:51.690> repeater<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> first

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
to want a one tick repeater at the first

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.880 
to want a one tick repeater at the first
one<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.230> repeater<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
one and then a to take repeater at the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.970 
one and then a to take repeater at the
first<00:00:56.629> what<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.840> piston<00:00:58.170> yeah<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.590> then

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
first what is that piston yeah and then

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.740 
first what is that piston yeah and then
you<00:00:59.309> technically<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.600> bit

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you technically have it a little bit

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.510 
you technically have it a little bit
different<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> other<00:01:01.260> side<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.250> one

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
different on the other side you have one

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.509 
different on the other side you have one
I<00:01:02.699> yeah<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.710> tick<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.280> one

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I yeah so you have one tick then one

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.870 
I yeah so you have one tick then one
tick<00:01:05.820> two<00:01:06.330> ticks<00:01:06.710> three<00:01:07.710> ticks<00:01:07.950> three<00:01:08.640> takes

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
tick two ticks three ticks three takes

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.899 
tick two ticks three ticks three takes
one<00:01:09.540> tick<00:01:09.830> three<00:01:10.830> -<00:01:10.979> error<00:01:11.159> four<00:01:11.460> ticks<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
one tick three - error four ticks and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.969 
one tick three - error four ticks and
then<00:01:12.030> three<00:01:12.240> ticks<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> side

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
then three ticks so that's on the side

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.330 
then three ticks so that's on the side
to<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> left<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.080> on<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.320> side<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to the left and on the right side you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.660 
to the left and on the right side you
have<00:01:17.659> one<00:01:18.659> tick<00:01:18.869> two<00:01:19.200> ticks<00:01:19.470> two<00:01:19.890> ticks<00:01:20.159> for

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
have one tick two ticks two ticks for

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.770 
have one tick two ticks two ticks for
ticks

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
ticks

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.440 
ticks
three<00:01:22.259> ticks<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:23.040> ticks<00:01:23.310> four<00:01:24.030> ticks<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
three ticks two ticks four ticks and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.170 
three ticks two ticks four ticks and
four<00:01:24.659> ticks<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.460> don't<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.729> tickets

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
four ticks so if you don't know tickets

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
four ticks so if you don't know tickets
it's<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> tenth<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.170> second<00:01:28.470> that's<00:01:28.650> how

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it's like a tenth of a second that's how

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.880 
it's like a tenth of a second that's how
the<00:01:28.829> repeater<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.540> that<00:01:30.540> much<00:01:30.720> more<00:01:30.900> time<00:01:31.200> for

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the repeater is that much more time for

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.819 
the repeater is that much more time for
the<00:01:32.189> piston<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.000> delayed<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.650> that's<00:01:34.650> what

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the piston to be delayed so that's what

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.380 
the piston to be delayed so that's what
you<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.520> want<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.060> actually

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
you want if you want this to be actually

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.590 
you want if you want this to be actually
working<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.130> place<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:39.090> goes<00:01:39.329> over

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
working so you place that it goes over

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
working so you place that it goes over
and<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.530> jump<00:01:40.770> across<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.430> safely<00:01:41.729> get

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and you jump across and safely get

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.960 
and you jump across and safely get
across<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> feel<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.710> could<00:01:43.970> just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
across and if you feel you could just

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
across and if you feel you could just
fall<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.270> lava<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.020> could<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> closed

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
fall in lava or you could have it closed

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.749 
fall in lava or you could have it closed
back<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:48.210> something<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.409> yeah<00:01:49.979> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
back up or something like that yeah so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.219 
back up or something like that yeah so
you<00:01:50.850> could<00:01:51.149> have<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> suffocate<00:01:51.689> them<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.079> way

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you could have a suffocate them in a way

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.510 
you could have a suffocate them in a way
so<00:01:52.890> yeah

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so yeah

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310
