00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
and bad grammar and flipping switches

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.840 
and bad grammar and flipping switches
and<00:01:02.370> dogs<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:06.680> there<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> story<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.369> but

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it's never really all that clear maybe

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.880 
it's never really all that clear maybe
something<00:01:11.369> about<00:01:11.490> magic<00:01:12.479> stones<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.740> could

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
something about magic stones that could

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890 
something about magic stones that could
summon<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> monster<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.330> which<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.630> turn

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
summon a monster then which in turn

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.469 
summon a monster then which in turn

people<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.310> always<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.670> worried<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
people are always so worried about the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.719 
people are always so worried about the
apocalypse<00:01:21.600> who<00:01:22.110> cares<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.220> we're<00:01:23.369> overdue

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
apocalypse who cares and we're overdue

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
apocalypse who cares and we're overdue
for<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.000> good<00:01:24.420> plague<00:01:24.780> anyway<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.470> mild

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
for a good plague anyway a mild

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.969 
for a good plague anyway a mild
apocalypse<00:01:26.670> would<00:01:26.850> suffice<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.900> no<00:01:28.110> there's

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
apocalypse would suffice but no there's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.969 
apocalypse would suffice but no there's
Laura<00:01:29.280> Croft<00:01:29.700> freaking<00:01:30.829> overachiever

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
Laura Croft freaking overachiever

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.819 
Laura Croft freaking overachiever
neither<00:01:32.670> apocalypse<00:01:33.329> nor<00:01:33.600> c-cup<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.590> Lara

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
neither apocalypse nor c-cup for Lara

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580 
neither apocalypse nor c-cup for Lara
Croft<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.570> game<00:01:36.750> has<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.500> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
Croft so the game has a kind of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
Croft so the game has a kind of
old-school<00:01:38.100> flair<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.820> which<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.240> really

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
old-school flair to it which I really

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 
old-school flair to it which I really
like<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> suits<00:01:40.560> Tomb<00:01:40.860> Raider<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.400> in

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
like and it suits Tomb Raider well in

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.999 
like and it suits Tomb Raider well in
this<00:01:41.880> particular<00:01:42.119> application<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.649> there's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this particular application so there's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.370 
this particular application so there's
plenty<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.340> platforming<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> puzzle<00:01:45.479> solving

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
plenty of platforming and puzzle solving

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.510 
plenty of platforming and puzzle solving
and<00:01:47.270> shimmying<00:01:48.270> across<00:01:48.560> ledges<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:50.159> least<00:01:50.340> in

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and shimmying across ledges at least in

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.819 
and shimmying across ledges at least in
theory<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.360> works<00:01:51.540> great<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.110> GBA<00:01:52.439> but

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
theory that works great on the GBA but

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
theory that works great on the GBA but
the<00:01:52.920> problem<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.549> game<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.090> really

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the problem with this game is really

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.600 
the problem with this game is really
twofold<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.799> perspective<00:01:56.369> doesn't

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
twofold one the perspective doesn't

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.020 
twofold one the perspective doesn't
always<00:01:56.880> work<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.360> two<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.500> gameplay<00:01:58.979> never

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
always work and two the gameplay never

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.749 
always work and two the gameplay never
evolves<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.869> speak<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> prior<00:02:01.649> there<00:02:02.610> are

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
evolves to speak to the prior there are

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.520 
evolves to speak to the prior there are
more<00:02:03.119> than<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.329> few<00:02:03.570> times<00:02:03.840> when<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> game's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
more than a few times when the game's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.249 
more than a few times when the game's
graphics<00:02:04.920> fail<00:02:05.820> its<00:02:06.060> perspective<00:02:06.509> which<00:02:07.079> is

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
graphics fail its perspective which is

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.680 
graphics fail its perspective which is
to<00:02:07.439> say<00:02:07.940> discerning<00:02:08.940> ledges<00:02:09.420> from

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
to say discerning ledges from

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.809 
to say discerning ledges from
backgrounds<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.860> problematic

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
backgrounds can be problematic

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.759 
backgrounds can be problematic
the<00:02:11.939> bigger<00:02:12.150> problem<00:02:12.689> is<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:13.019> Laura's

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
the bigger problem is that Laura's

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.309 
the bigger problem is that Laura's
objectives<00:02:14.430> never<00:02:14.730> change<00:02:15.120> from<00:02:15.870> beginning

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
objectives never change from beginning

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.099 
objectives never change from beginning
to<00:02:16.469> end<00:02:16.499> it's<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.370> flip<00:02:18.030> switch<00:02:18.389> find<00:02:18.810> or

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
to end it's just a flip switch find or

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.119 
to end it's just a flip switch find or
disable<00:02:19.980> trap<00:02:20.249> find<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:21.079> shoot<00:02:22.079> dogs<00:02:22.349> it<00:02:23.010> all

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
disable trap find or shoot dogs it all

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.069 
disable trap find or shoot dogs it all
works<00:02:23.400> perfectly<00:02:23.549> fine<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.689> actually

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
works perfectly fine and is actually

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.140 
works perfectly fine and is actually
good<00:02:25.319> fun<00:02:25.560> at<00:02:25.650> first<00:02:25.889> but<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.549> gets<00:02:26.730> repetitive

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
good fun at first but it gets repetitive

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.660 
good fun at first but it gets repetitive
really<00:02:27.959> fast<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.739> some<00:02:29.189> of<00:02:29.280> those<00:02:29.370> sound

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
really fast and some of those sound

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:43.880 
really fast and some of those sound
effects<00:02:30.030> Oh

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.800 

this<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.070> classic<00:02:45.850> example<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.600> game<00:02:46.750> that

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
this is a classic example of a game that

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.930 
this is a classic example of a game that
you<00:02:47.470> know<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.830> starts<00:02:48.220> off<00:02:48.400> with<00:02:48.550> some<00:02:48.760> fun

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
you know it starts off with some fun
