00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
okay now I get this level somewhat on

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
okay now I get this level somewhat on
the<00:01:25.830> tripod<00:01:27.770> okay<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.640> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the tripod okay you can just see it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.990 
the tripod okay you can just see it
underneath<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:31.189> crossbar<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:35.000> my

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
underneath the crossbar right there my

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.390 
underneath the crossbar right there my
understanding<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.470> turn<00:01:41.159> this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
understanding is you just turn this

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.630 
understanding is you just turn this
oh<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:44.440> does<00:01:44.680> turn<00:01:46.320> thought<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.380> tried<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:48.430> one

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
oh it does turn thought I tried this one

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.290 
oh it does turn thought I tried this one
time<00:01:48.940> because<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.570> didn't<00:01:49.780> know<00:01:49.840> what<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.080> was

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
time because I didn't know what it was

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:03.719 
time because I didn't know what it was
and<00:01:52.300> then

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.630 

yeah<00:02:04.360> that's<00:02:04.869> really<00:02:05.500> hard<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.890> pull<00:02:06.130> pull<00:02:06.700> up

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
yeah that's really hard to pull pull up

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.830 
yeah that's really hard to pull pull up
of<00:02:09.640> course<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:10.000> don't<00:02:10.179> think<00:02:10.330> it's<00:02:10.450> ever<00:02:10.569> been

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
of course I don't think it's ever been

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:21.350 
of course I don't think it's ever been
changed<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.349> mean<00:02:11.560> maybe<00:02:11.769> ask<00:02:12.129> previous<00:02:12.670> hunter

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.250 

there<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.480> go<00:02:22.599> okay<00:02:22.930> just<00:02:23.230> keep<00:02:23.410> turning<00:02:23.680> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
there you go okay just keep turning it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.009 
there you go okay just keep turning it
in<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.950> arrows<00:02:27.370> slide<00:02:27.940> up<00:02:28.239> that's<00:02:28.660> why<00:02:28.870> it's

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
in the arrows slide up that's why it's

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:40.229
