00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040 
just complete bug fix 4.1 of the point
6.1<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.970> that's<00:00:21.150> why<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.539> record<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
6.1 so that's why I can record it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.230 
6.1 so that's why I can record it
straight<00:00:22.439> away<00:00:22.470> because<00:00:22.859> every<00:00:23.369> time<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:24.060> try

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
straight away because every time you try

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.630 
straight away because every time you try
to<00:00:24.359> save<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.019> world<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.439> quit<00:00:25.650> out<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.160> it

look at the top that's got the armor bar

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.549 
look at the top that's got the armor bar
which<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.579> pretty<00:00:53.699> cool<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.989> craft

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
which is pretty cool so you can craft

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.450 
which is pretty cool so you can craft
here<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.940> armor<00:00:57.680> which<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.800> pretty<00:00:58.980> good<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
here the armor which is pretty good and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.830 
here the armor which is pretty good and
also<00:00:59.609> I've<00:00:59.910> noticed<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.239> they've<00:01:00.480> changed

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
also I've noticed that they've changed

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
also I've noticed that they've changed
the<00:01:01.140> melon<00:01:01.469> seeds<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.250> they've<00:01:02.430> changed<00:01:02.910> them

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the melon seeds so they've changed them

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.910 
the melon seeds so they've changed them
back<00:01:03.390> because<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.840> did<00:01:04.170> look<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.379> pumpkin

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
back because they did look like pumpkin

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
back because they did look like pumpkin
seed<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.430> originally<00:01:05.670> we'll<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.600> like

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
seed I think originally we'll just like

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.810 
seed I think originally we'll just like
normal<00:01:06.930> seat<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.740> changed<00:01:07.920> texture

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
normal seat but now they changed texture

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.060 
normal seat but now they changed texture
but<00:01:09.540> yeah<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> craft<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> these

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
but yeah so if you craft one of these

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.880 
but yeah so if you craft one of these
like<00:01:11.460> gold<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.330> something<00:01:12.720> pretend<00:01:13.290> acrostic

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
like gold or something pretend acrostic

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.969 
like gold or something pretend acrostic
gold<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.810> go<00:01:16.140> into<00:01:16.170> this

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
gold you go and then you go into this
