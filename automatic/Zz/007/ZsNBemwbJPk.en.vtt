00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.930
 high demand for quality 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.280
 planting material 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.759
 give birth to others 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.209
 new varieties 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.809
 adapted climatic 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.169
 conditions of the Urals and Siberia 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.900
 puzzled by advanced technology 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.009
 plant reproduction 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.539
 available traditional 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.929
 technology 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.079
 not effective enough therefore 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.369
 technology development 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.210
 artificial reproduction of plants 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.800
 is a prerequisite for development 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.410
 agriculture at the moment 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.490
 technology metran alla this is one of 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.970
 unique of all because 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.449
 deficiency of the original pernell having one 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.480
 a girl killed one plant for the introduction 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.470
 Well, there are a few kidneys you can get 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.650
 per year in 30 thousand plants 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.380
 about the fact that they say if it is already in a year and a half 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.170
 Someone from the predecessor 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.410
 decomposition of ice in arithmetic 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.800
 progression 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.030
 worldwide approach 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.540
 regarded as one of reliable and 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.580
 efficient ways of plant reproduction 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.680
 as well as the preservation of genetic 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.220
 the potential of rare and endangered species 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.990
 of plants 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.880
 so how is the invitro way 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.350
 the only way to get a plant in 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.960
 bulk quantity and in short time and 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.880
 gum method of producing plants 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.300
 released and the disease 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.850
 including viral diseases it is 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.520
 basis for breeding and obtaining varieties and 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.580
 hybrids with high economic 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.090
 valuable properties then how yields 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.730
 disease resistance 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.700
 climatic stability 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.550
 conditions 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.540
 we want flowers for example 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.420
 more and flour and settle in it 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 direction 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.880
 and here have some wind technology 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.510
 cases allows for selection and 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.310
 reduce the time of selection to receive 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.520
 new variety 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.350
 wind technology is the only 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.539
 wound capabilities 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.039
 at the moment of saving 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.099
 recovery population disappear 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:53.380
 plant species accounts 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.170
 technology based visit number 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.469
 production conditions 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.080
 septic conditions 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.460
 her design unique 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.730
 artificial nutrient media 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.700
 nutrient medium is a 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.250
 sophisticated optimized 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.090
 multicomponent structure consisting 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.620
 from organic and inorganic 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.050
 chemical compounds and in 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.150
 biologically active substances 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.210
 natural origin 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.500
 providing stimulating 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.830
 effect on growth tissue development in 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.509
 plant organs 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.609
 the whole decomposition process is possible 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.569
 divided by 401 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.569
 this is also an introduction to breeding culture 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.279
 rooting 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:32.420
 her adaptation 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.230
 of plants 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.750
 the next stage is her plants 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.360
 build up in a greenhouse but to 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.839
 get a standard seedling 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.369
 in for sale or exhibition 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:43.229
 to the nursery
