that's okay how are you going to do is
walk<00:02:06.240> around<00:02:06.420> till<00:02:06.720> we<00:02:06.780> find<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.110> next<00:02:07.409> area

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

it<00:02:11.520> will<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> place<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.240> lots<00:02:12.270> of

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
it will be a place with lots of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.260 
it will be a place with lots of
creepy-looking<00:02:12.900> d<00:02:13.350> monsters

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:28.720 

so<00:02:19.870> we'll<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.320> roll<00:02:20.890> on<00:02:21.460> down<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:22.000> beach

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.270 

maybe<00:02:29.730> actually<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.360> faster<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:30.960> around

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
maybe actually just faster to go around

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.949 
maybe actually just faster to go around
that

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.240 

just<00:02:37.959> call<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.290> jiggle<00:02:38.650> around<00:02:38.800> till<00:02:39.160> it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
just call it a jiggle around till it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.559 
just call it a jiggle around till it
clicks

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.780 

again<00:02:48.260> jumping<00:02:48.739> in<00:02:48.829> bag<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.040> hose<00:02:49.370> off<00:02:49.579> and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
again jumping in bag and hose off and

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.750 
again jumping in bag and hose off and
faster

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.190 

this<00:02:58.760> looks<00:02:58.970> promising<00:03:01.600> yep<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.080> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
this looks promising yep this is the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.390 
this looks promising yep this is the
place

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.220 

pacifica

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.100 

see<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.530> why<00:03:12.650> we<00:03:12.800> need<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.980> deploy<00:03:17.110> not

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
see this is why we need a deploy not

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.780 
see this is why we need a deploy not
getting<00:03:18.410> mauled<00:03:18.620> by<00:03:18.830> B<00:03:19.010> monsters<00:03:19.430> would<00:03:19.580> help

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
getting mauled by B monsters would help

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.600 
getting mauled by B monsters would help
too<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:23.210> that's<00:03:24.080> just<00:03:24.290> ridiculous<00:03:27.310> let's<00:03:28.310> try

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
too and that's just ridiculous let's try
