welcome<00:00:00.840> back<00:00:01.020> I<00:00:01.460> have<00:00:02.460> in<00:00:02.790> front<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.090> me<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.510> new

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
welcome back I have in front of me a new

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.590 
welcome back I have in front of me a new
freefall<00:00:05.009> mentalism<00:00:05.700> designed<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.480> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
freefall mentalism designed for the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.379 
freefall mentalism designed for the
nether<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:07.710> doesn't<00:00:08.010> use<00:00:08.130> water<00:00:08.340> let<00:00:09.150> me<00:00:09.210> just

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
nether it doesn't use water let me just

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.690 
nether it doesn't use water let me just
show<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.570> real<00:00:10.050> quick<00:00:10.320> how<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.530> works<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.889> fall

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
show you real quick how it works I fall

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.759 
show you real quick how it works I fall
down<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.389> at<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> bottom<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.349> don't<00:00:13.500> take<00:00:13.620> any

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
down and at the bottom I don't take any

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.770 
down and at the bottom I don't take any
damage<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:15.120> because<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.540> ladder

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
damage and it's because of this ladder

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.320 
damage and it's because of this ladder
and<00:00:16.940> these<00:00:17.940> hatches<00:00:18.800> so<00:00:19.910> let<00:00:20.910> me<00:00:21.000> sort<00:00:21.240> of

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
and these hatches so let me sort of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.029 
and these hatches so let me sort of
explain<00:00:21.750> what's<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.439> here<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:22.859> I'll

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
explain what's going on here first I'll

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.040 
explain what's going on here first I'll
start<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.820> common<00:00:24.180> solution<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.869> most

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
start with the common solution that most

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.109 
start with the common solution that most
people<00:00:25.289> use<00:00:25.439> for<00:00:25.650> freefall<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.880> doesn't

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
people use for freefall but that doesn't

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.990 
people use for freefall but that doesn't
work<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> nether<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.410> water

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
work in the nether and it's it's water

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.939 
work in the nether and it's it's water
so<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> fall<00:00:31.199> down<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.769> little

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
so as you see I fall down this little

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
so as you see I fall down this little
shaft<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.669> when<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
shaft here when I do that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.880 
shaft here when I do that
I<00:00:35.360> pop<00:00:36.360> through<00:00:36.780> these<00:00:36.960> three<00:00:37.260> locks<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.680> water

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I pop through these three locks of water

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.700 
I pop through these three locks of water
and<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.760> kill<00:00:38.969> our<00:00:39.000> momentum<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and they kill our momentum and so when I

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.459 
and they kill our momentum and so when I
hit<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> ground<00:00:41.629> I'm<00:00:42.629> not<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.020> falling

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
hit the ground I'm not really falling

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.979 
hit the ground I'm not really falling
anymore<00:00:43.969> or<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.539> fast<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:45.960> least

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
anymore or not really as fast at least

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.569 
anymore or not really as fast at least
so<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:46.710> take<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.190> take<00:00:47.309> any<00:00:47.460> damage

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so don't take really take any damage

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.250 
so don't take really take any damage
you've<00:00:48.329> probably<00:00:48.450> seen<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.719> before<00:00:48.930> it's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
you've probably seen that before it's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.939 
you've probably seen that before it's
pretty<00:00:49.410> common<00:00:49.850> but<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.530> isn't<00:00:52.710> working<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
pretty common but that isn't working the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.380 
pretty common but that isn't working the
nether<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.579> you're<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:53.969> allowed<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.270> use

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
nether because you're not allowed to use

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.900 
nether because you're not allowed to use
water<00:00:54.629> than<00:00:54.840> other<00:00:54.960> water<00:00:55.649> evaporate<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
water than other water evaporate so I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.830 
water than other water evaporate so I
have<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> solution<00:00:59.480> fall<00:01:00.480> down<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
have this as a solution fall down this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.910 
have this as a solution fall down this
shaft<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.609> at<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> bottom<00:01:03.049> you<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.530> near<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
shaft and at the bottom you are near a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.820 
shaft and at the bottom you are near a
ladder<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> way<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.320> works<00:01:07.590> is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
ladder so the way that this works is

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.880 
ladder so the way that this works is
that<00:01:08.720> when<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:09.869> climbing<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.380> ladder<00:01:10.560> or

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that when you're climbing a ladder or

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.750 
that when you're climbing a ladder or
for<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> ladder<00:01:12.979> you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
for going down a ladder you have a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.969 
for going down a ladder you have a
certain<00:01:15.150> speed<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> move<00:01:15.720> at<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
certain speed that you move at it's the

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.920 
certain speed that you move at it's the
top<00:01:17.220> speed<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.150> can't<00:01:18.420> move<00:01:18.540> any<00:01:18.720> faster

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
top speed and you can't move any faster

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.160 
top speed and you can't move any faster
than<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:19.530> matter<00:01:19.710> how<00:01:19.860> hard<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.130> try<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
than that no matter how hard you try and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
than that no matter how hard you try and
when<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.320> next<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> ladder<00:01:23.189> even<00:01:24.060> if

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
when you're next to a ladder even if

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.030 
when you're next to a ladder even if
you're<00:01:24.270> falling<00:01:24.750> you'll<00:01:25.080> start<00:01:25.439> climbing<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you're falling you'll start climbing it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.069 
you're falling you'll start climbing it
so<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> hit<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> bottom<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:30.079> you

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
so when you hit the bottom here you you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.480 
so when you hit the bottom here you you
just<00:01:31.320> start<00:01:31.500> climbing<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> ladder<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
just start climbing the ladder and it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.640 
just start climbing the ladder and it
slows<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.060> slows<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.689> fall<00:01:33.960> speed<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
slows you slows your fall speed down to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.700 
slows you slows your fall speed down to
the<00:01:35.009> vertical<00:01:35.670> ladder<00:01:36.590> downward<00:01:37.590> speed<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
the vertical ladder downward speed so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.160 
the vertical ladder downward speed so
when<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.770> hit<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.009> bottom<00:01:41.960> again<00:01:42.960> you're

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
when you hit the bottom again you're

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.289 
when you hit the bottom again you're
climbing<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.610> immediately<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.060> slow

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
climbing and so immediately you slow

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
climbing and so immediately you slow
down<00:01:45.619> that's<00:01:46.619> great

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
down that's great

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
down that's great
there's<00:01:47.820> one<00:01:48.000> problem<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.720> though<00:01:48.990> if

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
there's one problem with this though if

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
there's one problem with this though if
you<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.560> know<00:01:49.649> what<00:01:49.770> you're<00:01:49.860> doing<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.520> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you don't know what you're doing and you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.120 
you don't know what you're doing and you
get<00:01:50.939> into<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> shaft<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.810> then<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.409> turn

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
get into the shaft and then you turn

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
get into the shaft and then you turn
around<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.820> press<00:01:54.210> back<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
around or press back and you go into the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.410 
around or press back and you go into the
wall<00:01:55.649> you'll<00:01:56.579> hit<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.759> top<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.240> ladder

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
wall you'll hit the top of the ladder

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.149 
wall you'll hit the top of the ladder
and<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.170> saw<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.530> took<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> little<00:01:58.890> bit<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
and you saw I took a little bit of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.450 
and you saw I took a little bit of
damage<00:01:59.430> there

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
damage there

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.679 
damage there
that's<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.790> ladder<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.329> actually<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
that's because ladder is actually have a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.969 
that's because ladder is actually have a
little<00:02:03.719> bit<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> thickness<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.770> see

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
little bit of thickness you can see

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.999 
little bit of thickness you can see
there's<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> little<00:02:05.700> bit<00:02:05.820> thickness<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
there's a little bit thickness here and

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.210 
there's a little bit thickness here and
so

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
so

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.580 
so
when<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.729> fall<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.510> you're<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.200> you're<00:02:10.530> up

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
when you fall and you're and you're up

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.680 
when you fall and you're and you're up
against<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.040> edge<00:02:11.340> you'll<00:02:12.240> you'll<00:02:12.480> hit<00:02:12.630> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
against this edge you'll you'll hit the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.930 
against this edge you'll you'll hit the
lip<00:02:12.960> of<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.140> ladder<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> take<00:02:14.670> care<00:02:14.730> of

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
lip of the ladder so to take care of

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.960 
lip of the ladder so to take care of
that<00:02:15.180> I've<00:02:15.480> added<00:02:15.780> these<00:02:16.470> hatches<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
that I've added these hatches and the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.870 
that I've added these hatches and the
hatches<00:02:18.480> also<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> bit<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.560> thickness<00:02:19.880> but

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
hatches also have a bit of thickness but

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.550 
hatches also have a bit of thickness but
you<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.150> still<00:02:21.330> freefall<00:02:21.810> next<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.200> them

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you can still freefall next to them

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.150 
you can still freefall next to them
so<00:02:22.950> even<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.030> try<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.750> press<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.770> against

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
so even if I try and press up against

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.400 
so even if I try and press up against
the<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.760> hatches<00:02:27.180> they<00:02:28.020> still<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.350> enough

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
the the hatches they still have enough

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.500 
the the hatches they still have enough
thickness<00:02:28.740> that<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.190> can't<00:02:29.550> possibly<00:02:30.060> get<00:02:30.360> onto

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
thickness that I can't possibly get onto

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.430 
thickness that I can't possibly get onto
this<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:31.580> little<00:02:32.580> lip<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> ladder<00:02:33.440> so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
this little little lip of the ladder so

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.260 
this little little lip of the ladder so
that's<00:02:34.800> how<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.100> works<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.090> great

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
that's how it works and it's a great

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.200 
that's how it works and it's a great
freefall<00:02:37.200> mechanism<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.430> works<00:02:39.060> really

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
freefall mechanism that works really

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.210 
freefall mechanism that works really
well<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.600> there<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:40.800> access<00:02:41.100> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
well in there you don't have access to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.660 
well in there you don't have access to
water<00:02:41.310> thanks<00:02:42.300> for<00:02:42.390> watching
