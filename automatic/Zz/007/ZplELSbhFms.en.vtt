00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
promise you that it does the biggest

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.490 
promise you that it does the biggest
thing<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:59.040> that<00:03:00.019> tends<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.200> screw

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
thing that we have that tends to screw

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.620 
thing that we have that tends to screw
it<00:03:01.560> up<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.700> batteries<00:03:03.060> get<00:03:03.209> low<00:03:03.450> in

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
it up is if the batteries get low in

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.770 
it up is if the batteries get low in
this<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:05.280> gets<00:03:05.519> very<00:03:05.610> spotty<00:03:07.040> meaning<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.250> amp

it<00:03:09.780> actually<00:03:10.140> works<00:03:10.380> about<00:03:10.680> half<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.069> time<00:03:11.250> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
it actually works about half the time it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.340 
it actually works about half the time it
bleeps<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.060> off<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.930> just<00:03:12.959> make<00:03:13.319> sure
