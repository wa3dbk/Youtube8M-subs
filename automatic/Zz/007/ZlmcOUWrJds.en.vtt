which<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> little<00:02:46.110> hundred<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.790> fact

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
which get a little hundred is the fact

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.580 
which get a little hundred is the fact
that<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.599> deactivate<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.110> power<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that you can deactivate the power I

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.949 
that you can deactivate the power I
think<00:02:49.739> it<00:02:50.010> lasts<00:02:50.160> 60<00:02:50.489> minutes<00:02:50.730> by<00:02:50.849> itself<00:02:51.120> slow

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
think it lasts 60 minutes by itself slow

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.140 
think it lasts 60 minutes by itself slow
fire<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.349> activated<00:02:52.829> but<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.910> activate

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
fire the activated but you can activate

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.319 
fire the activated but you can activate
it<00:02:54.209> again<00:02:54.650> straight<00:02:55.650> away<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.700> it's

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
it again straight away so it's

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.229

being<00:03:07.490> continuously<00:03:08.240> available<00:03:08.960> to<00:03:09.230> me<00:03:09.380> is

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
being continuously available to me is

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.410 
being continuously available to me is
overpowered<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.580> I<00:03:10.640> don't<00:03:10.790> like<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.240> I

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
overpowered and I don't like that I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.640 
overpowered and I don't like that I
wouldn't<00:03:11.690> use<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:11.900> for<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.230> reason<00:03:12.410> alone
