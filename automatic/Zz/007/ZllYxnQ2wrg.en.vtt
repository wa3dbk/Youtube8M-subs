00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.340
 hi dear friends I am again 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.970
 welcome you to the universe channel 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.130
 destiny 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 your universal guide to the game world from 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.900
 gang in Russian in this video speech 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.760
 will go as you already understood about the exotic 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.310
 a sniper rifle from a breaker 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.220
 perhaps almost better exotic 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.650
 thing in the whole game main charm 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.779
 if you let this monster is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.480
 possibility of automatic recharge 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.809
 rounds of six bullets in the horn which 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.730
 never have to change every three 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.239
 seconds the rifle regenerates one 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.280
 cartridge 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.140
 so if you are going to a place where 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.739
 will have to sit down and shoot back 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.480
 it's just a must have thing to say 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.180
 that virtually no serious 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.640
 the team does not take on raid players without 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.520
 such weapons fortunately this gun 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.710
 quite often sold by the Jurassic vendor 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.079
 exotic things in the city so 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 stock up page other main 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.129
 currency wonderful seller in the hood 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.060
 coming every friday to the tower and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.240
 forward this thing just blows my head i 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.610
 strongly recommend this weapon go 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.770
 to the review of the main gun extensions 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.409
 to a large extent the first branch of expansion 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.299
 not much modifies weapons it comes 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.780
 except that the minimum difference in 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.220
 feedback remains at your discretion 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.890
 first unique ability a of 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.049
 breaker mulligan without hitting you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.659
 get a chance to fill your store 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.509
 on one cartridge the second branch is more 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.430
 essentially could draw choosing this your 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.439
 the rifle will be ready to shoot at the stake 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.720
 seconds faster lightweight 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.860
 your weapon is equipped you get 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.799
 agility bonus 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.350
 more speed and higher jumps i 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.600
 I opt for this snapshot 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.240
 you aim for a split second faster and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.020
 followed by the unique ability of a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.180
 from breaker 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.149
 not counting auto ammo regeneration 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.670
 killing enemies from this cannon their corpse 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.460
 each time it will explode causing damage 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.189
 nearby enemies check ice breaker 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.310
 in the glades you get a head boom in your head 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.440
 boom and so on forever in the past 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.530
 video I talked about the benefits of a breaker 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.080
 during the passage 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.850
 their heroic strike and my breaker 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.920
 equalized the chances of warlock twenty-seven 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.050
 level to pass the maximum 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.209
 difficulty levels enjoy 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.780
 entertainment and ease of passage 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.580

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.860
