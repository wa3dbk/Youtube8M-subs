00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
a mag and for this type and that really

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.730 
a mag and for this type and that really
isn't<00:01:09.000> very<00:01:09.150> many<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.409> i<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.650> they

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
isn't very many at all and i think they

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.830 
isn't very many at all and i think they
definitely<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.369> need<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.820> few<00:01:12.119> more<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.689> are

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
definitely do need a few more if you are

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.390 
definitely do need a few more if you are
trying<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.260> well<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.650> gun<00:01:13.890> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
trying to do well with this gun so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.499 
trying to do well with this gun so
that's<00:01:14.549> why<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> cinematic<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.299> quite

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that's why the cinematic is quite

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
that's why the cinematic is quite
important<00:01:15.990> however<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.070> quite<00:01:17.100> hard<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> get

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
important however it's quite hard to get

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.160 
important however it's quite hard to get
the<00:01:17.850> extended<00:01:18.119> mags<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.630> need<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.900> 30

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the extended mags I think need like 30

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630 
the extended mags I think need like 30
head<00:01:19.409> shots<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.830> gun<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.430> have

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
head shots with the gun so you all have

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.340 
head shots with the gun so you all have
to<00:01:20.759> grind<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.119> out<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> isn't<00:01:22.200> too

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
to grind it out a bit but it isn't too

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.690 
to grind it out a bit but it isn't too
bad<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:22.710> any<00:01:23.040> attachments<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
explanatory if you guys don't know what

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.160 
explanatory if you guys don't know what
that<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.000> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.240> reduces<00:01:36.390> sway<00:01:36.960> when

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that is it kind of reduces sway when

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.600 
that is it kind of reduces sway when
your<00:01:37.290> name<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.590> down<00:01:37.710> side<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.280> makes<00:01:38.490> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
your name and down side so it makes you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.840 
your name and down side so it makes you
a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.759> bit<00:01:38.939> more<00:01:39.060> accurate

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
a little bit more accurate

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.240 
a little bit more accurate
you<00:01:40.330> can<00:01:40.510> see<00:01:40.659> i'm<00:01:40.780> also<00:01:40.960> using<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.470> PDW

you can see i'm also using the PDW
pistol<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.939> i<00:01:42.970> don't<00:01:43.150> usually<00:01:43.299> use

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
secondaries but like i said before you

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.730 
secondaries but like i said before you
are<00:01:46.090> going<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.540> lose<00:01:46.630> most<00:01:47.020> kind<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.470> close

the enemy which is going to help you a
lot<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.479> close-range<00:01:55.689> situations<00:01:56.369> also<00:01:57.369> I

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
lot of close-range situations also I

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.889 
lot of close-range situations also I
haven't<00:01:57.700> used<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.090> match<00:01:58.360> with<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.659> fast

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
haven't used in that match with the fast

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.510 
haven't used in that match with the fast
hands<00:01:59.170> perk<00:01:59.500> because<00:01:59.830> if<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.039> guys<00:02:00.190> didn't

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
hands perk because if you guys didn't

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.460 
hands perk because if you guys didn't
know<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.909> this<00:02:01.180> game<00:02:01.390> at<00:02:01.570> he<00:02:01.840> takes<00:02:02.049> forever<00:02:02.229> to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
know in this game at he takes forever to

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.170 
know in this game at he takes forever to
switch<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.890> your<00:02:02.950> pistol<00:02:03.399> so<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:03.880> definitely

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
switch to your pistol so I definitely

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.760 
switch to your pistol so I definitely
think<00:02:04.390> vas<00:02:04.630> hand<00:02:04.899> is<00:02:05.080> needed<00:02:05.409> if<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.590> are

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
think vas hand is needed if you are

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.160 
think vas hand is needed if you are
gonna<00:02:05.950> use<00:02:06.130> secondary<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.970> also<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.990> peg

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
gonna use secondary and also in the peg

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.559 
gonna use secondary and also in the peg
to<00:02:08.380> stop<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:08.800> really<00:02:09.069> isn't<00:02:09.220> many<00:02:09.520> em<00:02:09.789> like

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
to stop that really isn't many em like

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.360 
to stop that really isn't many em like
decent<00:02:10.840> purposes<00:02:11.530> anyway<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.100> only<00:02:12.130> other

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
decent purposes anyway the only other

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.699 
decent purposes anyway the only other
one<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.489> would<00:02:12.819> use<00:02:13.030> peripherals<00:02:13.810> which<00:02:14.380> isn't

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
one I would use peripherals which isn't

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.770 
one I would use peripherals which isn't
the<00:02:14.769> most<00:02:14.800> important<00:02:15.400> one<00:02:15.430> anyway<00:02:15.940> but<00:02:16.690> now

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
the most important one anyway but now

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.030 
the most important one anyway but now
we're<00:02:16.930> on<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.080> topic<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.440> clerks<00:02:17.680> might<00:02:17.980> as

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
we're on the topic of clerks might as

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.770 
we're on the topic of clerks might as
well<00:02:18.130> go<00:02:18.280> over<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.580> rest<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.940> them<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.600> am

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
well go over the rest of them so I am

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.050 
well go over the rest of them so I am
using<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.170> low<00:02:20.410> profile<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.160> flak<00:02:21.430> jacket<00:02:21.850> low

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
using a low profile and flak jacket low

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.759 
using a low profile and flak jacket low
profile<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.540> quite<00:02:22.720> obvious<00:02:22.930> one<00:02:23.440> lots<00:02:23.709> of

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
profile is quite obvious one lots of

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.559 
profile is quite obvious one lots of
people<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.190> use<00:02:24.310> UAVs<00:02:24.819> this<00:02:25.120> game<00:02:25.360> and

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
people do like to use UAVs this game and

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.509 
people do like to use UAVs this game and
also<00:02:26.230> there<00:02:26.380> isn't<00:02:26.590> many<00:02:26.650> good<00:02:26.890> pubs<00:02:27.130> in<00:02:27.310> perk

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
also there isn't many good pubs in perk

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.890 
also there isn't many good pubs in perk
1<00:02:27.700> slot<00:02:27.910> anyway<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.360> it's<00:02:28.480> probably<00:02:28.630> one<00:02:28.870> of

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
1 slot anyway and it's probably one of

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.990 
1 slot anyway and it's probably one of
the<00:02:29.019> only<00:02:29.080> good<00:02:29.440> perks<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.310> low<00:02:30.430> profile<00:02:30.850> is

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
the only good perks so low profile is

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.309 
the only good perks so low profile is
definitely<00:02:31.299> one<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.660> want<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.870> use<00:02:32.080> on

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
definitely one that you want to use on

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.199 
definitely one that you want to use on
pretty<00:02:32.560> much<00:02:32.620> every<00:02:32.950> class<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.850> moors<00:02:34.090> of

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
pretty much every class the moors of

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.789 
pretty much every class the moors of
using<00:02:34.450> black<00:02:34.690> jackets<00:02:35.049> add<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> little<00:02:35.440> spare

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
using black jackets add a little spare

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.340 
using black jackets add a little spare
class<00:02:36.100> up<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:36.760> slot<00:02:37.090> laying<00:02:37.390> around<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:38.290> i

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
class up like slot laying around so i

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.600 
class up like slot laying around so i
thought<00:02:38.530> i'd<00:02:38.650> throw<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.890> flak<00:02:39.160> jacket<00:02:39.190> because

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
thought i'd throw a flak jacket because

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.280 
thought i'd throw a flak jacket because
it's<00:02:39.940> never<00:02:40.209> nothing<00:02:40.630> more<00:02:40.780> frustrating<00:02:40.930> than

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
it's never nothing more frustrating than

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.350 
it's never nothing more frustrating than
I<00:02:41.410> die<00:02:41.470> into<00:02:41.830> an<00:02:41.890> explosive<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.459> streak<00:02:42.790> so

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
I die into an explosive on a streak so

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.430 
I die into an explosive on a streak so
that's<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:43.600> kind<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.900> like<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.049> little<00:02:44.290> back

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
that's just kind of like a little back

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.250 
that's just kind of like a little back

my<00:02:52.840> streak<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.680> blast<00:02:53.950> pressure<00:02:54.280> because<00:02:54.880> i

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
my streak and blast pressure because i

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.030 
my streak and blast pressure because i
don't<00:02:56.320> feel<00:02:56.410> like<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.650> really<00:02:56.680> need

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
don't feel like you really need

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.740 
don't feel like you really need
toughness<00:02:57.549> so<00:02:57.730> much<00:02:57.970> with<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:58.299> gun<00:02:58.480> because

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
toughness so much with this gun because

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.210 
toughness so much with this gun because
you<00:02:58.900> are<00:02:59.049> going<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> be<00:02:59.350> allies<00:02:59.560> distance<00:03:00.070> most

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
you are going to be allies distance most

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.740 
you are going to be allies distance most
of<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> time<00:03:00.579> or<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.850> lose<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.359> should<00:03:01.570> be<00:03:01.720> i

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
of the time or you lose you should be i

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.259 
of the time or you lose you should be i
did<00:03:01.989> since<00:03:02.170> most<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.590> time<00:03:02.799> so<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.910> I

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
did since most of the time so and I

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.729 
did since most of the time so and I
don't<00:03:04.630> think<00:03:04.750> toughness<00:03:05.109> is<00:03:05.230> needed<00:03:05.590> and

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
don't think toughness is needed and

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.920 
don't think toughness is needed and
blast<00:03:06.010> oppressor<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:07.120> do<00:03:07.269> tend<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.720> use<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
blast oppressor and I do tend to use the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.750 
blast oppressor and I do tend to use the
XO<00:03:08.260> movements<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.709> lot<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.370> staying<00:03:09.579> off<00:03:09.730> the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
XO movements a lot so staying off the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.920 
XO movements a lot so staying off the
radar<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.209> definitely<00:03:10.600> someone<00:03:10.720> that's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
radar is definitely someone that's

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.430 
radar is definitely someone that's
really<00:03:11.170> going<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.350> help<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.620> out<00:03:11.650> there

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
really going to help you out there

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.110 
really going to help you out there
now<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.340> we've<00:03:13.430> done<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.640> perks<00:03:13.880> is

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
now that we've done the perks is

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.030 
now that we've done the perks is
obviously<00:03:14.420> just<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.780> kill<00:03:14.960> streak<00:03:15.230> left<00:03:15.560> and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
obviously just to kill streak left and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.220 
obviously just to kill streak left and
that<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.400> UAV<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.510> UAB<00:03:17.780> you'll<00:03:18.110> see

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
that is the UAV and the UAB you'll see

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.870 
that is the UAV and the UAB you'll see
me<00:03:18.290> use<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.590> in<00:03:18.800> pretty<00:03:18.980> much<00:03:19.070> every<00:03:19.430> game<00:03:19.610> play

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
me use it in pretty much every game play

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.610 
me use it in pretty much every game play
and<00:03:20.150> that's<00:03:20.600> recent<00:03:21.020> anyway<00:03:21.260> when<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.470> game

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
and that's recent anyway when the game

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.800 
and that's recent anyway when the game
first<00:03:21.650> came<00:03:21.920> out<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.160> didn't<00:03:22.490> just<00:03:22.700> use<00:03:22.760> UAV<00:03:23.300> why

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
first came out I didn't just use UAV why

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.290 
first came out I didn't just use UAV why
use<00:03:23.990> a<00:03:24.020> UAV<00:03:24.350> with<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.740> little<00:03:24.890> faster<00:03:25.730> faster

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
use a UAV with a little faster faster

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.940 
use a UAV with a little faster faster
scanning<00:03:26.510> speed<00:03:26.780> upgrade<00:03:27.440> which<00:03:27.740> is<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:27.890> think

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
scanning speed upgrade which is I think

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.890 
scanning speed upgrade which is I think
just<00:03:28.280> an<00:03:28.340> extra<00:03:28.610> 50<00:03:28.880> points<00:03:29.240> and<00:03:29.510> that<00:03:29.780> is

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
just an extra 50 points and that is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.360 
just an extra 50 points and that is
definitely<00:03:30.020> very<00:03:30.290> useful<00:03:30.800> you<00:03:30.920> can<00:03:30.980> cycle

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
definitely very useful you can cycle

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.070 
definitely very useful you can cycle
through<00:03:31.550> UAV<00:03:32.030> is<00:03:32.120> quite<00:03:32.300> quickly<00:03:32.540> even<00:03:32.900> if

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
through UAV is quite quickly even if

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.170 
through UAV is quite quickly even if
you're<00:03:33.200> playing<00:03:33.350> solo<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:34.550> that<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:34.910> helps

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
you're playing solo so that really helps

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.180 
you're playing solo so that really helps
you<00:03:35.270> to<00:03:35.330> build<00:03:35.510> up<00:03:35.630> some<00:03:35.750> streaks<00:03:36.140> so<00:03:37.070> yeah

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
you to build up some streaks so yeah

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.320 
you to build up some streaks so yeah
that's<00:03:37.280> pretty<00:03:37.370> much<00:03:37.550> everything<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.150> wanted

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
that's pretty much everything I wanted

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.210 
that's pretty much everything I wanted
to<00:03:38.450> go<00:03:38.600> over<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:39.140> did<00:03:39.380> die<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.830> down<00:03:39.980> for

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
to go over I did die just down for

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.010 
to go over I did die just down for
something<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:40.850> guys<00:03:41.090> enjoyed<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.540> video<00:03:41.630> make
