00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.710 

here<00:00:01.380> is<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.740> escalera<00:00:02.370> stare<00:00:02.790> cat<00:00:03.120> detached

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
here is the escalera stare cat detached

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.059 
here is the escalera stare cat detached
from<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.259> lift<00:00:04.500> attachment<00:00:06.410> with<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.440> dolly

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
from the lift attachment with the dolly

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.610 
from the lift attachment with the dolly
detach<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:09.150> reduces<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.870> weight<00:00:10.080> by<00:00:10.380> about

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
detach it reduces the weight by about

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.279 
detach it reduces the weight by about
half<00:00:11.389> this<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:13.530> lift<00:00:13.920> attachment<00:00:14.670> is

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
half this the lift attachment is

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.750 
half this the lift attachment is
probably<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.529> about<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:16.980> heavy<00:00:17.220> if<00:00:17.520> not

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
probably just about as heavy if not

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.140 
probably just about as heavy if not
heavier<00:00:18.300> than<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> escalera<00:00:19.230> itself<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> you

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
heavier than the escalera itself so you

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.439 
heavier than the escalera itself so you
can<00:00:21.600> detach<00:00:21.779> these<00:00:22.350> units<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.820> most

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
can detach these units for the most

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.450 
can detach these units for the most
versatility<00:00:25.320> depending<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.250> want

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
versatility depending on what you want

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.439 
versatility depending on what you want
to<00:00:26.519> haul<00:00:28.039> probably<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.429> something<00:00:29.640> fairly

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
to haul probably for something fairly

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.020 
to haul probably for something fairly
large<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.230> heavy<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> jukebox<00:00:32.690> or<00:00:33.690> piano

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
large and heavy like a jukebox or piano

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.540 
large and heavy like a jukebox or piano
probably<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.210> escalera<00:00:36.809> alone<00:00:37.370> would<00:00:38.370> be

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
probably the escalera alone would be

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.389 
probably the escalera alone would be
good<00:00:39.230> because<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.530> would<00:00:40.649> reduce<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.190> total

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
good because it would reduce the total

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.510 
good because it would reduce the total
weight<00:00:41.790> you're<00:00:42.420> having<00:00:42.989> hall<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.770> but

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
weight you're having hall with it but

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.830 
weight you're having hall with it but
for<00:00:44.700> something<00:00:45.410> smaller<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.579> TV<00:00:48.120> set<00:00:48.510> I

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
for something smaller like a TV set I

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.930 
for something smaller like a TV set I
think<00:00:49.829> it'd<00:00:49.950> probably<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.340> better<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.789> have

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
think it'd probably be better to have

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
think it'd probably be better to have
the<00:00:51.329> lift<00:00:51.899> attachment<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.739> give<00:00:52.890> some

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the lift attachment on to give some

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.119 
the lift attachment on to give some
extra<00:00:53.430> support<00:00:54.350> they<00:00:55.350> also<00:00:55.500> offer<00:00:55.890> an

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
extra support they also offer an

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.970 
extra support they also offer an
extension<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.940> top<00:00:57.270> plate<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:58.109> although

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
extension to the top plate here although

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.670 
extension to the top plate here although
this<00:00:59.160> would<00:00:59.370> probably<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.820> about<00:01:00.239> enough<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this would probably be about enough that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.130 
this would probably be about enough that
you<00:01:01.829> need<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:03.000> something<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.570> there<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
you need to get something on there and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.100 
you need to get something on there and
then<00:01:04.760> just<00:01:05.760> lean<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> back<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.540> against<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
then just lean it back up against the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.359 
then just lean it back up against the
dolly<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.810> these<00:01:09.810> surfaces<00:01:10.439> are<00:01:10.590> all<00:01:10.740> padded

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
dolly here these surfaces are all padded

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.219 
dolly here these surfaces are all padded
to<00:01:11.580> avoid<00:01:11.850> scratching<00:01:12.630> things<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.110> are

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to avoid scratching things that are

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.120 
to avoid scratching things that are
loaded<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> dolly<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.760> nice

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
loaded on the dolly which is really nice

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.520 
loaded on the dolly which is really nice
so<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.520> figured<00:01:17.729> out<00:01:18.060> how<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.659> detaches

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so I just figured out how this detaches

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.480 
so I just figured out how this detaches
it<00:01:20.000> slips<00:01:21.000> over<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.600> toe<00:01:21.840> plate<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.680> with

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
it slips over the toe plate here with

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.340 
it slips over the toe plate here with
these<00:01:23.670> two<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.270> hooks

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.720 

slips<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:28.530> over<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> put

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
slips right over there and then you put

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.930 
slips right over there and then you put
these<00:01:29.910> turnbuckles<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:31.490> put<00:01:32.490> these<00:01:32.640> little

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
these turnbuckles back put these little

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.640 
these turnbuckles back put these little
hooks<00:01:33.120> over<00:01:33.390> these<00:01:33.690> things<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.290> tighten

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
hooks over these things and tighten

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.650 
hooks over these things and tighten
these<00:01:34.830> up<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:36.510> to<00:01:37.320> attach<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.660> really

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
these up to to attach it to it I really

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.520 
these up to to attach it to it I really
wanted<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:41.450> combination<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.600> products

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
wanted to get a combination of products

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.750 
wanted to get a combination of products
with<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.010> will<00:01:44.070> give<00:01:44.280> me<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.550> most

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
with this it will give me the most

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.719 
with this it will give me the most
versatility<00:01:45.690> no<00:01:46.410> matter<00:01:46.650> what<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.010> needed<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
versatility no matter what I needed to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.110 
versatility no matter what I needed to
do<00:01:48.150> with<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.740> either<00:01:49.740> hauling<00:01:50.340> large<00:01:50.520> items<00:01:50.970> up

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
do with it either hauling large items up

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.740 
do with it either hauling large items up
the<00:01:51.240> stairs<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:52.220> just<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.270> fixed

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the stairs or just in a in a fixed

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.770 
the stairs or just in a in a fixed
position<00:01:55.550> being<00:01:56.550> able<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.970> crank<00:01:57.300> up<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
position being able to crank up and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.940 
position being able to crank up and
raise<00:01:58.380> up<00:01:58.770> loads<00:01:59.210> like<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.690> TV<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.470> instance

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
raise up loads like this TV for instance

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.510 
raise up loads like this TV for instance
to<00:02:02.400> get<00:02:02.550> it<00:02:02.670> at<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.850> good<00:02:03.090> working<00:02:03.360> height<00:02:04.520> and

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
to get it at a good working height and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.600 
to get it at a good working height and
here's<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.210> big<00:02:06.420> wheel<00:02:06.690> attachment<00:02:07.610> which

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
here's the big wheel attachment which

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.410 
here's the big wheel attachment which
clips<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.380> here<00:02:10.380> clips<00:02:10.739> onto<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.220> back<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
clips on here clips onto the back to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.820 
clips on here clips onto the back to
make<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.750> easier<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.320> roll<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:15.660> outdoors<00:02:16.410> for

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
make it easier to roll like outdoors for

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.640 
make it easier to roll like outdoors for
instance<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.780> i<00:02:18.810> think<00:02:18.930> i'll<00:02:19.200> go<00:02:19.380> ahead<00:02:19.410> and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
instance so i think i'll go ahead and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.490 
instance so i think i'll go ahead and
reassemble<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.610> back<00:02:20.850> together<00:02:21.090> now<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.959> just

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
reassemble it back together now I just

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.470 
reassemble it back together now I just
wanted<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> demonstrate<00:02:23.220> how<00:02:23.910> these<00:02:24.180> two

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
wanted to demonstrate how these two

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.540 
wanted to demonstrate how these two
components<00:02:24.900> come<00:02:25.380> apart<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.070> i<00:02:26.100> think<00:02:26.340> this

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
components come apart and i think this

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.310 
components come apart and i think this
setup<00:02:26.940> gives<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.660> most<00:02:28.500> flexibility
