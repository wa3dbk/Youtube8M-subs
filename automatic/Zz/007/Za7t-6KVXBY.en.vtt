you're a beginner at drop beading you
may<00:00:31.000> want<00:00:31.270> to<00:00:31.330> go<00:00:31.450> with<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.690> 24<00:00:32.200> gauge<00:00:32.440> because

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
may want to go with the 24 gauge because

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.650

loop<00:01:22.270> instead<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.720> doing<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.990> wrapped<00:01:23.290> loop<00:01:23.470> for

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
loop instead of doing a wrapped loop for

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.710 
loop instead of doing a wrapped loop for
here<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:24.730> now<00:01:24.880> I'm<00:01:24.940> going<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.180> take<00:01:25.330> this<00:01:25.480> eye

reposition your pliers down to the bead
create<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> loop<00:02:23.139> and<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.439> is<00:02:23.650> what<00:02:23.829> we<00:02:23.920> call<00:02:24.069> a

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
create a loop and this is what we call a

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.260 
create a loop and this is what we call a
rosary<00:02:24.459> loop

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
rosary loop

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.790 
rosary loop
now<00:02:26.690> what<00:02:26.870> I'm<00:02:26.960> going<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.140> do<00:02:27.230> with<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.410> rosary

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
now what I'm going to do with the rosary

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.830 
now what I'm going to do with the rosary
loop<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.160> I'm<00:02:28.310> going<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.520> open<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.030> because<00:02:29.570> now

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
loop is I'm going to open it because now

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.390 
loop is I'm going to open it because now
we've<00:02:30.020> got<00:02:30.230> another<00:02:30.590> loop<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:31.100> like<00:02:31.190> we<00:02:31.280> do

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
we've got another loop just like we do

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.650 
we've got another loop just like we do
on<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.610> bottom<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.000> soppy<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.450> I'm<00:02:32.540> going

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
on the bottom of the soppy and I'm going

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.990 
on the bottom of the soppy and I'm going

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
to open it away or toward you however

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.240 
to open it away or toward you however
you<00:02:35.270> want<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.720> do<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.410> I'm<00:02:36.800> going<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:36.980> slip

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
you want to do it and I'm going to slip

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.160 
you want to do it and I'm going to slip
on<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.670> loop<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.300> toggle<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:40.840> then<00:02:41.840> we'll

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
on the loop of the toggle and then we'll

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:53.240 
on the loop of the toggle and then we'll
close<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.800> loop

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.000 

now<00:02:54.090> we've<00:02:54.270> got<00:02:54.450> our<00:02:54.600> toggle<00:02:54.810> at<00:02:55.590> least<00:02:55.800> one

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
now we've got our toggle at least one

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.370 
now we've got our toggle at least one
end<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.250> our<00:02:56.340> taco<00:02:56.550> connected<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.270> our<00:02:57.420> chain

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
end of our taco connected to our chain

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.020 
end of our taco connected to our chain
and<00:02:58.650> I'm<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.370> repeat<00:02:59.640> for<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.850> other

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
and I'm you just repeat for the other

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.980 
and I'm you just repeat for the other
end<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:01.280> think<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.550> do<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:03.000> I'm<00:03:03.870> going

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
end I think I'm going to do is I'm going

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.050 
end I think I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:03:04.050> find<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.440> center<00:03:04.740> of<00:03:04.950> my<00:03:05.490> bracelet<00:03:05.910> no

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
to find the center of my bracelet no

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.440 
to find the center of my bracelet no
this<00:03:06.270> is<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.750> way<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.410> now<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.450> not

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
this is just the way I do it now and not

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.930 
this is just the way I do it now and not
much<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.960> symmetry<00:03:10.650> but<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.550> start<00:03:11.850> off

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
much on symmetry but just to start off

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.710 
much on symmetry but just to start off
with<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.450> will<00:03:13.020> do<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.590> center<00:03:14.340> point<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.690> I

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
with I will do a center point and so I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.480 
with I will do a center point and so I
found<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.260> center<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.650> my<00:03:16.770> bracelet<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.310> is

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490

going to take my pliers put directly
atop<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.550> last<00:03:56.790> bead<00:03:57.120> I'm<00:03:57.660> going<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.050> bend<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
atop the last bead I'm going to bend the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.750 
atop the last bead I'm going to bend the
wire<00:03:58.680> over<00:03:59.070> at<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.850> right<00:04:00.060> angle<00:04:01.640> reposition<00:04:02.640> my

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
wire over at a right angle reposition my

pliers<00:04:03.110> bring<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.260> wire<00:04:04.440> over<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.070> top<00:04:05.340> of

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
pliers bring the wire over the top of

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.030 
pliers bring the wire over the top of
the<00:04:05.610> plier<00:04:06.080> until<00:04:07.080> I've<00:04:07.170> started<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.709> form<00:04:07.950> a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
the plier until I've started to form a

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.940 
the plier until I've started to form a
loop<00:04:08.220> now<00:04:09.000> I'm<00:04:09.090> going<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.300> take<00:04:09.540> this<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.260> slip

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
loop now I'm going to take this and slip

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.560 
loop now I'm going to take this and slip
it<00:04:11.100> into<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:12.350> center<00:04:14.180> link<00:04:17.209> then<00:04:18.209> I'm<00:04:18.359> going

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
it into that center link then I'm going

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.640 
it into that center link then I'm going
to<00:04:18.630> finish<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.470> wrap<00:04:20.930> so<00:04:21.930> I'm<00:04:22.049> going<00:04:22.290> to<00:04:22.350> take

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
to finish the wrap so I'm going to take

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.540 
to finish the wrap so I'm going to take
it<00:04:23.419> bring<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.540> around<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:25.110> bottom<00:04:28.310> I'm<00:04:29.310> going

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
it bring it around the bottom I'm going

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.320 
it bring it around the bottom I'm going
to<00:04:29.640> grasp<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.360> loop<00:04:32.960> bring<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.110> wire<00:04:34.290> around

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
to grasp the loop bring the wire around

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.429 
to grasp the loop bring the wire around
continue<00:04:36.330> wrapping

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439

down to the bead and then I'm going to

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:46.879 
down to the bead and then I'm going to
trim<00:04:45.479> the<00:04:45.659> excess<00:04:45.989> wire<00:04:46.139> with<00:04:46.589> the<00:04:46.709> nipper

I<00:04:54.449> generally<00:04:55.229> will<00:04:55.949> start<00:04:56.309> from<00:04:56.459> the<00:04:56.610> center

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
I generally will start from the center

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.149 
I generally will start from the center
and<00:04:57.059> work<00:04:57.119> my<00:04:57.479> way<00:04:57.659> out<00:04:57.929> and<00:04:58.259> that's<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:59.069> a

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
and work my way out and that's just a

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.839 
and work my way out and that's just a
preference<00:05:00.349> and<00:05:01.349> I'll<00:05:01.469> many<00:05:02.159> times<00:05:02.459> I'll<00:05:02.669> just

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:02.849 
preference and I'll many times I'll just

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.229 
preference and I'll many times I'll just
start<00:05:03.119> counting<00:05:03.419> links<00:05:04.110> as<00:05:04.289> to<00:05:05.219> where<00:05:05.909> I<00:05:05.939> want

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:06.239 
start counting links as to where I want

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:07.879 
start counting links as to where I want
to<00:05:06.389> start<00:05:06.599> spacing<00:05:07.139> them<00:05:07.289> and<00:05:07.529> putting<00:05:07.769> them

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
to start spacing them and putting them

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.040 
to start spacing them and putting them
in<00:05:08.219> this<00:05:08.639> case<00:05:08.879> I'll<00:05:09.089> probably<00:05:09.330> just<00:05:09.689> skip<00:05:10.019> a

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
in this case I'll probably just skip a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.519 
in this case I'll probably just skip a
link<00:05:10.379> and<00:05:10.619> then<00:05:10.769> add<00:05:11.009> another<00:05:11.219> drop<00:05:12.169> so<00:05:13.169> I<00:05:13.199> will

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:13.529 
link and then add another drop so I will

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:15.199 
link and then add another drop so I will
again<00:05:13.829> demonstrate<00:05:14.429> how<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.639> do<00:05:14.879> the<00:05:14.909> drop

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:15.209 
again demonstrate how to do the drop

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:18.139 
again demonstrate how to do the drop
beating<00:05:15.569> and<00:05:15.719> then<00:05:16.409> we<00:05:17.339> will<00:05:17.550> give<00:05:17.999> you<00:05:18.089> a

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:18.149 
beating and then we will give you a

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:19.759 
beating and then we will give you a
close-up<00:05:18.599> shot<00:05:18.629> so<00:05:18.989> you<00:05:19.019> can<00:05:19.110> see<00:05:19.409> how<00:05:19.589> I've

three millimeter at the bottom of the

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.279 
three millimeter at the bottom of the
head<00:05:41.999> pin<00:05:42.149> before<00:05:42.509> the<00:05:42.599> bead<00:05:42.719> cap<00:05:42.929> just<00:05:43.139> to

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
head pin before the bead cap just to

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.219 
head pin before the bead cap just to
keep<00:05:43.499> just<00:05:43.800> in<00:05:43.949> case<00:05:44.129> the<00:05:44.279> bead<00:05:44.429> cap<00:05:44.699> is<00:05:45.229> hole

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
keep just in case the bead cap is hole

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.259 
keep just in case the bead cap is hole
is<00:05:46.529> too<00:05:46.740> large<00:05:46.979> for<00:05:47.099> the<00:05:47.339> head<00:05:47.459> pin<00:05:47.639> so<00:05:48.209> I'm

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:48.269 
is too large for the head pin so I'm

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:50.569 
is too large for the head pin so I'm
going<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.479> load<00:05:48.719> the<00:05:48.990> three<00:05:49.259> millimeter<00:05:49.679> the

going to load the three millimeter the

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:52.459 
going to load the three millimeter the
bead<00:05:50.759> cap<00:05:50.999> and<00:05:51.029> in<00:05:51.240> this<00:05:51.329> case<00:05:51.599> I'm<00:05:51.809> only<00:05:51.990> doing

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
bead cap and in this case I'm only doing

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.439 
bead cap and in this case I'm only doing
one<00:05:52.769> bead<00:05:53.279> cap<00:05:53.550> per<00:05:53.759> crystal<00:05:54.209> and<00:05:54.360> I'm

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
one bead cap per crystal and I'm

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.329 
one bead cap per crystal and I'm
alternating<00:05:55.199> them<00:05:55.319> so<00:05:55.529> if<00:05:55.619> I<00:05:55.679> use<00:05:55.889> one<00:05:55.919> on<00:05:56.219> the

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:56.339 
alternating them so if I use one on the

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:57.889 
alternating them so if I use one on the
bottom<00:05:56.729> then<00:05:56.879> the<00:05:56.909> next<00:05:57.240> one<00:05:57.419> I<00:05:57.449> use<00:05:57.689> on<00:05:57.869> the

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:57.899 
bottom then the next one I use on the

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.439 
bottom then the next one I use on the
top<00:05:58.399> okay<00:05:59.399> now<00:05:59.550> that<00:05:59.699> I've<00:05:59.789> got<00:05:59.969> the<00:06:00.119> head<00:06:00.269> pin

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
top okay now that I've got the head pin

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.480

next turn and now I'm going to add it to
the<00:06:22.259> chain<00:06:22.589> and<00:06:22.909> I'm<00:06:23.909> going<00:06:24.329> to<00:06:24.419> skip<00:06:24.929> two

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379 
the chain and I'm going to skip two

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:27.939 
the chain and I'm going to skip two
links<00:06:25.860> or<00:06:26.069> put<00:06:26.550> it<00:06:26.639> on<00:06:26.729> the<00:06:26.849> second<00:06:27.239> link<00:06:27.389> here

from the center just slip it through the
chain<00:06:34.610> and<00:06:35.610> then<00:06:35.879> you're<00:06:36.059> going<00:06:36.149> to<00:06:36.209> close

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
chain and then you're going to close

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.329 
chain and then you're going to close
your<00:06:36.779> rep<00:06:36.989> so<00:06:37.319> you're<00:06:37.439> going<00:06:37.589> to<00:06:37.649> grasp<00:06:37.919> your

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:38.339 
your rep so you're going to grasp your

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:41.620 
your rep so you're going to grasp your
loop

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.750

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
start rapping I like to rap until it

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.030 
start rapping I like to rap until it
reaches<00:06:47.180> the<00:06:47.210> top<00:06:47.570> of<00:06:47.600> the<00:06:47.870> crystal<00:06:48.140> or<00:06:48.650> beads

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
reaches the top of the crystal or beads

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.340 
reaches the top of the crystal or beads
and<00:06:49.340> in<00:06:50.120> some<00:06:50.360> cases<00:06:50.570> I'll<00:06:50.870> bring<00:06:51.050> it<00:06:51.200> down

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:51.350 
and in some cases I'll bring it down

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.600 
and in some cases I'll bring it down
just<00:06:51.380> a<00:06:51.650> little<00:06:51.680> further<00:06:52.040> so<00:06:52.340> you<00:06:52.430> get<00:06:52.580> a

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
just a little further so you get a

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.390 
just a little further so you get a
little<00:06:52.850> bit<00:06:52.910> of<00:06:53.030> a<00:06:53.120> coil<00:06:53.390> on<00:06:53.570> top<00:06:53.890> till<00:06:54.890> you<00:06:55.010> get

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
little bit of a coil on top till you get

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.140 
little bit of a coil on top till you get
where<00:06:55.700> you<00:06:56.170> like<00:06:57.170> it<00:06:57.200> and<00:06:57.620> then<00:06:58.460> trim<00:06:58.880> it<00:06:58.910> with

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
where you like it and then trim it with

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.990 
where you like it and then trim it with
the<00:06:59.240> nipper<00:06:59.420> tool<00:07:02.920> again<00:07:03.920> for<00:07:04.550> design

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
the nipper tool again for design

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.850 
the nipper tool again for design
purposes<00:07:05.510> and<00:07:05.690> this<00:07:05.780> is<00:07:05.960> just<00:07:06.140> how<00:07:06.260> I<00:07:06.470> like<00:07:06.830> to

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
purposes and this is just how I like to

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.620 
purposes and this is just how I like to
do<00:07:07.130> them<00:07:07.300> I'm<00:07:08.300> going<00:07:08.420> to<00:07:08.480> put<00:07:08.720> another<00:07:08.840> one<00:07:10.630> on

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.990 
do them I'm going to put another one on
the<00:07:11.840> other<00:07:11.870> side<00:07:12.050> of<00:07:12.230> the<00:07:12.440> center<00:07:13.000> skipping

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
the other side of the center skipping

the other side of the center skipping
two<00:07:14.180> links<00:07:14.540> and<00:07:14.720> then<00:07:15.080> for<00:07:15.800> pattern<00:07:16.280> reasons<00:07:16.820> I

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
two links and then for pattern reasons I

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.270 
two links and then for pattern reasons I
usually<00:07:17.330> will<00:07:17.660> go<00:07:17.810> ahead<00:07:17.900> in<00:07:18.380> this<00:07:18.800> case<00:07:19.070> I'm

if you want to add more beads then
obviously<00:07:35.000> you<00:07:35.330> wouldn't<00:07:35.570> need<00:07:35.630> any<00:07:35.870> spaces

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.290 
obviously you wouldn't need any spaces

obviously you wouldn't need any spaces
in<00:07:36.410> between<00:07:36.440> here<00:07:36.980> and<00:07:37.010> you<00:07:37.160> can<00:07:37.280> even<00:07:37.460> do<00:07:37.640> them

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760 
in between here and you can even do them

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 
on both sides of the chain but this is

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.040 
on both sides of the chain but this is
just<00:07:40.010> a<00:07:40.100> little<00:07:40.400> basic<00:07:40.820> drop<00:07:41.600> beading
