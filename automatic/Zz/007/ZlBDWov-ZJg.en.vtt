00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.130
 first max 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.810
 the fragrance of diesel does not have that 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.410
 ax effect neither in women nor at 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.349
 men 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.360
 certainly not with elegant ones 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.550
 Italian gran turismo gt gros 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.010
 Turismo that used to be in 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.019
 the big wide world had a breeze 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.080
 of rich and beautiful by marcello 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:27.710
 mastroianni and claudia cardinale of 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.390
 sun beach and dolce vita one of my 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.220
 My favorite thing is still that 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.960
 beautiful old bertone coupe 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.240
 the master did a few years ago 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.879
 put his wand back on and 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.629
 came out this beautiful 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.690
 car here 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.989
 the alfa gt times to see if the dreisatz 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.239
 diesel bertone and just works 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.000
 or whether he harmonizes as well as heino 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.860
 and the Milan scala shows from the front 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.510
 he already has a good character 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.000
 the classic snout with the 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.489
 scudetto the narrow headlights and 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.680
 The celebrated bonnet coupes are yes 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.170
 many as many as pretty 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.640
 average designer of the gt acts 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.560
 although he's been up for a couple of years already 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.050
 the brisk booklet still very much 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.890
 elegant and that is of course due to the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.090
 raised parts and the flat 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.770
 elongated roof the bananas 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.660
 Taillights are sitting on this beefy 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.120
 tail as well as cleverly cut 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.330
 bags on a tight jeans as I said 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.350
 the gt is not quite dewy anymore 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.270
 still an absolute one 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.460
 Looked at and above all nobody 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.730
 Now he knows that is expensive or 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.730
 Not 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.130
 the gt is based on the old 156 and yes 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.990
 to buy a copy is indeed synonymous 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.340
 always a belly decision that is 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.830
 In this case, you better not 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.009
 because in here it is tight as in 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.340
 a tailored suit you get the fancier 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.100
 line but of course less car 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.259
 for more money and back there you want 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.299
 not even two little Italians 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.000
 The fittings are like that 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.009
 one would expect from alpha and sporty 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.049
 the processing is really 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.799
 first class in here but in one 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.530
 bertone 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.660
 there simply belongs more wood and chrome 1 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.660
 like parmesan on the pasta 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.030
 accelerate here on the up 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.400
 highway you already notice the nail salon 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.780
 there is no under the hood 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.910
 absolutely everyone's thing 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.040
 certainly not from a real alpha 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.280
 male that is of the typical 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.900
 alfajores as far away as a haflinger 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:39.000
 from a lipizzaner but from 2000 tours 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:42.660
 the 1.9 jtd pure as bud spencer 150 ps 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.150
 and 350 newton meters put the gt in 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.940
 move and that pretty ponto though 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.420
 above, the performance becomes soft then 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.790
 too long boiled noodles are 209 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.980
 on the highway with the alfa gt in it 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.100
 but you should rather do something 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.660
 take on piano because from 180 will 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.710
 you pour through it like a 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.710
 martini in the shaker 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.910
 on the highway the gt shows water 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.340
 despite front-wheel drive he has here too 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.050
 the curves always full traction ours 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.880
 model that probably does that too 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.980
 good has another addition 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.580
 locking differential on the front axle 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.830
 what amazes me is how exactly the in 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.260
 the customer hall also mentions exactly 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.870
 the curves through rushes that he does 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.060
 really great he also throws himself 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.120
 really joyful at a curve 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.330
 and he really has grip in all turns 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.910
 Even if he was at the turn entrance 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.950
 likes to show how a capri fischer im 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.060
 storm but that stabilizes then 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.490
 quite fast 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.010
 The steering is very smooth 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.690
 Nevertheless, there is still enough feedback 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.630
 what's out there on the street 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.310
 so happens with a few movement leaves 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.650
 The dare here very well 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.530
 check and also at load changes 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.480
 in the bend that did not turn on that 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.940
 I like six-speed transmissions well 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.610
 here you change the gears as well 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.459
 like heinz carla bruni like your men 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.680
 the gt synonymous if he already on particle 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.930
 his chic hump has quite 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.390
 still its delight however the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.970
 combination with the 1.9 liter large 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.010
 diesel does not quite work that way 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.170
 would definitely have a stronger 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.560
 I would say yes 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.240
 Coupe and this is because there is also 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.539
 after all, the technology of champagne 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.539
 brimful 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.640
 Max
