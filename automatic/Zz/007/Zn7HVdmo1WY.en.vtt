they<00:01:47.540> are<00:01:47.750> rubber<00:01:48.080> not<00:01:48.530> plastic<00:01:49.010> so<00:01:49.280> they're

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
they are rubber not plastic so they're

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.340 
they are rubber not plastic so they're
going<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.730> be<00:01:49.820> perfect<00:01:50.180> on<00:01:50.630> your<00:01:50.810> hard<00:01:50.990> floors

the<00:01:53.690> really<00:01:54.080> amazing<00:01:54.350> technology<00:01:55.100> here<00:01:55.340> is

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
the really amazing technology here is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.110 
the really amazing technology here is
this<00:01:55.610> rotor<00:01:55.970> blade<00:01:56.300> it's<00:01:56.930> it's<00:01:57.890> layers<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.760> or

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
this rotor blade it's it's layers of or

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.899 
this rotor blade it's it's layers of or
sections<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.900> rubber<00:02:00.560> bands<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.580> run

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
sections of rubber bands that run

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.600 
sections of rubber bands that run
through<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.510> that<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:03.050> what<00:02:03.290> brings<00:02:03.590> all<00:02:04.040> of

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
through and that is what brings all of

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.840 
through and that is what brings all of
the<00:02:04.850> debris<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.650> canisters<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.250> hold

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
the debris in to the canisters that hold

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.729 
the debris in to the canisters that hold
the<00:02:08.330> waste<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:08.869> you're<00:02:08.989> looking<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.289> pick<00:02:09.590> up

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
the waste that you're looking to pick up

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.429 
the waste that you're looking to pick up
so<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.459> is<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.610> really<00:02:11.239> incredible<00:02:11.390> motion<00:02:12.230> you

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
so it is a really incredible motion you

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:12.900 
so it is a really incredible motion you
wouldn't

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
wouldn't

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.100 
wouldn't
that<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.330> do<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.750> can<00:02:13.840> do<00:02:13.930> I'm<00:02:13.990> going

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
that it can do what it can do I'm going

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.720 
that it can do what it can do I'm going

you've got two little canisters quite

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.700 
you've got two little canisters quite
large<00:02:19.270> canisters<00:02:19.930> actually<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.470> side

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
large canisters actually on the side

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
vacuum cleaner already sometimes there's

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.280 
vacuum cleaner already sometimes there's
some<00:02:31.990> little<00:02:32.550> handheld<00:02:33.550> type<00:02:34.480> devices<00:02:35.110> that

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
some little handheld type devices that

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.440 
some little handheld type devices that
are<00:02:35.380> powered<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:36.520> generally<00:02:37.000> find<00:02:37.240> that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
are powered you generally find that

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.750 
are powered you generally find that

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
right when you need to use it it's run

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.070 
right when you need to use it it's run
out<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.970> batteries<00:02:40.480> then<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.900> to

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
out of batteries then you have to

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.050 
out of batteries then you have to
recharge<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.710> again<00:02:41.800> you'll<00:02:42.160> never<00:02:42.400> have<00:02:42.820> to

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
recharge it again you'll never have to

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.780 
recharge it again you'll never have to
do<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:43.900> unit<00:02:44.350> because<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:45.220> is<00:02:45.460> run

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
do that with this unit because it is run

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.790 
do that with this unit because it is run
fuelie<00:02:46.270> with<00:02:46.420> those<00:02:46.660> rotor<00:02:46.960> blades<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.500> not

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
fuelie with those rotor blades and not

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.130 
fuelie with those rotor blades and not
with<00:02:48.010> power<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.550> me<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.780> great

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
with power so to me that that is a great

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.320 
with power so to me that that is a great
thing<00:02:50.350> you're<00:02:50.530> getting<00:02:50.620> all<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.760> benefits

you bit a little bit arthritic perhaps
and<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.940> find<00:03:07.240> that<00:03:07.360> these<00:03:07.510> things<00:03:07.720> are

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
and you find that these things are

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.810 
and you find that these things are
difficult<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.380> manage<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.400> light

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
difficult to manage this is so light

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.840 
difficult to manage this is so light
it's<00:03:10.510> really<00:03:11.080> easy<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.500> use<00:03:11.830> it's<00:03:12.430> going<00:03:12.730> to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
it's really easy to use it's going to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.210 
it's really easy to use it's going to
suck<00:03:13.060> up<00:03:13.210> anything<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.190> want

and<00:03:15.640> as<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.120> can<00:03:16.240> see<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:17.080> little<00:03:17.350> brushes<00:03:17.740> on

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
and as you can see the little brushes on

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.000 
and as you can see the little brushes on
the<00:03:17.920> side<00:03:18.250> also<00:03:18.970> serve<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.480> drag<00:03:20.020> that<00:03:20.440> in<00:03:20.650> and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
the side also serve to drag that in and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.650 
the side also serve to drag that in and
they're<00:03:21.670> going<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.940> pick<00:03:22.090> up<00:03:22.240> some<00:03:22.450> additional

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
they're going to pick up some additional

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.120 
they're going to pick up some additional
fluff<00:03:23.140> as<00:03:23.320> well<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.620> then<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.740> can<00:03:23.980> just

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
fluff as well and then you can just

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.740 
fluff as well and then you can just
discard<00:03:24.550> that<00:03:24.760> into<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.150> bin<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.510> it's<00:03:25.660> a

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
discard that into the bin so it's a
