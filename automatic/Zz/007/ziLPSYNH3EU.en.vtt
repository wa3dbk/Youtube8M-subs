wasn't<00:00:40.449> so<00:00:40.570> sure<00:00:40.600> about<00:00:40.809> it<00:00:41.080> when<00:00:41.320> I<00:00:41.350> saw<00:00:41.589> it<00:00:41.710> in

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
wasn't so sure about it when I saw it in

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.740 
wasn't so sure about it when I saw it in
pictures<00:00:41.980> but<00:00:42.400> now<00:00:42.550> seeing<00:00:42.850> it<00:00:42.970> in<00:00:43.059> person<00:00:43.269> I

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
pictures but now seeing it in person I

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.740 
pictures but now seeing it in person I
am<00:00:44.559> amazed<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.339> I<00:00:45.970> would<00:00:46.089> normally<00:00:46.210> start<00:00:46.690> off

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
am amazed and I would normally start off

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.299 
am amazed and I would normally start off
with<00:00:46.900> the<00:00:46.960> window<00:00:47.199> sticker<00:00:47.410> but<00:00:47.769> this<00:00:47.949> one<00:00:48.129> has

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
with the window sticker but this one has

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.770 
with the window sticker but this one has
no<00:00:48.640> window<00:00:48.970> sticker<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.510> be<00:00:49.659> seen<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:51.780> there's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
no window sticker to be seen so there's

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.029 
no window sticker to be seen so there's
probably<00:00:52.899> a<00:00:53.110> reason<00:00:53.140> for<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:53.739> I<00:00:53.800> guarantee

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039
