00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
I'm just blending it in in within that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
I'm just blending it in in within that
area<00:00:48.239> I'm<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.690> spreading<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.410> around<00:00:49.710> too

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
area I'm not spreading it around too

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.430 
area I'm not spreading it around too
much<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:52.020> whole<00:00:52.199> point<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> contouring<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
much the whole point of contouring is to

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.029 
much the whole point of contouring is to
create<00:00:55.440> definition<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.789> face<00:00:57.770> so<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> good

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
create definition in the face so a good

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.619 
create definition in the face so a good
idea<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.699> after<00:01:00.090> you've<00:01:00.210> blended<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.570> in

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
idea here after you've blended that in

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.750 
idea here after you've blended that in
would<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.230> be<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:02.219> we're<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
would just be because we're going to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.910 
would just be because we're going to
contour<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.570> powder<00:01:03.870> product<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.739> just

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
contour with a powder product would just

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.560 
contour with a powder product would just
be<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.159> dust<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.580> tiny<00:01:05.760> bit<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> face<00:01:06.299> powder

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
be to dust a tiny bit of face powder

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.490 
be to dust a tiny bit of face powder
over<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> top

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.110 

so<00:01:16.500> now<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.830> taking<00:01:17.160> a<00:01:17.220> Clarins<00:01:17.700> matte

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
so now I'm taking a Clarins matte

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.260 
so now I'm taking a Clarins matte
bronzer<00:01:19.220> all<00:01:20.220> I'm<00:01:20.460> doing<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.790> taking<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:21.150> little

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
bronzer all I'm doing is taking a little

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.070 
bronzer all I'm doing is taking a little
bit<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.870> brush<00:01:22.050> and<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:22.950> applying

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
bit on the brush and I'm just applying

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.720 
bit on the brush and I'm just applying
underneath<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.380> strokes<00:01:25.860> underneath<00:01:26.520> my

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
underneath in strokes underneath my

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.720 
underneath in strokes underneath my
cheekbone<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.390> I'm<00:01:28.230> using<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.800> small<00:01:28.830> angled

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
cheekbone and I'm using a small angled

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.700 
cheekbone and I'm using a small angled
blusher<00:01:30.060> brush<00:01:30.300> to<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.660> this<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.530> will

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
blusher brush to do this this will

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
blusher brush to do this this will
create<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.220> illusion<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.760> my<00:01:33.090> cheekbones

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
create the illusion that my cheekbones

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
create the illusion that my cheekbones
are<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:34.050> defined<00:01:34.230> than<00:01:34.740> they<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.210> matte

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
are more defined than they are matte

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.480 
are more defined than they are matte
colors<00:01:36.600> are<00:01:36.780> better<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.590> contouring<00:01:38.100> I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
colors are better for contouring I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
colors are better for contouring I
wouldn't<00:01:38.790> use<00:01:38.940> shimmer<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.080> draw

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
wouldn't use shimmer as you will draw

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
wouldn't use shimmer as you will draw
attention<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.640> area<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.330> we're

attention to the area and what we're
trying<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.810> do<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.050> create<00:01:43.230> depth

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610

a<00:03:12.760> smaller<00:03:13.090> fluffier<00:03:13.690> brush<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.350> I'm<00:03:14.500> just

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
a smaller fluffier brush and I'm just

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.850 
a smaller fluffier brush and I'm just
contouring<00:03:16.560> around<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.740> bridge<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.100> my<00:03:18.130> nose

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.610 
contouring around the bridge of my nose
this<00:03:20.860> is<00:03:21.040> always<00:03:21.250> good<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.670> practice<00:03:21.850> before

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
this is always good to practice before

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.990 
this is always good to practice before
you<00:03:23.620> actually<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.280> before<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.760> go<00:03:24.880> out

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
you actually do it before you go out

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.850 
you actually do it before you go out
just<00:03:25.210> in<00:03:25.360> case<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.750> have<00:03:25.900> any<00:03:26.080> mistakes<00:03:26.470> or<00:03:26.680> go

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
just in case you have any mistakes or go

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.270 
just in case you have any mistakes or go
too<00:03:26.920> heavy<00:03:27.520> but<00:03:28.300> again<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:29.470> can<00:03:29.620> always<00:03:29.980> blend

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
too heavy but again you can always blend

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.540 
too heavy but again you can always blend
it<00:03:30.460> away<00:03:30.840> or<00:03:31.840> even<00:03:32.320> just<00:03:32.650> start<00:03:32.860> again

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
it away or even just start again

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.300 
it away or even just start again
so<00:03:35.510> again<00:03:35.810> I'm<00:03:35.990> just<00:03:36.020> going<00:03:36.170> in<00:03:36.500> really<00:03:36.770> subtly

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
so again I'm just going in really subtly

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:55.720 
so again I'm just going in really subtly
here<00:03:38.200> for<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.230> bit<00:03:39.410> more<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:40.010> defined<00:03:40.370> nose

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.260

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
I'm just going in on top of the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.559 
I'm just going in on top of the
cheekbones<00:04:01.459> where<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:01.730> really<00:04:02.120> want<00:04:02.300> them<00:04:02.390> to

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
cheekbones where I really want them to

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.350 
cheekbones where I really want them to
stand<00:04:02.840> out<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:04.310> we're<00:04:04.430> using<00:04:04.610> light<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.090> dark

stand out so we're using light and dark

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.890 
stand out so we're using light and dark
to<00:04:06.580> create<00:04:07.580> definition<00:04:08.030> in<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.300> face<00:04:10.900> I'm

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900

just dabbing that just a tiny bit along
the<00:04:14.480> brow<00:04:14.720> bone<00:04:14.989> on<00:04:15.260> top<00:04:15.319> of<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.370> cheekbone

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760

where I want the eye to be drawn to this
is<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.910> really<00:04:20.239> good<00:04:20.359> way<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.720> giving<00:04:20.989> round<00:04:21.260> or
