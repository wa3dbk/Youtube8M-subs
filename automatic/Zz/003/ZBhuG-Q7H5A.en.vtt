00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 q or bono welcome cgf g and yes I you 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.549
 welcome for his new 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.839
 video today it's the draw at 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.799
 out of our game the way to y so we 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.929
 remind you of the world there was 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.820
 full of gifts to win including five 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.650
 nice gifts and we want to make a draw 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.820
 lots of early May and inevitably I 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.350
 am on the fluff because some 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.510
 will have understood it next week 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.160
 go to japan from 12 to 17 for the show it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.230
 and japan especially dedicated to 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.789
 Japanese smartphones but it was a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.769
 small relatively nice video 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.970
 so that we can think like you 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.199
 like me you have to tell you but 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.070
 what can we see there 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.359
 so certainly it 's not going to be 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.640
 smartphones that are meant for your 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.570
 market but what has seen 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.680
 guys they have ten years of advanced 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.420
 what are we going to lose there so 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.950
 you will be soon and after we will do 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.840
 for those who will decide our 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.280
 guide plus we will make videos that are 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.510
 especially dedicated to travel and after 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.710
 especially in Japan we will try to find 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.910
 someone would be nice to do some 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.980
 cool videos a little slick medley 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.940
 well good draw we are I am 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.410
 really fuck you'll get it 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.399
 understood because I take a little 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.620
 advanced for his videos so there 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.000
 today I'm taking this week these 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.140
 two videos a day to get one 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.760

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.379
 normally deep sea you have monday 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.030
 Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday value of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.340
 videos of the tests so it's not bad contract 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.229
 to come back and then after Japan's 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.479
 take a new rhythm of videos with 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.590
 we have seen things that will change 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.479
 it's light but things that change 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.680
 then do the draw and that is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.260

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.350
