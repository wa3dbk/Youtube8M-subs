using this brush you know as opposed to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.729 
using this brush you know as opposed to
the<00:00:46.379> Caesar<00:00:46.710> brush<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> thing<00:00:49.110> I've<00:00:49.289> notice

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the Caesar brush the thing I've notice

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.340 
the Caesar brush the thing I've notice
is<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.710> peak<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> brush<00:00:53.899> on<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> crown

brush<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.949> opposed<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.850> peak<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
brush as opposed to the peak on the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.349 
brush as opposed to the peak on the
Caesar<00:00:57.690> brush<00:00:58.100> there's<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.430> sharper<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.210> lot
