00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
had ever heard of and that led to a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.120 
had ever heard of and that led to a
four-year<00:01:27.830> research<00:01:28.460> project<00:01:29.060> that

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
four-year research project that

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.290 
four-year research project that
culminating<00:01:31.130> has<00:01:31.399> come<00:01:31.610> in<00:01:31.759> any<00:01:31.940> in<00:01:32.179> the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
culminating has come in any in the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.090 
culminating has come in any in the
recording<00:01:32.690> you're<00:01:33.020> going<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.259> make

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.830 

our<00:01:40.100> understanding<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:40.970> he<00:01:41.420> performed

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
our understanding is that he performed

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.830 
our understanding is that he performed
it<00:01:41.960> once<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.470> then<00:01:43.460> it's<00:01:44.120> never<00:01:44.300> been<00:01:44.540> really

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
it once and then it's never been really

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.920 
it once and then it's never been really
performed<00:01:45.320> since<00:01:45.560> then

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.760 

because<00:01:51.930> it's<00:01:52.110> never<00:01:52.260> been<00:01:52.410> performed

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
because it's never been performed

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.070 
because it's never been performed
there's<00:01:53.190> no<00:01:53.370> real<00:01:53.790> performance<00:01:54.480> practice<00:01:54.690> and

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
there's no real performance practice and

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.620 
there's no real performance practice and
so<00:01:55.290> one<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> interesting<00:01:55.890> things<00:01:56.340> that

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
so one of the interesting things that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.870 
so one of the interesting things that
