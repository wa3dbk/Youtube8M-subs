00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.140
 that for all of us we are here in a new 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.399
 video for every some girls then 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.230
 this time a video a little different from what 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.570
 that only upload that are 20 so those things 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.610
 and well this is to show you then 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.019
 I wanted to show you this simulator for 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.720
 game boy advance and this I'm 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.330
 moving here 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.910
 this good forgiveness emulator is called my 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.029
 boy advance my boy can find it 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.149
 how it starts and you can find it in the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.519
 google play the free version and then the 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.160
 of payment that the free the difference that 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.260
 has is that it does not allow to save I think and 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.150
 If they want to complete it, they can 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.199
 download or paying good then I'm going to 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.199
 show them the interface 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.149
 and the transition 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.770
 is this good here under the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.770
 simple I'm here 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.219
 then as you can see, the 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.719
 games do not come with an emulator have 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.629
 than download them but it's very easy 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.869
 download them and I'll show you once 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.799
 two pages in which they are 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.130
 absolutely all the games for the 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.940
 game boy advance then then for 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:17.760
 Android does not stop 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.320
 I do not know for windows phones and there 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.140
 then we left 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.140
 and here we go to chrome 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.350
 there are two there is one that is called free rooms 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.920
 and another one called cool rooms are already 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.689
 I will show you this is the first free rooms 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.819
 sfr or more like it will be in the 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.880
 description name of the two pages 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.299
 to download the games and the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.299
 emulator 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.230
 how can you see enter the page 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 you have to select here select 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.270
 forgiveness on the left 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.060
 in the game so that world what my 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.799
 evenings for game boy advance that the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.670
 juezos that were why morro game 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.530
 zelda in the end those games 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.660
 and then here select the letter that 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.649
 they want to search let's say we look for an egg 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.090
 by the letter p 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.090
 It is so obvious 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.990
 immediately then let's select 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.520
 the game that we need or want 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.520
 see here 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.590
 let's say there are words 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.590
 this 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.550
 to see that when they charge they will give 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.630
 Here I show you where right under the 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.500
 name and where pacman says there says 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.610
 direct 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.610
 there they have to click 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.850
 and will start the download 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.890
 there starts the download and good the game 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.210
 it will be downloaded directly to the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.270
 is the emulator do not have to pass it on 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.640
 no side to another is not for that 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.480
 now show you the games some 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.700
 how it runs and that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.560
 and we enter the second page that then 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.629
 the truth is I do not say that a better than 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.459
 another, I like them both, there's just one 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.720
 that I can already one for example if one is 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.959
 in play in English in the other is in 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.379
 Spanish and vice versa or things like that are 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.440
 simply things very much or do they go with 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.530
 very little probability 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:33.180
 norman we wait for him to load cool rooms 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.180
 it's called cool rom is 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.400
 As you can see we are going to give you when 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.400
 let's go to the top of the page 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.780
 if you allow me this page is 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.400
 good while loading what here 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.400
 we were in classic mario 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.519
 and it says how they can see the games we 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.970
 they weigh nothing size it's not even a 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.970
 megabyte 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.450
 and good then 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.450
 we go down 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.620
 we wait for that carrion there we go to 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.440
 adapt on this page there are also 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.480
 games for many crazy simulators in 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.720
 this case we are in the one of jÃ¡vea game 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.040
 boy game boy advance we enter here in the 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.610
 top right there is a 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.889
 lever with a handle a lever like 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.569
 red with a red head yes 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.210
 the upper right side 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.889
 success cell right that says there and 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.490
 there will show us the consoles that 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.319
 there is forgiveness I left 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.830
 in the consoles that are available 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.830
 atari 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.220
 we're going to the one that interests us, which is the 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.220
 game boy advance 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.499
 we entered her 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.240
 ready 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.400
 already after selecting it 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.650
 [Music] 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.780
 same as the previous one is the 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.430
 sorted by in order by letters 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.290
 between select the letters and search 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.860
 for example that having cell or with the 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.840
 zeta and the same steps recommended by 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.150
 example pokemon fire red list because 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.400
 with ruby because they go sapphire in short 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.400
 and shows that they are super mario advance 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.550
 and good 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.889
 there are the five plus describes 25 more 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.220
 downloaded the 25 most valued 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.050
 Search by letter and search by gender 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.400
 the same project gives you click already 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.400
 I show where they are downloaded 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.460
 but he went in there 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.200
 to see what load of energetics 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:59.250
 so 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.380
 to see the same folder always this 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.390
 google or download these pages the 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.910
 download games by default 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.070
 folder called download in the 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.250
 files from the internal memory of 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.250
 phone 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.410
 so 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:19.110
 good as you will see and come down says is a 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:22.430
 role play says the genre says how much 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:25.790
 weighs this sin is weighs 5 megabytes 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.030
 nothing happens and you are given here where it says 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.870

 and immediately you will be there in your 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.400
 regulator then let's check it 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.970
 in the download is so fast we go 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.970
 here the emulator 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.870
 sorry 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.090
