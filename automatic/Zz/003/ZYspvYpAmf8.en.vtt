 description of video links and is 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.580
 Papaya with sugar in the galley 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.020
 then warns all your friends to 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.900
 that they check their health plans 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.790
 and if everything is paid right if we 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.890
 we will have to face many times the 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.989
 queue of sus behind natal attendance 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.659
 methodology and consultation with 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.309
 orthopedist and physiotherapists as they 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.650
 were at great risk of being left with 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.089
 their necks and broken columns 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.800
 today we will learn rodrigues five 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.070
 stars immortalized as rivelino 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 elastic to make it folder you rotate the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.729
 LOL 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.890
 from one side to the other as 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.630
 shown on the screen on one side you speak the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.020
 elastic and proposed 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.450
 you will make the elastic one inverted 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.820
 This dribble is five stars is a 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.200
 excellent dribble because it generates a 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.799
 huge direction and speed change 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.140
 remember that your player is left-handed 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.250
 commands will be the opposite as it 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.130
 the left leg to make the dribbles 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.299
 for the 34-star player we have 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.689
 versions similar to the elastics in the 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.700
 Let's talk a little bit now. 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.420
 for three-star players we have the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.299
 in which the raith carries out Angola 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.100
 commands are the same as the elastic 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.829
 three-star players can 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.969
 dribble and stop or run around 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:09.880
 low speed for players of 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.720
 four stars with you will see in the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.200
 screen just ask one question why? 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.250
 the hulk is there right but alright they are 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.150
 facing left right and offends right 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.780
 It is light 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.060
 they can do this dribble and stop 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.810
 occurring at low speeds upwards 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.519
 velocity 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.590
 If you do the command they will 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.760
 perform the same three-dribble dribble 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.459
 made a goal 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.790
 already the five star belt players 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.040
 in speed they will make a movement of three 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.680
 stars when they are running in a 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.650
 average speed depending on the moment 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.950
 that you do the command, you can exit the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.560
 movement of three four or until the 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.940
 elastic even five stars this 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.299
 it will depend on the team 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.739
 I'm almost absolutely sure you 're connected. 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:09.109
 to the time of the player's past running 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.829
 at low speed the player of five 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:15.139
 stars will always make the 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.340
 five stars or we can 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:22.939
 to make elastic and elastic back 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.560
 stopped or at low speed and good 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.739
 combinations for use with 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.430
 elastics are pedaling with the elastic 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.260
 made with elastic and elastic with 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.120
 few 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.900
 you need to have a fantastic elastic with 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.449
 the dribble of the cow is not 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.169
 sensational examples I already showed 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:46.819
 here during this video is right and I 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:50.359
 I know that there are still people who have 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.849
 done is good right no rock but focuses 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.680
 we will learn in future tutorials 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.190
 look at the elastic with rodrigo cavaca 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.590
 So come on, let's go and close 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.840
 here is part of learning the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.159
 commands and let's go there our finalization 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.159
 We 're still going to the field. 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.340
 look, it circulates in dollar of 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.310
 fake band with elastic 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.690
 the opponents with the lost 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.720
 completely deconcentrated. 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.710
 of four stars running 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.500
 just look at our hollow relax reverse the 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.780
 beautiful release 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.220
 look there the movement of three stars 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.280
 running 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.790
 we already took and splintered from kelvin to the game 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.160
 with the port against benfica in this game 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.970
 the ball is elastic, our lady 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.790
 Nice ride again there, pedaled and gave 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:50.080
 elastic opponent who is asked again 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:53.470

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.510
 look there three stars working is 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.320
 very good, this brightness she thinks 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.790
 go through the bottom line our lady there 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.020
 again award three stars 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.210
 working right 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.160
 She's the five-star, there's no way 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.470
 It's very forceful, huh? 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.699
 but three- star sometimes breaks the 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:16.120
 Legal branch 4 also hope she 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.770
 pedaled with cute elastic lance looks 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.760
 A little trick coming out 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.860
 and to close people, let's go a good goal 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.050
