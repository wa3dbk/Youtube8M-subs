on<00:00:29.640> which<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:30.840> with<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> keep<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.550> mind

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
on which one to go with so keep in mind

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.970 
on which one to go with so keep in mind
that<00:00:32.969> these<00:00:33.180> are<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.480> two<00:00:34.110> view<00:00:34.500> finders<00:00:34.829> are

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that these are just two view finders are

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
that these are just two view finders are
the<00:00:35.100> many<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> market<00:00:36.480> but

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the many that are on the market but

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.139 
the many that are on the market but
these<00:00:37.530> two<00:00:37.680> represent<00:00:38.219> very<00:00:38.550> different<00:00:38.610> entry

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
these two represent very different entry

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.119 
these two represent very different entry
points<00:00:39.180> both<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.320> respect<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.770> build

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
points both with respect to build

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.389 
points both with respect to build
quality<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.450> price<00:00:42.660> itself<00:00:43.219> now<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
quality and the price itself now this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.650 
quality and the price itself now this
isn't<00:00:44.550> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> technical<00:00:45.390> specs

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
isn't going to be a technical specs

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
isn't going to be a technical specs
review<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.230> which<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.829> edges<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
review to see which one edges out the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180 
review to see which one edges out the
other<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:49.590> each<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
other because I really think each one

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.540 
other because I really think each one
shines<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.270> certain<00:00:51.750> uses<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> what<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> like

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
shines for certain uses so what I like

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
shines for certain uses so what I like
to<00:00:53.670> touch<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> practicality<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> using

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
to touch on is the practicality of using

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
to touch on is the practicality of using
these<00:00:56.129> two<00:00:56.340> view<00:00:56.579> finders<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.180> different

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
these two view finders in different

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
these two view finders in different
shooting<00:00:58.230> situations<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.789> either<00:01:00.000> way<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
shooting situations so either way I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.360 
shooting situations so either way I
think<00:01:00.750> using<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.079> viewfinder<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.739> an<00:01:01.859> essential

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
think using a viewfinder is an essential

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
think using a viewfinder is an essential
tool<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.969> both<00:01:03.170> photographers

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
tool for both photographers

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.730 
tool for both photographers
videographers<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.780> filmmakers<00:01:06.780> especially

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
videographers and filmmakers especially

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.460 
videographers and filmmakers especially
if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.159> find<00:01:08.400> yourself<00:01:08.490> shooting<00:01:09.030> in

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
if you find yourself shooting in

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.810 
if you find yourself shooting in
daylight<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.770> or<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.430> you're<00:01:11.549> using<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
daylight a lot or if you're using a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.810 
daylight a lot or if you're using a
shoulder<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.180> tripod<00:01:12.510> rig<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:14.189> these<00:01:14.610> view

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
shoulder or tripod rig so these view

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.420 
shoulder or tripod rig so these view
finders<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.299> used<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.869> magnify<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> image<00:01:17.250> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
finders are used to magnify the image of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
finders are used to magnify the image of
the<00:01:17.490> LCD<00:01:17.880> screen<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.290> shield<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the LCD screen as well as shield out the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.530 
the LCD screen as well as shield out the
external<00:01:20.189> light<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.790> see<00:01:20.909> what's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
external light so you can see what's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
external light so you can see what's
happening<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.229> screen<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> find

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
happening on your screen now I find

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.820 
happening on your screen now I find
these<00:01:24.180> two<00:01:24.330> view<00:01:24.540> finders<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> pretty

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
these two view finders do a pretty

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.770 
these two view finders do a pretty
comparable<00:01:26.159> job<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.790> respect<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.390> haven't

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
comparable job in that respect I haven't

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
comparable job in that respect I haven't
really<00:01:27.930> noticed<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> prefer<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.340> over

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
really noticed that I prefer one over

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.370 
really noticed that I prefer one over
the<00:01:29.640> other<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:30.150> far<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> magnification

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the other as far as the magnification

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.710 
the other as far as the magnification
goes<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.490> they<00:01:32.700> both<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> very<00:01:33.390> similar

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
goes because they both do a very similar

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.560 
goes because they both do a very similar
job<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.369> Z<00:01:35.520> finder<00:01:35.820> however<00:01:36.090> does<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
job so the Z finder however does have a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.039 
job so the Z finder however does have a
built-in<00:01:37.140> diopter<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.700> adjust<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.810> people's

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
built-in diopter to adjust for people's

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.200 
built-in diopter to adjust for people's
whose<00:01:40.229> visions<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> off<00:01:40.860> by<00:01:41.070> slightly<00:01:41.820> off<00:01:42.090> by

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
whose visions is off by slightly off by

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.179 
whose visions is off by slightly off by
2020<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.470> perfect<00:01:43.799> vision<00:01:43.860> or

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
2020 but if you have perfect vision or

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.639 
2020 but if you have perfect vision or
you<00:01:44.250> wear<00:01:44.369> glasses<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:45.380> it's<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.470> really

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you wear glasses then it's not really

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.460 
you wear glasses then it's not really
going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> matter<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.689> let's<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.200> depth

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
going to matter so let's go more depth

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.679 
going to matter so let's go more depth
into<00:01:49.649> each<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.009> these<00:01:50.070> view<00:01:50.310> finders<00:01:50.689> I'll

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
into each of these view finders I'll

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.810 
into each of these view finders I'll
start<00:01:51.960> with<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> LCD<00:01:52.259> bf<00:01:52.619> first<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
start with the LCD bf first this is the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520 
start with the LCD bf first this is the
first<00:01:53.909> viewfinder<00:01:54.659> Arbonne<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.079> I've<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.380> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
first viewfinder Arbonne and I've had it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.830 
first viewfinder Arbonne and I've had it
for<00:01:55.710> about<00:01:55.799> two<00:01:56.399> years<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.090> retails<00:01:57.780> for

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
for about two years now and retails for

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.980 
for about two years now and retails for
about<00:01:58.020> 125<00:01:58.770> USD<00:01:59.520> I've<00:02:00.360> used<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:00.750> both

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
about 125 USD I've used it for both

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.709 
about 125 USD I've used it for both
photo<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.590> video<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.210> area<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
photo and video and the one area that I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.630 
photo and video and the one area that I
found<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> LCD<00:02:04.500> bf2<00:02:04.770> excelent<00:02:05.520> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
found the LCD bf2 excelent is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.490 
found the LCD bf2 excelent is
portability<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.420> even<00:02:07.020> though<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.229> slightly

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
portability so even though it's slightly

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.130 
portability so even though it's slightly
taller<00:02:08.009> than<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> Z<00:02:09.149> finder<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.629> slimmer<00:02:09.989> in

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
taller than the Z finder it's slimmer in

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.750 
taller than the Z finder it's slimmer in
profile<00:02:10.500> overall<00:02:10.890> by<00:02:11.099> two-thirds<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
profile overall by two-thirds of the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.800 
profile overall by two-thirds of the
size<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.030> believe

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
size I believe

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.720 
size I believe
and<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.290> fits<00:02:13.500> into<00:02:13.680> pockets<00:02:14.370> pretty<00:02:14.550> easily

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and it fits into pockets pretty easily

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.550 
and it fits into pockets pretty easily
so<00:02:15.300> when<00:02:15.569> you're<00:02:15.660> on<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.930> go<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.350> need<00:02:16.470> to

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so when you're on the go and you need to

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.320 
so when you're on the go and you need to
pack<00:02:16.800> up<00:02:16.830> quickly<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.060> throw<00:02:18.240> it

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
pack up quickly you can just throw it

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.809 
pack up quickly you can just throw it
into<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.990> back<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.170> your<00:02:19.410> pants<00:02:19.709> pocket<00:02:20.130> or<00:02:20.370> a

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
into the back of your pants pocket or a

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.970 
into the back of your pants pocket or a
jacket<00:02:21.209> pocket<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.560> doesn't<00:02:22.770> feel<00:02:22.860> like

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
jacket pocket and it doesn't feel like

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.170 
jacket pocket and it doesn't feel like
it's<00:02:23.100> taking<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.490> large<00:02:23.640> amount<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.880> space

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
it's taking up a large amount of space

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.140 
it's taking up a large amount of space
so<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.410> actually<00:02:25.560> comes<00:02:26.100> with<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.520> pouch<00:02:27.120> that

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
so it actually comes with a pouch that

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.809 
so it actually comes with a pouch that
you<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.600> easily<00:02:27.810> clip<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> backpack<00:02:28.830> which

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
you can easily clip to a backpack which

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.070 
you can easily clip to a backpack which
is<00:02:29.940> really<00:02:30.120> convenient<00:02:30.420> for<00:02:30.630> traveling<00:02:30.959> you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
is really convenient for traveling you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.570 
is really convenient for traveling you
stood<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.440> travel<00:02:31.709> backpack<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:32.400> you

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
stood on a travel backpack and just you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.170 
stood on a travel backpack and just you
go<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:32.910> it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
go with it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.210 
go with it
and<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.260> usually<00:02:34.560> use<00:02:34.680> this<00:02:34.770> for<00:02:34.950> mostly

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
and I usually use this for mostly

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.120 
and I usually use this for mostly
photography<00:02:35.640> situations<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.770> does<00:02:37.950> come

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
photography situations so it does come

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.160 
photography situations so it does come
with<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.280> lanyard<00:02:38.580> which<00:02:39.120> something<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.050> put

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
with a lanyard which something you put

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
with a lanyard which something you put
around<00:02:40.260> your<00:02:40.410> neck<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.190> don't<00:02:41.250> really<00:02:41.520> use

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
around your neck and I don't really use

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.699 
around your neck and I don't really use
it<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.120> because<00:02:42.330> it's<00:02:42.569> it's<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.350> kind<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.620> a

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
it just because it's it's it's kind of a

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.440 
it just because it's it's it's kind of a
cheap<00:02:43.890> piece<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.190> cloth<00:02:44.370> sort<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.420> feel

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
cheap piece of cloth sort of and I feel

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.670 
cheap piece of cloth sort of and I feel
like<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:45.870> going<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.110> snap<00:02:46.350> at<00:02:46.500> any<00:02:46.560> moment

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
like it's going to snap at any moment

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.710 
like it's going to snap at any moment
that<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.040> use<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.880> don't<00:02:48.120> bother<00:02:48.360> with<00:02:48.540> it

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
that I use it so I don't bother with it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.840 
that I use it so I don't bother with it
really<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.130> couple<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.250> other<00:02:50.430> areas<00:02:50.820> that

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
really a couple of the other areas that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.430 
really a couple of the other areas that
I<00:02:50.970> wish<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.360> LCD<00:02:51.750> VF<00:02:51.959> was<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> little<00:02:52.320> bit

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
I wish the LCD VF was a little bit

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.020 
I wish the LCD VF was a little bit
better<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.190> build<00:02:53.400> quality<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.910> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
better in is the build quality and the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.490 
better in is the build quality and the
strength<00:02:54.330> of<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> connection<00:02:54.840> between<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
strength of the connection between the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.040 
strength of the connection between the
camera<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.610> viewfinder<00:02:56.790> itself<00:02:57.390> so

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
camera and the viewfinder itself so

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.110 
camera and the viewfinder itself so
being<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> lot<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.980> run-and-gun<00:02:59.370> situations

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
being in a lot of run-and-gun situations

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.990 
being in a lot of run-and-gun situations
as<00:03:00.239> well<00:03:00.269> as<00:03:00.540> nature<00:03:01.110> quite<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> bit<00:03:02.130> sometimes

as well as nature quite a bit sometimes

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.850 
as well as nature quite a bit sometimes
when<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.390> let<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.630> camera<00:03:04.110> hang<00:03:04.319> from<00:03:04.500> my<00:03:04.590> neck

with the camera strap or if I put it

with the camera strap or if I put it
down<00:03:07.380> because<00:03:07.709> after<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:07.980> reach<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.190> my<00:03:08.250> bag<00:03:08.340> to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
grab something the strength is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.920 
grab something the strength is
relatively<00:03:10.769> weak<00:03:11.450> because<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.660> the

has it's come off quite a few times just

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.340 
has it's come off quite a few times just
from<00:03:18.360> little<00:03:18.480> bumps<00:03:18.780> here<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:18.930> there<00:03:19.049> and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
from little bumps here and there and

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.199 
from little bumps here and there and
sometimes<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.340> magnet<00:03:20.670> collects<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.030> little

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
sometimes the magnet collects a little

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.210 
sometimes the magnet collects a little
dirt<00:03:21.480> off<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.900> ground<00:03:22.200> one<00:03:22.890> other<00:03:23.040> thing<00:03:23.190> I

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
dirt off the ground one other thing I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.500 
dirt off the ground one other thing I
have<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.400> mention<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.880> quality<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.329> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
have to mention is the quality of the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.830 
have to mention is the quality of the
the<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.290> eyepiece<00:03:25.980> here<00:03:26.510> after<00:03:27.510> about<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.750> year

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
the the eyepiece here after about a year

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.870 
the the eyepiece here after about a year
of<00:03:28.019> use<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:29.040> just<00:03:29.100> came<00:03:29.400> off<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.850> I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
of use it just it just came off and I

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.210 
of use it just it just came off and I
could<00:03:30.630> tell<00:03:30.750> was<00:03:30.930> glued<00:03:31.140> on<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:31.799> here<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.100> can

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
could tell was glued on so here you can

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.449 
could tell was glued on so here you can
see<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:33.019> use<00:03:34.019> some<00:03:34.200> gaffers<00:03:34.560> tape<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:35.040> make<00:03:35.310> it

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
see I use some gaffers tape to make it

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.160 
see I use some gaffers tape to make it
stay<00:03:35.640> on<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> works<00:03:36.299> fine<00:03:36.540> now<00:03:36.600> some<00:03:36.989> and

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
stay on and it works fine now some and

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.810 
stay on and it works fine now some and
I'm<00:03:37.230> not<00:03:37.350> gonna<00:03:37.470> mess<00:03:37.620> with<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.860> but<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.610> build

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
I'm not gonna mess with it but the build

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.460 
I'm not gonna mess with it but the build
quality<00:03:38.940> might<00:03:39.390> be<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> little<00:03:39.690> suspect<00:03:40.110> from

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
quality might be a little suspect from

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.140 
quality might be a little suspect from
my<00:03:40.590> experience<00:03:41.070> just<00:03:41.130> using<00:03:41.549> also<00:03:41.880> just

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
my experience just using also just

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.599 
my experience just using also just
shooting<00:03:42.299> conditions<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.650> let's<00:03:44.370> compare

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
shooting conditions so let's compare

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.099 
shooting conditions so let's compare
that<00:03:44.700> with<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.910> Zee<00:03:45.060> finder<00:03:45.390> anyone<00:03:45.930> who's

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
that with the Zee finder anyone who's

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.050 
that with the Zee finder anyone who's
ever<00:03:46.200> held<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.709> thing<00:03:46.950> will<00:03:47.579> know<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.970> it

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
ever held this thing will know that it

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.520 
ever held this thing will know that it
was<00:03:48.180> built<00:03:48.510> to<00:03:48.630> last<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:49.079> pretty<00:03:49.290> bomb-proof

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
was built to last it's pretty bomb-proof

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.240 
was built to last it's pretty bomb-proof
but<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.459> also<00:03:50.609> runs<00:03:50.880> around<00:03:51.060> 350<00:03:51.810> USD<00:03:52.230> it's<00:03:53.220> a

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
but it also runs around 350 USD it's a

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.490 
but it also runs around 350 USD it's a
little<00:03:53.489> more<00:03:53.670> heavy<00:03:54.480> but<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.989> feels<00:03:55.230> really

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
little more heavy but it feels really

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.650 
little more heavy but it feels really
durable<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.459> connection<00:03:56.820> between<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
durable and the connection between the

Zee finder and the cameras LCD is a

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.280 
Zee finder and the cameras LCD is a
little<00:03:59.910> bit<00:04:00.000> more<00:04:00.150> solid<00:04:00.359> actually<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.170> should

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
little bit more solid actually I should

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.590 
little bit more solid actually I should
say<00:04:01.320> much<00:04:01.560> more<00:04:01.590> solid<00:04:01.920> than<00:04:02.070> LCD<00:04:02.400> bf<00:04:02.760> there

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
say much more solid than LCD bf there

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.580 
say much more solid than LCD bf there
have<00:04:03.690> been<00:04:03.750> times<00:04:03.930> when<00:04:04.109> I've<00:04:04.200> accidentally

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
have been times when I've accidentally

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.250 
have been times when I've accidentally
bumped<00:04:04.980> into<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.420> bumped<00:04:06.420> into<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.630> while<00:04:06.840> it

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
bumped into the bumped into a while it

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.780 
bumped into the bumped into a while it
was<00:04:07.380> connecting<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.709> my<00:04:07.799> camera<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:08.579> stays

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
was connecting to my camera but it stays

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.380 
was connecting to my camera but it stays
on<00:04:09.260> quite<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> bit<00:04:10.470> more<00:04:10.650> versus<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.910> LCD<00:04:12.180> VF

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
on quite a bit more versus the LCD VF

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.509 
on quite a bit more versus the LCD VF
which<00:04:12.540> comes<00:04:12.810> off<00:04:12.989> at<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.859> slightest<00:04:14.160> bump<00:04:14.340> it

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
which comes off at the slightest bump it

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.430 
which comes off at the slightest bump it
seems<00:04:14.670> like<00:04:14.850> one<00:04:15.840> thing<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.109> really<00:04:16.320> like

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
seems like one thing that I really like

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.020 
seems like one thing that I really like
about<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.769> is<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.130> eyepiece<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.760> comes

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
about this is the eyepiece that comes

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.050 
about this is the eyepiece that comes
with<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.570> Z<00:04:18.720> finder<00:04:19.049> this<00:04:19.919> actually<00:04:20.549> opens<00:04:20.909> up

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
with the Z finder this actually opens up

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.360 
with the Z finder this actually opens up
and<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:21.359> can<00:04:21.930> actually<00:04:21.959> view<00:04:22.349> inside<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.770> LCD

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
and you can actually view inside the LCD

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.469 
and you can actually view inside the LCD
from<00:04:23.490> there<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:23.970> prevents<00:04:24.270> someone

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
from there and this prevents someone

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.940 
from there and this prevents someone
from<00:04:24.599> getting<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.140> actually<00:04:25.500> burning<00:04:25.740> your

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
from getting in actually burning your

into a bag you don't have to worry about

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.770 
into a bag you don't have to worry about
the<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.699> glass<00:04:33.879> getting<00:04:34.210> scratched<00:04:34.539> there

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
the the glass getting scratched there

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.939 
the the glass getting scratched there
which<00:04:35.020> is<00:04:35.199> something<00:04:35.379> that<00:04:35.469> they<00:04:35.620> else<00:04:35.770> keep

to stay with the Z finder because you

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.110 
to stay with the Z finder because you
know<00:05:41.800> just<00:05:41.830> it's<00:05:42.219> more<00:05:42.430> durable<00:05:42.669> I<00:05:42.940> have<00:05:43.060> a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
know just it's more durable I have a

finder and this harsh weather conditions

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.329 
finder and this harsh weather conditions
it<00:05:49.659> makes<00:05:50.229> sense<00:05:50.469> to<00:05:50.710> have<00:05:51.009> something<00:05:51.279> is

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:51.339 
it makes sense to have something is

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.519 
it makes sense to have something is
really<00:05:51.460> durable<00:05:51.729> you<00:05:52.629> know<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.900> lot<00:05:53.050> of<00:05:53.080> dog

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:56.349 
dusts a lot of heat a lot of Sun so it

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.050 
dusts a lot of heat a lot of Sun so it
makes<00:05:56.500> sense<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:56.800> go<00:05:56.919> with<00:05:56.949> this<00:05:57.189> so<00:05:57.849> it's<00:05:57.939> for

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
makes sense to go with this so it's for

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:10.659 
and so forth so another thing I want to

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:12.480 
and so forth so another thing I want to
make<00:06:10.779> a<00:06:10.810> note<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.080> is<00:06:11.349> the<00:06:11.529> adhesive<00:06:11.949> frame

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
make a note of is the adhesive frame

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.040 
make a note of is the adhesive frame
that<00:06:13.089> you<00:06:13.210> get<00:06:13.389> with<00:06:13.539> each<00:06:13.659> one<00:06:13.839> of<00:06:13.900> these

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
that you get with each one of these

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.200 
that you get with each one of these
units<00:06:14.500> here<00:06:14.830> you<00:06:15.430> really<00:06:15.580> want<00:06:15.849> to<00:06:15.909> be<00:06:15.969> careful

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
units here you really want to be careful

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.279 
units here you really want to be careful
with<00:06:16.419> the<00:06:16.479> ones<00:06:16.629> that<00:06:16.689> you<00:06:16.779> choose<00:06:17.080> because

with the ones that you choose because

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.600 
with the ones that you choose because
you'll<00:06:17.469> probably<00:06:17.500> be<00:06:17.800> standardizing<00:06:18.370> on<00:06:18.460> that

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
you'll probably be standardizing on that

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.499 
you'll probably be standardizing on that
for<00:06:18.789> a<00:06:18.849> little<00:06:18.939> while<00:06:19.150> since<00:06:19.389> you're

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
for a little while since you're

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.540 
for a little while since you're
essentially<00:06:20.050> gluing<00:06:20.439> the<00:06:20.830> frame<00:06:21.129> onto<00:06:21.339> the

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
essentially gluing the frame onto the

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.890 
essentially gluing the frame onto the
camera's<00:06:21.939> LCD<00:06:22.089> screen

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
camera's LCD screen

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.110 
camera's LCD screen
so<00:06:23.560> long<00:06:24.310> term<00:06:24.580> that'll<00:06:24.849> be<00:06:24.909> another

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
so long term that'll be another

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.969 
so long term that'll be another
condition<00:06:25.629> or<00:06:25.870> consideration<00:06:26.650> I<00:06:26.740> should<00:06:26.889> say

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
condition or consideration I should say

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.170 
condition or consideration I should say
before<00:06:27.039> you<00:06:27.339> actually<00:06:27.699> choose<00:06:27.849> one<00:06:28.029> of<00:06:28.089> these

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
before you actually choose one of these

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.140 
before you actually choose one of these
new<00:06:29.169> vendors<00:06:29.500> so<00:06:30.310> Zacuto<00:06:30.639> actually<00:06:30.969> does

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
new vendors so Zacuto actually does

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.089 
new vendors so Zacuto actually does
offer<00:06:31.659> a<00:06:31.839> base<00:06:32.080> plate<00:06:32.379> on<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.770> bottom<00:06:32.979> of<00:06:33.039> the

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
offer a base plate on the bottom of the

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.679 
offer a base plate on the bottom of the
camera<00:06:33.400> you<00:06:33.550> can<00:06:33.669> connect<00:06:33.939> which<00:06:34.479> bypasses

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
camera you can connect which bypasses

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.320 
camera you can connect which bypasses
that<00:06:35.169> whole<00:06:35.349> adhesive<00:06:35.770> piece<00:06:36.029> but<00:06:37.029> that<00:06:37.089> may

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
that whole adhesive piece but that may

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.790 
that whole adhesive piece but that may
add<00:06:37.509> more<00:06:37.539> pieces<00:06:37.930> to<00:06:38.080> your<00:06:38.289> camera<00:06:38.589> if<00:06:38.680> you're

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
add more pieces to your camera if you're

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.730 
add more pieces to your camera if you're
trying<00:06:38.979> to<00:06:39.039> be<00:06:39.130> light

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
trying to be light

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.409 
trying to be light
go<00:06:40.099> be<00:06:40.460> running<00:06:40.729> gun<00:06:40.880> so<00:06:41.060> that's<00:06:41.270> another

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
go be running gun so that's another

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.930 
go be running gun so that's another
consideration<00:06:42.130> so<00:06:43.130> that's<00:06:43.280> my<00:06:43.400> comparison<00:06:43.880> to

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
consideration so that's my comparison to

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.430 
consideration so that's my comparison to
show<00:06:44.000> you<00:06:44.150> to<00:06:44.389> what<00:06:44.539> these<00:06:44.690> view<00:06:44.870> finders<00:06:45.229> to

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
show you to what these view finders to

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.559 
show you to what these view finders to
show<00:06:46.130> you<00:06:46.190> what<00:06:46.370> these<00:06:46.460> two<00:06:46.639> view<00:06:46.849> finders<00:06:47.150> can

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:47.569 
show you what these two view finders can

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.240 
show you what these two view finders can
do<00:06:47.750> and<00:06:47.960> hope<00:06:48.259> it<00:06:48.349> helps<00:06:48.560> you<00:06:48.620> make<00:06:48.740> a<00:06:48.770> decision

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
do and hope it helps you make a decision

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.279 
do and hope it helps you make a decision
which<00:06:49.819> one<00:06:49.849> is<00:06:50.030> right<00:06:50.150> for<00:06:50.180> you<00:06:50.389> so<00:06:51.080> remember

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289 
which one is right for you so remember

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.499 
which one is right for you so remember
there<00:06:51.650> are<00:06:51.680> many<00:06:52.009> more<00:06:52.370> than<00:06:52.430> these<00:06:53.180> two<00:06:53.389> on

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:53.509 
there are many more than these two on

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:54.820 
there are many more than these two on
the<00:06:53.599> market<00:06:53.960> but<00:06:54.259> from<00:06:54.500> my<00:06:54.590> personal

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
the market but from my personal

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.339 
the market but from my personal
experience<00:06:55.430> I've<00:06:55.639> used<00:06:55.910> both<00:06:56.090> these<00:06:56.330> and<00:06:56.569> I've

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
experience I've used both these and I've

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:59.020 
experience I've used both these and I've
found<00:06:57.800> that<00:06:57.919> these<00:06:58.009> work<00:06:58.310> great<00:06:58.520> in<00:06:58.669> all<00:06:58.819> sorts

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.030 
found that these work great in all sorts

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.610 
found that these work great in all sorts
