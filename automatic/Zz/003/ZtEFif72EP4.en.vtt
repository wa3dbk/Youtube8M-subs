00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Good evening everyone , we have a review today. 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.960
 onboard computer multitronics 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.759
 VJ 1031 computer was installed on 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.800
 Toyota corolla 2003 RHD 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.380
 but I'm showing you right away already in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.250
 prescribed form 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.090
 because installation principle 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.670
 primitive 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.150
 nothing special everything is very simple very 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.859
 correctly but here I have the remnants of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.250
 installations are protective covers and steam from 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:41.010
 no unnecessary wires to also bundled 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.410
 complete instructions on how to assemble it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.559
 install it 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.870
 Well, the warranty card is understandable means 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.500
 the computer is very miniature 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.260
 Immediately hung under the glass, he is next to me 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.449
 with a rack with a door location for 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.329
 I am personally comfortable connecting 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.470
 elementary just find on your 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.490
 I'll take it off the car now 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:12.240
 diagnostic connector here I have it and in 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.820
 he needs to stick a block that goes 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.350
 complete with computer but naturally 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.350
 cable and wires 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.210
 the computer itself is very 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.229
 functional me personally he is very 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.140
 happy functions 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.140
 Well, the set you create will start the car 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.520
 [music] 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.940
 here he is even polite greets how well 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.060
 Apparently on the screen I have a screen with 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.230
 time balance here I have 5 liters in 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.310
 tank it is real so he can 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:58.630
 notice that the light is on well run 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.060
 here is 55 kilometers cabin temperature 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.170
 why in the cabin because in general with 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.149
 the computer is a sensor external 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.920
 temperature but since i have a sensor 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.000
 the external temperature of the car is 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.720
 full-time I installed it in this 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.510
 salon sensor from the computer you end up 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.090
 now I know the temperature of myself in the cabin 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.610
 many settings 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.470
 that's how you see now consumption is 900 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.440
 gram hour you can turn on another screen 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:51.019
 there are different characteristics again 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:03:01.280
 and the beard and the principle she herself says 3 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:03:03.049
 display parameters are generally so visible 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.350
 settings a lot but for some reason 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.519
 more like the first screen like it 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.010
 more then also 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.080
 this is the parameters button as well 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:18.500
 button statistics for trips for example and 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.980
 here everything for the current trip everything will become everything 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.980
 options 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.490
 Well, not decided because the machine has not yet 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.650
 go 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.870
 determined when the car starts moving 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:39.370
 I can show you drives 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.370
 that is, I drove the pictures 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.250
 9 liters in progress 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:02.690
 but this I drove in here the cost here by the way 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.710
 triggered warning when little 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.770
 gasoline in the tank 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.870
 there is no python in advance about a hundred 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.830
 six liters 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.140
 what else can I say 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.930
 the only thing that delivered a little 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.660
 inconvenience well again this is understandable 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.269
 why because all the same it's not 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.280
 regular on-board computer is 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:30.570
 connecting the wire which 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:33.330
 about to see an alert again 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.030
 see the rest of 6 liters here that is 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:40.350
 so that the balance on the computer coincides with 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.970
 the rest of the arrows need to be connected 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.980
 one of the wires that goes to 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.790
 complete with computer it is green 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.030
 colors this wire needs to be connected to 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.260
 the sensor 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.880
 fuel your car in my case 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.610
 it's under the back seat is 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.280
 gasoline pump and it goes to the bundle of wires 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.490
 so I found the right wire and connected 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.620
 Well, there is mat every car naturally 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.930
 differently it is necessary to consult with 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.590
 specialists well, or if you yourself 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.930
 you know you do it yourself 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.750
 that's basically all computer again 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.690
 I repeat very good he suits me 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.150
 I now know everything about my car but 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.580
 I have no mistakes as you can see 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.250
 mistakes I would demonstrate how he 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.970
 can erase decrypted then 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.210
 erase well, as you can see, I have no mistakes 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:37.320
 all who looked at him and thought 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:41.730
 buy or not advise buy from you 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.620
 it will really please well really pleasant 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.280
 the thing that I personally 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.800
 expected even less from him than there is on 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.260
 really 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.260
 Well, in general, in principle, I said everything
