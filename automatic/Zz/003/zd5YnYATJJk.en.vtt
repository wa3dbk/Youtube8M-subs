with<00:00:34.410> lava<00:00:34.710> plume<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.370> guess<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:36.030> camera<00:00:36.360> would

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
with lava plume I guess my camera would

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
with lava plume I guess my camera would
have<00:00:36.630> been<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> better<00:00:36.960> choice<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
have been a better choice just because a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.950 
have been a better choice just because a
lot<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.550> room<00:00:38.790> has<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> chance<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> burn<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
lot of room has a chance to burn and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.080 
lot of room has a chance to burn and
would<00:00:40.620> superfecta<00:00:41.040> damage<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.670> guess<00:00:41.879> it's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
would superfecta damage I guess it's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.500 
would superfecta damage I guess it's
enough<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.540> break<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> sash<00:00:43.969> but<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
enough to break down the sash but I just

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.889 
enough to break down the sash but I just
lead<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.320> back<00:00:46.559> my<00:00:46.829> second<00:00:47.309> best<00:00:47.399> answer

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
lead would go back my second best answer

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.330 
lead would go back my second best answer
just<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.020> case<00:00:49.110> she<00:00:49.649> does<00:00:49.920> lead<00:00:50.190> with

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
just in case she does lead with

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.369 
just in case she does lead with
something<00:00:50.640> else<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> random<00:00:52.020> fro

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379

break her down but as you can see she

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.450

this<00:02:11.099> one<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.760> training<00:02:11.970> speed<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
this one is in training speed and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.420 
this one is in training speed and
special<00:02:13.110> attack<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.709> believe<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.250> it's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
special attack I believe if it's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.350 
special attack I believe if it's
somewhat<00:02:15.239> image<00:02:15.599> rain<00:02:15.870> HP<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.500> well<00:02:16.739> but<00:02:17.459> it's

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
somewhat image rain HP as well but it's

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.300 
somewhat image rain HP as well but it's
really<00:02:18.569> good<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.959> take<00:02:19.140> special<00:02:19.470> moves<00:02:19.770> when

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
really good in take special moves when

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.059 
really good in take special moves when
it's<00:02:20.489> at<00:02:20.640> full<00:02:21.000> HP<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.630> especially<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.349> I'm

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
it's at full HP and especially and I'm

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.920 
it's at full HP and especially and I'm
actually<00:02:23.370> kind<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.819> surprised<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.480> mean<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
actually kind of surprised I mean the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.750 
actually kind of surprised I mean the
way<00:02:25.050> she<00:02:25.080> played<00:02:25.530> with<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.069> guess<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.610> could

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
way she played with it I guess it could

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.040 
way she played with it I guess it could
have<00:02:26.880> been<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.030> better<00:02:27.180> choice<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.720> preserve

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
have been a better choice to preserve

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.390 
have been a better choice to preserve
that<00:02:28.319> some<00:02:28.620> thought<00:02:28.770> for<00:02:29.040> later<00:02:29.069> on<00:02:29.340> because

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that some thought for later on because

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.960 
that some thought for later on because
again<00:02:30.090> my<00:02:31.020> things<00:02:31.290> were<00:02:31.560> at<00:02:31.800> full<00:02:32.100> HP<00:02:32.280> most<00:02:32.760> of

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
again my things were at full HP most of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.449 
again my things were at full HP most of
them<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.300> they<00:02:33.810> could<00:02:34.050> still<00:02:34.380> manage<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
them and they could still manage the

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.070 
them and they could still manage the
handle<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:35.819> then<00:02:35.970> again<00:02:36.090> Simon<00:02:36.450> thought<00:02:36.720> plus

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
handle but then again Simon thought plus

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.699 
handle but then again Simon thought plus
two<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.970> yeah<00:02:39.170> still<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> switch<00:02:40.440> out<00:02:40.590> to

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
but I just decide to go for the boost

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.890 
but I just decide to go for the boost
this<00:03:49.980> turn<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.459> she's<00:03:51.180> gonna<00:03:51.329> decide<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.780> go

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
this turn and she's gonna decide to go

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.509 
this turn and she's gonna decide to go

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
for the rest yeah that that was a bit of

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.460 
for the rest yeah that that was a bit of
a<00:03:56.609> no-brainer<00:03:56.910> on<00:03:57.660> my<00:03:57.930> behalf<00:03:58.260> because

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
a no-brainer on my behalf because

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.110

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
some respectable damage and she goes for

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.350 
some respectable damage and she goes for
the<00:06:10.500> hidden<00:06:10.680> power<00:06:10.950> ground<00:06:11.460> because<00:06:12.180> I<00:06:12.270> do

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
the hidden power ground because I do

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.110 
the hidden power ground because I do

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
probably has two scores on protein you

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.219 
probably has two scores on protein you
know<00:06:43.460> it's<00:06:43.729> it's<00:06:44.300> something<00:06:44.689> that<00:06:44.810> I<00:06:44.840> had<00:06:45.050> in

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
know it's it's something that I had in

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.260 
know it's it's something that I had in
mind<00:06:45.469> because<00:06:45.919> of<00:06:46.129> how<00:06:46.310> hunter<00:06:46.729> come<00:06:46.909> in<00:06:47.060> and

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
mind because of how hunter come in and

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.749 
mind because of how hunter come in and
they're<00:06:47.900> both<00:06:48.080> running<00:06:48.530> equal<00:06:49.129> speeds<00:06:49.520> and

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 
they're both running equal speeds and

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.089 
they're both running equal speeds and
you<00:06:49.849> can<00:06:50.030> see<00:06:50.210> hunter<00:06:50.509> does<00:06:50.870> out<00:06:51.080> speed<00:06:51.409> be<00:06:51.560> so

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:52.099 
you can see hunter does out speed be so

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:54.550 
you can see hunter does out speed be so
that<00:06:52.250> previous<00:06:52.699> only<00:06:53.060> try<00:06:53.270> there<00:06:53.479> was<00:06:54.169> a<00:06:54.199> speed

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 
that previous only try there was a speed

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.059 
that previous only try there was a speed
type<00:06:54.770> and<00:06:55.689> yeah<00:06:56.689> that<00:06:56.960> was<00:06:57.650> kind<00:06:58.009> of

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.069 
type and yeah that was kind of

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.490 
type and yeah that was kind of
interesting<00:06:58.509> plus<00:06:59.509> the<00:06:59.719> hidden<00:06:59.870> power<00:07:00.169> and

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
interesting plus the hidden power and

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.219
