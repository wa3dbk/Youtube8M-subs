max<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.759> curse<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.090> brotherhood<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.660> one

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
max in the curse of brotherhood is one

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.270 
max in the curse of brotherhood is one
that<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> lot<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.380> people<00:00:13.710> might<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:13.980> missed

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
that a lot of people might have missed

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.650 
that a lot of people might have missed
but<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.610> definitely<00:00:15.059> think<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.360> worth<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
but I definitely think it's worth a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.170 
but I definitely think it's worth a
second<00:00:15.990> look<00:00:16.020> now<00:00:16.920> one<00:00:17.130> reason<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.820> it's

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
second look now one reason is that it's

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.210 
second look now one reason is that it's
actually<00:00:18.330> part<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.050> games<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.949> gold

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
actually part of the games with gold

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.070 
actually part of the games with gold

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.930 
gonna be max in the curse of brotherhood
so<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.370> good<00:00:35.460> time<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
so now is a really good time to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.790 
so now is a really good time to
reconsider<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> game<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.020> about<00:00:37.140> see

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
reconsider what the game is about see

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.750 
reconsider what the game is about see
whether<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.370> might<00:00:38.489> want<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> give

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
whether you think you might want to give

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.639 
whether you think you might want to give
it<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> try<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.290> particularly

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
it a try now I think is particularly

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
it a try now I think is particularly
good<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:40.920> families<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.969> PEGI<00:00:42.329> 12

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
good for families in the PEGI 12

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.030 
good for families in the PEGI 12
category<00:00:43.140> which<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.829> not

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
category which is one that is not

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.459 
category which is one that is not
untouched<00:00:44.760> by<00:00:45.329> game<00:00:45.539> developers<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.350> it's

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
untouched by game developers so it's

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.450 
untouched by game developers so it's
definitely<00:00:46.800> worth<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.039> look<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.309> you've<00:00:47.430> got

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
definitely worth a look if you've got

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.910 
definitely worth a look if you've got
kids<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.059> age<00:00:48.230> right<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.559> tell<00:00:49.739> from

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
kids at that age right you can tell from

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.430 
kids at that age right you can tell from
the<00:00:50.070> screenshots<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> game<00:00:51.289> that<00:00:52.289> it's

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the screenshots of the game that it's

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.529 
the screenshots of the game that it's
quite<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> family<00:00:53.129> focused<00:00:53.789> game<00:00:54.000> anywhere<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
quite a family focused game anywhere you

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.060 
quite a family focused game anywhere you
know<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.750> very<00:00:54.930> colorful<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.500> cartoony<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
know it's very colorful and cartoony you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.799 
know it's very colorful and cartoony you
can<00:00:56.219> tell<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.059> suitable<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.510> younger

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
can tell that it's suitable for younger

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.849 
can tell that it's suitable for younger
players<00:00:58.140> or<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.440> least<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
players or at least that's the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.439 
players or at least that's the
impression<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.340> gives<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> can't<00:01:00.300> really

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
impression it gives but you can't really

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.569 
impression it gives but you can't really
tell<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> game<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.430> might

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
tell what the game is about you might

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.060 
tell what the game is about you might
think<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> platformer

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
think that it's a platformer

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
think that it's a platformer
straightforward<00:01:05.070> kind<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> Mario<00:01:06.299> s<00:01:06.510> game

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
straightforward kind of Mario s game

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.840 
straightforward kind of Mario s game
from<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.100> actually<00:01:08.280> all<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
from that but that's not actually all it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.520 
from that but that's not actually all it
is<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> platforming<00:01:09.720> itself<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
is and the platforming itself is is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.160 
is and the platforming itself is is
pretty<00:01:10.830> simple<00:01:11.540> for<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> most<00:01:12.780> part<00:01:13.020> there

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
pretty simple for the most part there

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
pretty simple for the most part there
are<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> few<00:01:13.500> speed<00:01:14.400> sections<00:01:14.970> where<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.180> have

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
are a few speed sections where you have

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.060 
are a few speed sections where you have
to<00:01:15.450> be<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> bit<00:01:15.689> more<00:01:15.780> quick<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.950> it's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to be a bit more quick but it's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.649 
to be a bit more quick but it's
definitely<00:01:17.250> nowhere<00:01:17.580> near<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.330> level<00:01:18.600> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
definitely nowhere near the level of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.539 
definitely nowhere near the level of
Mario<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.200> Donkey<00:01:19.830> Kong<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.040> anything<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
Mario or Donkey Kong or anything like

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.940 
Mario or Donkey Kong or anything like
that<00:01:20.689> now<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> core<00:01:22.110> mechanic<00:01:22.650> isn't

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that now the core mechanic isn't

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
that now the core mechanic isn't
actually<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> platforming<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> do

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
actually the platforming it's all to do

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.649 
actually the platforming it's all to do
with<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.930> marker<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.680> he<00:01:25.799> carries<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.939> you

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
with this marker that he carries and you

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.240 
with this marker that he carries and you
might<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> seen<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> before<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
might have seen it before in the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.160 
might have seen it before in the
previous<00:01:29.640> game<00:01:29.820> from<00:01:29.970> these<00:01:30.150> guys<00:01:30.329> Max<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
previous game from these guys Max and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.109 
previous game from these guys Max and
the<00:01:31.229> magic<00:01:31.470> marker<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:32.130> came<00:01:32.340> out<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.610> 2010

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the magic marker which came out in 2010

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.300 
the magic marker which came out in 2010
it<00:01:33.299> was<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.500> downloadable<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> buy<00:01:34.740> tool<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it was a downloadable to buy tool and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.819 
it was a downloadable to buy tool and
what<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> market<00:01:35.850> does<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:37.049> lets<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.439> draw

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
what the market does is it lets you draw

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.649 
what the market does is it lets you draw
objects<00:01:38.549> into<00:01:38.909> existence<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
objects into existence kind of

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.380 
objects into existence kind of
environmental<00:01:40.409> objects<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> things<00:01:42.180> like

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
environmental objects so things like

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.569 
environmental objects so things like
platforms<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> drag<00:01:44.009> them<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.280> from<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
platforms you can drag them up from the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.050 
platforms you can drag them up from the
ground

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
ground

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.179 
ground
you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.450> attach<00:01:45.720> vines<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.530> things<00:01:46.710> overhead

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you can attach vines to things overhead

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.950 
you can attach vines to things overhead
and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.820> use<00:01:48.030> these<00:01:48.210> objects<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> help

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and then you use these objects to help

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960 
and then you use these objects to help
max<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> get<00:01:49.409> closer<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.890> his<00:01:50.159> goal<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.399> resting

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
max to get closer to his goal of resting

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
max to get closer to his goal of resting
its<00:01:51.299> brother<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.439> really<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:52.860> way<00:01:53.009> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
its brother it's a really good way of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.499 
its brother it's a really good way of
showing<00:01:53.189> how<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.700> progress<00:01:54.060> through<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
showing how you progress through the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.300 
showing how you progress through the
game<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.930> well<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> real<00:01:55.439> sense<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:56.009> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
game as well there's a real sense of of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.429 
game as well there's a real sense of of
getting<00:01:56.729> better<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.930> each<00:01:58.110> chapter

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
getting better because with each chapter

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
getting better because with each chapter
you<00:01:58.710> learn<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> new<00:01:59.310> ability<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.090> start

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you learn a new ability so you start

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.670 
you learn a new ability so you start
with<00:02:00.450> these<00:02:00.630> platforms<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.439> gain

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
with these platforms and then you gain

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.010 
with these platforms and then you gain
the<00:02:02.159> vines<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> get<00:02:03.210> branches<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the vines and then you get branches and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
the vines and then you get branches and
things<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.590> build<00:02:04.829> up<00:02:05.009> your

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
things like that and you build up your

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.310 
things like that and you build up your
skillset<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.509> also<00:02:06.689> obviously<00:02:07.200> are

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
skillset and you also obviously are

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.449 
skillset and you also obviously are
getting<00:02:07.380> better<00:02:07.710> at<00:02:07.860> solving<00:02:08.009> these<00:02:08.280> puzzles

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
getting better at solving these puzzles

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.010 
getting better at solving these puzzles
as<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.849> go<00:02:08.970> through<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> game<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.539> well<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
as you go through the game as well so it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.360 
as you go through the game as well so it
gets<00:02:10.170> more<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.470> more<00:02:10.590> difficult<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
gets more and more difficult but at a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.479 
gets more and more difficult but at a
really<00:02:11.610> good<00:02:11.819> pace

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
really good pace

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.819 
really good pace
it's<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.939> really<00:02:13.120> good<00:02:13.239> sense<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.719> of<00:02:14.109> improving

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
it's a really good sense of of improving

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.699 
it's a really good sense of of improving
at<00:02:15.069> what<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.370> game<00:02:15.519> is<00:02:15.549> letting<00:02:15.909> you<00:02:16.000> do<00:02:16.709> and

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
at what the game is letting you do and

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.170 
at what the game is letting you do and
because<00:02:17.950> these<00:02:18.129> puzzles<00:02:18.519> are<00:02:18.549> environmental

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
because these puzzles are environmental

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.750 
because these puzzles are environmental
and<00:02:19.450> they<00:02:19.719> rely<00:02:20.019> on<00:02:20.049> on<00:02:20.469> physics<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.310> timing

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
and they rely on on physics and timing

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.740 
and they rely on on physics and timing
and<00:02:21.879> things<00:02:21.969> like<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.359> so<00:02:22.450> you've<00:02:22.540> got<00:02:22.659> to

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
and things like that so you've got to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.479 
and things like that so you've got to
think<00:02:22.870> about<00:02:22.959> gravity<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:24.099> might<00:02:24.250> want<00:02:24.400> to

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
think about gravity you might want to

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.580 
think about gravity you might want to
attach<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.299> vine<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.840> then<00:02:25.959> attach<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.319> at<00:02:26.500> an

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
attach a vine and then attach it at an

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.490 
attach a vine and then attach it at an
angle<00:02:26.799> let<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.430> fall<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.060> swing<00:02:28.450> back<00:02:28.719> through

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
angle let it fall and swing back through

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.009 
angle let it fall and swing back through
the<00:02:29.650> kind<00:02:30.219> of<00:02:30.280> momentum<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.480> max<00:02:31.780> can

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
the kind of momentum so that the max can

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.479 
the kind of momentum so that the max can
then<00:02:32.139> grab<00:02:32.439> onto<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.859> and<00:02:32.980> things<00:02:33.159> like<00:02:33.340> that

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
then grab onto it and things like that

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.059 
then grab onto it and things like that
now<00:02:33.939> because<00:02:34.379> because<00:02:35.379> it's<00:02:35.500> all<00:02:35.620> based<00:02:35.769> on<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
now because because it's all based on a

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.800 
now because because it's all based on a
physics<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:36.909> to<00:02:37.030> be<00:02:37.150> quite<00:02:37.359> precise

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
physics and you have to be quite precise

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.929 
physics and you have to be quite precise
it<00:02:38.349> can<00:02:38.530> be<00:02:38.650> quite<00:02:38.829> difficult<00:02:39.129> or<00:02:39.609> and<00:02:39.849> these

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
it can be quite difficult or and these

it can be quite difficult or and these

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
too frustrating unlike some other games

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.080 
too frustrating unlike some other games
because<00:02:51.069> you<00:02:51.159> just<00:02:51.310> get<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.519> go<00:02:51.549> back<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:51.939> try

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
because you just get to go back and try

because you just get to go back and try
them<00:02:52.299> straight<00:02:52.569> away<00:02:52.659> the<00:02:53.169> puzzles

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
beginning and you get this real sense of

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.550 
beginning and you get this real sense of
achievement<00:03:01.060> as<00:03:01.659> well<00:03:01.840> when<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.409> actually

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
achievement as well when you actually

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.800 
achievement as well when you actually

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.929 
manage to solve them and that continues
throughout<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.200> game<00:03:05.379> so<00:03:05.409> that's<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.159> gives

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
it gives kind of more longevity to the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.490 
it gives kind of more longevity to the
game<00:05:06.539> as<00:05:06.690> well<00:05:06.780> because<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.139> might<00:05:07.289> think

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
game as well because you might think

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.480

that<00:05:07.560> once<00:05:07.770> you've<00:05:07.919> solved<00:05:08.219> all<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.370> puzzles

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
that once you've solved all the puzzles

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.619 
that once you've solved all the puzzles
you<00:05:08.759> probably<00:05:09.029> wouldn't<00:05:09.210> want<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.360> play<00:05:09.539> it

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:09.629 
you probably wouldn't want to play it

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.230 
you probably wouldn't want to play it
again<00:05:10.370> but<00:05:11.370> I<00:05:11.400> think<00:05:11.759> it's<00:05:11.879> definitely<00:05:12.029> worth

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
again but I think it's definitely worth

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.820 
again but I think it's definitely worth
a<00:05:12.479> look<00:05:12.690> especially<00:05:13.110> if<00:05:13.169> you've<00:05:13.259> got<00:05:13.289> kids<00:05:13.469> in

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
a look especially if you've got kids in

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.290 
a look especially if you've got kids in
this<00:05:13.919> age<00:05:14.159> range<00:05:14.190> if<00:05:14.699> you've<00:05:14.819> got<00:05:15.000> kind<00:05:15.180> of

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
this age range if you've got kind of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.110 
this age range if you've got kind of
these<00:05:15.590> adolescent<00:05:16.590> kind<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:16.889> preteen<00:05:17.460> not

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
these adolescent kind of preteen not

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.399 
these adolescent kind of preteen not
quite<00:05:18.330> old<00:05:18.449> enough<00:05:18.569> for<00:05:18.719> the<00:05:18.870> mature<00:05:18.990> games

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
quite old enough for the mature games

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.409 
quite old enough for the mature games
but<00:05:19.620> definitely<00:05:19.979> too<00:05:20.159> old<00:05:20.340> for<00:05:20.639> the<00:05:20.789> really<00:05:21.120> QT

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
but definitely too old for the really QT

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.450 
but definitely too old for the really QT
games<00:05:21.680> definitely<00:05:22.680> give<00:05:22.770> this<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:22.979> try<00:05:23.129> it's

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
games definitely give this a try it's

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.879 
games definitely give this a try it's

there's a real gap in the market the

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.010 
there's a real gap in the market the
kids<00:05:41.639> at<00:05:41.729> that<00:05:41.819> age<00:05:42.000> they<00:05:42.389> really<00:05:42.690> really<00:05:42.870> want
