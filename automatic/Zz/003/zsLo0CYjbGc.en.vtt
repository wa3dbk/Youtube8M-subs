00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
in actual fact you don't have to but

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
in actual fact you don't have to but
sometimes<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:36.360> with<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:36.780> you're<00:01:36.930> wearing

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
can really make a massive difference as

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880 
can really make a massive difference as
you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.330> see<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> great<00:01:40.650> look

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you can see here this is a great look

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.010 
you can see here this is a great look
very<00:01:41.400> hard<00:01:41.729> not<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:42.090> pause<00:01:42.299> because<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> whole

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
very hard not to pause because the whole

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.500 
very hard not to pause because the whole
thing<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.500> very<00:01:43.530> monochromatic<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.940> one

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
thing is very monochromatic it's one

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.660 
thing is very monochromatic it's one
kind<00:01:45.870> of<00:01:45.930> color<00:01:46.260> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:47.130> think<00:01:47.400> a<00:01:47.460> lot<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
kind of color and I think a lot of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.950 
kind of color and I think a lot of
people<00:01:47.760> wouldn't<00:01:48.119> get<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> pull<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.659> off<00:01:48.750> while

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
people wouldn't get to pull it off while

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.180 
people wouldn't get to pull it off while
but<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.350> she<00:01:49.500> did<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> don't<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.070> she

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
but I think she did I don't think she

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.109 
but I think she did I don't think she
looks<00:01:50.340> amazing<00:01:51.380> Megan<00:01:52.380> Fox<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.950> think<00:01:53.940> no

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
