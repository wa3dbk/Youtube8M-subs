00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
after you've protected it so let's say

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
after you've protected it so let's say
you<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.899> want<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.290> use<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> UAV<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.369> some

you really want to use a UAV for some
reason<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.500> protect<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.070> everyone<00:02:02.850> in

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
reason now if you protect it everyone in

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.850 
reason now if you protect it everyone in
the<00:02:03.060> game<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.450> use<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> UAV<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.530> someone

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the game can use a UAV but if someone

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.700 
the game can use a UAV but if someone
before<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.790> bans<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.450> UAV<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.409> cannot

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
before you it bans the UAV you cannot

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
before you it bans the UAV you cannot
now<00:02:08.009> protect<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> UAV<00:02:08.970> you're<00:02:09.239> kind<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.629> out

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
now protect the UAV you're kind of out

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.390 
now protect the UAV you're kind of out
of<00:02:10.110> luck<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.800> one<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.310> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
of luck for that one and you have to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.170 
of luck for that one and you have to
pick<00:02:11.550> something<00:02:11.940> else<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.270> either<00:02:12.390> ban<00:02:12.720> or

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
pick something else to either ban or

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.059 
pick something else to either ban or
protect<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.469> to<00:02:14.590> add<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.709> really

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
protect this is going to add a really

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.000 
protect this is going to add a really
interesting<00:02:15.489> meta<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.299> game<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.650> overall

interesting meta to the game so overall

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.880 
interesting meta to the game so overall
I'm<00:02:18.310> very<00:02:18.370> excited<00:02:19.359> to<00:02:19.450> see<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:19.810> system<00:02:20.290> one

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
I'm very excited to see this system one

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.380 
I'm very excited to see this system one
thing<00:02:21.129> that<00:02:21.310> has<00:02:21.459> been<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.670> big<00:02:21.939> problem<00:02:22.150> with

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
thing that has been a big problem with

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.759 
thing that has been a big problem with
call<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.629> duty<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.079> past<00:02:23.260> you've<00:02:23.590> probably

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
call of duty in the past you've probably

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.589 
call of duty in the past you've probably
heard<00:02:24.069> some<00:02:24.310> other<00:02:24.459> commentators<00:02:25.120> talk<00:02:25.329> about

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
heard some other commentators talk about

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.380 
heard some other commentators talk about
this<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.980> competitive<00:02:27.640> side<00:02:27.909> of<00:02:28.180> Call<00:02:28.359> of

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
this is the competitive side of Call of

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.809 
this is the competitive side of Call of
Duty<00:02:28.780> doesn't<00:02:29.530> really<00:02:29.680> match<00:02:29.950> up<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
Duty doesn't really match up with the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.490 
Duty doesn't really match up with the
public<00:02:31.329> match<00:02:31.510> side<00:02:31.840> like<00:02:32.049> what<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.349> average

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
public match side like what the average

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.369 
public match side like what the average
person<00:02:32.769> plays<00:02:33.459> on<00:02:33.760> public<00:02:34.120> matches<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.629> pretty

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
person plays on public matches is pretty

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.050 
person plays on public matches is pretty
much<00:02:35.530> completely<00:02:36.099> different<00:02:36.639> to<00:02:36.790> what<00:02:36.909> you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
much completely different to what you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.539 
much completely different to what you
see<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.540> competitive<00:02:38.109> players<00:02:38.530> play<00:02:38.859> because

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
see the competitive players play because

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.890 
see the competitive players play because
there's<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:39.939> many<00:02:40.060> things<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.569> are<00:02:40.659> banned

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
there's so many things that are banned

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.559 
there's so many things that are banned
and<00:02:41.200> changed<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.939> it's<00:02:42.939> it's<00:02:43.299> just<00:02:43.389> a

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
and changed and it's it's just a

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.149 
and changed and it's it's just a
completely<00:02:43.930> different<00:02:44.049> game<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:44.920> this

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
completely different game with this

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.550 
completely different game with this
system<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.849> brings<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.659> a<00:02:46.780> lot<00:02:47.200> closer

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
system it brings it a lot closer

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.770 
system it brings it a lot closer
together<00:02:47.859> so<00:02:48.189> it's<00:02:48.639> definitely<00:02:49.090> relatable

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
together so it's definitely relatable

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.110 
together so it's definitely relatable
now<00:02:49.900> for<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.260> average<00:02:50.379> casual<00:02:51.189> player<00:02:51.459> they

think<00:03:15.609> for<00:03:15.790> eSports<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.450> year<00:03:16.719> I<00:03:16.870> think<00:03:17.379> this

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
think for eSports this year I think this

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.319 
think for eSports this year I think this
is<00:03:17.590> going<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.829> attract<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.340> lot<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.940> new<00:03:19.120> people

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
is going to attract a lot of new people

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.449 
is going to attract a lot of new people
towards<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.109> eSports<00:03:20.590> side<00:03:20.799> of<00:03:21.010> things<00:03:21.220> that

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
towards the eSports side of things that

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.490 
towards the eSports side of things that
were<00:03:21.609> previously<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.750> casual<00:03:23.229> players

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
were previously just casual players

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.689 
were previously just casual players
because<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.340> something<00:03:24.579> they<00:03:24.669> can

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
because it's something they can

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.659 
because it's something they can
definitely<00:03:25.299> relate<00:03:25.659> to<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.900> lot<00:03:26.379> more<00:03:26.409> also<00:03:27.340> I

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
definitely relate to a lot more also I

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.490 
definitely relate to a lot more also I
think<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.389> going<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.689> force<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:29.079> little

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
think this is going to force a little

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.589 
think this is going to force a little
bit<00:03:29.650> more<00:03:29.859> accountability<00:03:30.549> on<00:03:30.699> Treyarch<00:03:31.269> for

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
bit more accountability on Treyarch for

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.539 
bit more accountability on Treyarch for
patching<00:03:32.139> things<00:03:32.349> and<00:03:32.650> keeping<00:03:33.340> things

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
patching things and keeping things

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.300 
patching things and keeping things
balanced<00:03:34.090> for<00:03:34.479> the<00:03:34.810> actual<00:03:35.169> core<00:03:35.590> game<00:03:35.889> so<00:03:36.159> for

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
balanced for the actual core game so for

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.009 
balanced for the actual core game so for
public<00:03:36.609> matches<00:03:36.819> as<00:03:37.120> well<00:03:37.150> they're<00:03:37.870> gonna

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
public matches as well they're gonna

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.719 
public matches as well they're gonna
have<00:03:38.229> to<00:03:38.260> keep<00:03:38.530> things<00:03:38.799> balanced<00:03:39.250> for<00:03:39.400> public

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:39.729 
have to keep things balanced for public

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:41.580 
have to keep things balanced for public
matches<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:40.269> they<00:03:40.750> want<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.049> be<00:03:41.139> balanced

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
matches if they want it to be balanced

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.839 
matches if they want it to be balanced
for<00:03:41.739> competitive<00:03:42.220> because<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.519> but<00:03:42.669> if

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
for competitive because this but if

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.319 
for competitive because this but if
there's<00:03:43.090> something<00:03:43.389> that<00:03:43.419> is<00:03:44.129> really<00:03:45.129> really

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
there's something that is really really

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.979 
there's something that is really really
overpowered<00:03:46.329> or<00:03:46.449> something<00:03:46.720> along<00:03:46.930> those

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
overpowered or something along those

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.869 
overpowered or something along those
lines<00:03:47.229> of<00:03:47.590> course<00:03:47.979> it<00:03:48.129> could<00:03:48.310> be<00:03:48.340> banned<00:03:48.669> but

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
lines of course it could be banned but

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.330 
lines of course it could be banned but
it<00:03:49.030> also<00:03:49.180> could<00:03:49.599> be<00:03:49.629> protected<00:03:50.349> in<00:03:50.560> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
it also could be protected in the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.550 
it also could be protected in the
competitive<00:03:52.150> side<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.509> things<00:03:52.689> and<00:03:52.930> that

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
competitive side of things and that

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.319 
competitive side of things and that
could<00:03:53.739> cause<00:03:53.919> some<00:03:53.949> huge<00:03:54.519> imbalance<00:03:55.150> issues

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
could cause some huge imbalance issues

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.409 
could cause some huge imbalance issues
so<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.840> could<00:03:56.109> be<00:03:56.139> an<00:03:56.349> issue<00:03:56.500> but<00:03:57.340> treyarch<00:03:58.269> I

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
so this could be an issue but treyarch I

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.030 
so this could be an issue but treyarch I
have<00:03:58.659> faith<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:58.930> what<00:03:59.229> they're<00:03:59.379> doing<00:03:59.409> here<00:03:59.859> I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
have faith in what they're doing here I

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.740 
have faith in what they're doing here I
have<00:04:00.370> faith<00:04:00.639> that<00:04:00.669> they'll<00:04:01.000> stay<00:04:01.299> on<00:04:01.329> top<00:04:01.720> of

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
have faith that they'll stay on top of

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.749 
have faith that they'll stay on top of
things<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.290> actually<00:04:03.159> balance<00:04:03.519> things

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:03.759 
things and actually balance things

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.089 
things and actually balance things
properly<00:04:04.299> for<00:04:04.629> public<00:04:04.930> matches<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:05.799> that<00:04:05.949> they

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
properly for public matches so that they

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.249 
properly for public matches so that they
will<00:04:06.280> in<00:04:06.459> turn<00:04:06.489> be<00:04:06.939> balanced<00:04:07.389> properly<00:04:07.629> for

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:08.259 
will in turn be balanced properly for

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.550 
will in turn be balanced properly for
eSports<00:04:08.889> so<00:04:09.849> my<00:04:10.000> opinion<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.449> this<00:04:10.629> is<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:11.379> is

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
eSports so my opinion on this is this is

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.740 
eSports so my opinion on this is this is
a<00:04:11.590> great<00:04:12.069> addition<00:04:12.430> I'm<00:04:12.759> very<00:04:13.150> excited<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.720> see
