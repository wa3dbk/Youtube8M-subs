00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.840
 Okay! 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.500
 So all I'm saying is .. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.260
 You do not actually have any ice attacks that hurt me! 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.540
 Yes, I do! 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.620
 One name! 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.340
 My ice slide! 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.020
 Okay 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.180
 This is just you sliding on ice to hurt me ... 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.220
 Ice does not really hurt me. 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.640
 But you said the attacks cream !! 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.540
 I slide on ice to hurt you ... 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.100
 Which is exactly what I said! 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.000
 It's still an ice attack! 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.980
 not really! 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.820
 I mean you do not use snow as a solid body to hurt me with for some reason! 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.940
 But that's not what I said! 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.900
 You just hold me still long enough to where you hit me! 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.760
 Will you get the door, or not? 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.140
 I'm getting the door 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.360
 Jesus God Almighty! 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.420
 I swear by God if the Mormons were the last I'm gonna kill M! 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.380
 I thought I told you people !! 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.180
 trick or treat! 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.180
 My God 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.240
 It's a dwarf imp! 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.680
 Below zero! 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.060
 Stay away from the window !! 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.180
 There are dwarfs imp around the house! 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.680
 What the hell is wrong with you?! 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.920
 I'm sorry! 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.160
 Imp "little people" besieged the house .. 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.720
 Have you forgotten what was the day again ?? 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800
 ..What if I did?! 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.940
 It's Halloween! 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.040

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.780
 Black cats 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.420
 Pumpkin! 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.220
 I kicked a kid in the face again did not I ?! 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.080
 Yes, and if you gave them candy you would not need to. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.820
 Why give them candy? 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.060
 Because they will ring your bell so do your ... 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.720
 It's really annoying. 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.220
 So what you say is .. 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.920
 ..to repel children .. 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.280
 Use dessert! 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.860
 This is a great idea! 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.580
 I gotta try it now! 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.080

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.000
 I mean.. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.080
 What is supposed to be a little girl? 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.340
 I am a boy! 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.920
 What a strange picture of BOY you have there. 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.960

 So what'd you learn about Halloween this year? 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.160
 You gotta hit a kid hard enough .. 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.700
 To where he does not remember what happened! 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.160
 I do not think that- 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.500
 What were we doing? 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.840
 Why am I in the living room ..? 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.560
 Just like that. 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.680
