 and the last chord that appears in 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.650
 us in the refrain 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.650
 this is fds 7 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.610
 same as rts only we remove 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.610
 little finger 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.300
 now consider the sequence 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.910
 chords 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.170
 begin with the couplet for this couplet we 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.460
 we will break into two parts 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.210
 chords in the first part we start with 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.210
 chord hm 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.850
 same pts 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.810
 on helmet 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.810
 dts-hd 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.630
 again 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.530
 in the second part that starts with 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.790
 words you carry everything on the table 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.700
 the sequence is basically the same 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.790
 but at the very beginning when we play on 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.410
 chord h &amp; m we have a small 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.160
 difference 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.150
 we do not go after the h &amp; m chord right away 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.710
 on the same chord 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:00.460
 but first we play like that 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:03.720
 h &amp; m a and again h &amp; m 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.720
 and then go on the same 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:22.600
 further consider the chorus chorus 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.600
 Sakur even start as h &amp; m 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.630
 already 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.020
 I am in the childhood 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.020
 helmet 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.360
 we 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.940
 Now consider the drawing of the battle in this 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.300
 song but for starters find out if something 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.330
 that our thumb will play 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.260
 only the base strings will play 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
 bass role 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:59.920
 other movements will be made 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:06.400
 forefinger on the movement we have 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:10.830
 here such bases and down the back light you 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.830
 down the overhead light 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:33.509
 notice that in this song there is 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:36.709
 such moments when I change the battle 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:36.709
 for example one of them 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.700
 movement we have here such on every 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:55.360
 chord we play so you down down you 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:58.570
 down up bass down-up when 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.370
 go to the chord e do it 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:06.000
 such movements up up down up 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:08.610
 then go to the chord h &amp; m again you 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.090
 down up on the chord 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:17.380
 fts again doing an upward movement 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:18.750
 down up and go on chord h &amp; m and 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.290
 a game 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.290
 our god 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.430

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.360

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.790
 song and now you can learn it, I
