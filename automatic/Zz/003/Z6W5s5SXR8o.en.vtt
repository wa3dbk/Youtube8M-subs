six-month<00:05:42.930> review<00:05:43.110> you<00:05:43.919> know<00:05:44.039> we're<00:05:44.789> halfway

six-month review you know we're halfway

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.580 
six-month review you know we're halfway
through<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.569> year<00:05:45.870> that<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.080> was<00:05:46.259> told<00:05:46.440> this

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
through the year that I was told this

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.200 
through the year that I was told this
car<00:05:46.800> wouldn't<00:05:47.099> be<00:05:47.219> able<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.430> handle<00:05:47.639> it<00:05:48.120> would

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
car wouldn't be able to handle it would

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.670 
car wouldn't be able to handle it would
be<00:05:48.300> completely<00:05:48.750> destroyed<00:05:48.900> by<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.409> end<00:05:49.620> of

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
be completely destroyed by the end of

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.490 
be completely destroyed by the end of
the<00:05:49.740> year<00:05:50.659> we're<00:05:51.659> halfway<00:05:51.810> through<00:05:51.960> it<00:05:52.259> I

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
the year we're halfway through it I

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.059 
the year we're halfway through it I
think<00:05:53.009> total<00:05:53.900> maybe<00:05:57.529> fifteen<00:05:58.529> thousand<00:05:58.949> miles

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
think total maybe fifteen thousand miles

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.420 
think total maybe fifteen thousand miles
so<00:05:59.310> far<00:05:59.810> approximately<00:06:00.810> that's<00:06:01.080> that's<00:06:01.620> it's

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
so far approximately that's that's it's

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.860 
so far approximately that's that's it's
a<00:06:02.490> rough<00:06:02.669> estimate<00:06:03.090> but<00:06:03.120> it's<00:06:03.210> probably<00:06:03.690> it's

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
a rough estimate but it's probably it's

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.950 
a rough estimate but it's probably it's
probably<00:06:03.930> pretty<00:06:04.409> close<00:06:04.940> I<00:06:05.960> anticipate

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
probably pretty close I anticipate

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.480 
probably pretty close I anticipate
between<00:06:07.259> twenty<00:06:07.529> and<00:06:07.560> thirty<00:06:07.740> thousand<00:06:08.340> miles

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
between twenty and thirty thousand miles

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.149 
between twenty and thirty thousand miles
