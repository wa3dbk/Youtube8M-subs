so<00:00:03.909> here's<00:00:04.120> an<00:00:04.299> example<00:00:04.390> of<00:00:04.930> what<00:00:05.109> you<00:00:05.259> want<00:00:05.470> to

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:05.529 
so here's an example of what you want to

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:07.860 
so here's an example of what you want to
feed<00:00:05.830> your<00:00:06.069> red<00:00:06.279> foots<00:00:06.580> about<00:00:06.760> once<00:00:07.149> every<00:00:07.359> ten

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
feed your red foots about once every ten

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.740 
feed your red foots about once every ten
days<00:00:08.109> maybe<00:00:08.410> twice<00:00:08.889> a<00:00:09.099> month<00:00:09.510> depending<00:00:10.510> on

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
days maybe twice a month depending on

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.990 
days maybe twice a month depending on
the<00:00:10.900> size<00:00:11.130> these<00:00:12.130> are<00:00:12.190> all<00:00:12.430> chopped<00:00:12.880> up

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
the size these are all chopped up

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.089 
the size these are all chopped up
constituents<00:00:13.720> that<00:00:14.200> is<00:00:14.440> chopped<00:00:14.860> up

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
constituents that is chopped up

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.210 
constituents that is chopped up
portobello<00:00:15.639> mushroom<00:00:16.949> chopped<00:00:17.949> up

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
portobello mushroom chopped up

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.229 
portobello mushroom chopped up
blackberries<00:00:19.769> chopped<00:00:20.769> up<00:00:21.039> mango<00:00:21.699> and<00:00:22.150> I

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239 
blackberries chopped up mango and I

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.450 
blackberries chopped up mango and I
always<00:00:22.390> suggest<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.859> case<00:00:24.130> is<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.339> little

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
always suggest this case is a little

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.979 
always suggest this case is a little
different<00:00:24.909> because<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.179> skins<00:00:25.480> are<00:00:25.630> in<00:00:25.749> tough

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:25.989 
different because the skins are in tough

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.349 
different because the skins are in tough
shape<00:00:26.019> but<00:00:26.470> leave<00:00:26.800> the<00:00:27.130> skins<00:00:27.489> on<00:00:27.730> wash<00:00:28.119> the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
shape but leave the skins on wash the

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.790 
shape but leave the skins on wash the
mango<00:00:28.689> well<00:00:28.839> and<00:00:29.019> leave<00:00:29.169> the<00:00:29.319> skins<00:00:29.589> on

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
mango well and leave the skins on

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.220 
mango well and leave the skins on
because<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:30.220> provides<00:00:30.489> very<00:00:30.759> good<00:00:30.819> fiber

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
because it provides very good fiber

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.319 
because it provides very good fiber
here's<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.410> important<00:00:32.770> constituent<00:00:33.309> low<00:00:33.850> fat

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
here's the important constituent low fat

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.560 
here's the important constituent low fat
cat<00:00:34.870> food<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.470> in<00:00:36.190> this<00:00:36.430> case<00:00:36.760> we're<00:00:37.540> looking

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
cat food and in this case we're looking

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.420 
cat food and in this case we're looking
at<00:00:37.930> a<00:00:37.990> Fancy<00:00:38.530> Feast<00:00:38.740> you<00:00:38.980> can<00:00:39.100> pick<00:00:39.280> these<00:00:39.370> up

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
at a Fancy Feast you can pick these up

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.060 
at a Fancy Feast you can pick these up
in<00:00:39.670> almost<00:00:39.760> any<00:00:39.970> grocery<00:00:40.390> store<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:41.020> that<00:00:41.650> the

key thing to look for on this is on the

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.410 
key thing to look for on this is on the
back<00:00:44.110> here<00:00:44.860> it<00:00:44.980> says<00:00:45.160> crude<00:00:45.460> protein<00:00:45.880> crude

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
back here it says crude protein crude

back here it says crude protein crude
fat<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.470> fat<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:47.950> this<00:00:48.130> instance<00:00:48.670> is<00:00:48.880> 2%<00:00:49.300> look

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
fat the fat in this instance is 2% look

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
fat the fat in this instance is 2% look
for<00:00:50.080> 5%<00:00:50.980> or<00:00:51.190> less<00:00:51.220> fat<00:00:52.150> and<00:00:52.590> then<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.710> last

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
for 5% or less fat and then the last

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.730 
for 5% or less fat and then the last
piece<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.370> this<00:00:54.490> is<00:00:54.730> pure<00:00:55.270> calcium<00:00:56.110> carbonate

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
piece of this is pure calcium carbonate

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.340 
piece of this is pure calcium carbonate
hmm<00:00:57.490> mix<00:00:58.150> this<00:00:58.360> on<00:00:58.570> I'm<00:00:58.750> going<00:00:58.900> to<00:00:58.990> mix<00:00:59.110> this<00:00:59.290> up

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
hmm mix this on I'm going to mix this up

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.740 
hmm mix this on I'm going to mix this up
and<00:00:59.740> mix<00:01:00.310> some<00:01:00.400> calcium<00:01:00.880> carbonate<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:01.660> I'll

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
and mix some calcium carbonate and I'll

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.469 
and mix some calcium carbonate and I'll
show<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:01.960> how<00:01:02.110> to<00:01:02.200> mix<00:01:02.380> that<00:01:02.650> in<00:01:02.710> because<00:01:03.489> this

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
show you how to mix that in because this

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.660 
show you how to mix that in because this
is<00:01:04.540> how<00:01:04.809> red<00:01:05.079> foots<00:01:05.350> get<00:01:05.530> their<00:01:05.710> calcium<00:01:05.890> the

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
is how red foots get their calcium the

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.630 
is how red foots get their calcium the
d3<00:01:07.450> in<00:01:07.689> the<00:01:07.780> low-fat<00:01:08.200> cat<00:01:08.499> food<00:01:08.799> animal

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
d3 in the low-fat cat food animal

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.779 
d3 in the low-fat cat food animal
protein<00:01:10.060> is<00:01:10.859> allows<00:01:11.859> the<00:01:12.069> calcium<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.640> be

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
protein is allows the calcium to be

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.419 
protein is allows the calcium to be
taken<00:01:13.149> up<00:01:13.299> within<00:01:13.569> them<00:01:13.899> red<00:01:14.619> foots<00:01:14.920> for<00:01:15.369> the

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
taken up within them red foots for the

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.209 
taken up within them red foots for the
most<00:01:15.640> part<00:01:15.909> do<00:01:16.210> not<00:01:16.479> need<00:01:16.899> UVB<00:01:17.469> bulbs<00:01:17.829> they<00:01:18.069> are

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
most part do not need UVB bulbs they are

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.609 
most part do not need UVB bulbs they are
not<00:01:18.490> masters<00:01:19.270> by<00:01:19.569> nature<00:01:19.990> they're<00:01:20.229> Forest

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
not masters by nature they're Forest

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.770 
not masters by nature they're Forest
tortoises<00:01:21.189> so<00:01:21.909> I'm<00:01:21.999> going<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.210> mix<00:01:22.359> all<00:01:22.569> this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
tortoises so I'm going to mix all this

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.010 
tortoises so I'm going to mix all this
together<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.759> we'll<00:01:24.939> show<00:01:25.119> you<00:01:25.149> go<00:01:25.840> about

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
together and we'll show you go about

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.029 
together and we'll show you go about
feeding<00:01:26.469> them<00:01:27.749> so<00:01:28.749> here's<00:01:28.960> something<00:01:29.139> there

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
feeding them so here's something there

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.169 
feeding them so here's something there
you<00:01:30.069> can<00:01:30.189> see<00:01:30.399> I've<00:01:30.490> got<00:01:30.609> it<00:01:30.670> all<00:01:30.789> mixed

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
you can see I've got it all mixed

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.760 
you can see I've got it all mixed
together<00:01:31.270> now<00:01:31.899> this<00:01:32.079> is<00:01:32.200> going<00:01:32.319> to<00:01:32.380> be<00:01:32.499> enough

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
together now this is going to be enough

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.499 
together now this is going to be enough
to<00:01:32.979> feed<00:01:34.109> roughly<00:01:35.109> a<00:01:35.139> dozen<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.299> half

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
to feed roughly a dozen one and a half

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.120 
to feed roughly a dozen one and a half
and<00:01:37.810> two-year-olds<00:01:38.469> you<00:01:38.649> won't<00:01:38.799> need<00:01:38.920> this

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
and two-year-olds you won't need this

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.580 
and two-year-olds you won't need this
much<00:01:39.369> if<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.670> just<00:01:39.700> got<00:01:39.999> one<00:01:40.329> and<00:01:40.869> what<00:01:41.289> I<00:01:41.319> have

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
much if you just got one and what I have

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.449 
much if you just got one and what I have
here<00:01:41.619> is<00:01:42.039> one<00:01:42.780> round<00:01:43.780> one<00:01:44.139> level<00:01:44.469> teaspoon<00:01:44.859> of

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
here is one round one level teaspoon of

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.419 
here is one round one level teaspoon of
calcium<00:01:46.209> carbonate<00:01:46.600> powder<00:01:46.840> mix<00:01:47.799> that<00:01:48.039> in<00:01:48.219> and

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
calcium carbonate powder mix that in and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.309 
calcium carbonate powder mix that in and
then<00:01:49.029> we'll<00:01:49.179> mix<00:01:49.359> it<00:01:49.569> all<00:01:49.689> together<00:01:49.869> and

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
then we'll mix it all together and

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.330 
then we'll mix it all together and
you've<00:01:50.979> got<00:01:51.009> a<00:01:51.130> very<00:01:51.459> good<00:01:52.289> supplementary

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you've got a very good supplementary

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.639 
you've got a very good supplementary
diet<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:55.209> feed<00:01:55.450> your<00:01:55.630> your<00:01:55.990> red<00:01:56.109> foots<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.469> said

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
diet to feed your your red foots I said

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.120 
diet to feed your your red foots I said
probably<00:01:56.920> twice<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.249> month<00:01:58.950> mushrooms<00:01:59.950> are

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
probably twice a month mushrooms are

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.529 
probably twice a month mushrooms are

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
as I said this is one way to basically

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.960 
as I said this is one way to basically
get<00:03:01.510> calcium<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.720> low<00:03:03.140> fat<00:03:03.560> animal<00:03:04.489> protein

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
get calcium and low fat animal protein

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.780 
get calcium and low fat animal protein
which<00:03:05.239> red<00:03:05.510> foots<00:03:05.750> require<00:03:06.670> into<00:03:07.670> their

which red foots require into their

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.270 
which red foots require into their

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
system for one's this age about twice a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.970 
system for one's this age about twice a
month<00:03:10.549> works<00:03:11.390> very<00:03:11.930> effectively<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.739> as<00:03:12.859> you
