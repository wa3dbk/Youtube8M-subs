point draw in an earlier video so what I

that<00:00:50.070> down<00:00:50.519> are<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.090> weapons<00:00:51.420> positions<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that down are the weapons positions a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.709 
that down are the weapons positions a
big<00:00:52.620> mistake<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.940> lot<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> people<00:00:54.510> make

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
big mistake that a lot of people make

when handling and manipulating firearms

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.299 
when handling and manipulating firearms
is<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.780> they<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.409> fixed<00:00:58.710> positions

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is that they don't have fixed positions

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.049 
is that they don't have fixed positions
that<00:00:59.550> they<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.110> intuitively<00:01:01.850> once<00:01:02.850> they're

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
that they go to intuitively once they're

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
that they go to intuitively once they're

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
about that real carefully we've already

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.540 
about that real carefully we've already
talked<00:01:07.649> about<00:01:07.800> a<00:01:07.830> four<00:01:08.070> point<00:01:08.310> draw<00:01:08.490> in

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that I'm talking about you know within

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
that I'm talking about you know within
arm's<00:01:22.649> length<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.429> where<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> threat<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
arm's length is where a threat is so I

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.950 
arm's length is where a threat is so I
can't<00:01:25.860> present<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.460> weapon<00:01:26.940> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.660> threat

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
can't present my weapon you know threat

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.840 
can't present my weapon you know threat
is<00:01:28.080> very<00:01:28.140> near<00:01:28.590> me<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.160> if<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.340> present<00:01:29.729> my

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850

is very near me so if I present my
weapon<00:01:30.179> I<00:01:30.270> run<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> risk<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> being

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
weapon I run the risk of it being

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.320 
weapon I run the risk of it being
grabbed<00:01:31.619> or<00:01:31.890> knocked<00:01:32.100> out<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.520> way<00:01:32.670> so

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
grabbed or knocked out of the way so

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.300 
grabbed or knocked out of the way so
from<00:01:33.539> this<00:01:33.690> position<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.380> reason<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:34.890> support

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
from this position the reason my support

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.760 
from this position the reason my support
hand<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.960> reason<00:01:37.289> my<00:01:37.409> weapon

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
hand is here and the reason my weapon

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
hand is here and the reason my weapon
stops<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.429> is<00:01:38.640> I've<00:01:38.850> got<00:01:38.880> good<00:01:39.360> control

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
stops here is I've got good control

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.040 
stops here is I've got good control
right<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:41.580> slide<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.090> level<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.840> can

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
right here the slide is level and I can

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.109 
right here the slide is level and I can
fire<00:01:43.319> right<00:01:43.679> from<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.070> position<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
fire right from this position so the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
fire right from this position so the
only<00:01:45.270> time<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.570> would<00:01:45.810> actually<00:01:45.990> shoot<00:01:46.500> from

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
only time I would actually shoot from

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
only time I would actually shoot from
this<00:01:46.950> close<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.460> ready<00:01:47.759> position<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:48.990> as

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
this close in ready position would be as

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.789 
this close in ready position would be as
if<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> threat<00:01:49.829> were<00:01:50.070> right<00:01:50.579> about<00:01:50.790> here<00:01:51.180> or

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
if the threat were right about here or

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.130 
if the threat were right about here or
closer<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.700> didn't<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> extend<00:01:54.990> the
