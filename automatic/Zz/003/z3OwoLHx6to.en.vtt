00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
game it's gonna be split into three

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.859 
game it's gonna be split into three
parts<00:00:26.850> that<00:00:27.850> doesn't<00:00:28.150> really<00:00:28.269> concern<00:00:28.449> us<00:00:28.720> too

much here what I'm gonna show you is
just<00:00:30.789> a<00:00:31.060> basic<00:00:31.240> layout<00:00:32.019> of<00:00:32.199> the<00:00:32.590> interface<00:00:32.980> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
just a basic layout of the interface and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.810 
just a basic layout of the interface and
some<00:00:35.050> early<00:00:35.260> stages<00:00:35.650> of<00:00:35.949> what<00:00:36.040> I<00:00:36.100> would<00:00:36.370> do<00:00:36.519> to

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
some early stages of what I would do to

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.420 
some early stages of what I would do to
make<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.150> painting<00:00:37.449> using<00:00:37.839> art<00:00:38.290> rage<00:00:38.559> so<00:00:39.309> what

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.399 
make a painting using art rage so what
I've<00:00:39.519> got<00:00:39.549> is<00:00:39.940> this<00:00:40.629> sketch<00:00:40.930> I've<00:00:41.110> done<00:00:41.260> it's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:41.409 
I've got is this sketch I've done it's

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.009 
I've got is this sketch I've done it's
just<00:00:41.470> line<00:00:41.799> work<00:00:42.330> it's<00:00:43.330> fairly<00:00:43.540> loose<00:00:43.809> at<00:00:43.989> the

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
just line work it's fairly loose at the

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.219 
just line work it's fairly loose at the
moment<00:00:44.409> it's<00:00:44.530> showing<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.769> kind<00:00:44.949> of<00:00:45.040> chasm

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
moment it's showing the kind of chasm

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.410 
moment it's showing the kind of chasm
with<00:00:47.229> lots<00:00:47.500> of<00:00:47.790> ruined<00:00:48.790> these<00:00:49.089> are<00:00:49.210> gonna<00:00:49.299> be

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
with lots of ruined these are gonna be

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.000 
with lots of ruined these are gonna be
kind<00:00:49.510> of<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.690> Egyptian<00:00:50.140> ruins<00:00:50.320> classical

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
kind of the Egyptian ruins classical

kind of the Egyptian ruins classical
ruins<00:00:52.500> almost<00:00:53.500> like<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:54.180> Valley<00:00:55.180> of<00:00:55.299> the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
ruins almost like the Valley of the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.640 
ruins almost like the Valley of the
Kings<00:00:55.600> in<00:00:56.350> Egypt<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:58.449> I<00:00:58.510> want<00:00:58.659> to<00:00:58.750> do<00:00:58.869> is<00:00:59.199> all

Kings in Egypt what I want to do is all
I've<00:00:59.739> got<00:00:59.890> the<00:00:59.949> sketch<00:01:00.159> sorry<00:01:00.460> I'm<00:01:00.580> jumping

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
I've got the sketch sorry I'm jumping

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.700 
I've got the sketch sorry I'm jumping
ahead<00:01:01.030> I've<00:01:01.479> got<00:01:01.720> sketch<00:01:01.960> I've<00:01:02.140> overlaid<00:01:02.530> this

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
ahead I've got sketch I've overlaid this

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.710 
ahead I've got sketch I've overlaid this
texture<00:01:03.280> which<00:01:03.850> was<00:01:04.059> scanned<00:01:04.330> from<00:01:04.479> real

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
texture which was scanned from real

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.080 
texture which was scanned from real
paintings<00:01:05.260> done<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.070> bit<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.280> cloning<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:06.850> can

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
paintings done a bit of cloning you can

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.550 
paintings done a bit of cloning you can
see<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.299> top<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.689> top<00:01:07.869> texture<00:01:08.320> mapping

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
see the top of the top texture mapping

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.590 
see the top of the top texture mapping
mirrors<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.100> bottom<00:01:09.340> texture<00:01:09.850> but<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.480> is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
mirrors the bottom texture but this is

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.110 
mirrors the bottom texture but this is
all<00:01:10.720> just<00:01:10.750> just<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.560> very<00:01:12.310> basics<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.940> what's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
all just just the very basics of what's

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.970 
all just just the very basics of what's
gonna<00:01:13.300> lie<00:01:13.510> underneath<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.440> just<00:01:14.470> breaks<00:01:14.830> up

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
gonna lie underneath it just breaks up

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.180 
gonna lie underneath it just breaks up
the<00:01:15.010> white<00:01:15.310> page<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.350> that<00:01:17.500> I<00:01:17.560> can<00:01:17.710> focus<00:01:17.890> on

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
the white page so that I can focus on

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.430 
the white page so that I can focus on
tone<00:01:18.910> and<00:01:19.120> color<00:01:19.270> without<00:01:19.720> having<00:01:20.050> a<00:01:20.140> big<00:01:20.170> load

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
tone and color without having a big load

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.610 
tone and color without having a big load
of<00:01:20.530> white<00:01:20.830> paint<00:01:21.870> blazing<00:01:22.870> at<00:01:22.960> my<00:01:23.080> eyes

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
of white paint blazing at my eyes

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.710 
of white paint blazing at my eyes
so<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.700> handy<00:01:25.120> feature<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.540> art<00:01:25.720> rage<00:01:25.960> is

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
so a handy feature in art rage is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.010 
so a handy feature in art rage is
tracing<00:01:28.720> images<00:01:29.580> so<00:01:30.580> I've<00:01:31.210> got<00:01:31.360> my<00:01:31.480> tracing

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
tracing images so I've got my tracing

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.760 
tracing images so I've got my tracing
panel<00:01:32.500> open<00:01:33.010> here<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.520> can<00:01:33.670> get<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:33.970> by<00:01:34.150> view

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
panel open here you can get that by view

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.630 
panel open here you can get that by view
and<00:01:35.770> tracing<00:01:36.400> panel<00:01:37.590> I'm<00:01:38.590> gonna<00:01:38.740> do<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.190> load<00:01:39.610> a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
and tracing panel I'm gonna do is load a

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.590 
and tracing panel I'm gonna do is load a
tracing<00:01:40.180> image<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:43.000> actually<00:01:43.270> gonna

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
tracing image and I'm actually gonna

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.760 
tracing image and I'm actually gonna
what<00:01:43.810> I'm<00:01:43.900> gonna<00:01:44.020> do<00:01:44.200> this<00:01:44.320> as<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> cunning

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
what I'm gonna do this as a cunning

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.080 
what I'm gonna do this as a cunning
little<00:01:45.070> trick<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.460> shouldn't<00:01:45.670> be<00:01:45.730> giving<00:01:45.850> these

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
little trick I shouldn't be giving these

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.030 
little trick I shouldn't be giving these
tricks<00:01:46.360> away<00:01:46.570> but<00:01:46.780> hey<00:01:46.930> I'm<00:01:47.560> nice<00:01:47.800> like<00:01:48.010> that

tricks away but hey I'm nice like that
is<00:01:48.880> I'm<00:01:49.180> gonna<00:01:49.300> open<00:01:49.510> exactly<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.409> same<00:01:50.620> image

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
is I'm gonna open exactly the same image

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.610 
is I'm gonna open exactly the same image
as<00:01:51.070> I'm<00:01:51.190> working<00:01:51.550> on<00:01:51.610> as<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.940> tracing<00:01:52.390> image<00:01:52.630> so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
as I'm working on as a tracing image so

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.370 
as I'm working on as a tracing image so
there<00:01:53.800> is<00:01:54.010> now<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.550> grayed<00:01:54.909> out<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:56.170> image

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
there is now it's grayed out the image

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.050 
there is now it's grayed out the image
slightly<00:01:56.650> because<00:01:56.950> it's<00:01:57.190> still<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.729> tracing

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
slightly because it's still the tracing

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.880 
slightly because it's still the tracing
images<00:01:58.120> is<00:01:58.570> visible<00:01:59.080> I<00:01:59.229> could<00:01:59.500> change<00:01:59.680> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
images is visible I could change the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.910 
images is visible I could change the
opacity<00:02:00.190> of<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.990> like<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.440> same<00:02:02.620> image

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920

it<00:03:56.410> up<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.829> gives<00:04:00.040> me<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.340> lovely<00:04:01.500> range

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
it up and it gives me that lovely range

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.340 
it up and it gives me that lovely range
of<00:04:02.709> colors<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.340> occur<00:04:03.850> in<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.329> natural<00:04:05.049> media

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
of colors that occur in in natural media

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.860 
of colors that occur in in natural media
I'm<00:04:08.350> not<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:09.340> see<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.549> lot<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.150> digital<00:04:10.480> artists

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
I'm not you see a lot of digital artists

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.259 
I'm not you see a lot of digital artists
and<00:04:11.109> a<00:04:11.290> lot<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.709> did<00:04:11.859> some<00:04:12.130> digital<00:04:12.700> artists

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
and a lot of did some digital artists

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.050 
and a lot of did some digital artists
certainly<00:04:14.170> when<00:04:14.350> when<00:04:14.709> first<00:04:15.010> using<00:04:15.340> digital

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
certainly when when first using digital

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.729 
certainly when when first using digital
media<00:04:16.329> can<00:04:16.750> be<00:04:16.840> totally<00:04:17.109> overwhelmed<00:04:17.200> by<00:04:17.680> the

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
media can be totally overwhelmed by the

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.210 
media can be totally overwhelmed by the
choice<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:19.180> don't<00:04:19.359> have<00:04:19.510> any<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.989> the

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
choice and you don't have any of the

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.320 
choice and you don't have any of the
inbuilt<00:04:21.220> discipline<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:21.940> comes<00:04:22.120> with

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
inbuilt discipline that comes with

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.779 
inbuilt discipline that comes with
having<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.630> mix<00:04:22.900> colors<00:04:23.350> yourself<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.100> the

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
having to mix colors yourself and the

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.260 
having to mix colors yourself and the
time<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.300> comes<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:26.710> doing<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:27.430> the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
time that comes in doing that and the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.779 
time that comes in doing that and the
process<00:04:28.720> itself<00:04:29.110> can<00:04:29.229> guide<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:30.010> whereas

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
process itself can guide you whereas

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.760 
process itself can guide you whereas
with<00:04:31.240> digital<00:04:31.659> media

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
with digital media

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.930 
with digital media
we<00:04:32.830> just<00:04:33.009> have<00:04:33.129> an<00:04:33.220> infinite<00:04:33.639> amount<00:04:33.729> of

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
we just have an infinite amount of

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.760 
we just have an infinite amount of
choices<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.449> that's<00:04:34.569> not<00:04:34.840> not<00:04:35.139> necessarily<00:04:35.289> a

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
choices and that's not not necessarily a

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.550 
choices and that's not not necessarily a
good<00:04:35.919> thing<00:04:35.979> it<00:04:36.639> isn't<00:04:36.789> some<00:04:37.090> instances<00:04:37.599> but

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
good thing it isn't some instances but

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.460 
good thing it isn't some instances but
not<00:04:38.770> always<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:40.270> this<00:04:40.509> just<00:04:40.840> using<00:04:41.229> a<00:04:41.319> natural

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
not always so this just using a natural

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.089 
not always so this just using a natural
media<00:04:42.009> texture<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:43.289> mean<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:44.470> range<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.830> colors

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
media texture I mean the range of colors

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:55.409 
media texture I mean the range of colors
that<00:04:45.220> I<00:04:45.250> like<00:04:45.870> it's<00:04:46.870> really<00:04:47.080> gonna<00:04:47.229> help<00:04:54.419> and

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
that I like it's really gonna help and

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.399 
that I like it's really gonna help and
I'm<00:04:55.509> just<00:04:55.659> going<00:04:55.810> to<00:04:55.900> keep<00:04:56.050> doing<00:04:56.110> this

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
I'm just going to keep doing this

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.559 
I'm just going to keep doing this
building<00:04:57.039> up<00:04:58.500> until<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.530> pretty<00:04:59.889> much<00:05:00.569> covered

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
building up until I pretty much covered

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.899 
building up until I pretty much covered
the<00:05:01.840> whole<00:05:02.020> surface<00:05:02.500> actually<00:05:02.919> that<00:05:03.759> might

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
the whole surface actually that might

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.990 
the whole surface actually that might
leave<00:05:04.150> some<00:05:04.180> areas<00:05:04.780> as<00:05:05.520> they<00:05:06.520> are<00:05:08.849> but<00:05:09.849> I<00:05:09.940> do

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
leave some areas as they are but I do

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.539 
leave some areas as they are but I do
like<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:11.580> work<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.909> whole<00:05:13.060> canvas
