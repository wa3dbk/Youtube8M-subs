00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.050 

all<00:00:02.129> right<00:00:02.370> guys<00:00:04.069> the<00:00:05.069> mini<00:00:05.339> daftar<00:00:05.759> works

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
all right guys the mini daftar works

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.669 
all right guys the mini daftar works
perfectly<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:08.300> went<00:00:09.300> up<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.660> every<00:00:10.290> score<00:00:10.620> i

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
perfectly and I went up on every score i

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.780 
perfectly and I went up on every score i
have<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.490> pro<00:00:12.120> mode<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:13.009> it's<00:00:14.009> definitely<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
have on pro mode and it's definitely a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.040 
have on pro mode and it's definitely a
lot<00:00:15.089> more<00:00:15.150> easier<00:00:16.160> than<00:00:17.160> just<00:00:17.190> using<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.449> good

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
lot more easier than just using the good

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.960 
lot more easier than just using the good
old<00:00:19.850> ion<00:00:20.850> drum<00:00:21.150> rocker<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.840> yes<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.640> more

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
old ion drum rocker and yes this is more

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750 
old ion drum rocker and yes this is more
sensitive<00:00:24.330> than<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.689> ions<00:00:25.400> because<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.730> can

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
sensitive than the ions because you can

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.660 
sensitive than the ions because you can
upgrade<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.750> sensitivity<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.769> your<00:00:29.189> module

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
upgrade the sensitivity on your module

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.400 
upgrade the sensitivity on your module
and<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.340> adapter<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.050> pretty

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and on the adapter so it is pretty

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
and on the adapter so it is pretty
durable<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:35.309> looks<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.940> nice<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:37.760> it<00:00:38.760> does

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
durable it looks really nice and it does

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
durable it looks really nice and it does
let<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:40.140> you're<00:00:40.500> hitting<00:00:40.770> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
let you know when you're hitting it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.389 
let you know when you're hitting it
because<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.670> has<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.530> flashing<00:00:43.530> light<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
because it has a flashing light on it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.610 
because it has a flashing light on it
that<00:00:45.000> tells<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> MIDI<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.289> sent

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that tells you that the MIDI is sent

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.069 
that tells you that the MIDI is sent
through<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.840> I<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:49.710> recommend<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.520> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
my symbol my ride and this is for when

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.810 
my symbol my ride and this is for when

you have a crash for your yellow and
then<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.290> hi-hat<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> there's<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
then this is the hi-hat and there's the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.730 
then this is the hi-hat and there's the
hi-hat<00:01:45.329> pedal<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.880> i<00:01:47.880> found<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.899> mount<00:01:49.229> for

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
hi-hat pedal and i found a mount for

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.690 
hi-hat pedal and i found a mount for
this<00:01:50.520> thing<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:52.040> that<00:01:53.040> way<00:01:53.189> i<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.310> navigate

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this thing to that way i can navigate

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.550 
this thing to that way i can navigate
easier<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.049> works<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.590> nice<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
easier and it works really nice and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.520 
easier and it works really nice and
there<00:01:58.560> hasn't<00:01:58.860> been<00:01:59.719> any<00:02:00.719> problems<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.500> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
there hasn't been any problems with it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.100 
there hasn't been any problems with it
so<00:02:02.189> far<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.180> find<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.990> right

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
so far you just have to find the right

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.399 
so far you just have to find the right
sensitivity<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.009> your<00:02:05.219> module<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.409> upgrade

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
sensitivity on your module and upgrade

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.840 
sensitivity on your module and upgrade
it<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:09.110> adapter<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:11.069> I'm<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.239> try

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
it on the adapter so I'm going to try

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.650 
it on the adapter so I'm going to try
play<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.090> song<00:02:13.390> for<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.780> guys<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.530> uh<00:02:15.570> just<00:02:16.570> to
