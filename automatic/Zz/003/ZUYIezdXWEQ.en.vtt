my fabric Howell is green but I've had a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.430 
my fabric Howell is green but I've had a
previous<00:01:24.630> Sturgeon<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:25.750> think<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.080> used<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.409> have

that I lost that was Green so I thought

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.240 
that I lost that was Green so I thought

about<00:02:59.930> it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
about it

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.650 
about it
I<00:03:00.290> don't<00:03:00.890> know<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.160> it's<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.120> yellow<00:03:02.300> color

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660

I don't know it's it's a yellow color
but<00:03:03.580> in<00:03:04.580> real<00:03:04.880> life<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.420> almost<00:03:05.930> looks<00:03:06.530> like

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
but in real life that almost looks like

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.150 
but in real life that almost looks like
a<00:03:08.170> orangey<00:03:09.170> yellow<00:03:09.200> color<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:11.470> but<00:03:12.470> you

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
a orangey yellow color so but you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.350 
a orangey yellow color so but you
