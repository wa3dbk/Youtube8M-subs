00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.800
 so are 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.200
 Galler dapd I did not succeed 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.340
 but be forewarned if i have the problem and that i am im 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.630
 Internet times 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 he should be apprenticed in the direction of Apax with always in theirs 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.039
 Fighters around the bad habit maybe even if we are now it's finally time 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.750
 and then searched in forums and his people with experience again 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.420
 those who also said Super are sure to decorate them all 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.969
 The hair grows without changing this, which is also an effective after months 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.210
 in still others nothing is happening 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.730
 What would have gone wrong if you want something against hair loss companies 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.750
 then of course you have to first of all 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.400
 If you have a lot of time, you can find out about the diagnosis of McLaren 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.400
 will now be clarified before we discuss the therapy 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.120
 Percent of thinking and the second is that in the discussion forums too 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.710
 quite a piece of information 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.850
 because with it a completely different interest persecuted per cent when I was in 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.770
 Essentially wants to bring its product to the market 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.670
 Okay, that's why Sal Lommer consciously intrudes on people 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.140
 to add their own product to the prices or products of the competition 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.969
 freeze the discussion forums 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.099
 We are certainly one percent of the highest proportion manipulated and up 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:28.780
 this way there is little 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.950
 very carefully with what so percent we wrote that again 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.729
 Ireland are quite simply that information on the Internet generally not 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:37.410
 can trust 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.000
 The Internet is targeted as a marketing instrument enjoyment of 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 oil trader in the Senate 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.520
 Percent that we also partly completely clear and obviously partly 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.649
 until the industry dar 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.389
 those under their own name simply trade all the information 

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:56.099
 to her products and her company herself on the net put her well okay 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.409
 that's clear 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.530
 that by this transparent thing sure what happened is like 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.290
 Aliens must order 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.660
 Per cent then the traders are there simply and simply over the Internet 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.909
 to evict 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.989
 which, of course, also inform about the products 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.330
 Of course then skepticism attached if someone wants to sell me something okay 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.329
 against this background 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.489
 honestly what percentage of sites on the internet can make you a dream one can 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.040
 do not trust information one will be provided it always works 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.040
 to get more information and this against each other 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.730
 if you really only say neutral information that one now 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.090
 Information of the Traun I assume that you definitely more 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.679
 as half of what is presented on the internet 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:40.499
 In essence, front of the percent economists headed for the windy's interests 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.499
 this information is internet put her cradle me then 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:47.219
 when I find out on the internet what is good and what not percent are it guide 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.760
 you want to inform Dessau and not indirectly from one 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.000
 are international 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.830
 and then take a look at the imprint to see if these pages 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.099
 sponsored 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.780
 Percent of what even the medical field is very often the case though 

00:03:00.779 --> 00:03:04.659
 these pages are sponsored by a single company and also the text is up 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.769
 The pages after that sounds that is their main concern 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.379
 To introduce products 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.689
 Percent and therefore here too caution is appropriate because 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.219
 then neutrality can not be guaranteed
