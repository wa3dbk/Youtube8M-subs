can't<00:00:56.309> smell<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.180> television<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.930> then

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
can't smell this on television but then

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.630 
can't smell this on television but then
it<00:00:58.260> took<00:00:58.410> another<00:00:58.469> step<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> started

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
it took another step and I started

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
it took another step and I started
transforming<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> into<00:01:00.539> other<00:01:00.870> kinds<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> food

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
transforming it into other kinds of food

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
transforming it into other kinds of food

so it was completely unrecognizable from
its<00:01:04.110> original<00:01:04.500> form<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.339> about

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
