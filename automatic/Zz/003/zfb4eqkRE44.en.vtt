 tomatoes and add water but not a secret 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:15.530
 everyone who used to cook rice doesn't know 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:19.400
 that the ratio of water and rice is one to two 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.910
 for one cup of rice we will need two 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.329
 cups of water pour and cook until 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.310
 half cooked but rice cooked 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.380
 let's do some peppers 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.720
 we just need to cut off the cap 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.700
 pull the seeds out and get here 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.090
 these films that go to the sides 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.269
 everything 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:44.600
 with that is prepare them stuffing 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:47.900

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.600
 oregano at the very end finely chopped 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.630
 mint or lemon balm after two three 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.510
 minutes we cover the rice with a lid and stove 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.690

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.109

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.580

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.230
 So here is the highlight of this recipe as 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.209
 I read here in this book 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.349
 a little book called grazing in Greek 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:27.430

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:31.330
