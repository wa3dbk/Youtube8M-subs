00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
point I've got to the point where I've

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.690 
point I've got to the point where I've
actually<00:00:50.490> smooth<00:00:51.120> both<00:00:51.510> ends<00:00:51.900> kind<00:00:52.380> of<00:00:52.470> round

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
actually smooth both ends kind of round

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.270 
actually smooth both ends kind of round
which<00:00:53.700> kind<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.970> looks<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.300> big<00:00:54.570> foam<00:00:54.840> egg

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
which kind of looks like a big foam egg

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.890 
which kind of looks like a big foam egg
the<00:00:56.280> next<00:00:56.520> thing<00:00:56.640> you'll<00:00:56.760> need<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.940> maybe<00:00:57.330> I

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
the next thing you'll need is maybe I

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.370 
the next thing you'll need is maybe I
use<00:00:58.290> a<00:00:58.320> coffee<00:00:58.620> straw<00:00:59.040> like<00:00:59.250> when<00:00:59.400> you<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.580> to<00:00:59.640> a

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
use a coffee straw like when you go to a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.150 
use a coffee straw like when you go to a
convenience<00:01:01.380> store<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.740> got<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> coffee

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
convenience store they got the coffee

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
convenience store they got the coffee
straws<00:01:02.490> I<00:01:02.700> usually<00:01:03.000> grab<00:01:03.150> me<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.600> stack

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
straws I usually grab me a little stack

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
straws I usually grab me a little stack
of<00:01:04.170> those<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:05.430> way<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.579> make<00:01:05.850> sure<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.329> it

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
of those the way I make sure I get it

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.170 
of those the way I make sure I get it
dead<00:01:06.659> center<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.530> float<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.490> I'll<00:01:08.700> take

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
dead center in the float is I'll take

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.840 
dead center in the float is I'll take
like<00:01:09.329> a<00:01:09.390> long<00:01:09.960> piece<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> hanger<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.070> wire<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
like a long piece of a hanger a wire and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.249 
like a long piece of a hanger a wire and
I'll<00:01:12.180> stick<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.479> through<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.869> tip<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
I'll stick it through the tip of the

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.170 
I'll stick it through the tip of the
float<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> back<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.700> might<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.090> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
float and out the back you might have to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.730 
float and out the back you might have to
poke<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> couple<00:01:15.720> times<00:01:15.899> before<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.409> Center

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
poke it a couple times before you Center

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.360 
poke it a couple times before you Center
it<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> back<00:01:17.840> then<00:01:18.840> slip<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.290> straw<00:01:19.530> over

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
it in the back then slip your straw over

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.340 
it in the back then slip your straw over
the<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.940> wire<00:01:21.150> through<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.140> other

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the the wire through it to the other

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
the the wire through it to the other
side<00:01:22.440> pull<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> wire<00:01:23.130> back<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:23.909> you've

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
side pull the wire back out and you've

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.719 
side pull the wire back out and you've
got<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.600> part<00:01:25.409> where<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.830> string<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.550> going

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
got your part where the string is going

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.330 
got your part where the string is going
to<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:26.909> through<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.659> that's<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.159> basics<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to go through and that's the basics of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.710 
to go through and that's the basics of
making<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.150> float<00:01:30.560> now<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.620> rig<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.390> it's<00:01:33.390> it's

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
making the float now to rig it it's it's

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
making the float now to rig it it's it's
a<00:01:33.810> simple<00:01:34.140> procedure<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:35.010> you're<00:01:35.159> first

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
a simple procedure what you're first

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
a simple procedure what you're first
gonna<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.030> say<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.659> want<00:01:36.870> to<00:01:36.900> fish<00:01:37.080> 20<00:01:37.350> feet

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
gonna do is say you want to fish 20 feet

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.380 
gonna do is say you want to fish 20 feet
deep<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:38.490> gonna<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.760> to<00:01:38.850> cut<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.180> line

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
deep you're gonna have to cut your line

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
deep you're gonna have to cut your line
20<00:01:39.900> feet<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.159> use<00:01:41.370> a<00:01:41.400> uni<00:01:41.820> knot<00:01:43.159> here's<00:01:44.159> a

and of course you want to leave a couple
little<00:01:56.280> tails<00:01:56.580> or<00:01:56.940> actually<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> tail<00:01:57.930> end

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
little tails or actually the tail end

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.950 
little tails or actually the tail end
facing<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.100> leader<00:01:59.310> side<00:01:59.640> on<00:02:00.210> there<00:02:00.720> so

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
facing the the leader side on there so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.880 
facing the the leader side on there so
that<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> bead<00:02:01.500> can't<00:02:01.830> pass<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.400> knot<00:02:03.890> so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that the bead can't pass that knot so

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.509 
that the bead can't pass that knot so
now<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> rig<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.700> you're<00:02:06.360> gonna<00:02:06.479> run<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> bead

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:07.519 
now to rig it you're gonna run up a bead

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:11.509 
now to rig it you're gonna run up a bead
the<00:02:08.519> float<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.659> flat<00:02:09.929> side<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.409> if<00:02:10.799> you

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
the float with a flat side up if you

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.030 
the float with a flat side up if you
make<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> flat<00:02:12.030> side<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.830> then<00:02:13.830> you're<00:02:13.950> gonna

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
make a flat side on it then you're gonna

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.280 
make a flat side on it then you're gonna
put<00:02:14.250> an<00:02:14.340> egg<00:02:14.519> sinker<00:02:14.879> I<00:02:14.909> use<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.420> anywhere<00:02:15.900> up

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
put an egg sinker I use it anywhere up

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.589 
put an egg sinker I use it anywhere up
to<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.530> two<00:02:17.459> or<00:02:17.549> three<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.849> SIG's<00:02:18.150> synchros<00:02:18.480> I

to a two or three on SIG's synchros I

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.649 
to a two or three on SIG's synchros I
can<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> real<00:02:19.049> good<00:02:19.080> cast<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.739> of<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.659> next

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
can get a real good cast out of it next

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.500 
can get a real good cast out of it next
you'll<00:02:21.870> put<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.080> bead<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.969> then<00:02:23.969> you'll<00:02:24.120> tie<00:02:24.359> on

you'll put a bead and then you'll tie on

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.809 
you'll put a bead and then you'll tie on
a<00:02:24.540> snap<00:02:24.959> swivel

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819

starts pulling the line through and now

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.319 
starts pulling the line through and now
you're<00:03:15.109> fishing<00:03:15.470> 20<00:03:15.739> feet<00:03:15.889> deep<00:03:16.129> or<00:03:16.849> if<00:03:17.180> you're

fishing<00:03:17.629> along<00:03:17.840> jetties<00:03:18.260> you'll<00:03:18.439> set<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.739> for

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
fishing along jetties you'll set it for

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.789 
fishing along jetties you'll set it for
6<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.299> 8<00:03:20.389> feet<00:03:20.629> deep<00:03:20.689> it's<00:03:21.680> just<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.099> simple

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
6 to 8 feet deep it's just that simple

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.140 
6 to 8 feet deep it's just that simple
you<00:03:24.799> buy<00:03:24.980> one<00:03:25.189> noodle<00:03:25.430> they're<00:03:25.760> probably<00:03:25.970> a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
you buy one noodle they're probably a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.849 
you buy one noodle they're probably a

buck or two and you could probably make

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.490 
buck or two and you could probably make
10<00:03:28.250> floats<00:03:28.579> out<00:03:28.700> of<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.879> one<00:03:29.060> noodle<00:03:29.500> and
