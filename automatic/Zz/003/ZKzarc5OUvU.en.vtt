recorded with just one microphone are

one<00:00:20.140> example<00:00:20.290> so<00:00:20.980> we've<00:00:21.280> got<00:00:21.370> a<00:00:21.400> drum<00:00:21.610> kit<00:00:21.730> here

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
one example so we've got a drum kit here

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.730 
one example so we've got a drum kit here
and<00:00:22.420> we're<00:00:22.510> gonna<00:00:22.600> actually<00:00:22.750> mic<00:00:23.320> it<00:00:23.440> up<00:00:23.530> using

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
and we're gonna actually mic it up using

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.120 
and we're gonna actually mic it up using
just<00:00:23.890> the<00:00:24.250> sonic<00:00:24.490> port<00:00:24.610> VX<00:00:24.700> microphones<00:00:26.100> okay

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
record an entire drum kit with one

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.440 
record an entire drum kit with one
single<00:00:38.530> mic<00:00:38.829> either<00:00:39.250> a<00:00:39.280> mono<00:00:39.700> or<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:39.970> stereo<00:00:40.300> mic

single mic either a mono or a stereo mic

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.400 
single mic either a mono or a stereo mic
there<00:00:40.570> are<00:00:40.630> a<00:00:40.660> few<00:00:40.780> things<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:41.050> keep<00:00:41.140> in<00:00:41.260> mind

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
there are a few things to keep in mind

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.870 
there are a few things to keep in mind
for<00:00:42.220> one<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:43.810> entire<00:00:44.200> sound<00:00:45.130> of<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.610> drum<00:00:45.850> kit

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
for one the entire sound of the drum kit

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.220 
for one the entire sound of the drum kit
is<00:00:46.270> something<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:46.630> have<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:46.870> take<00:00:47.050> into

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
is something you have to take into

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.540 
is something you have to take into
consideration<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:48.100> in<00:00:48.220> these<00:00:48.370> situations

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
consideration and in these situations

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.120 
consideration and in these situations
it's<00:00:49.329> often<00:00:49.720> not<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:49.960> good<00:00:50.200> idea<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.739> play<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.920> lot

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
it's often not a good idea to play a lot

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.450 
it's often not a good idea to play a lot
of<00:00:51.250> splashy<00:00:51.870> cymbals<00:00:52.870> because<00:00:53.620> they<00:00:54.220> can<00:00:54.340> be

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
of splashy cymbals because they can be

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.080 
of splashy cymbals because they can be
louder<00:00:54.760> than<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.210> entire<00:00:55.480> drum<00:00:55.750> kit<00:00:55.809> as<00:00:56.739> well

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
louder than the entire drum kit as well

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.520 
louder than the entire drum kit as well
often<00:00:58.090> times<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.450> can<00:00:58.540> get<00:00:58.630> a<00:00:58.690> very<00:00:58.840> big<00:00:59.170> sound

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
often times you can get a very big sound

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.310 
often times you can get a very big sound
by<00:00:59.950> not<00:01:00.610> hitting<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.030> drums<00:01:01.300> quite<00:01:01.750> so<00:01:02.020> hard

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
by not hitting the drums quite so hard

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.829 
by not hitting the drums quite so hard
so<00:01:03.160> that<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.430> transient<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.149> about<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.600> same

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
so that the transient is about the same

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.699 
so that the transient is about the same
level<00:01:05.320> as<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.950> sustain<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.610> drum<00:01:06.929> so<00:01:07.929> when

00:01:08.699 --> 00:01:08.709 
level as the sustain of the drum so when

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:10.800 
level as the sustain of the drum so when
you're<00:01:08.859> positioning<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.490> mic<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:10.270> capture<00:01:10.719> an

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
you're positioning the mic to capture an

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.749 
you're positioning the mic to capture an
entire<00:01:10.869> drum<00:01:11.350> kit<00:01:11.409> like<00:01:11.740> this<00:01:11.770> it's<00:01:12.219> critical

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
entire drum kit like this it's critical

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.999 
entire drum kit like this it's critical
that<00:01:12.789> you<00:01:12.999> know<00:01:13.270> exactly<00:01:14.200> where<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.770> put<00:01:14.920> the

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
that you know exactly where to put the

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.789 
that you know exactly where to put the
mic<00:01:15.189> based<00:01:15.490> upon<00:01:15.729> what<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:15.999> want<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.240> hear

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
mic based upon what you want to hear

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.870 
mic based upon what you want to hear
changing<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.920> position<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.490> mic<00:01:18.639> just<00:01:18.759> a

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
changing the position of the mic just a

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.239 
changing the position of the mic just a
little<00:01:19.149> bit<00:01:19.299> will<00:01:19.990> affect<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.560> sound<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:21.009> lot

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
little bit will affect the sound a lot

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.099 
little bit will affect the sound a lot
so<00:01:21.520> one<00:01:22.029> of<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.149> ways<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.450> can<00:01:22.539> do<00:01:22.689> this<00:01:22.719> is<00:01:22.990> by

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
so one of the ways you can do this is by

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.709 
so one of the ways you can do this is by
sticking<00:01:23.350> one<00:01:23.709> finger<00:01:24.219> in<00:01:24.429> your<00:01:25.270> ear<00:01:25.509> and

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
sticking one finger in your ear and

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.389 
sticking one finger in your ear and
listening<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.679> entire<00:01:26.770> drum<00:01:27.100> kit<00:01:27.159> with

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
listening to the entire drum kit with

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.800 
listening to the entire drum kit with
only<00:01:27.549> one<00:01:27.819> ear<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.090> this<00:01:28.209> basically<00:01:28.569> means

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
only one ear and this basically means

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.389 
only one ear and this basically means
that<00:01:28.899> you<00:01:29.049> won't<00:01:29.170> be<00:01:29.350> hearing<00:01:29.590> any<00:01:29.679> bounce<00:01:30.039> off

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
that you won't be hearing any bounce off

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.459 
that you won't be hearing any bounce off
of<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.609> back<00:01:30.819> of<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.240> wall<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:31.990> you'll<00:01:32.289> be

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
of the back of the wall so you'll be

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.410 
of the back of the wall so you'll be
hearing<00:01:32.770> more<00:01:32.889> like<00:01:33.490> what<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.969> mic<00:01:34.209> will

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
hearing more like what the mic will

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.849 
hearing more like what the mic will
actually<00:01:34.719> be<00:01:34.779> listening<00:01:35.079> to<00:01:35.229> as<00:01:35.439> you<00:01:35.560> move<00:01:35.740> it

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
actually be listening to as you move it

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.649 
actually be listening to as you move it
so<00:01:36.009> to<00:01:36.490> simulate<00:01:36.700> this<00:01:37.029> I'm<00:01:37.209> gonna<00:01:37.299> have<00:01:37.389> to

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
so to simulate this I'm gonna have to

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.870 
so to simulate this I'm gonna have to
play<00:01:37.899> I'm<00:01:38.409> going<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.859> move<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.159> mic<00:01:39.369> around<00:01:39.700> in

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
play I'm going to move the mic around in

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.010 
play I'm going to move the mic around in
a<00:01:39.939> couple<00:01:40.029> different<00:01:40.389> places<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:40.779> you<00:01:40.869> can

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
a couple different places so you can

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.769 
a couple different places so you can
hear<00:01:41.229> how<00:01:41.529> much<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.009> sound<00:01:42.579> changes<00:01:43.090> from

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:43.779 
hear how much the sound changes from

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:47.099 
hear how much the sound changes from
place<00:01:44.139> to<00:01:44.170> place<00:01:44.319> so<00:01:45.310> I'm<00:01:45.520> using<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.810> mic<00:01:46.959> in

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
place to place so I'm using the mic in

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.919 
place to place so I'm using the mic in
stereo<00:01:47.439> mode<00:01:47.619> I<00:01:48.029> have<00:01:49.029> my<00:01:49.240> period<00:01:49.389> about<00:01:49.599> 5:00

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
stereo mode I have my period about 5:00

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.830 
stereo mode I have my period about 5:00
and<00:01:50.319> I'm<00:01:50.529> running<00:01:50.740> into<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.249> road<00:01:51.579> of<00:01:52.029> record

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and I'm running into the road of record

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.269 
and I'm running into the road of record
app<00:01:53.020> which<00:01:53.349> is<00:01:53.499> kind<00:01:53.709> of<00:01:53.740> cool<00:01:53.889> because<00:01:54.009> it'll

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:54.279 
app which is kind of cool because it'll

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:55.769 
app which is kind of cool because it'll
actually<00:01:54.399> write<00:01:54.700> waveforms<00:01:55.270> in<00:01:55.389> real<00:01:55.539> time

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
actually write waveforms in real time

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:57.749 
actually write waveforms in real time
for<00:01:56.020> me<00:01:56.139> in<00:01:56.259> stereo<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:56.770> can<00:01:56.919> watch<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.249> so<00:01:57.700> if

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
for me in stereo so I can watch it so if

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.120 
for me in stereo so I can watch it so if
I<00:01:57.819> push<00:01:57.999> record<00:01:58.499> now<00:01:59.499> it's<00:01:59.590> recording<00:01:59.709> and

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
I push record now it's recording and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:36.039 
I push record now it's recording and
asking<00:02:00.939> to<00:02:01.060> play<00:02:01.359> groove

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.160 

okay

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
okay

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.509 
okay
so<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.620> tell<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:37.920> there's<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.160> huge

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
so you can tell that there's a huge

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.190 
so you can tell that there's a huge
difference<00:02:39.060> between<00:02:39.209> all<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.629> those<00:02:39.900> mic

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
difference between all of those mic

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.789 
difference between all of those mic
positions

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
positions

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.069 
positions
so<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> mic<00:02:41.879> is<00:02:42.030> closer<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> floor<00:02:42.780> you

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
so as the mic is closer to the floor you

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.630 
so as the mic is closer to the floor you
get<00:02:43.200> much<00:02:43.379> more<00:02:43.410> kick<00:02:43.739> drum<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> mic<00:02:44.489> is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
get much more kick drum as the mic is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.280 
get much more kick drum as the mic is
raised<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.329> room<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.750> get<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.170> a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
raised in the room you get more of a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.830 
raised in the room you get more of a
balance<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:46.950> kick<00:02:47.220> snare<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.579> hat<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:48.690> your

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
balance of kick snare and hat so your

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.690 
balance of kick snare and hat so your
job<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.079> gonna<00:02:49.260> be<00:02:49.379> listening<00:02:50.250> without<00:02:50.519> one

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
job is gonna be listening without one

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.550 
job is gonna be listening without one
finger<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.150> your<00:02:51.239> ear<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.750> decide<00:02:52.049> what

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
finger in your ear to decide what

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.110 
finger in your ear to decide what
balance<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.400> instruments<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.879> want

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
balance of the instruments you want

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.550 
balance of the instruments you want
maybe<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.480> want<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.780> lot<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.930> kick<00:02:55.140> drum<00:02:55.319> in<00:02:55.440> one

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
maybe you want a lot of kick drum in one

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.229 
maybe you want a lot of kick drum in one
thing<00:02:55.769> or<00:02:55.950> maybe<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.609> want<00:02:56.849> it<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> much

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
thing or maybe you want it to be a much

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.900 
thing or maybe you want it to be a much
more<00:02:57.299> balanced<00:02:58.170> sound<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.370> one<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.760> things

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
more balanced sound so one of the things

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.940 
more balanced sound so one of the things
that's<00:03:00.030> common<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.540> do<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.019> studio<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.680> to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that's common to do in the studio is to

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.069 
that's common to do in the studio is to
process<00:03:02.280> drum<00:03:02.849> tracks<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.359> these<00:03:03.540> through

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
process drum tracks like these through

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.289 
process drum tracks like these through
various<00:03:04.859> effects<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.519> things<00:03:05.730> that

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
various effects one of the things that

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.449 
various effects one of the things that
this<00:03:06.390> responds<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.959> very<00:03:07.140> well<00:03:07.379> is<00:03:07.769> inordinate

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
this responds to very well is inordinate

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.729 
this responds to very well is inordinate
amounts<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.000> compression<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:10.170> I'm<00:03:10.440> gonna<00:03:10.560> have

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
amounts of compression so I'm gonna have

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.979 
amounts of compression so I'm gonna have
till<00:03:11.010> play<00:03:11.220> again<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.239> time<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.690> audio

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
till play again and this time the audio

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.599 
till play again and this time the audio
you'll<00:03:13.200> be<00:03:13.290> hearing<00:03:13.530> still<00:03:14.190> recorded<00:03:14.519> with

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
you'll be hearing still recorded with

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.970 
you'll be hearing still recorded with
sonic<00:03:14.880> port<00:03:15.000> VX<00:03:15.120> but<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:16.500> will<00:03:16.620> be<00:03:16.709> processed

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
sonic port VX but it will be processed

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.520 
sonic port VX but it will be processed
through<00:03:17.579> a<00:03:17.670> plugin<00:03:17.940> for<00:03:18.420> extreme<00:03:19.200> compression

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
through a plugin for extreme compression

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.890 
through a plugin for extreme compression
at<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.950> end<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.700> let's<00:03:20.880> see<00:03:20.970> what<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.120> does

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
at the end so let's see what that does

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:45.560 
at the end so let's see what that does
we're<00:03:22.230> recording<00:03:22.549> there<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.609> go

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.150 

so<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.660> can<00:03:46.810> see<00:03:46.990> that<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.560> drums<00:03:47.860> really

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
so you can see that the drums really

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.980 
so you can see that the drums really
benefit<00:03:48.760> from<00:03:48.970> all<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.270> extra<00:03:49.450> compression

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
benefit from all that extra compression

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.870 
benefit from all that extra compression
it<00:03:50.110> helps<00:03:50.320> glue<00:03:50.650> all<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.040> those<00:03:51.370> individual

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
it helps glue all of those individual

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.420 
it helps glue all of those individual
drums<00:03:52.150> into<00:03:52.480> one<00:03:52.720> sort<00:03:53.050> of<00:03:53.080> smushy<00:03:53.770> rock<00:03:54.070> sound

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
drums into one sort of smushy rock sound

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.070 
drums into one sort of smushy rock sound
which<00:03:54.580> is<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.730> very<00:03:54.940> desirable<00:03:55.360> sound<00:03:55.660> for<00:03:55.900> lots

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
which is a very desirable sound for lots

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.690 
which is a very desirable sound for lots
of<00:03:56.170> modern<00:03:56.470> record<00:03:56.740> making<00:03:56.890> now<00:03:57.520> there's

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
of modern record making now there's

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.010 
of modern record making now there's
something<00:03:57.880> else<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.270> can<00:03:58.390> do<00:03:58.600> as<00:03:58.750> opposed<00:03:58.990> to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
something else you can do as opposed to

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.900 
something else you can do as opposed to
doing<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.440> in<00:03:59.620> post-production<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.640> can<00:04:00.760> do

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
doing that in post-production you can do

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.300 
doing that in post-production you can do
that<00:04:01.060> right<00:04:01.330> on<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.660> fly<00:04:01.960> by<00:04:02.770> running<00:04:03.100> sonic

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
that right on the fly by running sonic

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.480 
that right on the fly by running sonic
port<00:04:03.640> through<00:04:04.240> mobile<00:04:04.540> pod<00:04:04.810> first<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.650> into

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
port through mobile pod first and into

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.640 
port through mobile pod first and into
something<00:04:06.760> like<00:04:07.000> GarageBand<00:04:07.690> or<00:04:07.870> cubasis<00:04:08.530> or

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
something like GarageBand or cubasis or

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.290 
something like GarageBand or cubasis or
Aria<00:04:09.010> or<00:04:09.100> something<00:04:09.400> like<00:04:09.490> that<00:04:09.550> so<00:04:10.150> you're

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
Aria or something like that so you're

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.000 
Aria or something like that so you're
processing<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:10.990> making<00:04:11.260> those<00:04:11.410> choices<00:04:11.650> on

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
processing and making those choices on

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.070 
processing and making those choices on
the<00:04:12.160> way<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.520> so<00:04:13.420> now<00:04:13.540> I'm<00:04:13.630> going<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.780> set<00:04:13.990> up

the way in so now I'm going to set up
the<00:04:14.200> iPad<00:04:14.530> for<00:04:14.800> mobile<00:04:15.040> pod<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.430> we're<00:04:15.520> to<00:04:15.610> do

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
the iPad for mobile pod and we're to do

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.580 
the iPad for mobile pod and we're to do
the<00:04:15.790> same<00:04:16.000> thing<00:04:16.270> only<00:04:16.690> processing<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.410> with

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
the same thing only processing it with

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.170 
the same thing only processing it with
the<00:04:17.680> guitar<00:04:18.010> sounds<00:04:18.460> in<00:04:18.580> mobile<00:04:18.850> pod<00:04:19.000> as

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
the guitar sounds in mobile pod as

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.020 
the guitar sounds in mobile pod as
opposed<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.690> some<00:04:20.260> sort<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.530> post<00:04:20.710> effect<00:04:21.040> so
