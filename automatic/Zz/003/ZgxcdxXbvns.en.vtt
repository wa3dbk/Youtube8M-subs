00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
made a quick video of the night test of

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.740 
made a quick video of the night test of
the<00:00:10.710> HIDs<00:00:11.300> here's<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.389> full<00:00:12.719> nice<00:00:13.380> view<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:14.750> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the HIDs here's a full nice view of the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.320 
the HIDs here's a full nice view of the
LED<00:00:16.379> strips<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:18.240> then

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
LED strips and then

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.180 
LED strips and then
there's<00:00:20.900> the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
there's the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.230 
there's the
like<00:00:22.789> you<00:00:23.539> can<00:00:23.690> barely<00:00:23.869> see<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.350> HIV<00:00:24.800> bolt

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
like you can barely see the HIV bolt

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.779 
like you can barely see the HIV bolt
photo<00:00:26.860> let's<00:00:27.860> go<00:00:27.980> ahead<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:28.369> turn<00:00:28.520> them<00:00:28.640> all

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
photo let's go ahead and turn them all

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.140 
photo let's go ahead and turn them all
on<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:29.000> foot<00:00:29.270> I<00:00:30.310> don't<00:00:31.310> really<00:00:31.670> like<00:00:31.910> the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
on a foot I don't really like the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.750 
on a foot I don't really like the
pattern<00:00:32.629> of<00:00:32.750> these<00:00:32.960> actual<00:00:33.710> housings<00:00:34.580> too

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
pattern of these actual housings too

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.530 
pattern of these actual housings too
much<00:00:34.940> but<00:00:35.650> all<00:00:36.650> right<00:00:40.180> they're<00:00:41.180> just<00:00:41.210> kind<00:00:41.510> of

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
much but all right they're just kind of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.750 
much but all right they're just kind of
weird<00:00:41.840> I<00:00:42.050> need<00:00:42.199> to<00:00:42.350> need<00:00:42.949> to<00:00:43.100> aim<00:00:43.400> them<00:00:43.580> a

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
weird I need to need to aim them a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.790 
weird I need to need to aim them a
little<00:00:44.000> bit<00:00:44.120> better<00:00:44.300> but<00:00:44.600> that's<00:00:45.530> actually

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
little bit better but that's actually

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.430 
little bit better but that's actually
the<00:00:46.100> low<00:00:46.280> beams<00:00:46.519> right<00:00:46.850> there<00:00:47.080> and<00:00:48.080> that's<00:00:48.230> the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
the low beams right there and that's the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.009 
the low beams right there and that's the
high<00:00:48.559> beam<00:00:48.910> high<00:00:49.910> beams<00:00:50.180> are<00:00:50.390> more<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:51.160> like

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
high beam high beams are more of a like

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.400 
high beam high beams are more of a like
more<00:00:54.019> of<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.140> focused<00:00:54.559> pattern<00:00:56.079> put<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:57.140> back<00:00:57.260> on

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
more of a focused pattern put it back on

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.450 
more of a focused pattern put it back on
the<00:00:57.530> low<00:00:57.680> beam<00:00:57.890> real<00:00:58.100> quick<00:00:58.750> go<00:00:59.750> around<00:01:00.020> here

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
the low beam real quick go around here

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:09.580 
the low beam real quick go around here
bitches<00:01:01.460> are<00:01:01.579> bright<00:01:01.789> as<00:01:01.910> hell

so what I'm gonna do is go drive around

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.190 
so what I'm gonna do is go drive around
with<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:36.330> I'm<00:01:37.330> just<00:01:37.420> gonna<00:01:37.630> do<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.840> continuous

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
shot on filling restart I mean that's a

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.510 
shot on filling restart I mean that's a
low<00:01:42.760> beam<00:01:44.190> right<00:01:45.190> it's<00:01:45.340> full

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.370 

up<00:01:50.090> here<00:01:50.270> at<00:01:50.329> your<00:01:50.420> carwash<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.140> like<00:01:51.259> the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
up here at your carwash it's like the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.660 
up here at your carwash it's like the
coolest<00:01:51.530> place<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:52.009> go<00:01:52.189> when<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:52.460> want<00:01:52.609> to

coolest place to go when you want to
make<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:52.820> video

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.980 

the<00:02:06.620> cool<00:02:06.830> thing<00:02:07.040> about<00:02:07.070> bi-xenon<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:08.030> uh

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
the cool thing about bi-xenon is uh

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.990 
the cool thing about bi-xenon is uh
you<00:02:10.290> can<00:02:10.560> respect<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.160> other<00:02:11.310> drivers<00:02:11.820> with

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you can respect the other drivers with

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.440 
you can respect the other drivers with
them<00:02:12.150> because<00:02:12.660> most<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.920> other<00:02:14.420> HIDs<00:02:15.420> are

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
them because most of the other HIDs are

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.280 
them because most of the other HIDs are
either<00:02:16.370> always<00:02:17.370> bright<00:02:17.880> or<00:02:18.180> always<00:02:18.540> kind<00:02:19.200> of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
either always bright or always kind of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.620 
either always bright or always kind of
dim<00:02:19.640> wait<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:20.910> guy<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.090> pass<00:02:21.360> sorry

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
dim wait for this guy to pass sorry

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.540 
dim wait for this guy to pass sorry
that's<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> low<00:02:22.080> beam<00:02:22.320> they<00:02:22.710> predict<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.340> real

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
that's the low beam they predict it real

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.740 
that's the low beam they predict it real
quick<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.560> high<00:02:25.740> beam<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.180> mean<00:02:27.450> in

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
quick it's a high beam so I mean in

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.100 
quick it's a high beam so I mean in
lights<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.200> road<00:02:28.380> up<00:02:28.530> three<00:02:28.770> nights

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.200 

and<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:32.890> said<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.730> kind<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:33.970> tell

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
and I just said you can kind of tell

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.430 
and I just said you can kind of tell
that<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.610> kind<00:02:36.610> of

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
that I have to kind of

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.500 
that I have to kind of
aim<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.310> my<00:02:38.490> headlights

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
aim of my headlights

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.589 
aim of my headlights
this<00:02:40.840> can<00:02:41.080> adjust

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
this can adjust

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.899 
this can adjust
one<00:02:42.749> blob<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.219> video<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.670> kind<00:02:44.879> of

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
one blob but in the video it kind of

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.550 
one blob but in the video it kind of
looks<00:02:45.120> like<00:02:45.209> it's<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.569> focused<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.109> one<00:02:46.290> spot

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
looks like it's just focused in one spot

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.190 
looks like it's just focused in one spot
when<00:02:46.920> really<00:02:47.359> it's<00:02:48.359> kind<00:02:48.629> of<00:02:48.659> like<00:02:48.780> everywhere

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
when really it's kind of like everywhere

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.229 
when really it's kind of like everywhere
it<00:02:49.739> really<00:02:49.980> lights<00:02:50.189> it<00:02:50.340> up<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.549> lot<00:02:50.700> even<00:02:51.060> just

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
it really lights it up a lot even just

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.880 
it really lights it up a lot even just
low<00:02:51.420> beam<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:51.719> I<00:02:51.780> could<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.079> drive<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.319> this

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.430 

have<00:02:55.370> no<00:02:55.550> problem<00:02:55.880> at<00:02:55.970> all<00:02:56.060> but<00:02:56.960> that's<00:02:57.200> pretty

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
have no problem at all but that's pretty

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.750 
have no problem at all but that's pretty
much<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.850> as<00:02:58.850> far<00:02:58.940> as<00:02:59.210> the<00:02:59.300> HIDs<00:02:59.720> go<00:02:59.960> us<00:03:00.760> are

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
much it as far as the HIDs go us are
