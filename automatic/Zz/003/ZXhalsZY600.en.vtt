00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
thermal convection the hotter water

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.950 
thermal convection the hotter water
moves<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> top<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.710> cools<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.720> as

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
moves to the top as it cools so as it as

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
moves to the top as it cools so as it as
a<00:01:30.990> heat<00:01:31.229> rise<00:01:31.409> excuse<00:01:31.890> me<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.579> warmer

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
a heat rise excuse me is the warmer

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.830 
a heat rise excuse me is the warmer
waters<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> move<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> top<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:35.720> it's<00:01:36.720> not

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
waters going to move the top so it's not

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.450 
waters going to move the top so it's not
really<00:01:37.110> circulating<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> waters<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.040> just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
really circulating the waters that just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
really circulating the waters that just
that's<00:01:38.729> why<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.090> call<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.509> water<00:01:39.750> oven<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that's why they call it a water oven so

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.770 
that's why they call it a water oven so
looking<00:01:41.759> inside<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.540> pretty

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

here<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.079> add<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.369> by<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> time<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.939> that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
here to add and so by the time I do that

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.190 
here to add and so by the time I do that
I'm<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.540> filling<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.049> thing<00:01:55.110> up<00:01:55.520> and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
I'm really filling this thing up and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.639 
I'm really filling this thing up and
again<00:01:58.200> since<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> doesn't<00:01:59.149> have<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
again since it doesn't have the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.399 
again since it doesn't have the
circulation<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.000> 7306<00:02:03.689> does<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.380> a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
circulation that the 7306 does is a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.219 
circulation that the 7306 does is a
little<00:02:04.619> warm<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:05.450> these<00:02:06.450> two<00:02:06.750> products<00:02:07.140> are

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
little warm if these two products are

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
little warm if these two products are
touching<00:02:07.409> closely<00:02:08.009> it's<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.340> really<00:02:08.640> going

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
touching closely it's not really going

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.050 
touching closely it's not really going
to<00:02:09.259> heat<00:02:10.259> evenly<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:11.150> evenly<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
to heat evenly as evenly as the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.520 
to heat evenly as evenly as the
cauli<00:02:13.209> science<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.380> going<00:02:14.500> to

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
cauli science so I'm just going to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.410 
cauli science so I'm just going to
relocate<00:02:14.860> all<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.250> packages<00:02:15.670> over<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.209> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
relocate all the packages over to the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.250 
relocate all the packages over to the
Pali<00:02:17.230> science<00:02:17.650> mounted<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.640> cambro

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
Pali science mounted in a cambro

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.110 
Pali science mounted in a cambro
container<00:02:20.260> just<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.730> kind<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.940> see

and 160 degree water is fairly warm I

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.270 
and 160 degree water is fairly warm I
mean<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.599> can<00:02:58.750> reach<00:02:58.870> my<00:02:58.920> my<00:02:59.920> hands<00:03:00.160> into<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:02.280> or

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.580 
the difference and you see the water
still<00:03:20.530> still<00:03:21.519> circulating<00:03:22.030> around<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.500> it

gonna rearrange this once I get the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.199 
gonna rearrange this once I get the
camera<00:03:27.040> off<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.220> kind<00:03:27.519> of<00:03:27.579> stack<00:03:27.760> everything

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.979 
larger than the smaller sous-vide Emmy
model<00:03:39.060> so<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.090> just<00:03:40.329> wanted<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.600> show<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.810> with

whole turkey you're going to need

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.059 
whole turkey you're going to need
something<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.989> little<00:03:44.079> bigger<00:03:44.350> than<00:03:44.620> the

sous-vide supreme that's where the Pali
science<00:03:48.069> sous-vide<00:03:48.670> professional<00:03:49.239> can<00:03:49.480> be

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
science sous-vide professional can be

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.420 
science sous-vide professional can be
clamped<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.079> larger<00:03:50.500> container<00:03:50.829> for

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
clamped to a larger container for

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.979 
clamped to a larger container for
instance<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:51.819> can<00:03:51.940> clamp<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.329> this<00:03:52.840> can

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
instance you can clamp this this can

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.050 
instance you can clamp this this can
handle<00:03:53.200> up<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.530> think<00:03:53.590> seven<00:03:54.040> gallons<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.579> a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
handle up to I think seven gallons of a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.020 
handle up to I think seven gallons of a
water<00:03:55.299> capacity<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:57.579> it's<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.819> little<00:03:57.940> more

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
water capacity so it's a little more

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.660 
water capacity so it's a little more
expandable<00:03:58.690> but<00:03:58.930> again<00:03:59.170> this<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.530> $7.99<00:04:00.130> and

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
expandable but again this is a $7.99 and

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.360 
expandable but again this is a $7.99 and
this<00:04:00.819> is<00:04:00.940> $4.99<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:02.799> I<00:04:02.829> just<00:04:02.980> wanted<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.280> show

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
this is $4.99 so I just wanted to show

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.420 
this is $4.99 so I just wanted to show
that<00:04:03.459> with<00:04:03.639> you<00:04:03.819> thanks<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.389> lot
