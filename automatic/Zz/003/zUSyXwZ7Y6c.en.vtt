00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.899
 when the shark movie was released in 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.719
 1975 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.759
 very few knew about sharks but 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
 This was about to change. 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.240
 we have analyzed this theory of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.740
 shark a devourer of people and 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.990
 we found that what had been 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.810
 interpreted as a shark decorator 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.630
 in fact it was based on others 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.130
 aspects of the biological nature of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.279
 shark 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.260
 for the first time scientists began to 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.969
 to observe white sharks in orbit 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.950
 natural passing their natural prey and 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.620
 calm and was among the first to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.320
 to study why and how they attack 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.020
 sharks swim by the bottom and they have 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.809
 huge muscles associated with the eyes 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.390
 that allow them to look up then 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.190
 they observe the company moving and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.030
 bull they already catch the white shark 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.280
 attacks its prey from behind or below 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.769
 taking a surprise and taking a bite 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.290
 very strong initial that kills 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.000
 immediately or injures the animal of such 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.380
 so it will die slowly the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.380
 Shark will be able to do away with it. 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.290
 as the study of sharks 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.090
 evolving experts began to 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.700
 question the crucial aspects of 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.700
 theory of the glass devourer that 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.140
 some shark cation people provoked 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.480
 law formulated alternative explanations 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.480
 for attacks like robert bob store 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.700
 then the shark may have confused 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.810
 robin's picture based on visibility 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.920
 water and the wholesale as if it were 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.920
 one of the seals 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.490
 Is the stock a victim of 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.890
 confusion of identity 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.290
 if the shark confused stock johnson 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.240
 with its normal prey then probably 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.790
 was not a devourer of people but a 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.310
 hunter repeatedly hunted in the same 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.990
 crucial premise area in cup theory 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.210
 the glass is blood was right to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.040
 to observe that there are certain locations 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.870
 along the Australian beaches where 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.870
 occurred more than one shark attack 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.540
 these serial attacks are not 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.200
 different from what is happening in 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.200
 california coast 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.640
 she is raw salmon in the north of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.160
 california one of the most famous places 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.160
 by serial attacks in the United States 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.800
 megan was the latest victim every time 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.720
 a white shark was dragging to the bottom 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.310
 by the trapped damage and your surfboard 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.620
 I remember seeing the image of my hand. 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.360
 pressed against a gray skin. 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.360
 very hard and cold skin 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.260
 I thought I did not want to die now strip. 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.570
 this shark close to me 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.620
 as the shark sank more 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.620
 teeth cut roads 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.930
 I remember going up quickly. 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.930
 and feel my hands coming to the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.930
 surface 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.080
 Then I thought, oh my god I want my 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.819
 body out of the water I want out of this 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.430
 Water 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:31.379
 I remember the pain of contracting muscles that 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.700
 had been completely cut off 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.680
 did not take my artery for a 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.879
 centimeter 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.209
 I could easily have died but 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.160
 would be a devourer hunting people 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.440
 for specialists investigating the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.720
 something about megan's injuries 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.849
 it would not beat if we observed sharks 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.739
 white teeth have saws for 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.690
 cut into the flesh but when they bite 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.880
 energy at the tip of all 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.970
 jaw teeth and when a pump 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:08.430
 hit the bone it simply pierces 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.190
 or breaks the bone but the wounds of 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.780
 megan were almost surgical a clue 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.090
 that sharks bite for reasons 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.669
 not always to kill and eat 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.859
 scars are very clean 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.270
 literally as if he had bitten 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.400
 and then gently remove your teeth 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.789
 a six-meter white shark would have 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.260
 ripped mega easily but did not 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.639
 it seems that he did not even 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.970
 damage it could have done if 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.810
 really wanted and after the first 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.940
 The shark attack disappeared in the case of 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.210
 Megan, I think the bite went to 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.940
 investigate the shark wanted at first 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.280
 place to know what it was about 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.270
 something I need with me 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.590
 to worry 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.919
 threatening me or would be possible 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.560
 food 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.460
 in this case they attack with a bite 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.460
 exploratory
