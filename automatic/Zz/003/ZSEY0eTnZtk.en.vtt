clock<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> tachometer<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.780> kept<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
clock with a tachometer and I kept the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.010 
clock with a tachometer and I kept the
original<00:00:58.170> gauge<00:00:58.829> cluster<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
original gauge cluster as is this is the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.170 
original gauge cluster as is this is the
climate<00:01:01.320> control<00:01:01.829> system<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.670> which<00:01:03.000> looks

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
climate control system here which looks

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.060 
climate control system here which looks
like<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.449> radio<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.530> actually<00:01:04.890> right

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
like a radio and it's actually right

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.950 
like a radio and it's actually right
next<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> radio<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.330> everyone<00:01:06.659> kind<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
next to the radio so everyone kind of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.700 
next to the radio so everyone kind of
freaks<00:01:07.260> out<00:01:07.470> when<00:01:07.530> they're<00:01:07.830> inside<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> car

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
freaks out when they're inside the car

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.899 
freaks out when they're inside the car
but<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:10.920> actually<00:01:11.100> climate<00:01:11.610> control

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
but that's actually climate control

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.810 
but that's actually climate control
system<00:01:12.770> alright<00:01:13.770> let's<00:01:13.950> give<00:01:14.159> her<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> bump<00:01:14.580> up

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
system alright let's give her a bump up

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.770 
system alright let's give her a bump up
here<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.299> let's<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.600> what<00:01:15.720> she<00:01:15.840> sounds<00:01:16.020> like
