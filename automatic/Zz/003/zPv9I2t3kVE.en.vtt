00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that when it gets into the stomach it's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.249 
that when it gets into the stomach it's
it<00:01:14.520> expands<00:01:15.119> slightly<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.780> gives<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
