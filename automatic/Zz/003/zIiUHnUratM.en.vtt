 panama looking to revalidate as 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.759

 event that he won last year in port 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.380
 rich in a sensational career on his 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.380
 participation this year in the same 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.290
 event his coach carlos arteaga us 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.059
 commented the following good 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.559
 first of all I must tell you what I bring 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:28.599
 two copies for the classic 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:31.509
 confraternity apart from that in carlos 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.579
 one also came with the magnificent one was the 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.280
 horse that arrived second behind sao 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.260
 in the classic simón bolívar this year 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.019
 in the corner so I feel that with 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.699
 those three copies and carlos one xavi 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.390
 the music venezuela has a 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.550
 quite powerful representation in the 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.019
 classic confraternidad del caribe de 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.359
 this year like to keep its 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.390
 run of triumphs of the last three 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.469
 years and achieve the fourth consecutive with 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.210
 about what you're asking me 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.969
 well my two copies have been seen 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.920
 pretty well they have adapted very well to 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.659
 the court what cost them a 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.670
 little to overcome is the topic of climate 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.350
 humidity has changed a little his 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.040
 staying power habits 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.530
 in the post 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.300
 we have been attacking them as we have 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.740
 I have been observing these situations and I 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.650
 I think that for this week they are 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.240
 they are resolved and they are going to go out 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.770
 provide a show in call of one 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.850
 it comes to revalidation because it won the year 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.350
 past in puerto rico and now 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.200
 brings an impressive record 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.070
 again venezuela this year now for 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.920
 Panama 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.200
 especially in the last three races 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.570
 that Carlos one world has given us to see 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.689
 that does not necessarily have to run 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.280
 like a junkie who manages his character a 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.330
 me who energetic who is dealing with 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.789
 a little with that with that with that genius 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.470
 that we know the horse so why 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.020
 that this year the champion takes 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.570
 Jaramillo and I feel that it will be a great 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.570
 pair with success thank you very much
