 i 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.670
 Y 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.199
 all right 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.390
 all right 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 and to miss already became 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.120
 custom yes and a misunderstood always 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.730
 that they called crazy just to think 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.850
 differently I realized how is the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.010
 people and I learned to differentiate those who 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.610
 do things for the love of those who 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.970
 they do to pretend to be what they are not 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 poor and heart fed up of being imprisoned in 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.010
 this prison of flesh and feeling alone 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.699
 because nobody feels the same as him 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.370
 feels that fucking incomprehension and accompanies 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.680
 song after song when none of 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.060
 them that of them can be put in my 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.549
 situation and I lie but I need to cry 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.650
 to calm the hatred and anger that there is 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.500
 inside me, I do not care 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.720
 shit I am like I am clean say what 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.260
 I want the bastard I do not know what they expect 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.870
 do not 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.700
 I can not change the world as much 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.340
 give a little hope that the one who 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.100
 dedicate at least I'm not I'm so 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.510
 important or you are so important the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.760
 time is taking us all ahead 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.880
 and that there is no one to change it 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.360
 so so so take advantage of every 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.670
 instantly and keep making music until 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.370
 that the body endures since it is the only one 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.630
 that was understanding me find me 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.009

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.110

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.420
