00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello here it's charles debierre I 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.259
 will show you how to make a knot 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.719
 on hooks for carp fishing in 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:21.689
 the boil is good you need wire 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:26.160
 I take 45 hundredths to the hook of the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.369
 6 for the map and after I you 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.130
 so showed up with the son oh take 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.810
 you're doing a loop like that they do not have 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:42.390
 like that make me redhead you red 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:45.210
 put on the hook you extend it if and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.140
 you turn around the hook and the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.140
 son but he must be tense 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.699
 about 10 to 13 is 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.010
 now this is giving it so there is 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.470
 the lie that surrounded the sons with 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.240
 the bvk keith on the other side you 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.400
 take the other son you have left 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.640
 put it in the loop and tighten 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.909
 the two after you will be more than a 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.299
 the one that will be hooked between 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:44.390
 town halls we are on and the hook you 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:46.520
 tighten it will do that here you tighten 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.210
 well after to pass the boilie 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.210
 first on the wire who is here from who 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:59.470
 is the opposite of the field and the greens 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.470
 have made a loop like that 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.910
 now you take your boil is 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.970
 or put it on the brouillette stick 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:21.130
 who a little stick like that with to in 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.130
 loop before the possible 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.540
 a little hard 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.370
 party it is possible 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.580
 when it's based you put everything in 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.580
 background 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.160
 here you open the little thing here 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.920
 like that and toc 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.800
 you put the loop in you 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.800
 close and you push the boilie 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.620
 now two years ago removed the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.620
 eighth Brouillette 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.330
 you put the boiling is just in 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.940
 below the hook meaning it touches 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.610
 a little bit anyway 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:43.010
 here and after you lapointe his 11 years 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.500
 to novara like that to normal is at 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.060
 just seals 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.060
 you slide to the bonito 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:57.320
 that's it 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.790
 she does not leave me and after you cut 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.940
 what remains is a little my father in 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.940
 Russia 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.100
 I really do well 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.770
 cut what's left with a chisel then 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.470
 with scissors or so with a 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.160
 knife 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.160
 this is how it is 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:44.210
 after much more about 30 or 50 cm 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:49.789
 like that after you made a loop to 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:54.280
 the other end room that would come 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.280
 get stuck in in ion halls 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.379
 and here is more than what sin goodbye 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.379
 it was boring to come
