00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.759
 hi guys how are you if robert i know that 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.229
 many of you have a channel of 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.780
 youtube and want to start from some 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:11.900
 way a good way to do it is 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.400
 having an audio of good quality for 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.360
 that your subscribers are nice 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.820
 listen 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.350
 so that's why today I 'm going to 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.039
 teach you how to clean your audio 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.539
 recordings occupying out like this first 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.360
 they have to have a previous recording 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.890
 although remember that once finished 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.570
 the recording should let the noise 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.730
 keep aggravating for a couple of seconds now 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.200
 that we are going to occupy that after the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.810
 it does not really matter much from where 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.899
 graben will have the same results 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.820
 using audacity adobe audition or the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.800
 windows audio recorder does not have 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.390
 no difference in recording themes 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.450
 what matters is the microphone that 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.520
 have on the other hand what we will do 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.700
 with av de cedice was to clean the audio 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.320
 once we have the recording 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.960
 now once with our audio 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.000
 recorded and we'll take it and let go 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.440
 within audacity and you will see more or 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.050
 less as seen in this part of the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.140
 screen as you can see the audio 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.330
 it has quite a lot of noise in fact 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 I'm going to see sirvo enlarge a little there if 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.040
 you notice it has a lot of noise 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.300
 well a a flat line means that 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.610
 there is no noise 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.040
 and it 's an audios to that is a silence in 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.020
 this case there is no silence and what 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.330
 let's do is select this area 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.430
 that has a noise already and we're going to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.820
 identify the sound that we're going to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.180
 do 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.090
 selecting effects 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.859
 it's not my world 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.230
 and we're going to tell you to select the 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.990
 jet option is not profile 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.990
 already that already identified the noise therefore 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.970
 I can already clean the rest of my audio 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.020
 what I'm going to do is select everything 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.980
 the audio 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.320
 again effects there's no I'm mobile and 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.320
 then I will enable the option ok 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.790
 it means all the noise that were in 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.310
 this area disappeared we're going to do it 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.310
 again listening to the audio 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.270
 this is an audio test this is a 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.890
 audio test so they will notice the noise 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.890
 which is present in this audio 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.060
 if they fix how that part of 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.060
 up but we'll see it again 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.560
 and then what are we going to do 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.079
 again the same effects blah blah 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.590
 blah that is not profile we select 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.470
 all 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.170
 and we clean it up let's listen then 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.740
 how is the recording after 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.690
 apply this 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.510
 this is an audio test this is a 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.100
 audio test so they will notice the noise 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.100
 which is present in this audio 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.400
 the minimum river south said can be cleaned 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.400
 more still let's apply it 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.870
 and without affecting the audio quality 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.700
 this is an audio test this is a 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:06.290
 audio test so they will notice the noise 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.290
 which is present in this audio 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.150
 then nothing is super easy to clean 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.240
 It is super useful for those who want 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.310
 start making recordings 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.710
 I'm currently with a microphone a 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.630
 technical audio but before having this 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.220
 microphone I was recording simply 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.710
 with the microphone of my people from my 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.750
 hearing aids then they are microphones 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.550
 basic microphones that can generate 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.340
 a lot of noise 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.260
 so if you want I do not know how to make some 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.360
 recordings for youtube for some 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.490
 I work for yes or studies 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.070
 any kind of thing is super super 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.600
 super useful well do not forget to follow me 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.660
 social networks to see more content 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.210
 more tutorials to gameplays reviews 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.950
 etcetera and guys I'm rubÃ©n and see you 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.950
