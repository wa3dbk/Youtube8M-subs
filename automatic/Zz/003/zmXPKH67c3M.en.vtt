00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.680 
and really pay attention to that
mini-map<00:01:48.430> whilst<00:01:48.700> picking<00:01:49.060> your<00:01:49.180> targets

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.780 
mini-map whilst picking your targets
carefully<00:01:50.320> for<00:01:50.740> example<00:01:51.070> whenever<00:01:51.220> I<00:01:51.369> use<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
carefully for example whenever I use the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.430 
carefully for example whenever I use the
weapon<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.210> almost<00:01:52.540> played<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.869> same<00:01:53.080> way<00:01:53.260> as

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
weapon I almost played the same way as

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.200 
weapon I almost played the same way as
if<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.650> was<00:01:53.799> using<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:54.130> shotgun<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.760> know<00:01:54.850> always

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
if I was using a shotgun you know always

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.850 
if I was using a shotgun you know always
sticking<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.689> some<00:01:55.869> kind<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.049> solid<00:01:56.290> cover<00:01:56.590> and

sticking to some kind of solid cover and

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.130 
sticking to some kind of solid cover and

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
minimum you really want to be careful

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.560

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
them off one by one instead of just

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.580 
them off one by one instead of just
firing<00:02:10.179> at<00:02:10.390> everyone<00:02:10.810> at<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.080> same<00:02:11.290> time

the chances of you surviving a gunfight
with<00:02:18.549> multiple<00:02:18.970> enemies<00:02:19.329> are<00:02:19.959> almost

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
with multiple enemies are almost

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.530 
with multiple enemies are almost
non-existent<00:02:20.650> now<00:02:21.609> let's<00:02:21.849> go<00:02:22.029> over<00:02:22.060> some<00:02:22.510> of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
non-existent now let's go over some of

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.209 
non-existent now let's go over some of
the<00:02:22.719> attachments<00:02:23.319> for<00:02:23.439> this<00:02:23.529> rifle<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:24.040> what

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
the attachments for this rifle and what

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.140 
the attachments for this rifle and what
I<00:02:24.249> think<00:02:24.370> are<00:02:24.879> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
I think are the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.910 
I think are the
wants<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.540> use<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:26.140> control<00:02:26.500> some<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.799> that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
wants to use to control some of that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.710 
wants to use to control some of that
first<00:02:27.190> shot<00:02:27.400> recoil<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.970> would<00:02:28.209> recommend<00:02:28.599> to

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
first shot recoil I would recommend to

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.210 
first shot recoil I would recommend to
use<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.019> angled<00:02:29.409> grip<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.769> course<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.099> really

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
use the angled grip of course you really

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.860 
use the angled grip of course you really
won't<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.610> any<00:02:30.670> advantage<00:02:31.420> using<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
won't have any advantage using the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.899 
won't have any advantage using the
stubby<00:02:32.290> or<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> potato<00:02:32.799> grip<00:02:33.159> since<00:02:33.760> you're

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
stubby or a potato grip since you're

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.580 
stubby or a potato grip since you're
gonna<00:02:33.970> be<00:02:34.090> tab<00:02:34.420> firing<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.049> burst<00:02:35.290> firing

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
gonna be tab firing and burst firing

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.890 
gonna be tab firing and burst firing
this<00:02:35.709> weapon<00:02:35.769> most<00:02:36.519> of<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.970> time<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:37.510> would

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
this weapon most of the time I would

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.630 
this weapon most of the time I would
recommend<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.470> equip<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.860> laser<00:02:39.159> sight<00:02:39.459> on

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
recommend you to equip a laser sight on

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.860 
recommend you to equip a laser sight on
it<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.909> always<00:02:40.030> makes<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.540> gun<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> little

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
it that always makes the gun a little

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.600 
it that always makes the gun a little
bit<00:02:41.080> more<00:02:41.290> accurate<00:02:41.680> if<00:02:41.799> fired<00:02:42.040> from<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.459> hip

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
bit more accurate if fired from the hip

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.430 
bit more accurate if fired from the hip
which<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.209> what<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.420> really<00:02:43.629> want<00:02:43.750> on<00:02:44.319> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
which is what you really want on the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.110 
which is what you really want on the
FAMAS<00:02:44.739> you<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:45.340> always<00:02:45.579> equip<00:02:45.849> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
FAMAS you can always equip the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.789 
FAMAS you can always equip the
compensator<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.140> want<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.349> take<00:02:47.500> away<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
compensator if you want to take away a

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.199 
compensator if you want to take away a
little<00:02:48.099> bit<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.489> horizontal<00:02:48.819> or<00:02:49.180> a

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
little bit of that horizontal or a

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.759 
little bit of that horizontal or a
recoil<00:02:49.599> but<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:49.900> definitely<00:02:50.049> not<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.409> must

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
recoil but it's definitely not a must

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.530 
recoil but it's definitely not a must
and<00:02:50.950> again<00:02:51.250> if<00:02:51.519> your<00:02:51.819> burst<00:02:52.090> firing<00:02:52.329> this

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
and again if your burst firing this

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.630 
and again if your burst firing this
weapon<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:53.019> will<00:02:53.170> not<00:02:53.440> notice<00:02:54.099> much<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
weapon you will not notice much of the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.729 
weapon you will not notice much of the
horizontal<00:02:55.150> recoil<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.959> have<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.319> be<00:02:56.440> honest

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
horizontal recoil I have to be honest

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.080 
horizontal recoil I have to be honest
here<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.010> know<00:02:57.129> this<00:02:57.340> weapon<00:02:57.700> really

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
here you know this weapon really

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.240 
here you know this weapon really
surprised<00:02:58.780> me<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:58.989> was<00:02:59.200> not<00:02:59.379> expecting<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.129> to

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
surprised me I was not expecting it to

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.400 
surprised me I was not expecting it to
be<00:03:00.340> all<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.640> good<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.629> after<00:03:02.079> playing<00:03:02.200> with

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
be all that good but after playing with

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.020 
be all that good but after playing with
it<00:03:02.560> for<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.769> while<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.129> really<00:03:03.430> found<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.819> so

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
it for a while I really found it so

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.240 
it for a while I really found it so
useful<00:03:04.329> in<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.660> maps<00:03:04.900> like<00:03:05.019> operation<00:03:06.010> Locker

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
useful in on maps like operation Locker

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.009 
useful in on maps like operation Locker
on<00:03:06.549> operation<00:03:07.030> Metro<00:03:07.420> where<00:03:07.569> all<00:03:07.780> the

you however if you're gonna use this
