00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.629 

another<00:04:27.870> small<00:04:28.229> room<00:04:28.470> simple<00:04:29.160> lighting

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.929 

of<00:04:33.999> course<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.629> would<00:04:34.810> be<00:04:34.960> nice<00:04:35.939> few

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939
