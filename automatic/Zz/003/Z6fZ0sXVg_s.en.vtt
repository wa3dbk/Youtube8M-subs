series of videos its DNA technology from
unit<00:00:07.859> 5<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.790> first<00:00:09.090> video<00:00:09.269> we're<00:00:09.540> going

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
unit 5 in this first video we're going

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.020 
unit 5 in this first video we're going
to<00:00:09.719> look<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:09.990> producing<00:00:10.559> Dani<00:00:10.800> fragments<00:00:11.460> so

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
to look at producing Dani fragments so

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.669 
to look at producing Dani fragments so
our<00:00:12.210> objectives<00:00:12.809> are<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.559> be

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
our objectives are going to be

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.220 
our objectives are going to be
understand<00:00:14.670> why<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.389> important<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.139> able

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
understand why it's important to be able

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.439 
understand why it's important to be able
to<00:00:16.410> produce<00:00:16.590> these<00:00:16.949> DNA<00:00:17.310> fragments<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.850> then

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
to produce these DNA fragments and then

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.840 
to produce these DNA fragments and then
describe<00:00:18.840> how<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.500> use<00:00:19.740> how<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.550> can<00:00:20.760> use

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
describe how we can use how we can use

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.759 
describe how we can use how we can use
two<00:00:21.029> different<00:00:21.119> enzymes<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:22.109> isolate<00:00:22.619> DNA

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
two different enzymes to isolate DNA

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.009 
two different enzymes to isolate DNA
fragments<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.699> those<00:00:23.970> enzymes<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.630> reverse

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
fragments and those enzymes are reverse

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.009 
fragments and those enzymes are reverse
transcriptase<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.970> restriction

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
transcriptase and restriction

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.740 
transcriptase and restriction
endonucleases<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:29.429> first<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.029> all<00:00:30.150> what<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
endonucleases so first of all what is a

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.139 
endonucleases so first of all what is a
DNA<00:00:31.080> fragment<00:00:31.340> well<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.430> basically<00:00:32.640> tiny

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
DNA fragment well it's basically tiny

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.450 
DNA fragment well it's basically tiny
tiny<00:00:33.420> bits<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> DNA<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.350> what's<00:00:35.250> really

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
tiny bits of DNA and what's really

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220 
tiny bits of DNA and what's really
useful<00:00:35.640> about<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.210> technique<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.079> can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
useful about this technique is we can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500 
useful about this technique is we can
isolate<00:00:37.469> those<00:00:37.980> fragments<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.730> insert<00:00:39.390> them

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
isolate those fragments and insert them

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
isolate those fragments and insert them
into<00:00:39.660> host<00:00:39.930> cells<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.710> produce<00:00:40.860> large<00:00:41.340> amounts

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
into host cells to produce large amounts

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
into host cells to produce large amounts
of<00:00:41.820> desired<00:00:42.120> proteins<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.960> basically<00:00:43.350> we

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
of desired proteins so basically we

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
of desired proteins so basically we
break<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.520> genes<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.329> insert<00:00:45.660> them<00:00:45.780> into

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
break out genes we insert them into

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
break out genes we insert them into
cells<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:47.010> those<00:00:47.190> cells<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.640> become

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
cells and get those cells to become

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.360 
cells and get those cells to become
factories<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.899> producing<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> protein<00:00:50.010> that

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
factories for producing the protein that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.430 
factories for producing the protein that
that<00:00:50.520> gene<00:00:50.730> codes<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.199> way<00:00:52.320> we

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
that gene codes for and the way we

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
that gene codes for and the way we
produce<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:53.039> fragments<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:54.030> use

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
produce these fragments is we use

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.420 
produce these fragments is we use
enzymes<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.989> there<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.739> two<00:00:55.920> ways<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.280> doing

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
enzymes and there are two ways of doing

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
enzymes and there are two ways of doing
this<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.480> convert<00:00:57.930> RNA<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> DNA<00:00:58.949> or<00:00:59.960> you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
this you can convert RNA to DNA or you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500 
this you can convert RNA to DNA or you
can<00:01:01.199> use<00:01:01.410> different<00:01:01.920> enzymes<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.489> cut<00:01:02.609> DNA<00:01:02.879> at

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
can use different enzymes to cut DNA at

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.740 
can use different enzymes to cut DNA at
specific<00:01:03.570> base<00:01:04.470> sequences<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> first<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
specific base sequences so the first of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.350 
specific base sequences so the first of
these<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.140> RNA<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> DNA<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.909> involves<00:01:09.299> an

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
these is RNA to DNA and this involves an

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.070 
these is RNA to DNA and this involves an
enzyme<00:01:09.720> called<00:01:10.020> reverse<00:01:10.950> transcriptase<00:01:12.080> now

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
enzyme called reverse transcriptase now

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.510 
enzyme called reverse transcriptase now
reverse<00:01:13.500> transcriptase<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.610> produced<00:01:15.299> by

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
reverse transcriptase is produced by

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.719 
reverse transcriptase is produced by
retroviruses<00:01:17.990> whose<00:01:18.990> entire<00:01:19.710> genetic<00:01:20.159> makeup

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
retroviruses whose entire genetic makeup

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.969 
retroviruses whose entire genetic makeup
is<00:01:20.850> based<00:01:21.180> around<00:01:21.360> RNA<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.799> can

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
is based around RNA but they can

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.429 
is based around RNA but they can
synthesize<00:01:23.280> DNA<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.810> which<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> quite

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
synthesize DNA from that which is quite

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.219 
synthesize DNA from that which is quite
crazy<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.240> well<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:28.020> really

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
crazy so here they are well not really

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.350 
crazy so here they are well not really
but<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.590> know<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> idea<00:01:29.790> behind<00:01:29.970> these

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
but you know and the idea behind these

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.899 
but you know and the idea behind these
guys<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.229> they<00:01:31.380> synthesize<00:01:31.890> DNA<00:01:32.159> from

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
guys is that they synthesize DNA from

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.550 
guys is that they synthesize DNA from
RNA<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.720> let's<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> look<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.259> how<00:01:34.409> these

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
RNA so let's have a look at how these

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520 
RNA so let's have a look at how these
guys<00:01:34.770> work<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.240> how<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.900> make<00:01:37.110> these

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
guys work so how do we make these

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.280 
guys work so how do we make these
reverse<00:01:38.369> transcriptase<00:01:39.270> enzymes<00:01:39.780> work<00:01:40.049> for

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
reverse transcriptase enzymes work for

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.340 
reverse transcriptase enzymes work for
us<00:01:40.439> well<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> first<00:01:41.490> step<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.509> find<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.049> cell

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
us well the first step is to find a cell

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.399 
us well the first step is to find a cell
that<00:01:43.860> readily<00:01:44.250> produces<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.329> protein<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
that readily produces the protein that

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.789 
that readily produces the protein that
we<00:01:46.590> want<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> here's<00:01:48.840> our<00:01:48.960> cell<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.439> there's

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
we want so here's our cell and there's

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.300 
we want so here's our cell and there's
some<00:01:49.979> protein<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.450> second<00:01:51.869> stage<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.890> find

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
some protein the second stage is we find

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.539 
some protein the second stage is we find
some<00:01:53.880> our<00:01:54.090> M<00:01:54.450> RNA<00:01:55.290> messenger<00:01:55.619> RNA<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.490> we

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
some our M RNA messenger RNA and we

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.999 
some our M RNA messenger RNA and we
extract<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.869> here's<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.140> sequence<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.680> mRNA

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
extract it so here's a sequence of mRNA

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.380 
extract it so here's a sequence of mRNA
that<00:01:59.340> codes<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.869> desired<00:02:01.259> gene<00:02:02.390> then

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
that codes for the the desired gene then

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.109 
that codes for the the desired gene then
we<00:02:03.780> use<00:02:04.020> reverse<00:02:04.829> transcriptase<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
we use reverse transcriptase to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.540 
we use reverse transcriptase to
synthesize<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.710> complementary<00:02:07.710> DNA<00:02:07.890> strand

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
synthesize a complementary DNA strand

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.890 
synthesize a complementary DNA strand
from<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.539> mRNA<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.739> here's<00:02:10.920> our<00:02:11.069> mRNA<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.000> we

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
from that mRNA so here's our mRNA and we

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.830 
from that mRNA so here's our mRNA and we
use<00:02:13.140> reverse

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
use reverse

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.380 
use reverse
transcriptase<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:15.160> produce<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.640> single<00:02:16.060> strand

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
transcriptase to produce a single strand

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.270 
transcriptase to produce a single strand
of<00:02:16.620> complementary<00:02:17.620> DNA<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:20.709> can<00:02:20.920> call<00:02:21.129> this

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
of complementary DNA so we can call this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.119 
of complementary DNA so we can call this
cDNA<00:02:22.000> in<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.420> C<00:02:22.660> stands<00:02:23.319> for<00:02:23.349> complimentary

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
cDNA in the C stands for complimentary

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.420 
cDNA in the C stands for complimentary
in<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:25.540> fourth<00:02:25.900> stage<00:02:26.230> we're<00:02:26.920> going<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.250> use

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
in the fourth stage we're going to use

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.940 
in the fourth stage we're going to use
another<00:02:27.730> enzyme<00:02:28.180> which<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.959> DNA<00:02:29.319> polymerase

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
another enzyme which is DNA polymerase

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.089 
another enzyme which is DNA polymerase
to<00:02:30.310> add<00:02:30.700> complementary<00:02:31.660> nucleotides<00:02:32.349> on<00:02:32.620> to

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
to add complementary nucleotides on to

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.759 
to add complementary nucleotides on to
that<00:02:33.250> cDNA<00:02:33.940> template<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.269> go<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:38.379> DNA

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
that cDNA template there we go so DNA

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.729 
that cDNA template there we go so DNA
polymerase<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.489> time<00:02:39.700> doing<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.060> work<00:02:40.209> and

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
polymerase this time doing the work and

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.490 
polymerase this time doing the work and
this<00:02:41.739> gives<00:02:42.040> us<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.900> copy<00:02:43.900> of<00:02:44.260> our<00:02:44.709> desired<00:02:45.250> gene

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
this gives us a copy of our desired gene

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.860 
this gives us a copy of our desired gene
and<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:47.620> can<00:02:47.799> use<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.220> synthesize<00:02:49.150> lots

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
and we can use that to synthesize lots

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.390 
and we can use that to synthesize lots
of<00:02:49.930> large<00:02:50.380> amounts<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.709> proteins<00:02:51.130> but<00:02:51.280> we'll

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
of large amounts of proteins but we'll

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.789 
of large amounts of proteins but we'll
look<00:02:51.519> at<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:51.849> a<00:02:51.880> different<00:02:52.120> video<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
look at that in a different video so the

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.259 
look at that in a different video so the
other<00:02:53.950> method<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.489> by<00:02:54.610> using<00:02:54.640> these<00:02:55.000> things

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
other method is by using these things

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.330 
other method is by using these things
called<00:02:55.569> restriction<00:02:56.079> endonucleases<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
called restriction endonucleases and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.910 
called restriction endonucleases and
these<00:02:58.030> are<00:02:58.150> produced<00:02:58.390> by<00:02:58.510> bacteria<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.319> they

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
these are produced by bacteria and they

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.880 
these are produced by bacteria and they
cut<00:03:00.190> DNA<00:03:00.579> at<00:03:01.030> very<00:03:01.510> specific<00:03:01.690> base<00:03:02.260> sequences

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
cut DNA at very specific base sequences

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.369 
cut DNA at very specific base sequences
and<00:03:03.069> there<00:03:03.790> are<00:03:03.910> loads<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.599> these<00:03:04.720> guys<00:03:04.989> loads

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
and there are loads of these guys loads

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.780 
and there are loads of these guys loads
of<00:03:05.530> restriction<00:03:06.010> endonucleases

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
of restriction endonucleases

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.000 
of restriction endonucleases
they're<00:03:07.299> all<00:03:07.540> cut<00:03:07.930> at<00:03:08.140> different<00:03:08.769> base

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
they're all cut at different base

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.530 
they're all cut at different base
sequences<00:03:09.610> which<00:03:09.790> gives<00:03:10.000> us<00:03:10.120> quite<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.360> lot<00:03:10.450> of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
sequences which gives us quite a lot of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.500 
sequences which gives us quite a lot of
power<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.170> trim<00:03:11.920> out<00:03:12.069> specific<00:03:12.940> parts<00:03:13.269> of<00:03:13.390> DNA

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
power to trim out specific parts of DNA

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.170 
power to trim out specific parts of DNA
and<00:03:14.069> depending<00:03:15.069> on<00:03:15.160> how<00:03:15.280> they<00:03:15.459> cut<00:03:15.760> they<00:03:16.000> can

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
and depending on how they cut they can

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.360 
and depending on how they cut they can
either<00:03:16.269> form<00:03:16.629> blunt<00:03:17.019> ends<00:03:17.530> are<00:03:17.650> these<00:03:18.190> things

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
either form blunt ends are these things

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.650 
either form blunt ends are these things
called<00:03:18.609> sticky<00:03:19.030> ends<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.389> these<00:03:19.480> will<00:03:19.630> come

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
called sticky ends and these will come

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.849 
called sticky ends and these will come
in<00:03:19.780> handy<00:03:20.139> later<00:03:20.170> on<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:22.150> here<00:03:22.630> we're<00:03:23.590> going<00:03:23.769> to

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
in handy later on so here we're going to

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.270 
in handy later on so here we're going to
look<00:03:23.980> at<00:03:24.190> here's<00:03:24.819> a<00:03:24.970> section<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.660> DNA<00:03:26.280> and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
look at here's a section of DNA and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.500 
look at here's a section of DNA and
we're<00:03:27.430> going<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.609> look<00:03:27.670> at<00:03:27.819> what<00:03:27.940> happens<00:03:28.299> if

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
we're going to look at what happens if

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.960 
we're going to look at what happens if
the<00:03:28.720> enzyme<00:03:29.019> cuts<00:03:29.319> in<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.500> straight<00:03:29.769> line<00:03:29.970> so

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
the enzyme cuts in a straight line so

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.470 
the enzyme cuts in a straight line so
first<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.870> all<00:03:32.040> like<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.099> said<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.609> enzymes<00:03:34.000> cut

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
first of all like I said the enzymes cut

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.420 
first of all like I said the enzymes cut
in<00:03:34.720> very<00:03:34.959> specific<00:03:35.290> places<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.889> they<00:03:36.160> find

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
in very specific places and they find

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.099 
in very specific places and they find
something<00:03:36.730> called<00:03:36.849> a<00:03:37.000> recognition<00:03:37.630> sequence

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
something called a recognition sequence

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.110 
something called a recognition sequence
which<00:03:38.290> tells<00:03:38.560> them<00:03:38.709> where<00:03:38.889> to<00:03:39.040> cut<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.910> it's<00:03:40.030> a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
which tells them where to cut so it's a

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.640 
which tells them where to cut so it's a
specific<00:03:40.359> base<00:03:40.840> sequence<00:03:41.349> that<00:03:41.500> they

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
specific base sequence that they

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.210 
specific base sequence that they
recognize<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:43.209> if<00:03:43.510> they<00:03:44.470> cut<00:03:44.709> in<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:44.889> straight

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
recognize so if they cut in a straight

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.690 
recognize so if they cut in a straight
line<00:03:45.419> like<00:03:46.419> so<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:47.099> that's<00:03:48.099> going<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.370> form

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
line like so and that's going to form

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.990 
line like so and that's going to form
these<00:03:49.060> things<00:03:49.329> called<00:03:49.510> blunt<00:03:49.870> ends<00:03:51.000> where

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
these things called blunt ends where

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.909 
these things called blunt ends where
there<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.299> you<00:03:52.840> know<00:03:52.870> just<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.290> straight<00:03:53.650> cut

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
there is you know just a straight cut

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.670 
there is you know just a straight cut
through<00:03:54.160> both<00:03:54.400> strands<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.000> DNA<00:03:55.560> which<00:03:56.560> is

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
through both strands of the DNA which is

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.120 
through both strands of the DNA which is
fair<00:03:56.889> enough

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
fair enough

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.150 
fair enough
but<00:03:58.090> really<00:03:58.569> to<00:03:58.810> be<00:03:58.930> able<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.200> have<00:03:59.380> power<00:03:59.889> to

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
but really to be able to have power to

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.830 
but really to be able to have power to
piece<00:04:00.400> these<00:04:00.609> things<00:04:00.940> back<00:04:01.120> together<00:04:01.299> later

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
piece these things back together later

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.009 
piece these things back together later
we<00:04:02.230> want<00:04:02.470> sticky<00:04:02.980> ends<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:04.450> do<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:04.810> we

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
we want sticky ends and to do this we

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.199 
we want sticky ends and to do this we
need<00:04:05.049> restriction<00:04:05.829> endonucleases<00:04:06.669> that<00:04:07.030> make

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
need restriction endonucleases that make

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.690 
need restriction endonucleases that make
a<00:04:07.239> staggered<00:04:07.840> cut<00:04:08.169> so<00:04:09.040> still<00:04:09.370> we<00:04:09.519> have<00:04:09.669> a

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
a staggered cut so still we have a

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.110 
a staggered cut so still we have a
recognition<00:04:10.120> sequence<00:04:10.750> but<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:11.620> this<00:04:11.799> case<00:04:12.130> we

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
recognition sequence but in this case we

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.860 
recognition sequence but in this case we
make<00:04:13.349> cut<00:04:14.349> in<00:04:14.620> two<00:04:14.889> different<00:04:15.160> places<00:04:15.870> and

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
make cut in two different places and

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.479 
make cut in two different places and
that<00:04:17.049> forms<00:04:17.470> these<00:04:17.620> things<00:04:17.889> called<00:04:18.160> sticky

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
that forms these things called sticky

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.640 
that forms these things called sticky
ends<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.539> those<00:04:19.660> sticky<00:04:20.079> ends<00:04:20.410> are

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
ends and those sticky ends are

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.339 
ends and those sticky ends are
complementary<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:21.669> one<00:04:21.789> another<00:04:22.110> so<00:04:23.110> this

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
complementary to one another so this

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.010 
complementary to one another so this
means<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.740> if<00:04:23.890> you<00:04:24.039> cut<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:25.240> same<00:04:25.539> if<00:04:25.810> you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
means that if you cut the same if you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.629 
means that if you cut the same if you
could<00:04:26.260> DNA

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
could DNA

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.459 
could DNA
with<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:27.909> same<00:04:28.180> restriction<00:04:28.780> endonuclease

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
with the same restriction endonuclease

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.529 
with the same restriction endonuclease
you'll<00:04:30.009> end<00:04:30.159> up<00:04:30.249> with<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.550> same<00:04:30.819> sticky<00:04:31.240> ends

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
you'll end up with the same sticky ends

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.189 
you'll end up with the same sticky ends
so<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.080> can<00:04:32.349> piece<00:04:32.710> together<00:04:34.020> different<00:04:35.020> bits

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
so you can piece together different bits

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.589 
so you can piece together different bits
of<00:04:35.379> DNA<00:04:35.830> nice<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.610> easily<00:04:36.939> and<00:04:37.150> we'll<00:04:37.360> look<00:04:37.449> at

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
of DNA nice and easily and we'll look at

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.260 
of DNA nice and easily and we'll look at
this<00:04:37.689> in<00:04:37.749> the<00:04:37.900> next<00:04:38.020> video<00:04:38.789> so<00:04:39.789> to<00:04:39.879> summarize

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
this in the next video so to summarize

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.600 
this in the next video so to summarize
we<00:04:41.020> can<00:04:41.229> produce<00:04:41.379> DNA<00:04:41.889> fragments<00:04:42.400> by

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
we can produce DNA fragments by

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.570 
we can produce DNA fragments by
synthesizing<00:04:43.210> DNA<00:04:43.900> from<00:04:44.349> RNA<00:04:44.590> using<00:04:45.340> reverse

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
synthesizing DNA from RNA using reverse

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.570 
synthesizing DNA from RNA using reverse
transcriptase<00:04:46.650> we<00:04:47.650> can<00:04:47.889> use<00:04:48.069> restriction

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
transcriptase we can use restriction

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.640 
transcriptase we can use restriction
endonucleases<00:04:49.270> which<00:04:49.900> could<00:04:50.110> DNA<00:04:50.529> at

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
endonucleases which could DNA at

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.040 
endonucleases which could DNA at
specific<00:04:50.680> base<00:04:51.249> sequences<00:04:51.849> and<00:04:52.050> the

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
specific base sequences and the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.559 
specific base sequences and the
production<00:04:53.379> of<00:04:53.740> sticky<00:04:54.189> ends<00:04:54.430> is<00:04:54.580> useful<00:04:55.419> for

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
production of sticky ends is useful for

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.450 
production of sticky ends is useful for
joining<00:04:55.930> fragments<00:04:56.319> together<00:04:56.439> I<00:04:56.800> hope<00:04:57.279> that's

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
joining fragments together I hope that's

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.070 
joining fragments together I hope that's
been<00:04:57.580> useful<00:04:57.639> guys<00:04:58.060> thank<00:04:58.449> you<00:04:58.569> very<00:04:58.749> much<00:04:58.930> for
