00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 until March 30 stands everywhere 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.879
 in France the eighth edition of the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 week without pesticides or for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.360
 alternatives to pesticides the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.769
 individuals open their garden to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.019
 public to discover their universe 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.179
 vegetable garden and show that a garden can 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.250
 be treated in a 100% natural way 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.590
 for almost two years to and not a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.720
 couple embarked on the adventure of a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.750
 garden without phytosanitary products 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.800
 report of emmanuel le bellego 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.869
 welcome to the family garden of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.550
 sylvaine and gregory a space of 600 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.019
 square meters and soon 1500 meters 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 additional squares put into culture 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.230
 this year in this place the man and the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.180
 listen to nature no products 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 phytosanitary one cultivates sancerre and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.239
 no-till are instead the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.140
 hand tools the strength and the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.640
 human sensitivity 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 we call this approach the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 permaculture nature finds its place 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 in fact gardening more in fighting 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.399
 nature but he works his garden 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 in partnership with nature so me 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.890
 I see that in the idea of 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.180
 bring back life in a garden in the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.340
 earth than those in the real earth that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.660
 a lot of micro organisms from worms 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.949
 earth working in my place it's 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.870
 they who plow the earth is more me 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.720
 so I'm breaking it so it's 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.640
 very nice and next to that it's 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.680
 also bring life off the ground so 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.160
 a lot of bio diversity a lot of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.840
 plants 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.430
 the goal is year-round production 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.869
 seasonal fruits and vegetables 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.280
 family of four benefit 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.990
 thanks to this garden of autonomy 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.640
 food from mid-May to the end of January 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 but the concern of every gardener is 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.670
 some insects and bad ones 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 herbs or rather wild herbs 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.270
 but here no pesticides the technique 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.410
 it's mulching and sheltering 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.530
 insects one installs a whole system of 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.800
 mulching in our paths to limit 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.899
 our weeding work in the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.810
 aisles so we install like you 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.590
 can see it from the carton the carton it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:02:02.250
 prevents the light from passing but by 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:03.720
 above everything in this space 100% natural 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.409
 the man must listen to the plants 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.290
 and their needs 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.390
 I did different type goal so there the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.730
 legume the pea is on the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.700
 ridge of the hillock 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.410
 then sunny side on the side of 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.120
 the hillock i'm going to put apples from 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.320
 earth in the middle of which I am going 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.280
 interspersed some aromatic plants 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.450
 parsley type coriander to keep away 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.900
 some parasites like the wireworm by 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.030
 example and then shady side there I 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.030
 put rather leafy vegetables 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.320
 spinach carrots Swiss chard that need 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.720
 a little more shade or humidity in 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.040
 anyway the secret space imagines itself to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.630
 year length combining the useful to 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.130
 the pleasant couple is planning to plant 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.840
 more flowers to color a 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.840
 garden that has not finished revealing itself
