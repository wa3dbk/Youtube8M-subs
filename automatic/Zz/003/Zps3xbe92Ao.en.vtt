which<00:00:45.440> brings<00:00:45.739> all<00:00:46.010> these<00:00:46.219> quirky<00:00:46.609> little

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
which brings all these quirky little

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.360 
which brings all these quirky little
bugs<00:00:47.030> back<00:00:47.329> out<00:00:47.600> that<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.710> map<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:49.070> I<00:00:49.159> had

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
bugs back out that the map that I had

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.459 
bugs back out that the map that I had
was<00:00:49.550> solely<00:00:49.909> designed<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.629> fix<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:51.019> couple<00:00:51.350> of

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
was solely designed to fix a couple of

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:59.400 
was solely designed to fix a couple of
issues<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:54.550> was<00:00:55.550> beautiful

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.790 

and<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.649> fixed<00:01:00.980> those<00:01:01.129> issues<00:01:01.489> very<00:01:01.699> very<00:01:02.030> well

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
and it fixed those issues very very well

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.990 
and it fixed those issues very very well
that's<00:01:03.800> part<00:01:04.009> of<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.159> problem<00:01:04.400> is<00:01:04.699> I<00:01:04.790> turned

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
that's part of the problem is I turned

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.580 
that's part of the problem is I turned
it<00:01:05.119> off<00:01:05.210> because<00:01:05.950> in<00:01:06.950> most<00:01:07.220> places<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:08.380> well<00:01:09.380> in

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
it off because in most places it well in

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.770 
it off because in most places it well in
a<00:01:09.680> lot<00:01:09.710> of<00:01:09.950> places<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.670> wants<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.060> bike<00:01:11.299> to<00:01:11.540> run

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
a lot of places it wants the bike to run

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.180 
a lot of places it wants the bike to run
a<00:01:11.990> fair<00:01:12.259> bit<00:01:12.440> richer<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.259> stock<00:01:15.590> map<00:01:15.830> and

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
a fair bit richer and the stock map and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.590 
a fair bit richer and the stock map and
it<00:01:16.940> costs<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.110> quit<00:01:18.290> cutting<00:01:18.590> out

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
it costs it to quit cutting out

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.180 
it costs it to quit cutting out
installing<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:20.720> all<00:01:20.840> this

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.160 

I<00:01:26.250> can't<00:01:27.120> tell<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.300> that's<00:01:27.510> what<00:01:27.780> you're<00:01:27.990> not

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
I can't tell if that's what you're not

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.920 
I can't tell if that's what you're not
now<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.860> anyway<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.730> causes<00:01:33.300> you<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.780> get

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
now and so anyway it causes you to get

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
now and so anyway it causes you to get
worse<00:01:34.110> gas<00:01:34.350> mileage<00:01:35.780> point<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.900> fact<00:01:37.880> last

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
worse gas mileage point of fact last

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.130 
worse gas mileage point of fact last

Austin are going down to work or
whatever<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.940> would<00:01:45.120> get<00:01:45.570> about<00:01:46.020> 37<00:01:46.980> miles<00:01:47.130> yeah

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
whatever I would get about 37 miles yeah

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
on the trip up here which was almost all

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
I wasn't going terribly fast but I was

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.810 
I wasn't going terribly fast but I was
playing<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.620> hills<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.580> were<00:02:05.730> a<00:02:05.760> couple

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
playing in the hills there were a couple

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.980 
playing in the hills there were a couple
of<00:02:06.060> times<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.450> doing<00:02:06.690> 80<00:02:06.900> 90<00:02:08.690> almost<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.840> hundred

of times of doing 80 90 almost a hundred

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.160 
of times of doing 80 90 almost a hundred
at<00:02:10.260> one<00:02:10.410> time<00:02:13.940> which<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:14.970> really<00:02:15.600> bad<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
at one time which is really bad for the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.040 
at one time which is really bad for the
gas<00:02:16.320> mileage<00:02:16.710> still<00:02:17.190> averaged<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:17.910> 42<00:02:18.570> 43

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050
