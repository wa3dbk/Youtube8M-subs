00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
wasn't a huge amount of evidence to back

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.020 
wasn't a huge amount of evidence to back
up<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.250> theory<00:02:05.550> or<00:02:05.640> at<00:02:05.700> least<00:02:05.880> nothing

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
up the theory or at least nothing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.790 
up the theory or at least nothing
compared<00:02:06.510> with<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.960> now<00:02:07.140> could<00:02:07.710> you

well<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.940> Darwin's<00:02:15.390> time<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.600> mean<00:02:15.810> such

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
well in in Darwin's time I mean such

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.200 
well in in Darwin's time I mean such
evidence<00:02:16.320> as<00:02:16.620> there<00:02:16.800> was<00:02:17.010> Darwin<00:02:17.550> himself<00:02:17.670> was

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
evidence as there was Darwin himself was

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.430 
evidence as there was Darwin himself was
largely<00:02:18.480> responsible<00:02:18.600> for<00:02:19.290> gathering

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440

largely responsible for gathering
together<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.190> was<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.460> difference<00:02:20.580> between

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
together that was the difference between

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.760 
together that was the difference between
Wallace<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.540> Darwin<00:02:21.660> well<00:02:22.170> they<00:02:22.470> both<00:02:22.590> have

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
Wallace and Darwin well they both have

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.440 
Wallace and Darwin well they both have
the<00:02:22.860> same<00:02:22.890> idea<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.400> Darwin<00:02:23.880> wrote<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.270> book

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
the same idea but Darwin wrote the book

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.730 
the same idea but Darwin wrote the book
which<00:02:25.170> brought<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.010> evidence<00:02:26.310> together

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
which brought all the evidence together

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.590 
which brought all the evidence together
the<00:02:28.740> evidence<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.700> today<00:02:29.910> well

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
the evidence that we have today well

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.440 
the evidence that we have today well
it's<00:02:30.840> there<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.350> fossils<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:33.030> Darwin's

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it's there are fossils and in Darwin's

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.300 
it's there are fossils and in Darwin's
time<00:02:33.570> there<00:02:34.200> what<00:02:34.320> there<00:02:34.530> were<00:02:34.650> fossils<00:02:35.100> many

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
time there what there were fossils many

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.550 
time there what there were fossils many
of<00:02:35.430> them<00:02:35.550> discovered<00:02:35.730> by<00:02:36.060> Darwin<00:02:36.420> himself<00:02:36.560> but

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
of them discovered by Darwin himself but

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.100 
of them discovered by Darwin himself but
a<00:02:37.800> small<00:02:38.520> fraction<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.660> number<00:02:39.960> of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
a small fraction of the number of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.530 
a small fraction of the number of
fossils<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:40.950> today<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.730> in

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
fossils that we have today and in

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.690 
fossils that we have today and in
Darwin's<00:02:42.960> time<00:02:43.130> people<00:02:44.130> spoke<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.520> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
Darwin's time people spoke of the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.270 
Darwin's time people spoke of the
missing<00:02:45.090> link<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:46.200> idea<00:02:46.530> they<00:02:46.680> they<00:02:47.130> could

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
missing link this idea they they could

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.800 
missing link this idea they they could
see<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.700> humans<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.450> chimpanzees

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
see that humans and chimpanzees

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.660 
see that humans and chimpanzees
resembled<00:02:49.530> each<00:02:49.560> other<00:02:49.800> but<00:02:50.310> there<00:02:50.460> was<00:02:50.550> no

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
resembled each other but there was no

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.690 
resembled each other but there was no
fossil<00:02:51.060> evidence<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:52.500> link<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.890> link<00:02:53.460> them

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
fossil evidence to link the link them

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.090 
fossil evidence to link the link them
and<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.690> phrase<00:02:55.020> missing<00:02:55.560> link<00:02:55.830> was

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and so this phrase missing link was

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.860 
and so this phrase missing link was
immensely<00:02:56.850> powerful<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.420> lots<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.660> people

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
immensely powerful and lots of people

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.240 
immensely powerful and lots of people
went<00:02:57.990> around<00:02:58.110> saying<00:02:58.230> well<00:02:58.710> I<00:02:58.740> won't<00:02:59.010> believe

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
went around saying well I won't believe

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.820 
went around saying well I won't believe
it<00:02:59.310> until<00:02:59.460> the<00:03:00.150> missing<00:03:00.540> link<00:03:00.780> its<00:03:01.530> founding

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
it until the missing link its founding

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.680 
it until the missing link its founding
and<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.190> still<00:03:02.460> hear<00:03:02.730> people<00:03:03.090> saying<00:03:03.300> that<00:03:03.510> by

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
and you still hear people saying that by

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.360 
and you still hear people saying that by
the<00:03:03.750> way<00:03:04.520> well<00:03:05.520> since<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.970> time<00:03:06.239> as<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.660> know

of<00:04:03.780> at<00:04:04.350> all<00:04:04.560> he<00:04:04.680> knew<00:04:04.769> about<00:04:04.890> comparative

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
of at all he knew about comparative

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.599 
of at all he knew about comparative
anatomy<00:04:05.880> if<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.630> look<00:04:06.900> at<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.609> resemblances

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
anatomy if you look at the resemblances

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.130 
anatomy if you look at the resemblances
between<00:04:09.109> animals<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.230> between<00:04:10.560> plants

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
between animals and between plants

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.789 
between animals and between plants
they<00:04:13.140> fall<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.740> a<00:04:14.450> wonderful<00:04:15.450> neat<00:04:15.870> tree<00:04:16.560> a

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
they fall on a wonderful neat tree a

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.970 
they fall on a wonderful neat tree a
branching<00:04:17.519> tree<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:19.470> branching<00:04:19.950> tree

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
branching tree and the branching tree

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.370 
branching tree and the branching tree
works<00:04:20.579> for<00:04:21.329> all<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.720> different<00:04:22.079> things<00:04:22.109> you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
works for all the different things you

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.170 
works for all the different things you
look<00:04:22.560> at<00:04:22.710> if<00:04:22.889> you<00:04:22.980> say<00:04:23.160> take<00:04:23.400> molecules<00:04:23.940> and

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
look at if you say take molecules and

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.930 
look at if you say take molecules and
you<00:04:24.960> can<00:04:25.410> struck<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.950> tree<00:04:26.100> of<00:04:26.310> resemblance

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
you can struck the tree of resemblance

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.870 
you can struck the tree of resemblance
of<00:04:27.210> one<00:04:28.080> molecule<00:04:28.290> like<00:04:28.740> cytochrome<00:04:29.220> C<00:04:29.550> and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
of one molecule like cytochrome C and

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.300 
of one molecule like cytochrome C and
you<00:04:30.600> get<00:04:30.810> a<00:04:30.840> tree<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.470> then<00:04:31.950> you<00:04:32.070> construct

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
you get a tree and then you construct

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.520 
you get a tree and then you construct
the<00:04:32.669> tree<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.060> resemblance<00:04:33.600> for<00:04:34.169> another

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
the tree of resemblance for another

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.980 
the tree of resemblance for another
molecule<00:04:34.800> say<00:04:35.340> hemoglobin<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.270> it's<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
molecule say hemoglobin and it's the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.440 
molecule say hemoglobin and it's the
same<00:04:37.260> tree<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:38.790> do<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.000> for<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.210> third

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
same tree and you do it for a third

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.600 
same tree and you do it for a third
molecule<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:40.169> it's<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.590> same<00:04:40.800> tree<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.430> so

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
molecule and it's the same tree and so

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.990 
molecule and it's the same tree and so
on<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.169> that<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.530> tree<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:43.890> course<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.520> as

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
on and that and the tree of course is as

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.630 
on and that and the tree of course is as
Darwin<00:04:45.419> would<00:04:45.510> have<00:04:45.660> realized<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:47.010> family

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
Darwin would have realized is a family

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.730 
Darwin would have realized is a family
tree<00:04:47.940> it's<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.300> pedigree<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.380> can<00:04:49.530> do<00:04:49.620> the

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
tree it's a pedigree and you can do the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.770 
tree it's a pedigree and you can do the
same<00:04:49.919> not<00:04:50.130> just<00:04:50.310> for<00:04:50.460> molecules<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.480> do<00:04:51.630> the

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
same not just for molecules and do the

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
same for bones do the same for all sorts

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.320 
same for bones do the same for all sorts
of<00:04:55.200> parts<00:04:55.980> of<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.430> body<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:56.880> I<00:04:56.910> think<00:04:57.000> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
of parts of the body so I think the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.040 
of parts of the body so I think the

knew about this is evidence but there's

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.760 
knew about this is evidence but there's
a<00:06:47.400> whole<00:06:47.580> lot<00:06:47.760> more<00:06:48.000> since<00:06:48.660> since<00:06:49.380> Darwin's

a whole lot more since since Darwin's

a whole lot more since since Darwin's
time
