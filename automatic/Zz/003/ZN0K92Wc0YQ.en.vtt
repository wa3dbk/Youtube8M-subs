00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.840
 to wash your hair shampoos 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.280
 conditioners masks have already been 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.260

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.770
 I have told you what I use to praise him and 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.630
 as many of you have told me 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.950
 Asked today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.869
 that I'm going to start talking about a 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.199
 brand positively surprised me 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.330
 redd I bought both the field and the 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.309
 conditioner I had never tried on 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.960
 one of this brand and this is the line 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.879
 stent color which is the line for 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.949
 hair dyed from the first moment 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.200
 I liked it a lot sometimes used the shampoo 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.880
 together with the conditioner and sometimes 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.739
 I used a shampoo with any other 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.840
 mask and the truth is that very well 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.180
 the shampoo mostly cleans the hair 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.149
 phenomenal does not leave residue on my hair 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.190
 I left it very clean very loose and I 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.899
 It lasts several days clean and the truth is 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.700
 I am very happy the conditioner 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.379
 I also like it a lot, but I do not see 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.820
 that is nothing special is fine 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.100
 but what really surprised me is 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.440
 This shampoo has among other compounds 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.420
 of blueberry oil and good as 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.680
 I say to you I like very much other 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.840
 extreme that I also like very much 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.090
 is the 20 photos of the brand that was these 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.659
 I've been using it for a short time 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.280
 weeks 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.259
 I can tell you that I like it very much 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.670
 I had already tried products of this same 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.670
 line that is for damaged hair 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.920
 weakened and good because it smells very good 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.689
 Leaves hair very clean and I like it very much 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.399
 I'm going to show you the last shampoo that 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.350
 use from time to time and I will pass to you 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.149
 teach the masks that I have this 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.219
 it's a shampoo of confrides of the line 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.319
 color line is a concealer shampoo 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.640
 color has a purple color and good this 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.159
 type of shampoos what it does is 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.530
 neutralize colorado hair 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.299
 so when I used it only 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.840
 I give it to the tips in the rest 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.909
 I give there 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.170
 the normal shampoo but I left it 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.909
 tips because what this does is 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.709
 neutralize many of you that 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.209
 you have to have bleached hair 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.700
 You know that many times we have 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.950
 this tone as well as orange and what 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.810
 they call Brazil here is what this 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.500
 type of shampoos with this purple tone is 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.289
 neutralize that orange and leaves us a 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.179
 goldier tone let's say then when 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.459
 sometimes maybe he noticed that he is 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.530
 pulling a little more orange the tips 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.090
 what I do is use the shampoo that 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.290
 I also bought the conditioner but 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.780
 sincerely the conditioner 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.250
 I like so much pedraza the hair almost nothing 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.859
 but the shampoo I recommend it 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.659
 very much because I know that not all 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.579
 Effect on color leaves one more color 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.829
 nice I recommend you use this type of 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.140
 shampoos to neutralize once each 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.879
 two weeks or so I would not use it to 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.829
 everyday many of you have told me 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.989
 asked if he knew any good shampoo 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.689
 for dandruff good to tell you what 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.609
 a few months then he deserves a lot 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.260
 scalp and I noticed that something came out 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.170
 of dandruff then I was investigating a 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.109
 little and I bought this lorea shampoo that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.090
 it's called stand click and it was good 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.370
 phenomenal is almost and practically 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.590
 exhausted more or less in about two weeks 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.209
 If you have started using it, note that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.340
 I practically did not have anything either 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.810
 I had a lot of dandruff but since I have 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.629
 dark root because you already know that 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.669
 right away it shows and well it's a shampoo 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.680
 purifying so for those who have 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.780
 Dandruff problems I recommend it 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.730
 because it went very well for me and finally 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.889
 I'm going to show you three masks and 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.389
 you know I have dry hair and I have it 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.430
 that hydrate quite the first one is from 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.159
 the brand alternates and is called bamboo 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.240
 google + kÃ¶hler protection 'and good as 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.890
 the name says is for 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.440
 protect the color is a mask 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.150
 Intensive moisturizer has extract 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.070
 Bamboo organic and it's a face mask 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.410
 ecological is free of for me I do not 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.820
 I like it a lot but I have other masks 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.200
 that hydrate me more then there's the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.060
 I use when I have good hair when 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.320
 I have very dry hair I use others the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.020
 next mask is one of my 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.820
 preferred from the natural brand today and 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.800
 although this jar is already running out 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.540
 and I have to replace you I have to say 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.670
 which is one of my favorite masks 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.280
 especially for those who have that hair 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.470
 dry I recommend it 100% it smells 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.570
 phenomenal leaves hair very well 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.490
 I do not recommend that you give in the root 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.960
 in the scalp because if what 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.160
 better you can leave something of something 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.320
 fat because I tell you hydrate 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.150
 very much these miraculous masks 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.130
 for me I already showed you in another video the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.860
 natural oil macadamia oils what 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.300
 I do is mix one of the oils with 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.830
 the mask that they also tell you 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.360
 I recommend and you apply it as 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.700
 treatment and between the components 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.500
 have macadamia oil feel oil 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.810
 of argan tea tree oil has 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.610
 aloe vera has algae extracts like this 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.560
 which is a very complete mask 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.389
 He also does not have parabens and for me he is one 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.520
 of the best hair products 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.439
 and finally I'm going to talk about another 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.199
 Mask that arrives in a call is the 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:31.819
 more intense and what were these and it's good 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.199
 Well, what to tell you is phenomenal what 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:35.629
 I really like these masks that I 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.930
 I can apply it in both the root 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.759
 as in the rest of the hair and when lightening it 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.680
 then they do not leave any residue left 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.599
 hydrated and maximum hair leaves a scent 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.610
 that lasts for days leaves the hair very 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.110
 bright and also moisturizes a lot of good 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.789
 in girls now I would like to consider 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.310
 to you a question about the 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.840
 times without parabens and is that good 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.939
 I have always heard that the best for 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.039
 The hair is to use in free products 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.750
 of sulfates free of parabens and others 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.580
 I've tried several shampoos from that 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.439
 guy and I did not manage to find one that 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.789
 like some face masks 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.379
 the ones that I taught you 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:09.199
 they are free of parabens sulfates 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.330
 etcetera and I go phenomenally with the 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.219
 shampoos then is that I do not notice did not manage 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.139
 I like to find what I'm looking 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.719
 those who have tried this is the brand 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.610
 natural macadamia also like me 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.680
 they like both the oils and the mask 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.379
 Well, I ordered it online because in addition 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.940
 I was thinking that 50 or 70 percent of 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.460
 good discount to see it was 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.900
 to come from sulfates because I said sure 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.790
 I'm doing well because I like them all 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.260
 the products of this brand 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.540
 unfortunately I do not like it does not leave me 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.280
 the clean hair in the texture that leaves me 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.590
 I do not like it either and it does not last at all 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.600
 clean the hair and then the other shampoo 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.110
 that I have also proven that it is from this 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.270
 style is the wing forest of in body shop 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.800
 equally free of parabens and so on 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.750
 it happens to me a bit like that of 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.240
 Natural macadamia does not leave my hair 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.270
 clean this terrific judge that does smell 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.800
 that you die but I do not like it and that 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.440
 I have given an opportunity to 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.420
 sulfates and do not touch him but this my 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.130
 stronger neither better nor brighter nor 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.690
 nothing simply I notice that I do not last 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.030
 Indian the hair even starts to me 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.490
 grease the root more often than 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.140
 Normally you do not pass me and well then that 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.460

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.010
