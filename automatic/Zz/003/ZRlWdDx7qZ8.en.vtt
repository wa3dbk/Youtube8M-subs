00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
the wrong way that I do from an

the wrong way that I do from an
established<00:00:55.410> fact<00:00:55.860> franchise<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.699> Madden

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
established fact franchise like Madden

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.930 
established fact franchise like Madden
and<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:58.199> franchise<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.710> basically<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
and a franchise that basically is in the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.330 
and a franchise that basically is in the
pole<00:01:00.149> position<00:01:00.180> only<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:01.770> reason<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
pole position only for one reason and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.799 
pole position only for one reason and
only<00:01:02.730> reason<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.690> an

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
only reason is that they have an

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.960 
only reason is that they have an
exclusive<00:01:04.290> license<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:05.339> attack<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> game

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
exclusive license would attack a game

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.450 
exclusive license would attack a game
that<00:01:06.510> hasn't<00:01:06.869> even<00:01:06.960> come<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.229> yet<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.830> we

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
that hasn't even come out yet that we

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
that hasn't even come out yet that we
don't<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.729> any<00:01:09.060> idea<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.810> now

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
don't have any idea what it is now

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
don't have any idea what it is now
there's<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.860> couple<00:01:11.010> ways<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.520> look<00:01:11.640> at

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
there's a couple ways you can look at

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.300 
there's a couple ways you can look at
this<00:01:12.470> maybe<00:01:13.470> they're<00:01:13.650> threatened<00:01:14.159> by<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
this maybe they're threatened by this

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.760 
this maybe they're threatened by this
game<00:01:14.640> I'm<00:01:15.330> not<00:01:15.689> sure<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> case<00:01:16.530> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
game I'm not sure if that's the case I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
game I'm not sure if that's the case I
doubt<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.280> maybe<00:01:18.060> he<00:01:18.240> knows<00:01:18.420> exactly<00:01:18.659> what

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
doubt that maybe he knows exactly what

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.179 
doubt that maybe he knows exactly what
this<00:01:19.290> game<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:21.180> he<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:22.259> afford<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.770> attack

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
this game is and he can afford to attack

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.460 
this game is and he can afford to attack
the<00:01:23.340> game<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:24.900> bothers<00:01:25.290> me<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the game but it just bothers me that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
the game but it just bothers me that
they're<00:01:25.770> attacking<00:01:26.100> game<00:01:26.460> when<00:01:26.909> their<00:01:27.119> game

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
they're attacking game when their game

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
they're attacking game when their game
is<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.680> bad<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.630> by<00:01:31.530> bad<00:01:31.829> i<00:01:31.860> mean<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.430> not

classless<00:04:16.359> behavior<00:04:17.229> man<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.739> seems

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
classless behavior man it just seems

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.399 
classless behavior man it just seems
like<00:04:18.130> when<00:04:18.310> you're<00:04:18.430> on<00:04:18.579> top<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:20.139> wouldn't

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
like when you're on top you wouldn't

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.670 
like when you're on top you wouldn't
engage<00:04:20.530> in<00:04:20.979> that<00:04:21.070> type<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:21.340> behavior<00:04:21.519> unless

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
engage in that type of behavior unless

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.379 
engage in that type of behavior unless
no<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.039> reason<00:04:23.220> why<00:04:23.490> you're<00:04:23.699> on<00:04:23.820> top<00:04:24.090> is

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
no the reason why you're on top is

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.080 
no the reason why you're on top is
because<00:04:25.380> you're<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.830> only<00:04:26.100> game<00:04:26.639> that<00:04:26.669> can

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
because you're the only game that can

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.900 
because you're the only game that can
use<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.419> NFL<00:04:27.870> license<00:04:28.410> now<00:04:28.650> i<00:04:28.949> just<00:04:29.550> find<00:04:29.729> it

about people legitimately questioning if

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.029 
about people legitimately questioning if
it's<00:04:44.610> better<00:04:45.000> than<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.720> game<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.620> was<00:04:46.800> made<00:04:47.009> in

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
it's better than a game that was made in

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.790 
it's better than a game that was made in
2007<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.360> seems<00:04:48.690> like<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:49.020> would<00:04:49.139> stay<00:04:49.470> away
