crab paste oil in it which is really
crucial<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.030> recipe<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.869> this

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
crucial in this recipe in this was this

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.139 
crucial in this recipe in this was this
is<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.470> sets<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:46.890> recipe<00:01:47.250> apart<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.970> other

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
is what sets my recipe apart from other

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.120 
is what sets my recipe apart from other
recipes<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> want<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> stir<00:01:49.890> this

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
recipes so you want to stir this

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
recipes so you want to stir this
literally<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.729> until<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.299> combined<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.990> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
literally just until it's combined for a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.380 
literally just until it's combined for a
probably<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.470> minute<00:01:53.009> 30<00:01:53.399> seconds<00:01:53.880> even<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
probably like minute 30 seconds even and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.889 
probably like minute 30 seconds even and
now<00:01:54.720> I'm<00:01:55.020> adding<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.829> my<00:01:56.219> crack<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> next<00:01:57.780> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
now I'm adding in my crack so next you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.870 
now I'm adding in my crack so next you
just<00:01:57.960> want<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.350> mix<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.829> crab<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.700> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
just want to mix the crab and with that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
just want to mix the crab and with that
sauce<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.540> make<00:02:00.630> sure<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.140> very<00:02:01.770> well

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
sauce and make sure it's all very well

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.010 
sauce and make sure it's all very well
coated<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.880> then<00:02:03.450> we're<00:02:03.570> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> put<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
coated and then we're going to put the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.130 
coated and then we're going to put the
lid<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.950> allow<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> steam<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.659> cook<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
lid on and allow it to steam or cook a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.499 
lid on and allow it to steam or cook a
little<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.979> would<00:02:08.700> come<00:02:08.940> back<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.300> I

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
little bit more I would come back and I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.290 
little bit more I would come back and I
would<00:02:10.069> constantly<00:02:11.069> come<00:02:11.430> back<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.879> stir<00:02:12.180> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
would constantly come back and stir it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.610 
would constantly come back and stir it
all<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.930> keep<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.200> from

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
all up to keep it from

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.470 
all up to keep it from
turning<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.400> actually<00:02:14.640> lift<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.299> lid

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
turning so I actually lift up the lid

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.330 
turning so I actually lift up the lid
halfway<00:02:15.810> through<00:02:16.019> cooking<00:02:16.319> time<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.860> I'm

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
halfway through cooking time and I'm

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.570 
halfway through cooking time and I'm
going<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.790> throw<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.510> my<00:02:18.959> chopped<00:02:19.580> scallions

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
going to throw in my chopped scallions

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.670 
going to throw in my chopped scallions
and<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.909> also<00:02:21.120> add<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.629> two<00:02:21.840> tablespoons<00:02:22.470> of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
and I also add it in two tablespoons of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.180 
and I also add it in two tablespoons of
water<00:02:22.739> as<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.720> stir<00:02:25.080> again<00:02:25.349> once<00:02:25.739> more

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
water as well and stir again once more

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.770 
water as well and stir again once more
and<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:26.549> I'm<00:02:26.670> going<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:26.940> put<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> lid<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.480> and

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and then I'm going to put the lid on and

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.479 
and then I'm going to put the lid on and
then<00:02:27.840> let<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.530> cook<00:02:28.739> for<00:02:28.920> about<00:02:29.040> ten<00:02:29.310> minutes

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
then let it cook for about ten minutes

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.460 
then let it cook for about ten minutes
or<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.180> probably<00:02:30.599> should<00:02:30.810> mention<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.200> forgot

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
or so I probably should mention I forgot

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.410 
or so I probably should mention I forgot
that<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.739> should<00:02:31.920> crack<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.400> claws<00:02:32.670> before

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
that you should crack the claws before

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.809 
that you should crack the claws before
you<00:02:33.720> fry<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.019> because<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.799> cooks<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.670> more

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
you fry it because it cooks it more

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.550 
you fry it because it cooks it more
evenly<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.599> forgot<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.049> do<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.409> I<00:02:37.470> had

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
evenly and I forgot to do that so I had

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.500 
evenly and I forgot to do that so I had
to<00:02:37.650> cook<00:02:37.799> fine<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.010> little<00:02:38.159> bit<00:02:38.370> longer<00:02:38.579> than<00:02:39.390> I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
to cook fine a little bit longer than I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.660 
to cook fine a little bit longer than I
usually<00:02:39.690> would<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.129> hope<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.340> guys<00:02:41.459> enjoyed
