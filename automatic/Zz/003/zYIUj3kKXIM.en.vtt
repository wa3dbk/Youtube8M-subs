00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
one on each side all the way around one

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.960 
one on each side all the way around one
on<00:03:10.300> each<00:03:10.420> side<00:03:10.660> now<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.470> depends<00:03:11.800> on<00:03:12.010> what<00:03:12.370> area

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
on each side now it depends on what area

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.760 
on each side now it depends on what area
of<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.360> country<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.750> live<00:03:13.930> in<00:03:13.989> how<00:03:14.440> many

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
of the country you live in how many

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.530 
of the country you live in how many
holes<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.580> make<00:03:15.760> in<00:03:15.910> your<00:03:15.940> containers

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
holes you make in your containers

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.250 
holes you make in your containers
because<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.890> know<00:03:17.980> here<00:03:18.190> in<00:03:18.310> Ohio<00:03:19.080> we<00:03:20.080> get<00:03:20.230> a

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
because you know here in Ohio we get a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.670 
because you know here in Ohio we get a
lot<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.530> rain<00:03:20.830> but<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:22.450> point<00:03:22.750> is<00:03:22.930> if<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.290> have

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
lot of rain but the point is if you have

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.160 
lot of rain but the point is if you have
if<00:03:24.160> you're<00:03:24.760> not<00:03:24.880> going<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.060> water<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.480> lot<00:03:25.810> or

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
if you're not going to water a lot or

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.080 
if you're not going to water a lot or
you<00:03:26.799> don't<00:03:26.920> get<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.160> lot<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.489> rain

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
you don't get a lot of rain

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.960 
you don't get a lot of rain
you<00:03:28.840> want<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.080> have<00:03:29.170> less<00:03:29.350> holes<00:03:29.610> if<00:03:30.610> you're

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
you want to have less holes if you're

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.490 
you want to have less holes if you're
not<00:03:31.120> if<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.360> water<00:03:31.570> every<00:03:31.870> day<00:03:31.900> then<00:03:32.290> you<00:03:32.380> can

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
not if you water every day then you can

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.720 
not if you water every day then you can
have<00:03:32.620> more<00:03:32.830> holes<00:03:33.010> because<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.400> more<00:03:33.549> holes

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
have more holes because the more holes

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.070 
have more holes because the more holes
you<00:03:33.880> have<00:03:33.910> obviously<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.540> faster<00:03:34.930> your

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
you have obviously the faster your

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.140 
you have obviously the faster your
container<00:03:35.380> will<00:03:35.590> dry<00:03:35.799> out<00:03:35.830> so<00:03:36.730> that<00:03:36.940> ratio

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
container will dry out so that ratio

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.970 
container will dry out so that ratio
right<00:03:37.510> there<00:03:37.750> has<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:37.900> been<00:03:38.110> perfect<00:03:38.650> for<00:03:38.860> me

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
right there has just been perfect for me

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.460 
right there has just been perfect for me
