hey<00:00:00.630> everyone<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.290> is<00:00:01.350> phil<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:01.949> i'm<00:00:02.310> going

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hey everyone this is phil and i'm going

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.789 
hey everyone this is phil and i'm going
to<00:00:02.550> be<00:00:02.610> doing<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:03.000> quick<00:00:03.240> demo<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:04.200> Alpha

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
to be doing a quick demo of the Alpha

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.010 
to be doing a quick demo of the Alpha
Chun<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.250> this<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.240> going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.420> be<00:00:06.540> very<00:00:06.569> short

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
Chun to this is going to be very short

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.900 
Chun to this is going to be very short
I'll<00:00:07.230> make<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.440> more<00:00:07.890> detailed<00:00:08.400> video<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
I'll make a more detailed video in the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.780 
I'll make a more detailed video in the
future<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.080> DIY<00:00:10.530> kit<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.550> came

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
future this is the DIY kit that it came

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.240 
future this is the DIY kit that it came
in<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.210> looks<00:00:12.509> super<00:00:12.809> scary<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:13.620> really<00:00:14.040> cool

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
in it looks super scary but really cool

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.460 
in it looks super scary but really cool
at<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.519> same<00:00:14.610> time<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.750> take<00:00:15.960> out<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.260> pieces

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
at the same time you take out the pieces

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.279 
at the same time you take out the pieces
and<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:17.220> just<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> regular<00:00:17.840> assembly<00:00:18.840> process

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
and it's just a regular assembly process

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.580 
and it's just a regular assembly process
um<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.810> cube<00:00:22.050> looks<00:00:22.320> like

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
um and this is what the cube looks like

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.390 
um and this is what the cube looks like
I<00:00:22.890> comes<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:24.029> stainless<00:00:24.269> steel<00:00:24.630> tabs

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
I comes with these stainless steel tabs

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
I comes with these stainless steel tabs
but<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.460> couldn't<00:00:27.000> fit<00:00:27.150> them<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.480> properly

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
but I couldn't fit them in properly

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.109 
but I couldn't fit them in properly
without<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.220> know<00:00:29.340> falling<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:29.849> I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
without them you know falling out so I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.569 
without them you know falling out so I
decided<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.660> forgo<00:00:30.929> them<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:32.099> turning<00:00:32.460> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
decided to forgo them the turning is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.110 
decided to forgo them the turning is
okay<00:00:34.880> there<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.090> some<00:00:36.360> lockup<00:00:36.750> issues<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
okay there are some lockup issues and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.639 
okay there are some lockup issues and
some<00:00:39.120> stability<00:00:39.450> issues<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.440> there's

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
some stability issues because there's

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.010 
some stability issues because there's
not<00:00:40.829> enough<00:00:40.890> contact<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.969> inside<00:00:42.329> but

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
not enough contact on the inside but

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.850 
not enough contact on the inside but
otherwise<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.160> very<00:00:44.340> fast<00:00:44.640> queue<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.860> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
otherwise it's a very fast queue and the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.180 
otherwise it's a very fast queue and the
turning<00:00:47.219> resistance<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.440> very<00:00:49.440> minimal<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
turning resistance is a very minimal so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.869 
turning resistance is a very minimal so
you<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.579> move<00:00:50.820> very<00:00:51.090> easily<00:00:51.620> without

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
you can move very easily without

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
you can move very easily without
actually<00:00:53.879> overturn<00:00:54.390> one-handed<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.020> this

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
actually overturn one-handed on this

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.170 
actually overturn one-handed on this
because<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.890> light<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.850> cube<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
because it's so light so the cube is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
because it's so light so the cube is
very<00:00:57.390> light<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.809> there's<00:00:58.739> very<00:00:59.010> little

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
very light and there's very little

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.189 
very light and there's very little
turning<00:00:59.520> resistance<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.660> very<00:01:00.870> fun<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
turning resistance so it's very fun to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.779 
turning resistance so it's very fun to
play<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.530> physics<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.340> feels<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.640> you're

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
play with physics it feels like you're

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
play with physics it feels like you're
playing<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.180> air<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.320> there's<00:01:04.589> like

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
playing with air you know there's like

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.080 
playing with air you know there's like
no<00:01:05.309> turning<00:01:05.670> resistance<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:08.090> very

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
no turning resistance so very

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
no turning resistance so very
interesting<00:01:09.299> puzzle<00:01:09.900> I'll<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.799> coming<00:01:11.189> out

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
interesting puzzle I'll be coming out

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.609 
interesting puzzle I'll be coming out
