then we're gonna watch this area of low

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.190 
then we're gonna watch this area of low
pressure<00:03:16.590> drop<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.579> as<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.329> moves<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.989> we

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
pressure drop in as that moves in we

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.039 
pressure drop in as that moves in we
