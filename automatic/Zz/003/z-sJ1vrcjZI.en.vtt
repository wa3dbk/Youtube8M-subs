in<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.540> video

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
in this video

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:18.230 
in this video
talk<00:00:07.530> about<00:00:07.680> thyroid<00:00:08.250> hormone<00:00:09.030> control<00:00:17.240> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
talk about thyroid hormone control the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.280 
talk about thyroid hormone control the
first<00:00:18.450> player<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.230> mechanism<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
first player in this mechanism is the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.150 
first player in this mechanism is the
hypothalamus<00:00:24.380> it's<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.919> in<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
hypothalamus it's it's just in the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.179 
hypothalamus it's it's just in the
middle<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> brain<00:00:26.759> like<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.890> it's<00:00:28.890> one

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
middle of the brain like this it's one

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.530 
middle of the brain like this it's one
the<00:00:29.400> very<00:00:29.579> center<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:36.030> draw<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the very center and so draw it out a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.430 
the very center and so draw it out a
little<00:00:36.899> larger<00:00:37.230> here

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.590 

so<00:00:47.440> here's<00:00:47.650> the<00:00:47.770> hot<00:00:47.920> paleness<00:00:48.400> up<00:00:48.580> up<00:00:48.820> here

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
so here's the hot paleness up up here

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.840 
so here's the hot paleness up up here
and<00:00:51.750> hanging<00:00:52.750> down<00:00:52.990> from<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.440> is<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.640> -

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
and hanging down from it is that the -

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.500 
and hanging down from it is that the -
Ettore<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:56.770> a<00:00:56.800> gland<00:00:57.340> that<00:00:57.790> sits<00:00:58.120> within

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
Ettore this is a gland that sits within

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.070 
Ettore this is a gland that sits within
the<00:00:58.720> base<00:00:58.930> of<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.200> bone<00:01:00.450> so<00:01:01.450> this<00:01:01.690> side<00:01:01.900> is<00:01:01.930> a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
the base of the bone so this side is a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.650 
the base of the bone so this side is a
posterior<00:01:02.680> pituitary<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.700> this<00:01:04.300> sides<00:01:04.540> the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
posterior pituitary and this sides the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.600 
posterior pituitary and this sides the
anterior<00:01:05.199> pituitary<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:06.100> we'll<00:01:06.250> be<00:01:06.340> looking

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
anterior pituitary and we'll be looking

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
anterior pituitary and we'll be looking
at<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.790> anterior<00:01:07.150> pituitary

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.110 

now<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.920> anterior<00:01:12.400> pituitary<00:01:12.700> is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
now the anterior pituitary is

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.200 
now the anterior pituitary is
interesting<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.350> has<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.860> portal<00:01:15.790> vein

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
interesting in that it has a portal vein

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.290 
interesting in that it has a portal vein
system<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.040> portal<00:01:18.430> vein<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:18.970> vein<00:01:19.270> that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
system so a portal vein is a vein that

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.190 
system so a portal vein is a vein that
goes<00:01:19.540> from<00:01:19.810> one<00:01:19.930> capillary<00:01:20.590> bed<00:01:20.800> to<00:01:21.190> another

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
goes from one capillary bed to another

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.190 
goes from one capillary bed to another
in<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.970> one<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.360> call<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.690> hypophyseal

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
in this one we call the hypophyseal

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.460 
in this one we call the hypophyseal
portal<00:01:27.119> hypothesis<00:01:28.119> is<00:01:28.360> another<00:01:29.020> name<00:01:29.260> for

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
portal hypothesis is another name for

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:47.160 
portal hypothesis is another name for
the<00:01:29.560> pituitary

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.039 

now<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.320> way<00:01:47.530> this<00:01:47.740> works<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.630> neuron

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
now the way this works is that a neuron

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.420 
now the way this works is that a neuron
in<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:51.250> paraventricular<00:01:51.729> nucleus<00:01:53.430> releases

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
in the paraventricular nucleus releases

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.990 
in the paraventricular nucleus releases
a<00:01:54.640> hormone<00:01:55.030> we<00:01:55.840> call<00:01:56.110> T<00:01:56.740> RH<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.340> releases

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
a hormone we call T RH and this releases

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.830 
a hormone we call T RH and this releases
toh<00:02:01.649> into<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:03.040> portal<00:02:03.520> vein<00:02:06.030> t<00:02:07.030> rh<00:02:07.770> stands<00:02:08.770> for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
toh into the portal vein t rh stands for

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:21.550 
toh into the portal vein t rh stands for
thyrotropin-releasing<00:02:10.840> hormone

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400 

now<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.620> trh<00:02:23.280> travels<00:02:24.090> down<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.420> portal<00:02:25.110> vein

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
now the trh travels down the portal vein

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.890 
now the trh travels down the portal vein
and<00:02:26.690> then<00:02:27.690> diffuses<00:02:28.470> into<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.900> anterior

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and then diffuses into the anterior

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.020 
and then diffuses into the anterior
pituitary<00:02:32.660> as<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:34.170> bunch<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.740> endocrine<00:02:35.700> cells

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
pituitary as a bunch of endocrine cells

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:44.350 
pituitary as a bunch of endocrine cells
down<00:02:36.390> here<00:02:38.210> known<00:02:39.210> as<00:02:39.440> pirate<00:02:40.440> rope<00:02:40.680> cells<00:02:42.860> and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
down here known as pirate rope cells and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.770 
down here known as pirate rope cells and
in<00:02:45.360> response<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.740> trh<00:02:47.510> they<00:02:48.510> produce

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
in response to the trh they produce

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.460 
in response to the trh they produce
another<00:02:49.530> hormone<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:54.000> they<00:02:54.780> release<00:02:55.200> this

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
another hormone and they release this

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.080 
another hormone and they release this
hormone<00:02:56.210> into<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.780> systemic<00:02:58.020> circulation

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
hormone into the systemic circulation

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.430 
hormone into the systemic circulation
this<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.450> blood<00:03:00.630> scheme<00:03:00.960> throughout<00:03:01.260> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
this is the blood scheme throughout the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:10.400 
this is the blood scheme throughout the
whole<00:03:01.590> body<00:03:08.660> this<00:03:09.660> hormone<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.290> they

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
whole body this hormone that they

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:21.550 
whole body this hormone that they
release<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:11.010> called<00:03:11.600> TSH<00:03:18.350> TSH<00:03:19.880> stands<00:03:20.880> for

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
release is called TSH TSH stands for

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:35.620 
release is called TSH TSH stands for
thyroid<00:03:22.560> stimulating<00:03:23.370> hormone

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.690 

now<00:03:36.380> let's<00:03:36.560> have<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.770> look<00:03:36.920> at<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.160> thyroid

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
now let's have a look at the thyroid

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.830 
now let's have a look at the thyroid
gland<00:03:38.060> thyroid<00:03:38.960> gland<00:03:39.440> sits<00:03:39.710> in<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.190> neck

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
gland thyroid gland sits in the neck

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.040 
gland thyroid gland sits in the neck
just<00:03:41.840> here<00:03:42.490> and<00:03:43.490> I'll<00:03:43.610> draw<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.030> up<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.420> bit

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
just here and I'll draw this up a bit

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:54.310 
just here and I'll draw this up a bit
larger<00:03:45.470> detail<00:03:52.240> I'll<00:03:53.240> add<00:03:53.480> in<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.750> little<00:03:54.050> extra

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
larger detail I'll add in a little extra

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.350 
larger detail I'll add in a little extra
anatomy<00:03:54.890> but<00:03:55.070> it's<00:03:55.220> not<00:03:55.400> that<00:03:55.670> important<00:03:56.240> for

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
anatomy but it's not that important for

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:11.589 
anatomy but it's not that important for
the<00:03:56.480> function

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.140 

down<00:04:12.599> here<00:04:13.250> sitting<00:04:14.250> behind<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.909> thyroid

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
down here sitting behind the thyroid

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:26.760 
down here sitting behind the thyroid
gland<00:04:15.629> is<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.959> trickier

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.920 

and<00:04:27.669> this<00:04:27.849> little<00:04:28.150> one

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
and this little one

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.170 
and this little one
drawn<00:04:29.199> in<00:04:29.380> here<00:04:29.590> is<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.160> cricoid<00:04:30.580> cartilage

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
drawn in here is the cricoid cartilage

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.150 
drawn in here is the cricoid cartilage
and<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:32.560> thyroid<00:04:32.830> gland<00:04:33.370> sits<00:04:33.699> just<00:04:33.850> below<00:04:34.240> it

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.980 

so<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.340> thyroid<00:04:39.910> gland<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:40.360> an<00:04:40.479> h-shaped

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
so this thyroid gland is an h-shaped

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.340 
so this thyroid gland is an h-shaped
structure<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:45.520> receives<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.210> TSH<00:04:46.840> from

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
structure and it receives the TSH from

structure and it receives the TSH from
the<00:04:47.500> bloodstream<00:04:51.150> now<00:04:52.150> in<00:04:52.300> response<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.050> TSH

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
the bloodstream now in response the TSH

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.730 
the bloodstream now in response the TSH
the<00:04:55.120> thyroid<00:04:55.570> releases<00:04:56.139> t3<00:04:57.039> and<00:04:57.280> t4<00:04:58.590> which<00:04:59.590> are

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
the thyroid releases t3 and t4 which are

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.499 
the thyroid releases t3 and t4 which are
known<00:04:59.949> as<00:04:59.979> thyroid<00:05:00.729> hormones<00:05:01.349> and<00:05:03.180> these<00:05:04.180> get

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
known as thyroid hormones and these get

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:14.640 
known as thyroid hormones and these get
released<00:05:04.930> back<00:05:05.380> into<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.860> blood

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.890 

you

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.990 

now<00:05:19.900> from<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.320> blood<00:05:20.590> they<00:05:21.370> go<00:05:21.610> into<00:05:21.910> your

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
now from the blood they go into your

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.420 
now from the blood they go into your
tissues<00:05:22.450> all<00:05:22.690> over<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.350> body<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:27.250> have

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
tissues all over the body and I have

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.960 
tissues all over the body and I have
many<00:05:27.700> effects<00:05:28.530> but<00:05:29.530> their<00:05:29.680> main<00:05:29.919> effect<00:05:30.340> is<00:05:30.580> to

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
many effects but their main effect is to

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.990 
many effects but their main effect is to
increase<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.960> metabolic<00:05:32.230> rate<00:05:33.000> throughout

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
increase the metabolic rate throughout

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.900 
increase the metabolic rate throughout
the<00:05:34.180> body<00:05:34.389> so<00:05:35.200> you'll<00:05:35.440> use<00:05:35.710> more<00:05:36.100> energy<00:05:36.370> per

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
the body so you'll use more energy per

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:44.250 
the body so you'll use more energy per
unit<00:05:37.300> time<00:05:39.630> now<00:05:40.630> one<00:05:40.840> last<00:05:41.080> thing<00:05:42.360> t4<00:05:43.360> is<00:05:43.690> also

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
unit time now one last thing t4 is also

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.600 
unit time now one last thing t4 is also

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
known as though rock scene and this is a

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.030 
known as though rock scene and this is a
more<00:05:49.060> prevalent<00:05:50.580> hormone<00:05:51.580> than<00:05:52.330> 2<00:05:52.570> 3<00:05:52.930> but<00:05:53.919> it's

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
more prevalent hormone than 2 3 but it's

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:04.130 
more prevalent hormone than 2 3 but it's
weaker<00:05:58.140> t3<00:05:59.140> is<00:05:59.470> known<00:06:00.400> as<00:06:00.780> triiodothyronine

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.719 

and<00:06:06.000> it's<00:06:07.000> scarce<00:06:07.419> ad<00:06:07.919> but<00:06:08.919> it's<00:06:09.070> about<00:06:09.280> four

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
and it's scarce ad but it's about four

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.240 
and it's scarce ad but it's about four
times<00:06:10.060> more<00:06:10.419> potent<00:06:10.900> when<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:14.650> body<00:06:14.830> needs<00:06:15.130> to

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
times more potent when the body needs to

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.000 
times more potent when the body needs to
increase<00:06:15.790> its<00:06:16.000> metabolic<00:06:16.540> rate<00:06:16.840> it<00:06:17.830> can

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
increase its metabolic rate it can

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.680 
increase its metabolic rate it can
convert<00:06:18.370> t4<00:06:19.180> into<00:06:19.930> t3<00:06:20.200> and<00:06:21.330> therefore<00:06:22.330> have<00:06:22.660> a

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
convert t4 into t3 and therefore have a

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.580 
convert t4 into t3 and therefore have a
larger<00:06:23.229> effect<00:06:23.970> and<00:06:24.970> that's<00:06:25.540> thyroid<00:06:26.140> hormone

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
larger effect and that's thyroid hormone

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.979 
larger effect and that's thyroid hormone
