this and it's a good idea to lay the

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.229 
this and it's a good idea to lay the
machine<00:02:17.349> on<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> couple<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:17.980> towels<00:02:18.280> now<00:02:19.180> we

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
machine on a couple of towels now we

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.880 
machine on a couple of towels now we
have<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.450> machine<00:02:19.569> on<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.019> side<00:02:20.319> let's<00:02:20.680> take

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
have the machine on this side let's take

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.070 
have the machine on this side let's take
a<00:02:20.920> closer<00:02:21.280> look<00:02:21.430> at<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.760> motor<00:02:21.970> while<00:02:22.750> going

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
a closer look at the motor while going

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.990 
a closer look at the motor while going
to<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.349> motor<00:02:23.500> need<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.190> be<00:02:24.310> removed<00:02:24.640> we've

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
to the motor need to be removed we've

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.930 
to the motor need to be removed we've
got<00:02:25.150> an<00:02:25.269> earth<00:02:25.390> wire<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.950> needs<00:02:27.160> moving<00:02:27.549> and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
got an earth wire that needs moving and

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.000 
got an earth wire that needs moving and
the<00:02:28.840> main<00:02:29.019> set<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.440> wires<00:02:29.680> which<00:02:29.799> are

bolts and remove the motor from the
machine<00:02:48.420> okay<00:02:49.420> let's<00:02:49.660> now<00:02:49.840> take<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.109> look<00:02:50.380> where

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
machine okay let's now take a look where

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.789 
machine okay let's now take a look where
the<00:02:50.890> carbon<00:02:51.130> brushes<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:52.450> motor<00:02:52.799> are

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
the carbon brushes on this motor are

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.910 
the carbon brushes on this motor are
located<00:02:54.430> okay<00:02:55.299> remember<00:02:55.569> on<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.109> motor<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
located okay remember on this motor the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.229 
located okay remember on this motor the
carbon<00:02:57.280> brushes<00:02:57.459> are<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.730> type<00:02:57.970> that's

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
carbon brushes are the type that's

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.690 
carbon brushes are the type that's
slotting<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.959> side<00:02:59.250> the<00:03:00.250> first<00:03:00.459> thing<00:03:00.609> we

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
slotting to the side the first thing we

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.729 
slotting to the side the first thing we
need<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.880> do<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.959> remove<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:03.160> Spade<00:03:03.459> connector

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
need to do is remove the Spade connector

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.190 
need to do is remove the Spade connector
that's<00:03:05.739> connecting<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> wire<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.660> carbon

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
that's connecting the wire to the carbon

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.430 
that's connecting the wire to the carbon
brush<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:09.549> then<00:03:10.090> what<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.720> need<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.989> do<00:03:11.139> is

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
brush and then what you need to do is

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.690 
brush and then what you need to do is
just<00:03:11.620> push<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:13.650> carbon<00:03:14.650> brush<00:03:14.950> connector

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
just push the carbon brush connector

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.650 
just push the carbon brush connector
forward<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.359> lift<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.500> up<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:19.000> be<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.389> little

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
forward and lift it up can be a little

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.120 
forward and lift it up can be a little
bit<00:03:19.930> fiddly<00:03:22.980> once<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.190> up<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:26.530> carbon<00:03:26.920> brush

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
bit fiddly once it's up the carbon brush

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.979 
bit fiddly once it's up the carbon brush
can<00:03:27.310> pull<00:03:27.519> out<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.799> side<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.250> motor

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
can pull out of the side of the motor

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.400 
can pull out of the side of the motor
just<00:03:31.989> note<00:03:32.350> which<00:03:33.310> way<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:34.510> angle<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.019> on<00:03:35.230> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
just note which way the angle is on the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.089 
just note which way the angle is on the
carbon<00:03:35.829> brush<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.269> when<00:03:37.389> you<00:03:37.480> replace<00:03:37.810> it

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
carbon brush so that when you replace it

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.430 
carbon brush so that when you replace it
it<00:03:39.099> goes<00:03:39.280> back<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.819> right<00:03:39.940> way

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
it goes back in the right way

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.410 
it goes back in the right way
replacing<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.500> new<00:03:41.650> carbon<00:03:42.040> brush<00:03:42.420> simply

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
replacing the new carbon brush simply

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.440 
replacing the new carbon brush simply
slots<00:03:43.810> in<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.260> side<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.650> loader

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.630 

and<00:03:47.870> then<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.140> spring<00:03:48.500> needs<00:03:48.950> to<00:03:49.069> be<00:03:49.190> fed<00:03:49.430> back

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
and then the spring needs to be fed back

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.690 
and then the spring needs to be fed back
into<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:50.440> top<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.620> carbon<00:03:52.280> brush<00:03:52.490> which

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
into the top of the carbon brush which

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.040 
into the top of the carbon brush which
can<00:03:53.000> be<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.390> little<00:03:53.720> bit<00:03:53.840> fiddly<00:03:54.050> but<00:03:54.380> then<00:03:56.050> it

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
can be a little bit fiddly but then it

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:15.220 
can be a little bit fiddly but then it
is<00:03:57.319> fairly<00:03:57.590> straightforward

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.460 

push<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.549> connector<00:04:17.549> back<00:04:17.790> over<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.450> will<00:04:19.230> stop

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
push the connector back over I will stop

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.920 
push the connector back over I will stop
it<00:04:19.650> from<00:04:19.680> coming<00:04:20.250> up<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:21.570> then<00:04:21.780> we<00:04:21.810> can

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
it from coming up and then we can

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.970 
it from coming up and then we can
reconnect<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.900> Spade<00:04:25.169> connector<00:04:25.710> at<00:04:25.889> the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
reconnect the Spade connector at the

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:48.020 
reconnect the Spade connector at the
same<00:04:26.190> time<00:04:45.710> make<00:04:46.710> sure<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.979> Spade<00:04:47.550> connector

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
same time make sure the Spade connector

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.750 
same time make sure the Spade connector
is<00:04:48.240> fully<00:04:48.570> in<00:04:48.750> place<00:04:49.020> before<00:04:49.290> you<00:04:49.470> replace<00:04:49.919> the

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
is fully in place before you replace the

00:04:50.760 --> 00:05:04.760 
is fully in place before you replace the
motor<00:05:02.360> always<00:05:03.360> replace<00:05:03.750> both<00:05:04.050> carbon<00:05:04.530> brushes

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
motor always replace both carbon brushes

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.040 
motor always replace both carbon brushes
before<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.400> put<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.760> motor<00:05:05.940> back<00:05:06.330> into<00:05:06.960> the

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
before you put the motor back into the

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:29.980 
before you put the motor back into the
machine

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.840 

so<00:05:30.990> you<00:05:31.110> go<00:05:31.229> how<00:05:31.560> to<00:05:31.620> replace<00:05:32.009> carbon<00:05:32.490> brushes

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
so you go how to replace carbon brushes

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.330 
so you go how to replace carbon brushes
