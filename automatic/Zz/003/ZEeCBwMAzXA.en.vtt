00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
eating plan some do so that's really up

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.090 
eating plan some do so that's really up
to<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.220> obviously<00:01:42.780> um<00:01:44.010> then<00:01:45.010> we've<00:01:45.250> got<00:01:45.750> this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to you obviously um then we've got this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.850 
to you obviously um then we've got this
one<00:01:48.100> we've<00:01:49.090> got<00:01:49.299> this<00:01:49.570> one<00:01:49.840> here<00:01:50.140> called<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
one we've got this one here called the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.240 
one we've got this one here called the
little<00:01:51.400> house<00:01:51.610> salad<00:01:52.210> um<00:01:52.570> i<00:01:53.049> would<00:01:53.740> venture<00:01:53.979> a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
little house salad um i would venture a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.980 
little house salad um i would venture a
guess<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.700> this<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:55.030> something<00:01:55.390> like<00:01:55.780> a

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
guess that this is something like a

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.020 
guess that this is something like a
regular<00:01:56.229> dinner<00:01:56.590> salad<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.850> could

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
regular dinner salad and you could

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.960 
regular dinner salad and you could
probably<00:01:58.270> just<00:01:58.930> order<00:01:59.740> that<00:02:00.010> again<00:02:00.700> with

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
probably just order that again with

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.620 
probably just order that again with
vinegar<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.140> oil<00:02:02.350> on<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.799> side<00:02:03.070> i<00:02:03.630> would

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
vinegar and oil on the side i would

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.770 
vinegar and oil on the side i would
obviously<00:02:05.560> ask<00:02:06.040> what<00:02:06.760> all<00:02:06.970> goes<00:02:07.180> on<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.600> their

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
obviously ask what all goes on to their

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.539 
obviously ask what all goes on to their
if<00:02:07.960> it's<00:02:08.200> croutons<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.979> know<00:02:09.099> avoid<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
if it's croutons you know avoid the

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.550 
if it's croutons you know avoid the
croutons<00:02:09.970> just<00:02:10.330> make<00:02:10.479> sure<00:02:10.599> it<00:02:10.840> really<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.260> all

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
croutons just make sure it really is all

shredded<00:05:11.500> cheese<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:12.100> keep<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.460> from<00:05:13.800> sort<00:05:14.800> of

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
shredded cheese to keep it from sort of

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.340 
shredded cheese to keep it from sort of
sticking<00:05:16.000> all<00:05:16.240> together<00:05:16.390> in<00:05:16.720> one<00:05:16.750> big<00:05:17.020> clump

tomato mushrooms and spinach now that

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.930

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
sounds really really good to me the only

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.060 
sounds really really good to me the only
thing<00:05:58.060> I<00:05:58.360> would<00:05:58.540> ask<00:05:58.780> your<00:05:58.990> waiter<00:05:59.140> is<00:05:59.650> to<00:05:59.950> be

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
thing I would ask your waiter is to be

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.040 
thing I would ask your waiter is to be
sure<00:06:00.280> that<00:06:00.550> they<00:06:00.700> don't<00:06:00.880> pre<00:06:01.240> flour<00:06:01.570> the

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
sure that they don't pre flour the

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.040 
sure that they don't pre flour the
chicken<00:06:02.470> or<00:06:03.130> preseason<00:06:03.940> it<00:06:04.180> or<00:06:04.330> marinated<00:06:04.960> or

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
chicken or preseason it or marinated or

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.390 
chicken or preseason it or marinated or
anything<00:06:05.380> like<00:06:05.410> that<00:06:05.560> it<00:06:05.830> should<00:06:06.010> just<00:06:06.160> be<00:06:06.280> a

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
anything like that it should just be a

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.990 
anything like that it should just be a
very<00:06:06.760> plain<00:06:07.120> piece<00:06:07.420> of<00:06:07.600> grilled<00:06:07.780> chicken<00:06:08.230> and

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
very plain piece of grilled chicken and

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.120 
very plain piece of grilled chicken and
that<00:06:10.000> I<00:06:10.030> mean<00:06:10.360> that<00:06:10.540> to<00:06:10.720> me<00:06:10.840> looks<00:06:11.020> looks<00:06:11.980> like

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
that I mean that to me looks looks like

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.830 
that I mean that to me looks looks like
one<00:06:12.310> of<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.490> best<00:06:12.640> options<00:06:13.570> on<00:06:13.720> their

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
one of the best options on their

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.070 
one of the best options on their
breakfast<00:06:14.170> menu<00:06:15.090> so<00:06:16.090> moving<00:06:16.780> right<00:06:16.810> along

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
breakfast menu so moving right along

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.790 
breakfast menu so moving right along
here<00:06:17.860> I<00:06:18.270> think<00:06:19.270> that's<00:06:19.840> pretty<00:06:20.500> much<00:06:20.740> it

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
here I think that's pretty much it

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.010 
here I think that's pretty much it
because<00:06:21.190> everything<00:06:21.610> else<00:06:21.730> is<00:06:22.020> milkshakes

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
because everything else is milkshakes

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.140 
because everything else is milkshakes
and<00:06:23.230> margaritas<00:06:23.860> which<00:06:24.220> sounds<00:06:25.120> really

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
and margaritas which sounds really

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.570 
and margaritas which sounds really
wonderful<00:06:25.810> but<00:06:26.080> probably<00:06:26.650> not<00:06:26.890> the<00:06:27.250> cleanest

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
wonderful but probably not the cleanest

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.410 
wonderful but probably not the cleanest

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.390 
options so that can see an idea of a few
things<00:06:31.570> to<00:06:31.720> order<00:06:32.050> at<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.980> Cheesecake

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
that it's really sort of impossible to

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.650 
that it's really sort of impossible to
go<00:06:40.690> through<00:06:40.960> online<00:06:41.200> I<00:06:42.240> in<00:06:43.240> that<00:06:43.450> manner
