00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.019
 hello friends, I'm you, I fell under gamers 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.519
 butrón here a new video and good 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.769
 guys this time will come and not 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.029
 a texture super hd and good guys 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.769
 before continuing with this video 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.320
 I would like us to reach a goal yes 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.480
 guys a goal of more than 600 light already 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.129
 that this texture is super hd and does not have 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 books ok guys and good we're going to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 continue with the video and I wanted them 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.280
 explain that this texture has no bus 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.379
 since it is a texture for all good 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.540
 basically for all types of version 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 but the problem is guys is this 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.070
 texture can cause boots if you have 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.220
 for example, it causes me wood if you have 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 Android 4.2.2 below that guys 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.299
 good because it causes book simply 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.180
 because it 's this texture I think it's 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.970
 for open gl 3.0 and then those that have 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.710
 devices from 4.2 to below go to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.710
 have problems since they have open gl 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.590
 2.0 and then this texture is needed open 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.930
 gl 3.0 so it does not give you any ship and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 good guys I have pl 2.0 and the see 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.040
 I'm super happy because it does not have 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.170
 many bugs have very few but if 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 you have remember that if you have an open 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.510
 gl 3.0 will not cause you any problems 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.460
 ok guys and good this one 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.800

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.240
