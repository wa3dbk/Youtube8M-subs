let's<00:01:29.659> do<00:01:29.869> one<00:01:30.200> more<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:37.490> was<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.909> tie<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:38.810> that

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
let's do one more that was a tie so that

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.429 
let's do one more that was a tie so that
was<00:01:39.139> the<00:01:39.259> first<00:01:39.439> five<00:01:39.829> routes<00:01:40.130> for<00:01:41.029> both

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
was the first five routes for both

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.949 
was the first five routes for both
beyblades<00:01:42.439> in<00:01:43.659> attack<00:01:44.659> mode

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
beyblades in attack mode

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.349 
beyblades in attack mode
now<00:01:45.409> let's<00:01:45.619> switch<00:01:45.919> the<00:01:46.130> mode<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.579> stamina<00:01:47.209> now

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
now let's switch the mode to stamina now

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.409 
now let's switch the mode to stamina now
both<00:01:47.630> less<00:01:48.020> sagittario's<00:01:48.950> are<00:01:49.219> in<00:01:49.520> stamina

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:50.419 
both less sagittario's are in stamina

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:54.010 
both less sagittario's are in stamina
mode<00:01:50.779> and<00:01:51.049> let's<00:01:51.679> do<00:01:51.919> another<00:01:52.069> 5<00:01:52.549> battles<00:01:53.020> this

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
mode and let's do another 5 battles this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:03.520 
mode and let's do another 5 battles this
time<00:01:54.289> I<00:01:54.319> will<00:01:54.649> launch<00:01:55.239> 40<00:01:56.239> first

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.590 

so<00:02:04.530> round<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> tie<00:02:06.140> round<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:08.480> try<00:02:09.480> that

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
so round one is a tie round to try that

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.890 
so round one is a tie round to try that
again

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
again

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.940 
again
you<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.380> lost<00:02:10.530> very<00:02:10.800> well<00:02:15.620> round<00:02:16.620> two

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
you get really lost very well round two

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:50.970 
you get really lost very well round two
belongs<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:18.080> 40<00:02:19.370> round<00:02:20.370> three

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.490 

oh<00:02:56.560> I'm<00:02:57.560> pretty<00:02:58.250> sure<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.959> 40<00:02:59.959> took<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.349> one

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
oh I'm pretty sure that 40 took that one

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:35.880 
oh I'm pretty sure that 40 took that one
with<00:03:00.650> just<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:01.069> few<00:03:01.549> rotations<00:03:03.879> around<00:03:04.879> for

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.440 

another<00:03:36.890> close<00:03:37.160> one

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.610 

when<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.599> belongs<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.230> 4d<00:03:45.200> let's<00:03:46.200> do<00:03:46.349> one

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
when that belongs to 4d let's do one

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.360 
when that belongs to 4d let's do one
more<00:03:46.650> battle<00:03:47.010> round<00:03:47.549> five<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:51.599> again<00:03:52.370> belongs

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
more battle round five and again belongs

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.360 
more battle round five and again belongs
to<00:03:53.580> 40<00:03:54.000> all<00:03:54.720> right<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.950> end<00:03:56.129> of

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
to 40 all right so that is the end of

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.530 
to 40 all right so that is the end of
the<00:03:56.790> hyper<00:03:57.120> Blade<00:03:57.480> versus<00:03:58.110> 40<00:03:58.620> Bey<00:03:58.890> battle

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
the hyper Blade versus 40 Bey battle

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.000 
the hyper Blade versus 40 Bey battle
which<00:04:00.540> one<00:04:00.750> do<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:00.930> think<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.440> better

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
which one do you think is better

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.369 
which one do you think is better
Piper<00:04:02.670> blades<00:04:02.940> or<00:04:03.180> forty<00:04:03.569> system<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.230> me<00:04:04.349> I

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
Piper blades or forty system to me I

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.229 
Piper blades or forty system to me I
think<00:04:04.590> they're<00:04:04.890> pretty<00:04:05.040> much<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.370> same<00:04:05.640> but

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
think they're pretty much the same but

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.360 
think they're pretty much the same but
let<00:04:06.870> me<00:04:06.989> know<00:04:07.140> your<00:04:07.379> opinion<00:04:07.409> in<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.980> comments
