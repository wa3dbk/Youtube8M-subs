just<00:00:35.329> finished<00:00:36.050> its<00:00:36.289> growth<00:00:36.559> for<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.980> year

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
just finished its growth for the year

that<00:00:37.370> you<00:00:38.269> can<00:00:38.449> see<00:00:38.749> it's<00:00:39.260> rather<00:00:39.589> heavily

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
that you can see it's rather heavily

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.459 
that you can see it's rather heavily
overgrown<00:00:40.519> so<00:00:41.359> what<00:00:41.780> we're<00:00:41.989> going<00:00:42.199> to<00:00:42.260> do

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
overgrown so what we're going to do

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.939 
overgrown so what we're going to do
today<00:00:42.710> is<00:00:43.100> prune<00:00:43.699> it<00:00:43.879> back<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.510> try<00:00:45.499> to<00:00:45.620> get<00:00:45.859> it

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
today is prune it back and try to get it

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.860 
today is prune it back and try to get it
in<00:00:46.070> shape<00:00:46.370> for<00:00:46.609> the<00:00:46.730> coming<00:00:47.059> growing<00:00:47.300> season

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
in shape for the coming growing season

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.130 
in shape for the coming growing season
in<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.079> spring<00:00:48.699> here<00:00:49.699> in<00:00:49.819> California<00:00:50.659> our

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
in the spring here in California our

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.189 
in the spring here in California our
winters<00:00:51.649> tend<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.129> be<00:00:52.249> rather<00:00:52.460> short<00:00:53.079> in<00:00:54.079> an

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
winters tend to be rather short in an

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.020 
winters tend to be rather short in an
evergreen<00:00:54.499> don't<00:00:54.949> like<00:00:55.219> this<00:00:55.519> is<00:00:55.699> going<00:00:55.879> to

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
evergreen don't like this is going to

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.329 
evergreen don't like this is going to
come<00:00:56.239> out<00:00:56.390> of<00:00:56.449> dormancy<00:00:56.809> early<00:00:57.649> right<00:00:58.100> now

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
come out of dormancy early right now

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.819 
come out of dormancy early right now
it's<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.699> end<00:00:58.729> of<00:00:58.999> November<00:00:59.629> and<00:01:00.079> this<00:01:00.649> will

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
it's the end of November and this will

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.549 
it's the end of November and this will
probably<00:01:01.100> emerge<00:01:01.760> from<00:01:01.999> dormancy<00:01:02.539> two<00:01:03.409> to

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
probably emerge from dormancy two to

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.130 
probably emerge from dormancy two to
three<00:01:03.829> months<00:01:04.159> from<00:01:04.370> now<00:01:04.570> around<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.870> end<00:01:06.020> of

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
three months from now around the end of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.950 
three months from now around the end of
January<00:01:06.830> or<00:01:06.979> earlier<00:01:07.640> mid-february<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:08.780> let's

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
January or earlier mid-february so let's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.700 
January or earlier mid-february so let's
get<00:01:09.110> started<00:01:09.560> with<00:01:09.740> some<00:01:09.799> fruit<00:01:10.280> in<00:01:10.460> here<00:01:11.710> now

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
get started with some fruit in here now

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.899 
get started with some fruit in here now
I<00:01:13.070> wired<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:13.939> tree<00:01:14.329> out<00:01:15.250> several<00:01:16.250> weeks<00:01:16.670> ago

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
I wired this tree out several weeks ago

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.170 
I wired this tree out several weeks ago
and<00:01:17.390> all<00:01:18.049> of<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:18.409> growth<00:01:18.710> has<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> flush<00:01:19.939> and

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
and all of this growth has a flush and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.660 
and all of this growth has a flush and
late<00:01:20.420> fall<00:01:20.750> growth<00:01:21.200> that<00:01:21.590> occurred<00:01:21.950> after<00:01:22.310> the

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
late fall growth that occurred after the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.380 
late fall growth that occurred after the
wiring<00:01:23.590> because<00:01:24.590> we<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:25.159> some<00:01:25.549> very<00:01:26.090> warm

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
wiring because we have some very warm

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.010 
wiring because we have some very warm
and<00:01:26.659> mild<00:01:26.899> weather<00:01:27.320> here<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:28.719> that's<00:01:29.719> one

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
and mild weather here and that's one

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.050 
and mild weather here and that's one
thing<00:01:30.229> about<00:01:30.289> these<00:01:30.860> they<00:01:31.159> tend<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.490> respond

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
thing about these they tend to respond

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.230 
thing about these they tend to respond
to<00:01:32.299> temperature<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.049> weather<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:35.060> you

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
to temperature and weather so if you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.649 
to temperature and weather so if you
have<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.450> mild<00:01:35.780> winter<00:01:36.430> then<00:01:37.430> we<00:01:38.090> tend<00:01:38.359> to<00:01:38.479> have

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
have a mild winter then we tend to have

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.800 
have a mild winter then we tend to have
a<00:01:38.689> very<00:01:38.810> short<00:01:39.350> dormancy<00:01:40.180> now<00:01:41.180> I'm<00:01:41.390> not<00:01:41.570> really

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
a very short dormancy now I'm not really

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.830 
a very short dormancy now I'm not really
trying<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.350> do<00:01:42.530> anything<00:01:42.979> fancy<00:01:43.280> here<00:01:43.969> I<00:01:44.149> just

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
trying to do anything fancy here I just

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.709 
trying to do anything fancy here I just
want<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.530> try<00:01:46.009> to<00:01:46.070> restore<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.850> tree<00:01:47.179> to<00:01:47.539> its

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
want to try to restore the tree to its

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.980 
want to try to restore the tree to its
basic<00:01:48.229> contours<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.329> when<00:01:50.479> we<00:01:50.630> start

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
basic contours so that when we start

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.719 
basic contours so that when we start
growth<00:01:51.619> again<00:01:52.039> in<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.280> spring<00:01:53.799> we'll<00:01:54.799> make

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
growth again in the spring we'll make

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.999 
growth again in the spring we'll make
some<00:01:55.969> progress<00:01:56.299> towards<00:01:56.899> building<00:01:57.289> density

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
some progress towards building density

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.169 
some progress towards building density
those<00:01:58.880> front<00:01:59.359> branch<00:01:59.630> here<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.140> pretty<00:02:00.409> nice

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
those front branch here is pretty nice

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.219 
those front branch here is pretty nice
it's<00:02:02.530> got<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.590> lot<00:02:03.829> of<00:02:03.859> good<00:02:04.130> development<00:02:04.850> here

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
it's got a lot of good development here

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.989 
it's got a lot of good development here
but<00:02:06.229> as<00:02:06.499> we<00:02:06.649> can<00:02:06.859> see<00:02:07.130> not<00:02:07.640> all<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.969> other

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
but as we can see not all the other

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.100 
but as we can see not all the other
branches<00:02:08.509> have<00:02:08.899> kept<00:02:09.200> pace<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.390> we<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:11.870> keep

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
branches have kept pace so we just keep

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.839 
branches have kept pace so we just keep
going<00:02:12.769> through<00:02:13.190> here

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
going through here

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.739 
going through here
and<00:02:14.749> take<00:02:15.230> off<00:02:15.969> anything<00:02:16.969> that's<00:02:17.209> all<00:02:17.540> really

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:17.749 
and take off anything that's all really

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.099 
and take off anything that's all really
long<00:02:18.079> you'll<00:02:18.469> notice<00:02:18.909> this<00:02:19.909> is<00:02:20.180> literally<00:02:20.930> a

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
long you'll notice this is literally a

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.530 
long you'll notice this is literally a

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
month's growth here this entire spring

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.110 
month's growth here this entire spring
and<00:02:24.379> what<00:02:24.620> we're<00:02:24.799> going<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.129> do<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.519> try<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:25.909> go

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
and what we're going to do is try and go

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.390 
and what we're going to do is try and go
back<00:02:26.389> and<00:02:26.780> leave<00:02:27.139> maybe<00:02:27.469> two<00:02:27.829> or<00:02:27.980> three<00:02:28.219> or

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
back and leave maybe two or three or

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.539 
back and leave maybe two or three or
four<00:02:28.639> leaves<00:02:28.969> on<00:02:29.389> it<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.920> then<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.340> will

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
four leaves on it and then it will

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.259 
four leaves on it and then it will
branch<00:02:31.909> out<00:02:32.269> from<00:02:32.889> the<00:02:33.889> petioles<00:02:34.849> of<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> old

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
branch out from the petioles of the old

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.300 
branch out from the petioles of the old
leaves<00:02:35.659> you<00:02:36.079> don't<00:02:36.109> want<00:02:36.439> to<00:02:36.530> cut<00:02:36.799> all<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.219> way

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
leaves you don't want to cut all the way

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.059 
leaves you don't want to cut all the way
back<00:02:37.609> flush<00:02:38.120> but<00:02:39.019> you<00:02:39.170> can<00:02:39.349> end<00:02:39.530> up<00:02:39.680> damaging

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
back flush but you can end up damaging

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.610 
back flush but you can end up damaging
the<00:02:40.519> node<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.209> you'll<00:02:41.659> you<00:02:42.019> won't<00:02:42.230> get<00:02:42.439> any

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
the node and you'll you won't get any

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.039 
the node and you'll you won't get any
new<00:02:42.799> growth<00:02:43.069> from<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.549> location<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:45.019> I

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
new growth from that location so I

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.839 
new growth from that location so I
always<00:02:45.290> like<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.769> leave<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.430> little<00:02:46.700> bit

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
always like to leave just a little bit

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.819 
always like to leave just a little bit
of<00:02:46.969> a<00:02:47.060> stub<00:02:47.419> there<00:02:47.719> in<00:02:48.079> case<00:02:48.409> it<00:02:48.709> dies<00:02:48.919> back<00:02:49.370> and

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
of a stub there in case it dies back and

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.589 
of a stub there in case it dies back and
that<00:02:51.829> technique<00:02:52.400> has<00:02:52.639> worked<00:02:52.879> pretty<00:02:53.299> well

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
that technique has worked pretty well

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.619 
that technique has worked pretty well
for<00:02:53.659> me<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.579> we'll<00:02:55.579> come<00:02:55.760> back<00:02:55.790> around<00:02:56.150> here

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
for me so we'll come back around here

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.729 
for me so we'll come back around here
the<00:02:56.810> back<00:02:57.049> branches<00:02:57.709> now<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.750> just<00:03:00.169> continue

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
the back branches now and just continue

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.839 
the back branches now and just continue
pruning<00:03:01.219> that<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:03.040> we<00:03:04.040> have<00:03:04.250> our<00:03:04.280> basic

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
pruning that and we have our basic

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.780 
pruning that and we have our basic
structure<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:06.530> like<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.769> said<00:03:07.310> this<00:03:07.549> is

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
structure it's like I said this is

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.250 
structure it's like I said this is
really<00:03:08.859> just<00:03:09.859> aimed<00:03:10.189> and<00:03:10.609> achieving<00:03:11.260> better

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
really just aimed and achieving better

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.309 
really just aimed and achieving better
density

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
density

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.520 
density
now<00:03:14.860> these<00:03:15.010> trees<00:03:15.900> they<00:03:16.900> tend<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.349> naturally

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
now these trees they tend to naturally

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.410 
now these trees they tend to naturally
grow<00:03:18.189> dense<00:03:18.930> if<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.170> clean<00:03:20.469> them<00:03:20.650> well

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
grow dense if you clean them well

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.440 
grow dense if you clean them well
they're<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:24.010> most<00:03:24.280> evergreen<00:03:24.909> Oaks<00:03:25.209> they

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
they're like most evergreen Oaks they

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.410 
they're like most evergreen Oaks they
respond<00:03:25.959> quite<00:03:26.290> well<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:27.879> both<00:03:28.090> side

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
respond quite well to both side

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.920 
respond quite well to both side
treatment<00:03:29.109> these<00:03:29.950> techniques<00:03:30.579> can<00:03:30.970> be

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
treatment these techniques can be

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.830 
treatment these techniques can be
applied<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:33.420> most<00:03:34.420> of<00:03:34.629> the<00:03:34.689> other

is<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.669> European<00:03:58.060> okay<00:03:58.659> we<00:03:58.810> have<00:03:59.019> just<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.439> little

is a European okay we have just a little

is a European okay we have just a little

the apex that I'm going to take a look

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.099 
the apex that I'm going to take a look
at<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.280> height<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.639> overall<00:04:09.970> shape<00:04:10.540> now

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.190 
at the height and the overall shape now
although<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.709> wired<00:04:12.129> this<00:04:12.489> tree<00:04:12.909> and<00:04:13.750> got<00:04:14.049> it

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
although I wired this tree and got it

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.249 
although I wired this tree and got it
pretty<00:04:14.439> close<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:15.010> where<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.250> wanted<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:16.259> we

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 
pretty close to where I wanted it we

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.370 
pretty close to where I wanted it we
have<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.500> local<00:04:17.859> cat<00:04:18.370> that<00:04:18.729> likes<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:20.019> hang<00:04:20.260> out

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
have a local cat that likes to hang out

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.920 
have a local cat that likes to hang out
nearby<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.340> sometimes<00:04:21.909> it<00:04:22.180> disturbs<00:04:22.690> the

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:36.689 
comes up next to the tree or jumps
around<00:04:29.289> near<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.010> tree<00:04:34.650> well<00:04:35.650> then<00:04:36.190> leaves

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
around near the tree well then leaves

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.839 
around near the tree well then leaves
pull<00:04:37.090> out<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.270> here

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
that right there and this is pretty good

that right there and this is pretty good

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
okay this is the tree as it's shaped for

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.290 
okay this is the tree as it's shaped for
right<00:04:50.460> now<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:51.379> hopefully<00:04:52.379> next<00:04:52.919> spring<00:04:53.340> and

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
growth out of it so let's do a slow 360

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:21.800 
growth out of it so let's do a slow 360
now<00:05:04.080> so<00:05:04.409> you<00:05:04.560> can<00:05:04.770> see<00:05:04.979> what<00:05:05.159> it<00:05:05.250> looks<00:05:05.460> like
