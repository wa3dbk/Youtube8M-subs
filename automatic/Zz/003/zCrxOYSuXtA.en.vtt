since<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.670> came<00:02:22.819> back<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.060> university<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.310> I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
since I came back to university so I

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.860 
since I came back to university so I

guess that's why my gameplay hasn't been

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.160 
guess that's why my gameplay hasn't been
anything<00:02:27.080> new<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.819> crazy<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:29.989> lost
