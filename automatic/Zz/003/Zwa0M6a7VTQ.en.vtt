 well we know that those tennis are very 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.270
 ugly are very simple so you 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.640
 we brought an idea to very original for 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.040
 play them exact let's teach less 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.950
 tennis and apart they like our 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.780
 friends from the USA because they are very very the 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.690
 flag usa so let's see the 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.390
 analyze of materials 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.020
 to decorate your tennis we need some 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.020
 cloth tennis smooth spoken paintings 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.020
 slats 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:45.400
 the parents and the woman wonder if at 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.320
 better have a costume party or the 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.960
 chapulín colorado but we are not going to 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.420
 give a twist wow the Colorado grasshopper 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.900
 he also delivered with him aaiún the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.330
 yellow yellow ribbon see 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.600
 observe the most and the joke is already 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.600
 we stop all follow the pattern is 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.070
 all the same is not going to buy me that's a 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.790
 little do we our own 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.820
 designs always gives a touch is more 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.190
 fun more relaxed and already everything 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.400
 depending on the occasion but if they go to the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.760
 school or something like that or whatever yesterday 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.200
 a concert I like a lot like that 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.200
 it's already good 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.079
 and remember that also painting 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.670
 textile already comes as the inflatable paint 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.670
 I'm going to put you here 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.560
 now you bolt today this you forget 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.560
 water power 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.990
 and if it does not happen that we can also 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.030
 take advantage of not only the fabric of the 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.780
 surface of the tennis we go to then to 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.280
 cover all wow how good in this case 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.530
 can be unisex this is obviously 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.189
 very feminine but good is now so 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.810
 comfortable the customer and the customer asks 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.580
 then here I am not going to leave a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.200
 little of what is left over for 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.970
 and always remember at the end of the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.680
 strips if we want 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.510
 where we can be has been a double quoted 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.510
 after accessing 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.770
 and what I can do is count on 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:32.240
 screw guiding me to fill it 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:35.390
 they are super simple details until I go 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.020
 to make a big difference not like me 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.180
 I say it turns into a tennis 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.180
 low budget in Intendance 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.400
 Today there are some tennis that paint us 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.320
 let's say artists as well as bottles of 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.860
 famous vodka 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.710
 there are some very popular tennis 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.260
 well-known brand because the German of 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.720
 little mouth very style this they paint 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.000
 while suddenly it is huichol style and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.090
 it can cost depending who I am 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.860
 I am not better than the clients 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.940
 and it makes me think that this is going to have 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.940
 what modeling lives you sign up 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.530
 beibut see the same I'll fill it here 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.080
 do not believe that it is employer 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.450
 but 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.260
 I'm certainly going to do it 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.260
 although yes 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.319
 the dedazo 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.290
 hey it is well full of sweet 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.360
 able to 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.760
 barbara beard that's what she has to do 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.739
 you at home dare and say no 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.069
 Well, if they are saying do it 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.049
 with a bigger brush on my fingers I 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.840
 I do it on a fork because they're going to stay 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.140
 stripes that were had which is the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.209
 finished and a little out of the traditional 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.099
 it's nothing else this painting for the 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.400
 good paper suddenly try it on another 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.810
 material or do another style I do not know 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.500
 me because it can happen is I have not seen it 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.180
 it is not something that we are the truth is 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.030
 that we normally like options that 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.019
 be easy fun 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.019
 and good economic 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.820
 because apart after these are going to 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.410
 give 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.540
 salt does not have to go to buy 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.150
 some the most expensive not for nothing 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.510
 then checks and we already put there the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.710
 hairline a white one red 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.900
 finish 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.110
 and here 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.210
 I grab my silicon pistol 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.280
 to follow him putting that like you 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.790
 did you do all the canon tip hen 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.940
 atalanta heel 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.680
 to this part of these figurines that 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.200
 we have here obviously not good 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.100
 exits of exercise with this is is 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.770
 more stop gonda 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.050
 precious appreciate nothing of what I'm going to 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.330
 do jogging with salts with this and they say 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.940
 I do not give away this does not run 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:23.170
 do not get latex 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:25.240
 these weapons because they are what pons 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:29.009
 cool 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.009
 and this long with the other 3 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:37.099
 they will be easy had to take the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.259
 same colors and do not be like 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:43.750
 very contrasting designs can be 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:46.750
 part does not necessarily have to be 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.750
 equal 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.230
 then it gives that artistic touch done 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.230
 by hand 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.490
 because in addition a good subject of 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:05.100
 conversation a good leagues and so many 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:07.620
 euros or even from eyeos the rest can 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.169
 be history so you can do your 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.430
 tennis and what do you think if we go to step 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.289
 step by step and we go back to see how 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.289
 finished 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.430
 mode of preparation paints the tennis with 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.289
 the reasons for your choice 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.270
 to give you a more fun design 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.670
 place ribbons instead of searches 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.220
 they will be ready 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.960
 we have finished and the truth is that 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.970
 I want to send a greeting because this 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.740
 We did it with the idea of 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.660
 suggestion that sent us village target 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.850
 who wanted good leaders for 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.120
 No, here is a lot of greetings and 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.650
