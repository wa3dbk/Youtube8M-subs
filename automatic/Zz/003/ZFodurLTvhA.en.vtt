in<00:01:29.520> mind<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.210> most<00:01:30.390> important<00:01:30.960> things

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
in mind one of the most important things

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.350 
in mind one of the most important things
for<00:01:31.500> these<00:01:31.650> electronic<00:01:32.280> devices<00:01:32.700> is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
for these electronic devices is

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.520 
for these electronic devices is
electricity<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:35.490> may<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.759> heard<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
electricity and you may have heard that

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
electricity and you may have heard that
Europe<00:01:37.530> does<00:01:37.799> not<00:01:38.040> use<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> same<00:01:38.640> electrical

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
Europe does not use the same electrical

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.310 
Europe does not use the same electrical

read<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.569> fine<00:02:37.780> print<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:38.260> there<00:02:38.500> but

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
read the fine print on there but

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.800 
read the fine print on there but
generally<00:02:39.430> speaking<00:02:39.459> those<00:02:39.909> AC<00:02:40.090> adapters<00:02:40.569> are

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
generally speaking those AC adapters are

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.800 
generally speaking those AC adapters are
good<00:02:41.200> for<00:02:42.010> input<00:02:42.340> voltages<00:02:42.760> up<00:02:42.969> to<00:02:43.090> 240<00:02:43.780> volts

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810

which<00:02:44.319> is<00:02:44.500> what<00:02:44.709> you'll<00:02:44.859> find<00:02:45.099> mostly<00:02:45.549> in

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
which is what you'll find mostly in

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.949 
which is what you'll find mostly in
Europe<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:45.939> you<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.150> need<00:02:46.239> an<00:02:46.389> adapter<00:02:46.810> so

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
Europe so you just need an adapter so

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.319 
Europe so you just need an adapter so
the<00:02:47.109> plug<00:02:47.349> fits<00:02:47.709> but<00:02:48.489> aside<00:02:48.700> from<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.939> you

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
the plug fits but aside from that you

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.170 
the plug fits but aside from that you
should<00:02:49.629> be<00:02:49.780> good<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.019> go<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:51.220> other<00:02:51.280> electrical

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180

and then I can use their their sim card
and<00:04:54.860> have<00:04:54.949> a<00:04:55.130> reasonable<00:04:55.849> level<00:04:56.030> of<00:04:56.270> service

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660

for<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> reasonable<00:04:57.830> price<00:04:58.039> I<00:04:58.460> think<00:04:59.270> I<00:04:59.360> might

00:04:59.589 --> 00:04:59.599 
for a reasonable price I think I might

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.450

pop<00:04:59.810> my<00:05:00.020> own<00:05:00.199> regular<00:05:00.620> sim<00:05:00.830> card<00:05:01.039> in<00:05:01.099> a<00:05:01.220> couple

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
pop my own regular sim card in a couple

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.830 
pop my own regular sim card in a couple
of<00:05:01.520> times<00:05:01.610> while<00:05:01.880> I'm<00:05:02.030> over<00:05:02.270> there<00:05:02.300> just<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:02.720> it

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
of times while I'm over there just so it

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.010 
of times while I'm over there just so it
can<00:05:03.020> download<00:05:03.830> my<00:05:03.979> emails<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.639> stuff<00:05:04.729> but<00:05:05.150> to

can download my emails and stuff but to

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.809

use it as a phone or to leave it on

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.550 
use it as a phone or to leave it on
would<00:05:08.090> be<00:05:08.120> absolutely<00:05:08.509> crazy<00:05:08.930> cuz<00:05:09.199> the<00:05:09.319> data

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
would be absolutely crazy cuz the data

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.010 
would be absolutely crazy cuz the data
charges<00:05:09.949> alone<00:05:10.430> would<00:05:10.909> would<00:05:11.210> slaughter<00:05:11.720> you
