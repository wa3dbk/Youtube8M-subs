00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.759
 most small small, 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.130
 innocent children went through a very scary 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.080
 common if you already imagine who I'm talking about 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.080
 that's what I mean, the clown 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.390
 that does not have a fixed form but usually 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.670
 appear generally in the form of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.710
 clown while in the novel is 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.690
 described as a cross between joy and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.270
 ronald mcdonald dressed in a suit 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.730
 entirely silver with orange buttons 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.980
 in the movie he is seen as a clown 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.080
 bald with white face red hair 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.840
 around the head a red nose 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.630
 a gorgo a yellow suspenders with 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.479
 orange buttons and white gloves 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.610
 once in a while he carries balloons in his hand in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.560
 numerous occasions tend to appear 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.780
 brown fangs to scare their 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.250
 victims what has turned him into a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.119
 character very feared by the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.880
 spectators 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.860
 many people started being cults 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.350
 phobic because of characters like and 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.259
 that is currently a very popular icon 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.030
 from all the murderous clowns 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.759
 he has a very strange sense of humor 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 is usually laugh and tell grotesque jokes 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.200
 that's an old monster created before 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.360
 of the formation of the universe itself in a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.790
 place called macrocosm to which he 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.310
 he calls the fatuous fires and his true 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.229
 way it was never seen is more possible 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.580
 that does not have a physical appearance 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.680
 definite 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.620
 this reason makes it has been called that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.540
 and in English the image that he adopts with 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.390
 more often is that of a clown in 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.190
 his underground lair takes the form of a 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 monstrous spider that is the one 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.450
 mostly approaches what could 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.700
 be its real appearance that is with which 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.130
 is left among the losers without 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.810
 these go crazy too usually 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.700
 appear under the figure of some 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.800
 animals or things that are the worst 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.470
 fears of some of the characters of 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.510
 the plot the monster came to our 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.160

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.740
