 olavo be is not legend draws 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.109
 where a work about the villains 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.979
 who to apply 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.699
 alvin years 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.919
 the characters in the restaurant 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.919
 players this logic 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.759
 The first thing you know about the villains 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.849
 is that go to a very relative point of view 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.480
 the loss of points of view 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.770
 depends on many villains per break they buy some of the case 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.860
 they are the good guys 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.440
 with the lock 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.250
 you just do not prove he speaks that they are demoliner creatures that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.629
 feel that they 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.659
 I know 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.989
 and feeding on humans and living things 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.499
 to continue 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.499
 to walk here on earth 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.100
 olavo saucers in london can respond saying it to be a rather limited proof 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.620
 What differs today 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.600
 I must be exported 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.549
 I know we feed them living things as much as you do. 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 It depends on the viewpoint 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.540
 it's difficult 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.530
 a 60% bigger villain 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.330
 and still survives 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.320
 the damage 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.570
 already a search on the internet and some fingers 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.580
 Talabani villains 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.690
 there are several types 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.010
 in a play in the front we can do has three pilot titles 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.750
 exist 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.750
 the villains classified as evil geniuses 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 that are 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.300
 which are those guys who usually have a big army 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.760
 which exempts and not one of the characters from books to structure them 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.800
 to avoid the sea the power to him that is the power the more the better policy 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.220
 as one by far to its history 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.060
 you can play a lot of stories of streaming towns villages 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.059
 families 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.739
 made by this villain 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.669
 that he will not be like an evil genius 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:17.150
 obviously he has great intelligence and does not stand out among 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:18.359
 the others 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.019
 not cumulative for five months 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.989
 famous characters 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.549
 is the helmet class 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.349
 can not accept 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.349
 ten years ago 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.259
 it's an island 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.829
 although he does not have a large army he has henchmen ii 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.889
 is endowed with a series of validity 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.949
 the other title of villain 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:48.889
 c are games like the villains 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.249
 in saints 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.069
 those who 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.289
 some disease 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.289
 the sociopath 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.689
 some mental disturbance there was simply our civic duty for the 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:06.459
 fire 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.109
 a good way of you between the similar characters of billions suffices 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.269
 you played the mysterious deaths of the city the people in the scenario that you 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.809
 have played 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:24.579
 differently and if any behavior of the individual for example 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.579
 for this 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.419
 examples of this pierre 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.610
 examples 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.210
 dir crazy characters 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.990
 we can quote the classic with the leader or renew have 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:41.650
 the third type 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.729
 I have not had a loon is classified as a circumstantial villain 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.699
 said that means he is not a villain 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.789
 He was not in the United States. 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:54.280
 bad city 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.349
 but something happened in his life. 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.539
 something happened with him he preferred to change his concepts of preservation 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:03.699
 about the world 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.699
 that would make him change his mind and drastically 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.219
 it is circumstances and that 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:14.119
 the character can completely change his behavior 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:15.420
 the server 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.879
 some badly resolved passion the good social being 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:23.879
 or something happened to your family ariane osshiro 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.620
 they are characters like ones 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.759
 in general as well as the big problem is due to this 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.020
 these are from the brazil history agency you can just start 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.539
 making this site character be a friend 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.020
 of the players 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.809
 that it should compete for a certain time opening them 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.840
 what's up 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.629
 after this phase 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:50.629
 and this is what happens without the characters noticing 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.809
 that the big villain he was looking for was guilty 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.150
 formerly 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
 were two examples that I can quote for you 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.930
 it's because the lawn of deadly games 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.930
 party guys face 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.650
 The logic that I can you deserve 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.860
 is here 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.449
 nor the end of the year is the day of the tap and the mind is a slow and gradual process 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.550
 this character is doing things 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.860
 with the characters around the characters 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.080
 free 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.990
 feed more and more if the podium 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.930
 this anger they have doubt 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.759
 I give one of the villains 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.800
 that you place the advice 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.790
 do not think that you play a villain 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.790
 he now arises everybody 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:47.689
 tereza 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.009
 but with dieter basket villains 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.680
 to match 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.309
 through a sentence is very simple 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:57.080
 the size of a hero 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.080
 no doctor for the size of your opponent 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.589
 how to create 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:07.199
 villains 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.240
 The lake in my opinion 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.220
 a good villain he lost the trail of the break he has to have a story 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:19.310
 much details the talk about the weather else said 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.969
 He has to take that risk. 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.569
 before any form whatsoever 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.649
 he has to return as soon as possible and it will certainly take three 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:29.559
 November 5 

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:34.159
 friends and duties that may influence your story or not in relation to 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.999
 age 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.580
 We can see around. 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.559
 there are many movies 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:40.330
 What are sessions? 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.330
 ef 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.170
 many villains are already mission older than they hold larger 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.490
 if you are some weakness a weakness 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.830
 to narrow your character and your guitar 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.490
 leave it more real 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.999
 good as last part is worth remembering that you do not need the gigantic limit 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:03.689
 aircraft 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:08.229
 can not put the accessory creatures supernatural beings any 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.009
 thing your imagination wants 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.849
 lisbon today the sides seem to like the accident 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:20.030
 the time you have fun commented if you want to add some 

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.110
 information so we're arguing 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.249
 and this location
