00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
multiplayer I remember around this time

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.040 
multiplayer I remember around this time
last<00:05:02.560> year<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.310> was<00:05:03.790> not<00:05:03.940> excited<00:05:04.240> all<00:05:04.720> from

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
last year I was not excited all from

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.590 
last year I was not excited all from
autumn<00:05:05.320> or<00:05:05.410> 43<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.520> wasn't<00:05:07.030> sure<00:05:07.180> if<00:05:07.480> you

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
autumn or 43 and I wasn't sure if you

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.090 
autumn or 43 and I wasn't sure if you
know<00:05:07.720> if<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:07.930> thought<00:05:08.110> mom<00:05:08.290> 43<00:05:08.650> was<00:05:08.800> gonna<00:05:08.950> be<00:05:09.070> a

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
know if I thought mom 43 was gonna be a

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.820 
know if I thought mom 43 was gonna be a
bad<00:05:09.340> game<00:05:09.730> or<00:05:09.900> what<00:05:10.900> was<00:05:11.320> really<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:11.770> you

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
bad game or what was really and you

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.130 
bad game or what was really and you
guess<00:05:11.980> and<00:05:12.010> see<00:05:12.250> I<00:05:12.280> get<00:05:12.460> my<00:05:12.580> moab<00:05:12.970> right<00:05:13.180> here<00:05:13.450> I

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
guess and see I get my moab right here I

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.900 
guess and see I get my moab right here I
think<00:05:14.920> Morrow<00:05:15.100> for<00:05:15.190> three<00:05:15.370> is<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.580> good<00:05:15.610> game

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
think Morrow for three is a good game
