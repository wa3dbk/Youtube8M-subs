friendly competition it's going to be a
draw<00:00:47.219> /<00:00:47.370> pegs<00:00:48.440> we've<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.559> done<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
draw / pegs we've actually done and you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.060 
draw / pegs we've actually done and you
just<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> walk<00:00:51.120> around<00:00:51.270> before<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:52.110> look

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
just have to walk around before we look

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.520 
just have to walk around before we look
to<00:00:53.190> some<00:00:53.309> areas<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> we're<00:00:53.910> fishing<00:00:54.239> will

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
to some areas that we're fishing will

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.600 
to some areas that we're fishing will
basically<00:00:55.530> separating<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> lake<00:00:56.430> into

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
basically separating the lake into

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.360 
basically separating the lake into
certain<00:00:57.000> areas<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.420> fish<00:00:58.070> that'll<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.160> from

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
certain areas to fish that'll be from

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.770 
certain areas to fish that'll be from
the<00:00:59.520> initial<00:00:59.699> off<00:00:59.969> anyway<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> we'll<00:01:00.570> draw

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the initial off anyway and we'll draw

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.939 
the initial off anyway and we'll draw
for<00:01:00.960> those<00:01:01.079> pegs<00:01:02.840> smack<00:01:03.840> round<00:01:04.110> I'd<00:01:04.619> say<00:01:04.799> my

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
for those pegs smack round I'd say my

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.800 
for those pegs smack round I'd say my
lakers<00:01:06.950> area<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.299> effectively<00:01:09.299> starts<00:01:09.630> just

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
lakers area one effectively starts just

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.160 
lakers area one effectively starts just
up<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:11.549> you've<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:11.729> from<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
up here so you've got from here the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.230 
up here so you've got from here the
corner<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.619> island<00:01:13.850> all<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> way<00:01:15.150> along

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
corner of this island all the way along

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.920 
corner of this island all the way along
here<00:01:15.530> area<00:01:16.530> too<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.590> here<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
here area too is this here so it's the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.920 
here area too is this here so it's the
end<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.259> island<00:01:22.470> here<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:24.420> along<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
end of this island here and along to the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.130 
end of this island here and along to the
bar<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.710> wear<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.979> white<00:01:26.220> sign<00:01:26.520> was<00:01:27.140> showed

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
bar to wear that white sign was showed

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.499 
bar to wear that white sign was showed
you<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.439> walk<00:01:28.650> around<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> draw<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> line

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
you in walk around so if you draw a line

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.640 
you in walk around so if you draw a line
there<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.530> bar<00:01:32.869> along<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> end<00:01:34.560> of

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
fish it from either side you completion

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.720 
fish it from either side you completion
from<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.650> point<00:02:28.800> here<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.370> fish<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.520> from
