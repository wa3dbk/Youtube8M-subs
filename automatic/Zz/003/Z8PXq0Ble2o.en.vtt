I mean bright as you can see I got my

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.180 
I mean bright as you can see I got my
knees<00:02:26.230> tucked<00:02:27.150> up<00:02:29.400> there<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:32.830> where<00:02:33.010> you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
knees tucked up there it's where you

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.840 
knees tucked up there it's where you
can't<00:02:33.460> see<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.320> unless<00:02:35.320> you're<00:02:35.860> looking<00:02:36.400> from

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
can't see it unless you're looking from

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
can't see it unless you're looking from
up<00:02:37.120> underneath<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.870> case<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:40.090> um<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:42.490> know

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
up underneath the case but um you know

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.820 
up underneath the case but um you know
you're<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:44.050> looking<00:02:44.320> at<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.440> from<00:02:44.590> any<00:02:44.740> other

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
you're just looking at it from any other

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.170 
you're just looking at it from any other
angle<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:45.550> know<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.700> won't<00:02:45.850> be<00:02:46.000> able<00:02:46.030> to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
angle and you know you won't be able to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.870 
angle and you know you won't be able to
see<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.580> that's<00:02:48.790> pretty<00:02:48.970> cool<00:02:49.710> but<00:02:50.710> um<00:02:50.950> it

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
see it so that's pretty cool but um it

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.420 
see it so that's pretty cool but um it
does<00:02:52.180> give<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.750> very<00:02:53.140> very<00:02:53.620> very<00:02:54.010> bright<00:02:54.570> light

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
does give a very very very bright light

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.650 
does give a very very very bright light
I<00:02:58.050> may<00:02:59.050> even<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.770> somehow<00:03:00.460> wire<00:03:01.000> in<00:03:01.420> some

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
I may even have to somehow wire in some

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.350 
I may even have to somehow wire in some
type<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.870> switch<00:03:02.490> so<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.580> can<00:03:03.760> turn<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.150> and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
type of switch so I can turn it on and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.630 
type of switch so I can turn it on and
off<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:05.290> not<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.710> bad<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.370> know

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
especially when I put the side door back

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.500 
especially when I put the side door back
on<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.950> know<00:03:09.070> it's<00:03:09.190> not<00:03:09.280> that<00:03:09.490> bad<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:12.040> you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
on you know it's not that bad but you

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.290 
on you know it's not that bad but you
