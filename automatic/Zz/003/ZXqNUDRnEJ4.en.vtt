out it's got a magnet here it just comes
across<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:38.400> magnet<00:02:38.819> itself<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.329> super<00:02:39.840> strong

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
across the magnet itself is super strong

is<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.049> easy<00:02:46.709> on-off<00:02:47.100> adjustability<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.180> mean

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
is this easy on-off adjustability I mean

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.840 
is this easy on-off adjustability I mean
I<00:02:48.600> think<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.109> you<00:02:49.739> know<00:02:49.859> both<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.579> younger

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
I think that you know both the younger

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.370 
I think that you know both the younger
generation<00:02:51.389> as<00:02:51.480> well<00:02:51.510> as<00:02:51.720> people<00:02:51.840> who<00:02:52.019> travel
