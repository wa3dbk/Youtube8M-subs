00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.320
 we started on our motorcycle 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.510
 We will follow the yellow line of the map to reach destination 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.330
 in this case we go to the puticlub with the rest of bikers 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.859
 we should not separate ourselves too much from them if we can not do little and 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.640
 read what they tell us 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.369
 once we arrive at the club 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.670
 we will see a sequence in which the protagonist speaks with Billy the leader 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:29.679
 of the group 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.329
 he wants to recover his motorcycle and that is what we will look for 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.150
 past the video 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
 we go to the illegal dismantling following the indications 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.260
 there they will tell us that the group of angels of dead have the motorcycle 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.110
 play fuck them the day 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.820
 we go to the lair of this band following the path marked in yellow 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.710
 Once we reach the lair, half a dozen enemies will wait for us 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.940
 with the armed shotgun 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.110
 we finish with them using the covers and watching to not get too close to 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.129
 the cars in which they hide 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.870
 since they may explode 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.050
 once dead billy will recover his uncle alive 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.900
 we take ours and we are in formation following the leader of the band 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.329
 a symbol will appear on the floor of the lost 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.070
 if we are inside him 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.070
 we will have improvements to act within the formation that touches us in the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.150
 highway 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.210
 we continue until the end and we will see where is the safe house to be able to save 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.540
 departure 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.780
 now we go to the apple map brand 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.970
 a few meters from where we are and what the missions mean 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 who charge us 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.530
 angels in america 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.689
 we will be in the life pool and when suddenly 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.580
 some rednecks that sell pirated movies come to the door 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.480
 they come to ask for pasta 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.580
 once out 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.040
 and after discussing 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.360
 the leader is charged to one of them because he said that the movies he sold 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.110
 they were very expensive and they were false 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.530
 the others escape and here begins our mission 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.409
 we will have to avoid at all costs that they arrive until their companions 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.929
 alert them that they have discovered the thymus and that it was better to download the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.219
 pelvis of the lares 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.989
 On the back of the bike we will have to send them to the other neighborhood 1 to 1 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.079
 the first thing will be to equip the shotgun 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.680
 since it is much more effective than the gun to immediately pursue them 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.760
 all over the map following the red dots 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.369
 joe how schools run 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:31.779
 you have to keep an eye on the traffic that comes face to face and the sudden turns of 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:32.760
 the enemies 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.879
 since they can make us fall 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.420
 we eliminate them one by one until we reach the last one that will hide in a hole 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.510
 the highway 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.459
 believing that we are playing hide and seek 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.879
 we go down where he has gotten and killed him 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.169
 once dead 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.169
 johnny will call billy to tell him that everything is in order 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.239
 will ask us to go see it 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.369
 we follow the yellow road and complete the mission 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:02.079
 Soon he will call us Jim asking us if we can go to pick up 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.749
 to his daughter who has the motorcycle in the dye 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.779
 will appear on the map marked with a jota 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:11.789
 and we can fix it in the menu so that we are followed with a green line on 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.639
 I walk to him 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.329
 liveris and tics or cars 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.209
 jin will explain what the bikes of the angels of death want for 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.459
 sell them to the Chinese corner 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.009
 Once the sequence is finished, we follow our partner to perform 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.749
 the first thing we will do is get on a truck with jim to be able to perpetrate the 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:31.539
 plan 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.119
 now we will go to the point where the bikes are parked in 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.589
 question 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:41.999
 Once we get to the area where the merchandise is located, we go down 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:46.339
 truck and we started to climb the bikes to the back of the east 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:47.819
 to which we carry two 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.680
 Quinn will ask you to call some reinforcement because the enemies are 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.279
 singing and their farts smell bad 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:58.579
 we pick up the phone and call Claudio Terry with the reason for the reinforcement 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.079
 both will come to throw us a cable 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.189
 the enemies 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.930
 that are in a parking space 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.669
 they are very well covered and we do not 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:09.979
 what suckers 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:13.589
 the ideal is to attack those who are behind the yellow taxi 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:18.199
 to our right to have a better angle of vision and be able to cover 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.039
 once dead 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.520
 We got the two bikes missing from the truck 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.599
 Now we take the van and we go to the scrapyard 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.979
 we will be chased by some bikers 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.520
 if we go fast without crashing they should not pose any problem 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.840
 Once we arrive at our destination, some police officers extort money from us 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.789
 they will do after telling us that they have seen everything 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.059
 a problem that will be solved later 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.479
 at the moment mission accomplished 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.800
 now we take the bike that is in the scrapyard and we go to the villa brand 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.680
 and on the map to continue with our walks in teletubbies siti 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.400
 with this and a cake until tomorrow at 8
