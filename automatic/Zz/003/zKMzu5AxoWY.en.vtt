feel<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.670> my<00:05:00.820> hair<00:05:01.120> is<00:05:01.330> getting<00:05:01.930> cleaned<00:05:02.350> and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
feel that my hair is getting cleaned and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.450 
feel that my hair is getting cleaned and
this<00:05:03.760> did<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.330> job<00:05:04.570> like<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.230> did<00:05:05.680> two<00:05:05.890> passes

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
this did the job like I did two passes

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.230 
this did the job like I did two passes
and<00:05:07.290> my<00:05:08.290> hair<00:05:08.590> afterwards<00:05:09.010> felt<00:05:09.580> clean

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
and my hair afterwards felt clean

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.420 
and my hair afterwards felt clean
squeaky<00:05:10.930> clean<00:05:11.260> but<00:05:11.920> there's<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.280> difference

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
squeaky clean but there's a difference

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.150 
squeaky clean but there's a difference
between<00:05:12.640> like<00:05:13.090> that<00:05:13.300> squeaky<00:05:13.870> stripped<00:05:14.770> clean

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
between like that squeaky stripped clean

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.030 
between like that squeaky stripped clean
and<00:05:15.430> just<00:05:15.880> squeaky<00:05:16.600> clean<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.530> it<00:05:17.740> definitely

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
and just squeaky clean so it definitely

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.790 
and just squeaky clean so it definitely
did<00:05:18.430> not<00:05:18.460> strip<00:05:19.030> my<00:05:19.180> hair<00:05:19.420> or<00:05:19.600> nor<00:05:20.290> did<00:05:20.470> my<00:05:20.500> hair

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
did not strip my hair or nor did my hair

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.390 
did not strip my hair or nor did my hair
feel<00:05:21.130> stripped<00:05:21.810> it<00:05:22.810> felt<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:23.590> soft<00:05:24.010> when<00:05:24.340> this

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.950 
website they have I think body products
I<00:07:57.640> I<00:07:57.820> just<00:07:58.150> went<00:07:58.330> and<00:07:58.450> looked<00:07:58.600> for<00:07:58.720> this

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 
I I just went and looked for this

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.150 
I I just went and looked for this
because<00:07:59.200> I<00:07:59.320> wanted<00:07:59.530> to<00:07:59.590> see<00:07:59.710> how<00:07:59.740> much<00:07:59.920> it<00:08:00.070> was
