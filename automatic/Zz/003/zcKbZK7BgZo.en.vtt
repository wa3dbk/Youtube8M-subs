should<00:02:43.099> be<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.549> seventh<00:02:43.939> fret<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.780> this

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
should be on the seventh fret so this

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.140 
should be on the seventh fret so this
one<00:02:45.019> should<00:02:45.049> be<00:02:45.290> right<00:02:45.560> here<00:02:45.769> it<00:02:46.430> was<00:02:46.609> up<00:02:46.819> here

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
one should be right here it was up here

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.170 
one should be right here it was up here
now<00:02:47.689> you're<00:02:47.840> down<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.049> fresh<00:02:48.439> so<00:02:48.889> it's<00:02:50.530> and

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
now you're down to fresh so it's and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.369 
now you're down to fresh so it's and
that's<00:02:53.180> basically<00:02:53.540> how<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.959> goes<00:02:54.549> it's<00:02:55.549> the

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
that's basically how it goes it's the

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.369 
that's basically how it goes it's the
e-up<00:02:57.379> one<00:02:58.040> string<00:02:58.750> down<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.019> fifth<00:03:00.230> fret

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
e-up one string down to the fifth fret

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.909 
e-up one string down to the fifth fret
where<00:03:00.889> the<00:03:01.010> e<00:03:01.040> was<00:03:01.629> starting<00:03:02.629> at<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.919> fifth

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
where the e was starting at the fifth

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.000 
where the e was starting at the fifth
string<00:03:04.280> for<00:03:04.519> your<00:03:04.639> first<00:03:04.909> finger<00:03:05.439> go<00:03:06.439> up<00:03:06.709> one

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
strain which the next chord remember

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.050 
strain which the next chord remember
this<00:03:10.519> whole<00:03:10.760> time<00:03:10.939> never<00:03:11.329> try<00:03:12.139> not<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.470> hit<00:03:12.590> the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
this whole time never try not to hit the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.309 
this whole time never try not to hit the
first<00:03:14.060> couple<00:03:14.329> of<00:03:14.479> strings<00:03:14.750> because<00:03:15.019> I<00:03:15.260> just

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
first couple of strings because I just

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.960 
first couple of strings because I just
thought<00:03:15.620> isn't<00:03:16.040> how<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.280> song<00:03:16.609> goes<00:03:16.639> you

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
thought isn't how the song goes you

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.939 
thought isn't how the song goes you
don't<00:03:17.120> want<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.419> high-pitched<00:03:17.870> sound<00:03:18.139> so

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:18.949 
don't want that high-pitched sound so

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:24.520 
don't want that high-pitched sound so
it's<00:03:22.689> just<00:03:23.689> kind<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.989> do<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:24.229> keeping<00:03:24.439> that

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
it's just kind of do it keeping that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.470 
it's just kind of do it keeping that
same<00:03:24.709> pattern

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.229 

and<00:03:28.690> then<00:03:29.379> once<00:03:29.560> again<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.310> keep<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.940> pattern

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
and then once again you keep the pattern

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.020 
and then once again you keep the pattern
going<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.750> go<00:03:31.930> down<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.409> next<00:03:33.040> two<00:03:33.760> frets

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
going you go down to the next two frets

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.750 
going you go down to the next two frets
down<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:34.840> your<00:03:34.989> first<00:03:35.230> finger<00:03:35.500> should<00:03:36.370> be<00:03:36.549> on

like the rest just sound like that so to

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.940 
like the rest just sound like that so to
start<00:04:01.360> from<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.930> beginning<00:04:02.049> what<00:04:02.530> we've<00:04:02.709> had

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
start from the beginning what we've had

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.670 
start from the beginning what we've had
how<00:04:03.640> far<00:04:03.940> we've<00:04:04.150> gone<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:11.170> it's<00:04:11.379> but<00:04:11.530> then

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
how far we've gone is and it's but then

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.059 
how far we've gone is and it's but then
the<00:04:12.220> last<00:04:12.549> three<00:04:13.299> chords<00:04:13.780> is<00:04:13.959> just<00:04:14.379> hit<00:04:14.920> that

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.449 
the last three chords is just hit that
same<00:04:15.400> chord<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.060> finished<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:17.070> go<00:04:18.070> down<00:04:18.250> one

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
same chord you finished on go down one

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.180

end with an E minor if you watch the
video<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.699> them<00:04:27.699> playing<00:04:27.880> master<00:04:28.240> exploiter

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
video of them playing master exploiter

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.689 
video of them playing master exploiter
it's<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.560> lot<00:04:29.710> easier<00:04:29.740> instead<00:04:30.310> of<00:04:30.430> having<00:04:30.580> to

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
it's a lot easier instead of having to

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.960 
it's a lot easier instead of having to
go<00:04:30.820> like<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:31.090> was<00:04:31.270> our<00:04:31.389> nail<00:04:31.539> a<00:04:32.320> minor<00:04:32.970> just

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
go like that was our nail a minor just

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.480 
go like that was our nail a minor just
keep<00:04:34.180> your<00:04:34.740> third<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.070> fourth<00:04:36.669> fingers<00:04:38.490> just

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
keep your third and fourth fingers just

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.850 
keep your third and fourth fingers just
slide<00:04:39.729> it<00:04:39.880> down<00:04:40.289> that's<00:04:41.289> how<00:04:41.440> he<00:04:41.919> plays<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:44.800> to

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
slide it down that's how he plays so to

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:58.450 
slide it down that's how he plays so to
play<00:04:45.070> it<00:04:45.160> all<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.280> way<00:04:45.460> through<00:04:45.729> is

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.840 

and<00:04:59.540> it's<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:01.110> takes<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.560> little<00:05:01.680> bit<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.040> get

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
and it's it takes a little bit to get

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.660 
and it's it takes a little bit to get
the<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.450> strum<00:05:04.050> pattern<00:05:04.440> down<00:05:04.650> but<00:05:05.370> once<00:05:05.550> you

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
the the strum pattern down but once you

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.370 
the the strum pattern down but once you
get<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:05.970> it's<00:05:06.000> pretty<00:05:06.360> easy<00:05:06.570> it's<00:05:06.870> just<00:05:07.020> really

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
get it it's pretty easy it's just really

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.610 
get it it's pretty easy it's just really
fast<00:05:07.740> paced<00:05:08.100> at<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.490> end<00:05:08.640> so<00:05:09.270> if<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:10.440> are

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620
