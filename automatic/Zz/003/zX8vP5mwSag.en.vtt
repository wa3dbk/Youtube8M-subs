00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
in them but I do not recommend that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
in them but I do not recommend that
because<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> tried<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.989> there

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
because I tried that with this and there

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740 
because I tried that with this and there
was<00:00:55.800> mineral<00:00:56.190> build-up<00:00:56.550> clogging<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
was mineral build-up clogging up the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.130 
was mineral build-up clogging up the
steamer<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.649> able<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.300> now<00:01:00.719> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
steamer was able to get it out and now I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.590 
steamer was able to get it out and now I
use<00:01:01.829> distilled<00:01:02.340> water<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> way

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
use distilled water so this is the way

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
use distilled water so this is the way
to<00:01:03.660> go<00:01:04.970> okay<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.979> starting

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
to go okay I think that we are starting

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.940 
to go okay I think that we are starting
to<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:10.619> quite

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to get going with this not quite

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.840 
to get going with this not quite
um<00:01:11.479> steamers<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.600> money-saving<00:01:13.640> items<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
um steamers are money-saving items to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.600 
um steamers are money-saving items to
own<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
own because if you're I know that you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
own because if you're I know that you
would<00:01:17.729> never<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.119> body<00:01:18.390> odor<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.320> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
would never have body odor but just in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
would never have body odor but just in
case<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.950> did<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> had<00:01:20.700> something<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
case you did and you had something that

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
you'd worn there were no spots on it or
anything<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.900> bit<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
anything but there was a little bit of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.170 
anything but there was a little bit of
body<00:01:25.320> odor<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.710> could<00:01:26.040> actually<00:01:26.220> steam<00:01:26.939> out

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
body odor you could actually steam out

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.050 
body odor you could actually steam out
the<00:01:27.630> area<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.409> had<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.799> body<00:01:28.950> odor<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the area that had the body odor and the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
the area that had the body odor and the
steam<00:01:30.360> actually<00:01:30.540> kills<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.439> bacteria<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
steam actually kills the bacteria that

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.100 
steam actually kills the bacteria that
causes<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.720> odor

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
causes the odor

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.890 
causes the odor
hence<00:01:34.710> saving<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.460> money<00:01:35.670> same<00:01:36.360> thing<00:01:36.659> if
