one of the most important things we can

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.409 
one of the most important things we can
talk<00:00:12.139> about<00:00:12.530> are<00:00:13.249> the<00:00:13.459> springs<00:00:13.820> on<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:14.150> press

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.419 
talk about are the springs on the press

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.180 
talk about are the springs on the press
those<00:00:14.690> springs<00:00:15.049> are<00:00:15.200> under<00:00:15.349> a<00:00:15.379> lot<00:00:15.469> of<00:00:15.650> tension

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
those springs are under a lot of tension

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.000 
those springs are under a lot of tension
and<00:00:16.690> we<00:00:17.690> want<00:00:17.930> to<00:00:17.990> know<00:00:18.080> what<00:00:18.260> spring<00:00:18.650> you<00:00:18.770> have

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
and we want to know what spring you have

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.070 
and we want to know what spring you have
so<00:00:19.430> that<00:00:19.610> you<00:00:20.120> do<00:00:20.300> not<00:00:20.330> get<00:00:20.600> injured<00:00:20.930> by<00:00:21.050> a

so that you do not get injured by a
spring<00:00:22.480> many<00:00:23.480> of<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:23.660> manufacturers<00:00:24.550> use<00:00:25.550> a

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
spring many of the manufacturers use a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.060 
spring many of the manufacturers use a

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
manufacturers recognize that risk and so

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.260 
manufacturers recognize that risk and so
they<00:01:21.350> wrap<00:01:21.649> their<00:01:21.680> Springs<00:01:22.340> with<00:01:22.700> some<00:01:23.030> sort

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
they wrap their Springs with some sort

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.319 
they wrap their Springs with some sort
of<00:01:23.329> like<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.509> shrink<00:01:23.930> wrap<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:25.039> protect<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.090> the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
never had a spring break so we can

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.980 
never had a spring break so we can

like this all we do is tell the customer
to<00:02:10.759> rotate<00:02:11.180> these<00:02:11.709> silver<00:02:12.709> nuts<00:02:12.920> which<00:02:13.370> is

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
to rotate these silver nuts which is

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.030 
to rotate these silver nuts which is
part<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.819> our<00:02:13.940> patented<00:02:14.360> spring<00:02:14.659> tension

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
control by rotating those nuts we can

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.569 
control by rotating those nuts we can
adjust<00:02:19.060> for<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.359> size<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.079> weight<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.319> the

adjust for the size and weight of the
screen<00:02:21.579> so<00:02:22.329> that's<00:02:22.480> how<00:02:22.599> we<00:02:22.689> have<00:02:23.049> addressed

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
screen so that's how we have addressed

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.830 
screen so that's how we have addressed
it<00:02:23.590> but<00:02:23.980> make<00:02:24.219> sure<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.489> your<00:02:25.060> springs<00:02:25.480> are

it but make sure that your springs are

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.649 
it but make sure that your springs are
safe<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.189> you<00:02:27.250> don't<00:02:27.760> get<00:02:27.939> hit<00:02:28.150> by<00:02:28.359> flying

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.970 
safe so you don't get hit by flying
steel<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:30.370> that's<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.640> first<00:02:30.879> concern<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
steel so that's the first concern the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.720 
steel so that's the first concern the
second<00:02:33.400> concern<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:34.150> spray<00:02:34.569> adhesive<00:02:35.730> there

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
second concern is spray adhesive there

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.670 
second concern is spray adhesive there
are<00:02:36.879> different<00:02:37.239> kinds<00:02:37.269> there's<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.989> mist<00:02:38.319> spray

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
are different kinds there's a mist spray

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.550 
are different kinds there's a mist spray
and<00:02:39.040> if<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.790> take<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.299> mist<00:02:40.510> spray<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.139> spray

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
and if you take the mist spray and spray

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.250 
and if you take the mist spray and spray
on<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.859> platen<00:02:42.540> not<00:02:43.540> only<00:02:43.720> do<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:43.930> get<00:02:44.079> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
on the platen not only do you get the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.690 
on the platen not only do you get the
adhesive<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.920> platen<00:02:45.189> but<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.609> get

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
adhesive on the platen but you get

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.990 
adhesive on the platen but you get
overspray<00:02:46.209> you're<00:02:47.170> inhaling<00:02:47.439> that<00:02:48.220> if<00:02:48.790> you

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
overspray you're inhaling that if you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.910 
overspray you're inhaling that if you
think<00:02:49.030> secondhand<00:02:49.810> smoke<00:02:50.139> is<00:02:50.170> bad<00:02:50.560> for<00:02:50.829> your

worse so you don't want adhesives in
your<00:02:56.620> lungs<00:02:56.889> but<00:02:57.849> that's<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.959> risk<00:02:59.139> with

a lot of shops like the web and he said

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.399 
a lot of shops like the web and he said
because<00:03:30.010> when<00:03:30.430> Flint<00:03:30.849> builds<00:03:31.359> up<00:03:31.569> rather<00:03:32.260> than

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
because when Flint builds up rather than

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.199 
because when Flint builds up rather than
clean<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:33.010> platen<00:03:33.669> which<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.909> what<00:03:34.060> they

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
clean the platen which is what they

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.909 
clean the platen which is what they
should<00:03:34.449> do<00:03:34.720> but<00:03:35.319> they<00:03:35.440> don't<00:03:35.470> want<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.769> take

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
should do but they don't want to take

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.099 
should do but they don't want to take
the<00:03:35.949> time<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.459> do<00:03:36.609> that<00:03:36.639> they<00:03:37.180> instead<00:03:37.599> spray

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
the time to do that they instead spray

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.619 
the time to do that they instead spray
adhesive<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:38.859> top<00:03:39.129> of<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.489> lint<00:03:39.729> and<00:03:40.000> that's

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
adhesive on top of the lint and that's

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.390 
adhesive on top of the lint and that's
why<00:03:40.870> they're<00:03:41.049> using<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> wet<00:03:41.799> because<00:03:42.190> it's

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
why they're using the wet because it's

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.960 
why they're using the wet because it's
it's<00:03:43.049> it's<00:03:44.049> more<00:03:44.590> adhesive<00:03:44.979> and<00:03:45.370> then<00:03:45.849> of

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
it's it's more adhesive and then of

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.550 
it's it's more adhesive and then of
course<00:03:46.000> we're<00:03:46.389> all<00:03:46.569> an<00:03:46.720> adhesive<00:03:47.199> down<00:03:47.349> you

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
course we're all an adhesive down you

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.259 
course we're all an adhesive down you
may<00:03:47.739> have<00:03:47.919> adhesive<00:03:48.220> stuck<00:03:48.669> on<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:48.940> inside<00:03:49.239> of

may have adhesive stuck on the inside of
the<00:03:49.449> shirt<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:50.440> could<00:03:50.680> go<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:50.889> a<00:03:51.069> roll-on<00:03:51.400> type

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
the shirt you could go to a roll-on type

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.569 
the shirt you could go to a roll-on type
adhesive<00:03:52.540> but<00:03:53.169> that<00:03:53.319> has<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.769> dry<00:03:54.069> before<00:03:54.340> you

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
adhesive but that has to dry before you

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.250 
adhesive but that has to dry before you
can<00:03:54.790> use<00:03:54.819> it<00:03:55.000> then<00:03:55.299> you're<00:03:55.419> losing<00:03:55.750> production

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
can use it then you're losing production

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.990 
can use it then you're losing production
time<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:56.829> that's<00:03:57.010> not<00:03:57.250> very<00:03:57.400> satisfactory

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
time so that's not very satisfactory

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.569 
time so that's not very satisfactory
here<00:03:58.479> well<00:03:58.959> none<00:03:59.409> of<00:03:59.530> those<00:03:59.620> solutions<00:04:00.280> that

I've just given you sound very good as
productive<00:04:04.470> solutions<00:04:05.470> or<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:06.370> safe

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
productive solutions or is safe

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.179 
productive solutions or is safe
solutions<00:04:07.449> so<00:04:07.959> we<00:04:08.319> came<00:04:08.530> up<00:04:08.560> with<00:04:08.769> what's

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
solutions so we came up with what's

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.640 
solutions so we came up with what's
known<00:04:09.340> as<00:04:09.729> double<00:04:10.629> take<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:11.019> is<00:04:11.199> a<00:04:11.229> product

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
known as double take this is a product

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.679 
known as double take this is a product
we<00:04:11.739> develop<00:04:12.159> and<00:04:12.370> what<00:04:12.879> this<00:04:13.060> is<00:04:13.329> it's<00:04:13.599> a

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
we develop and what this is it's a

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.420 
we develop and what this is it's a
plastic<00:04:14.259> sheet<00:04:14.290> with<00:04:14.799> adhesive<00:04:15.280> on<00:04:15.400> both

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
plastic sheet with adhesive on both

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.670 
plastic sheet with adhesive on both
sides<00:04:15.849> of<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.209> plastic<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:16.840> paper<00:04:17.259> on<00:04:17.500> both

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
sides of the plastic and paper on both

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.860 
sides of the plastic and paper on both
sides<00:04:17.949> so<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.159> pull<00:04:18.489> off<00:04:18.669> one<00:04:18.880> piece<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.329> paper

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
sides so you pull off one piece of paper

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.839 
sides so you pull off one piece of paper
and<00:04:20.289> then<00:04:20.530> you'll<00:04:20.709> lay<00:04:20.949> the<00:04:21.190> sheet<00:04:21.579> down

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
and then you'll lay the sheet down

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.810 
and then you'll lay the sheet down
that's<00:04:22.509> what<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:22.990> on<00:04:23.380> here<00:04:23.650> now<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.310> then

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
that's what this is on here now and then

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.080 
that's what this is on here now and then
you<00:04:24.880> pull<00:04:25.150> off<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.330> other<00:04:25.659> piece

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
you pull off the other piece

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.590 
you pull off the other piece
paper<00:04:27.280> our<00:04:28.280> customers<00:04:28.880> tell<00:04:29.090> us<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.480> they

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
paper our customers tell us that they

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.290 
paper our customers tell us that they
typically<00:04:30.080> are<00:04:30.440> able<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:30.949> get<00:04:31.100> 1,400<00:04:31.940> prints

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
typically are able to get 1,400 prints

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.520 
typically are able to get 1,400 prints
per<00:04:32.720> sheet<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:34.660> there's<00:04:35.660> nothing<00:04:36.050> in<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.320> air

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
per sheet so there's nothing in the air

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.990 
per sheet so there's nothing in the air
to<00:04:36.830> inhale<00:04:37.220> it's<00:04:37.850> dry<00:04:38.720> at<00:04:38.960> all<00:04:39.080> times<00:04:39.440> now<00:04:40.430> when

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
to inhale it's dry at all times now when

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.460 
to inhale it's dry at all times now when
we<00:04:41.030> do<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.360> lot<00:04:41.510> of<00:04:41.570> printing<00:04:42.020> we're<00:04:42.260> going<00:04:42.410> to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
we do a lot of printing we're going to

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.070 
we do a lot of printing we're going to
have<00:04:42.650> lymph<00:04:42.889> buildup<00:04:43.370> so<00:04:44.360> what<00:04:44.540> do<00:04:44.600> we<00:04:44.660> do<00:04:44.870> we

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
have lymph buildup so what do we do we

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.080 
have lymph buildup so what do we do we
take<00:04:45.229> a<00:04:45.290> spray<00:04:45.620> bottle<00:04:45.710> of<00:04:46.190> clean<00:04:46.490> water<00:04:46.669> we

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
take a spray bottle of clean water we

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.200 
take a spray bottle of clean water we
spray<00:04:47.449> the<00:04:47.660> platen<00:04:48.169> runner<00:04:49.040> our<00:04:49.490> hand<00:04:49.850> around

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
spray the platen runner our hand around

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.230 
spray the platen runner our hand around
and<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:52.130> lint<00:04:52.370> will<00:04:52.550> roll<00:04:52.699> up<00:04:52.880> in<00:04:53.030> little

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
and the lint will roll up in little

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.689 
and the lint will roll up in little
balls<00:04:53.530> then<00:04:54.530> we<00:04:54.650> take<00:04:54.830> a<00:04:54.889> rag<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.250> we<00:04:55.490> just

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
balls then we take a rag and we just

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.460 
balls then we take a rag and we just
dust<00:04:55.940> dust<00:04:56.360> those<00:04:56.570> limb<00:04:56.780> pulls<00:04:57.020> into<00:04:57.320> the

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
dust dust those limb pulls into the

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.980 
dust dust those limb pulls into the
waste<00:04:57.680> can<00:04:57.949> and<00:04:58.700> that<00:04:58.850> takes<00:04:59.150> care<00:04:59.450> of<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
waste can and that takes care of the

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.230 
waste can and that takes care of the
limit<00:05:00.350> removes<00:05:00.800> it<00:05:00.979> and<00:05:01.160> dries<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.790> plat<00:05:02.030> at

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
limit removes it and dries the plat at

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.440 
limit removes it and dries the plat at
the<00:05:02.330> same<00:05:02.570> time<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.979> we<00:05:04.400> always<00:05:04.639> have<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.850> nice

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
the same time so we always have a nice

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.969 
the same time so we always have a nice
smooth<00:05:06.160> platen<00:05:07.160> no<00:05:07.430> lumps<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:07.970> bumps<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.979> we

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
smooth platen no lumps and bumps and we

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.820 
smooth platen no lumps and bumps and we
have<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.160> cleaner<00:05:10.520> environment<00:05:10.639> which<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.540> work

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
have a cleaner environment which to work

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.760 
have a cleaner environment which to work
you<00:05:12.830> can<00:05:12.979> have<00:05:13.160> lint<00:05:13.490> in<00:05:13.669> your<00:05:13.700> shop<00:05:14.060> for

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
you can have lint in your shop for

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.590 
you can have lint in your shop for
reasons<00:05:15.770> such<00:05:15.950> as<00:05:16.010> handling<00:05:16.850> lots<00:05:17.090> of<00:05:17.300> shirts

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
reasons such as handling lots of shirts

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.469 
reasons such as handling lots of shirts
and<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.320> solution<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.100> is<00:05:19.270> you<00:05:20.270> get<00:05:20.450> a

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
and the solution to that is you get a

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.170 
and the solution to that is you get a
thick<00:05:21.229> fan<00:05:21.710> like<00:05:22.130> this<00:05:22.340> one<00:05:22.580> which<00:05:22.760> is<00:05:22.940> about

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
thick fan like this one which is about

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.560 
thick fan like this one which is about
two<00:05:23.479> foot<00:05:23.750> by<00:05:23.780> two<00:05:24.229> foot<00:05:24.970> then<00:05:25.970> you<00:05:26.180> go<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.419> the

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
two foot by two foot then you go to the

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.300 
two foot by two foot then you go to the
hardware<00:05:26.780> store<00:05:26.960> you<00:05:27.380> buy<00:05:27.500> a<00:05:27.530> furnace<00:05:27.979> filter

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
hardware store you buy a furnace filter

I<00:05:28.370> took<00:05:28.460> this<00:05:28.729> one<00:05:28.880> out<00:05:29.030> of<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.150> garbage<00:05:29.860> this

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
I took this one out of the garbage this

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.640 
I took this one out of the garbage this
is<00:05:31.160> rated<00:05:31.700> between<00:05:32.240> one<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.600> five<00:05:32.930> microns

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
is rated between one and five microns

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.700 
is rated between one and five microns
and<00:05:33.950> it<00:05:34.580> will<00:05:34.850> pull<00:05:35.510> the<00:05:35.810> lint<00:05:36.050> out<00:05:36.229> of<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.530> air

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
and it will pull the lint out of the air

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.710 
and it will pull the lint out of the air
if<00:05:36.950> you<00:05:37.070> tape<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.639> front<00:05:38.000> of<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.450> fan

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
if you tape it to the front of the fan

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.529 
if you tape it to the front of the fan
and<00:05:38.960> draw<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.260> air<00:05:39.680> through<00:05:40.280> the<00:05:40.460> filter<00:05:41.330> and

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
and draw the air through the filter and

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.379 
and draw the air through the filter and

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
a small shot with one or two presses you

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.000 
a small shot with one or two presses you
might<00:05:44.539> have<00:05:44.750> four<00:05:45.020> or<00:05:45.169> five<00:05:45.349> of<00:05:45.590> those<00:05:45.710> hanging

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
might have four or five of those hanging

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.920 
might have four or five of those hanging
from<00:05:46.280> the<00:05:46.430> ceiling<00:05:46.910> with<00:05:47.389> the<00:05:47.419> electrical

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
from the ceiling with the electrical

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.200 
from the ceiling with the electrical
cords<00:05:48.320> going<00:05:48.650> down<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.979> wall<00:05:49.190> plug<00:05:49.910> into<00:05:50.090> the
