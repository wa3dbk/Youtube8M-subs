through<00:00:24.740> color<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.920> color<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:27.119> in

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
through color to color I think in

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.300 
through color to color I think in
five-second<00:00:27.900> intervals<00:00:28.260> everything<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.279> be

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
five-second intervals everything can be

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.820 
five-second intervals everything can be
changed<00:00:29.730> as<00:00:29.820> far<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:30.119> color<00:00:30.330> speed<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.710> can

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
changed as far as color speed and we can

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350 
changed as far as color speed and we can
customize<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> lights<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.880> anything<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
customize the lights to do anything you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.319 
customize the lights to do anything you
want<00:00:33.860> chasing<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.520> twinkling<00:00:36.090> or
