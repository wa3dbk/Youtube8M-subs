so<00:00:13.500> bouldering<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.160> more<00:00:14.549> about<00:00:14.820> short<00:00:15.360> climbs

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
so bouldering is more about short climbs

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.910 
so bouldering is more about short climbs
generally<00:00:17.039> doing<00:00:17.550> harder<00:00:18.180> moves<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.990> above

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
generally doing harder moves and above

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
pads rather than with ropes you just

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.540 
pads rather than with ropes you just
need<00:00:21.869> your<00:00:22.050> shoes<00:00:22.289> your<00:00:22.619> chalk<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> pad<00:00:23.519> on

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
need your shoes your chalk and a pad on

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.519 
need your shoes your chalk and a pad on
your<00:00:23.699> back<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.689> not<00:00:24.900> necessarily<00:00:25.380> about

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
your back and it's not necessarily about

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.120 
your back and it's not necessarily about
danger<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.849> necessarily<00:00:27.510> about

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
danger it's not necessarily about

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.580 
danger it's not necessarily about
endurance<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.580> about<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.210> hard<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:31.529> you

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
endurance it's about how hard can you

endurance it's about how hard can you
climb<00:00:35.870> people<00:00:36.870> come<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.200> repeaters<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> climb

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
climb people come to repeaters to climb

on<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.399> grit<00:00:38.579> stage<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.660> gives<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.200> lot<00:00:40.469> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
on the grit stage it gives a lot of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.260 
on the grit stage it gives a lot of
friction<00:00:40.770> because<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.120> much

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
friction because you can get so much

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
friction because you can get so much
back<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> rock<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> lends<00:00:44.129> itself<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
back from the rock so it lends itself to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.810 
back from the rock so it lends itself to
a<00:00:44.640> quite<00:00:45.059> unique<00:00:45.329> style<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.020> climbing<00:00:52.820> there

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
a quite unique style of climbing there

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.660

the<00:00:59.910> weather's<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.359> great<00:01:00.690> today<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.260> pretty

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the weather's not great today is pretty

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.310 
the weather's not great today is pretty
windy<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.460> raining<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> little<00:01:03.149> bit<00:01:03.320> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
windy and it's raining a little bit a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320 
windy and it's raining a little bit a
little<00:01:05.010> bit<00:01:05.189> wind<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> nice<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> dries

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
little bit wind is nice because it dries

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.060 
little bit wind is nice because it dries
the<00:01:06.360> rock<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.320> keeps<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the rock up and it keeps you know the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
the rock up and it keeps you know the
conditions<00:01:08.460> quite<00:01:08.729> good<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> friction

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
conditions quite good and the friction

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.390 
conditions quite good and the friction
quite<00:01:09.780> good<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> level<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.040> wind<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
quite good but this level of wind is a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.700 
quite good but this level of wind is a
little<00:01:11.670> bit

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.510 

don't<00:01:16.710> worry<00:01:16.860> about<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.040> I'll<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.370> that<00:01:17.460> one

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
don't worry about it I'll get that one

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.970 
don't worry about it I'll get that one
let<00:01:18.450> me<00:01:18.480> we<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.020> inside<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.800> have

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
let me we can go inside and you can have

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.530 
let me we can go inside and you can have
a<00:01:20.010> go<00:01:20.160> there<00:01:21.590> okay<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.460> our<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.480> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
a go there okay so this is our this is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.720 
a go there okay so this is our this is
our<00:01:24.750> bad<00:01:24.960> weather<00:01:25.260> option<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:26.010> it's<00:01:26.130> also<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
our bad weather option but it's also a

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.670 
our bad weather option but it's also a
good<00:01:27.150> option<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.630> come<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:27.990> stronger<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
good option to come and get stronger to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.680 
good option to come and get stronger to
get<00:01:28.860> better<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.550> work<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:29.940> technique<00:01:30.120> oh

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
get better to work on your technique oh

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.330 
get better to work on your technique oh
I'm<00:01:31.020> gonna<00:01:31.140> get<00:01:31.290> some<00:01:31.500> shoes<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.980> have<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> go

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
I'm gonna get some shoes on it have a go

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.950 
I'm gonna get some shoes on it have a go
yeah<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:32.880> should<00:01:33.030> definitely<00:01:33.120> have<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.480> go<00:01:33.660> if

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
yeah you should definitely have a go if

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.880 
yeah you should definitely have a go if
we<00:01:34.170> try<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:35.760> one<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.780> green<00:01:37.080> ones<00:01:37.380> green

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
we try the one of the green ones green

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.750 
we try the one of the green ones green
that's<00:01:38.190> probably<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> good<00:01:38.910> start<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.760> you've

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
that's probably a good start so you've

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.980 
that's probably a good start so you've
got<00:01:41.880> greens<00:01:42.120> of<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.300> hands<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.720> greens<00:01:42.870> for

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
got greens of your hands and greens for

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.540 
got greens of your hands and greens for
your<00:01:43.140> feet<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.440> you<00:01:43.830> want<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.070> heel<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.460> go

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
your feet and you want your heel to go

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.400 
your feet and you want your heel to go
down<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.540> as<00:01:45.660> much<00:01:45.840> rubber<00:01:46.200> in

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
down so you get as much rubber in

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.410 
down so you get as much rubber in
contact<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.130> possible<00:01:47.760> and<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.210> want<00:01:48.330> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
contact as possible and then you want to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.300 
contact as possible and then you want to
step<00:01:48.660> onto<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.140> left<00:01:49.260> foot<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:50.190> your

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
step onto your left foot up with your

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.680 
step onto your left foot up with your
arms<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.670> reach<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.119> left<00:01:51.330> hand<00:01:51.510> to

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
arms and reach up with your left hand to

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.150 
arms and reach up with your left hand to
that<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.650> you<00:01:52.740> reach<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
that one and then can you reach out to

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.390 
that one and then can you reach out to
that<00:01:53.250> next<00:01:53.490> one<00:01:53.670> yeah<00:01:54.150> I<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:54.300> so<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:56.220> get

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
that next one yeah I think so you get

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.940 
that next one yeah I think so you get
really<00:01:56.610> good<00:01:56.759> match<00:01:57.570> hands<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.680> you've<00:01:58.830> done

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
really good match hands and you've done

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.880 
really good match hands and you've done
it<00:01:59.930> right<00:02:02.930> let's<00:02:03.930> do<00:02:04.050> another<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:04.830> your

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it right let's do another one put your

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.890 
it right let's do another one put your
hips<00:02:05.130> into<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> wall<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.180> outside<00:02:06.600> edge<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
hips into the wall the outside edge of

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.120 
hips into the wall the outside edge of
your<00:02:06.960> boot<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.500> you've<00:02:07.680> got<00:02:07.800> more<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.100> a

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130

onto it that's it it's really it's fun
it's<00:02:23.519> really<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:23.940> challenging<00:02:24.450> though<00:02:24.600> it's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
it's really it's challenging though it's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.270 
it's really it's challenging though it's
a<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.410> an<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.709> hard<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.130> tough

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
a but it's an it's hard it's tough

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.680 
a but it's an it's hard it's tough
exercise<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.790> mean<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.209> feel<00:02:27.330> my<00:02:27.450> heart

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
exercise I mean I can feel my heart

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.509 
exercise I mean I can feel my heart
going<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.230> could<00:02:28.380> because<00:02:28.620> I'm<00:02:28.739> quite<00:02:28.950> unfit

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
going that could because I'm quite unfit

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.280 
going that could because I'm quite unfit
I<00:02:29.550> think<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.300> also<00:02:30.420> because<00:02:30.540> you're<00:02:30.959> using<00:02:31.140> a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
I think it's also because you're using a

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.750 
I think it's also because you're using a
lot<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.470> your<00:02:31.590> upper<00:02:31.800> body<00:02:31.950> strength<00:02:32.250> will

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
lot of your upper body strength will

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.520 
lot of your upper body strength will
lift<00:02:33.060> your<00:02:33.209> whole<00:02:33.360> body<00:02:33.690> weight<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.230> top

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
lift your whole body weight to the top
