00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.440 
look bad but i'll show you how it still
brings<00:03:13.190> highly<00:03:13.520> in<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.640> second<00:03:13.940> but<00:03:14.060> even<00:03:14.330> if

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
brings highly in a second but even if

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.060 
brings highly in a second but even if
you<00:03:14.540> did<00:03:14.720> copy<00:03:15.050> your<00:03:15.290> title<00:03:15.620> word<00:03:15.739> for<00:03:15.950> word

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
you did copy your title word for word

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.410 
you did copy your title word for word
and<00:03:16.250> one<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.520> your<00:03:16.670> call<00:03:16.820> dude<00:03:17.030> videos<00:03:17.300> you
