you concrete anchors for your concrete
slab<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.460> don't<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.700> either<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
slab if you don't have either one of

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.210 
slab if you don't have either one of
those<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.720> maybe<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> truss<00:01:40.439> frame

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
those but maybe you have a truss frame

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
those but maybe you have a truss frame
going<00:01:41.460> across<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.880> top<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.450> actually

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
going across the top you can actually

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
going across the top you can actually
loop<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.950> through<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.220> trust<00:01:44.460> beam<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> come

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
loop it through the trust beam and come

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.039 
loop it through the trust beam and come
back<00:01:45.210> down<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:46.020> BOTS<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:47.689> they<00:01:48.689> provide

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
back down to your BOTS here they provide

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.410 
back down to your BOTS here they provide
you<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.409> four<00:01:49.619> cables<00:01:49.850> one<00:01:50.850> has<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> loop<00:01:51.299> on

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
you with four cables one has a loop on

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.969 
you with four cables one has a loop on
the<00:01:51.540> end<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.200> run<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.860> your

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the end so you would run that up to your

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.039 
the end so you would run that up to your
top<00:01:53.189> part<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> your<00:01:53.520> ceiling<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.689> simply

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
top part of your ceiling and just simply

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.010 
top part of your ceiling and just simply
loop<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.530> through<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:56.540> then<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.780> come<00:01:57.990> back

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
loop it through and then you come back

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.910 
loop it through and then you come back
down<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:59.000> your<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.840> your<00:02:00.869> BOTS<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.649> what

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
down to your to your BOTS here and what

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.319 
down to your to your BOTS here and what
you're<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.610> using<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you're going to do is using one of the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.160 
you're going to do is using one of the
little<00:02:03.509> wire<00:02:03.780> bice<00:02:05.570> contraptions<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.810> they

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
little wire bice contraptions here they

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
little wire bice contraptions here they
provide<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.729> loop<00:02:08.910> this

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
provide to you you're going to loop this

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.479 
provide to you you're going to loop this
through

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:29.490 

come<00:02:17.489> through<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.360> eyes<00:02:18.510> here

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.730 

there<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.590> go<00:02:31.240> once<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.300> get<00:02:32.390> that<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.660> place

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
there we go once you get that in place

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.230 
there we go once you get that in place
you<00:02:33.740> repeat<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:34.100> on<00:02:34.250> all<00:02:34.490> four<00:02:34.730> corners<00:02:34.760> and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
you repeat that on all four corners and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.840 
you repeat that on all four corners and
that's<00:02:35.390> pretty<00:02:35.600> much<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.490> anyway<00:02:37.490> i<00:02:37.520> hope<00:02:37.610> this

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
that's pretty much it anyway i hope this
