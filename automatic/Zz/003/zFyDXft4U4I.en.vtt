this a little bit you can see on the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.190 
this a little bit you can see on the
side<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.810> tried<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.939> keep<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.119> even<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.049> was

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
side I tried to keep it even but it was

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.920 
side I tried to keep it even but it was
breaking<00:01:55.680> off<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> side<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.880> think<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.719> think

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
breaking off on the side I think I think

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
breaking off on the side I think I think
that<00:01:57.960> happens<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> take<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> shower<00:01:59.219> and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.160 
that happens when I take a shower and
the<00:01:59.850> normally<00:02:00.149> when<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.630> shower<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.049> use

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the normally when I when I shower I use

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.069 
the normally when I when I shower I use
gloves<00:02:01.710> scratch<00:02:02.700> gloves<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.329> me<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.960> get

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
gloves scratch gloves with me they get

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.880 
gloves scratch gloves with me they get
very<00:02:04.290> soapy<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.460> guess<00:02:05.729> when<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> rub<00:02:06.990> my

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
very soapy and I guess when I rub my

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520 
very soapy and I guess when I rub my
fingernail<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:09.239> get<00:02:09.539> soft<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.170> something<00:02:10.500> I

don't<00:02:10.590> know<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.069> because<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.000> can't<00:02:12.360> I

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
don't know it just because I can't I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.700 
don't know it just because I can't I
can't<00:02:12.989> remember

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.410 
can't remember
any<00:02:13.830> other<00:02:14.010> situations<00:02:14.640> where<00:02:14.730> my<00:02:14.850> nails<00:02:15.120> got

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
any other situations where my nails got

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.060 
any other situations where my nails got
caught<00:02:15.660> on<00:02:15.690> something<00:02:15.840> but<00:02:16.320> that's<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.860> had

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
caught on something but that's it had

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.970 
caught on something but that's it had
the<00:02:17.220> men<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.490> uh<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.420> shower<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:19.470> it's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the men in uh in the shower but it's

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.980 
the men in uh in the shower but it's
still<00:02:20.190> long<00:02:20.520> but<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.270> would<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.540> been<00:02:21.600> longer

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
still long but it would have been longer

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.300 
still long but it would have been longer
if<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.320> didn't<00:02:22.910> if<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.150> hadn't<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.870> cut<00:02:25.650> trimmed<00:02:26.160> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
if I didn't if I hadn't I cut trimmed it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.140 
if I didn't if I hadn't I cut trimmed it
so<00:02:27.000> that's<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.360> thumb<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:29.040> nail<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
so that's the thumb this nail here the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180 
so that's the thumb this nail here the
same<00:02:30.540> deal<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:31.140> see<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.740> trimmed<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
same deal you can see that is trimmed a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.040 
same deal you can see that is trimmed a
little<00:02:32.400> bit<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.670> side<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.270> didn't<00:02:33.750> want<00:02:33.930> to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
little bit on the side I didn't want to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.200 
little bit on the side I didn't want to
I<00:02:34.260> didn't<00:02:35.190> want<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.400> trim<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.760> want<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> just

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
I didn't want to trim I want to just

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.820 
I didn't want to trim I want to just
keep<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:36.900> keep<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.590> length

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
keep it like this keep it that length

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.390 
keep it like this keep it that length
but<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.850> tell<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.300> it's<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.690> little<00:02:39.960> bit

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
but you can tell that it's a little bit

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.660 
but you can tell that it's a little bit
sideways<00:02:42.290> due<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> way<00:02:43.710> I<00:02:43.740> cut<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.460> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
sideways due to the way I cut it but it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.830 
sideways due to the way I cut it but it
was<00:02:44.820> breaking<00:02:45.450> off<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> side<00:02:47.630> okay

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
was breaking off on the side okay

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.050 
was breaking off on the side okay
this<00:02:49.080> now<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.430> actually<00:02:50.670> was

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
this now this this this actually was

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.910 
this now this this this actually was
shorter<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:52.170> watch<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.620> video

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
shorter if you watch the video

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.550 
shorter if you watch the video
previously<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:54.270> was<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> lot<00:02:54.840> shorter<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.320> it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
previously this was a lot shorter and it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.490 
previously this was a lot shorter and it
grew<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> lot<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:57.060> lot<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.480> progress<00:02:57.660> was<00:02:58.470> made

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
grew a lot so a lot of progress was made

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.570 
grew a lot so a lot of progress was made
on<00:02:58.740> this<00:02:59.010> finger<00:02:59.400> and<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:01.320> one<00:03:01.560> as<00:03:01.740> well<00:03:02.250> a

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
on this finger and this one as well a

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.150 
on this finger and this one as well a
lot<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.150> progress<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.960> one's<00:03:04.170> way<00:03:04.470> shorter

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
lot of progress this one's way shorter

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.120 
lot of progress this one's way shorter
and<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:06.120> think<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.510> told<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.960> before<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.890> had

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
and I think I told you before that I had

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.880 
and I think I told you before that I had
to<00:03:08.280> cut<00:03:08.520> this<00:03:08.700> nail<00:03:09.080> lower<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.410> look<00:03:10.650> at<00:03:10.770> it

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.199 

that<00:03:52.220> one<00:03:52.459> look<00:03:52.880> at<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.610> way<00:03:55.850> longer

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
that one look at that this is way longer

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:04.840 
that one look at that this is way longer
than<00:03:56.360> before<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:58.240> this<00:03:59.240> one<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:03.650> my<00:04:03.770> thumb<00:04:04.069> so
