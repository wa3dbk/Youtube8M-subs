 I guess I'm a surplus equivalent to that has been with for free 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:42.860
 Well, I've put it back and forth but in the previous video of this video

 To 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.130
 The person who this banana penetrates is the item that this butter is a lock sheet in Baron. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.090
 I will transform using 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:32.469
 The back side is such a feeling that it becomes quite busy inside 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.680
 By the way, two AAA batteries will be required for the driver, so be careful as this is sold separately 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.890
 Please 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:47.110

 Masu Tei 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:08.580
 One by one in It is chock had been entered in this manner will continue to check the middle 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:15.710
 First, the instruction manual 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:17.900
 Left and right of the melt is of this one belt I'm yellow fluorescence 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.010
 This is a belt stop 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.010
 Baron's face plate 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.260
 Izumiya blade for driver 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.760

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.350
 Deluxe Panalock Seed 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.440
 And it is the body of the last battle pole driver 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:45.500
 Peel off Terry hot flashes Te 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:49.580
 It will be something more than is included in the 1 round of the Six-&amp; Baron set of queuing driver 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.490
 At this time opening + 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:01.890
 I think I will go to the preparation before playing 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:03.020
 It is the installation of the blade belt and removing the pre- loto 6 seed tape which inserts the basic battery 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.180
 Ne 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:11.420
 Then I would like to put the locals into the body of the driver for relaxing battle . 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.650
 It is this part that the wrench enters 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:21.330
 It is along with how to spear One because so far of meeting driver is basically 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:24.020
 It is ok if you insert a slender one and slide it 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.500
 The lid opens like this 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.500
 Here are the two set for AAA enemy territory 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.600
 If you throw 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.850
 ana 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.180
 Before turning on the power 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:45.130
 Let's wear a blade and a belt 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:52.590
 The blade is ok if you set this round part like this 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.590
 It is necessary to set by the rain in such a feeling that this ditch is matched for the removal 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.700
 Oh and ok So crispy if put into place in such a feeling 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.300
 It has become a fire that expires 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.060
 The 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:10.960
 It is such a feeling- 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:19.120
 You need to put more power than you imagined 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:22.940
 And this belt gets 2 yellow belts This is lr so that the right and left can be seen 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.910
 L bet l is because it is written 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:30.870
 Well while pressing this upper limit button 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:37.080
 If set, it's ok here with the old driver 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:43.099
 Here also red while pressing the button flush against the r and r 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.099
 The belt stopper is attached to the left side of this l 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:53.920
 It is man-trail locations are in this area in accordance with the eh waist size 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.150
 I went to eat it earlier 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.630
 Stop the belt 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:07.840
 I 'll take it to this seam 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.440
 This of Japan Verdot can be wound in the waist of your child's in such a feeling that has been fixed 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.290
 I will 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:18.510
 The video will disappear, so I would like to do a detailed review in the next video 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.510
 I would like to turn on the power for a moment 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:29.330
 It is a nice large pronunciation Sengoku dry blue 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:33.470
 I feel like I have some belts 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:37.669
 I driver is the first time who say the bell toe name 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.889
 Also I would like to turn towards the lock seed in 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:46.470
 As there is insulation tape from orange lock seed in the first place 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:49.560
 It takes this power button on the 6 seed because there at the bottom 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:52.160
 The one with this patch will be on 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.160
 Ha 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:02.070
 I hope the other brackets 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.070
 Sounds of kabuki-ish feel flow Next is banana lock seal 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.510
 Just like water tape 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.510
 Power on 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.009
 This is also good for Baron 's appearance 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.430
 It'll kind of sound flow 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:27.719
 As we finished opening and preparation of one pass, this battle pole driver in the next video 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.719
 I would like to confirm the rock seed gimmick
