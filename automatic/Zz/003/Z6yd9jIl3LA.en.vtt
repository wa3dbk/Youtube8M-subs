00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
doubled speed and then they would just

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.540

people are gonna try to maybe bring back

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.510 
people are gonna try to maybe bring back
the<00:01:08.909> Escadrille<00:01:09.450> idea<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.470> momentum<00:01:10.830> maybe

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
the Escadrille idea or momentum maybe

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.030 
the Escadrille idea or momentum maybe
see<00:01:12.060> how<00:01:12.180> slam<00:01:12.540> slash<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:13.140> against<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
see how slam slash does against that and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.320 
see how slam slash does against that and
obviously<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> video<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.060> guys<00:01:15.180> are

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
obviously in the video you guys are

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.990 
obviously in the video you guys are
about<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> watch<00:01:15.689> it'll<00:01:16.350> kind<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.770> add<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
about to watch it'll kind of add on to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.830 
about to watch it'll kind of add on to
my<00:01:18.229> hypothesis<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.549> sandslash<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.880> good<00:01:21.600> in

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
my hypothesis that sandslash is good in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
my hypothesis that sandslash is good in
certain<00:01:22.170> situations<00:01:22.680> i'll<00:01:22.860> explain<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.670> i

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
certain situations i'll explain it as i

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.200 
certain situations i'll explain it as i
keep<00:01:23.850> going

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
keep going

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.399 
keep going
so<00:01:24.540> obviously<00:01:24.810> let's<00:01:24.990> take<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:25.350> at

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
so obviously let's take a look at

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
so obviously let's take a look at
Escadrille<00:01:25.830> member<00:01:26.189> Escadrille<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

control Cobb and maybe like a really
long<00:01:41.520> while<00:01:41.759> back<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.360> too<00:01:42.540> far<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.960> don't

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
long while back not too far and I don't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.300 
long while back not too far and I don't
think<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.290> was<00:01:43.350> too<00:01:43.530> long<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
think it was too long but it was like a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.639 
think it was too long but it was like a
I<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> was<00:01:45.360> close<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.720> year<00:01:45.960> maybe<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
I think it was close to a year maybe a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.840 
I think it was close to a year maybe a
little<00:01:46.799> bit<00:01:46.979> over<00:01:47.040> maybe<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.640> less

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the same ability and the thing is Sam /

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
can pretty much run the exact same set

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.429 
can pretty much run the exact same set
that<00:02:04.200> escargots<00:02:04.890> did<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.670> SD

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
that escargots did you know if so SD

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.930 
that escargots did you know if so SD
earthquake<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.190> even<00:02:08.369> run<00:02:08.489> stone<00:02:08.759> edge

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
earthquake it can even run stone edge

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940 
earthquake it can even run stone edge
over<00:02:09.179> rockslide<00:02:09.840> which<00:02:10.080> gives<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.530> little

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
over rockslide which gives it a little

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
over rockslide which gives it a little
bit<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.160> help<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.520> its<00:02:11.910> attack<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
bit of help up its attack you know a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.610 
bit of help up its attack you know a
little<00:02:12.810> bit<00:02:12.870> lower<00:02:13.050> than<00:02:13.170> espadrille

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
little bit lower than espadrille

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.830 
little bit lower than espadrille
so<00:02:14.160> stone-age<00:02:14.550> helps<00:02:14.849> with<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.690> can

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so stone-age helps with that and you can

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
so stone-age helps with that and you can
either<00:02:15.930> run<00:02:16.230> rapid<00:02:16.680> spin<00:02:16.890> x-scissor<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:17.940> it

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
either run rapid spin x-scissor if it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.320 
either run rapid spin x-scissor if it

I<00:02:58.590> think<00:02:58.799> Escadrille<00:02:59.220> has<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> little<00:02:59.700> bit<00:02:59.790> more

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
I think Escadrille has a little bit more

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.000 
I think Escadrille has a little bit more
so<00:03:00.599> that's<00:03:00.900> not<00:03:00.989> really<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.230> big<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> deal

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
so that's not really that big of a deal

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.520 
so that's not really that big of a deal
and<00:03:02.099> then<00:03:02.489> speed<00:03:02.849> escrow<00:03:03.420> Joel<00:03:03.629> has<00:03:03.840> 88<00:03:04.260> base

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
and then speed escrow Joel has 88 base

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.580 
and then speed escrow Joel has 88 base
speed<00:03:04.829> while<00:03:05.129> San<00:03:05.700> /<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.180> has<00:03:06.299> only<00:03:06.480> 65<00:03:07.019> so
