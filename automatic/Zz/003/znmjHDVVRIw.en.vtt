so<00:00:17.640> far<00:00:17.670> well<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.690> ultimately<00:00:18.869> when

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
so far well I think that ultimately when

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.230 
so far well I think that ultimately when
they<00:00:19.710> looked<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.279> these<00:00:20.400> two<00:00:20.640> games<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.119> begin

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
they looked at these two games to begin

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.000 
they looked at these two games to begin
with<00:00:21.539> when<00:00:21.869> they<00:00:21.960> had<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.199> go<00:00:22.289> down<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.529> Central

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
with when they had to go down to Central

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.679 
with when they had to go down to Central
America<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.430> take<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.730> Guatemala<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.480> got

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
America to take on Guatemala if they got

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.240 
America to take on Guatemala if they got
four<00:00:24.990> points<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.680> first<00:00:25.980> two<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
four points out of this first two I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.650 
four points out of this first two I
think<00:00:26.400> you're<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:26.849> Klinsmann<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.330> company

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
think you're going Klinsmann and company

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.120 
think you're going Klinsmann and company
would<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:27.810> pretty<00:00:28.109> happy<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.619> when<00:00:29.039> they

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
would be pretty happy with it when they

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
would be pretty happy with it when they
look<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> long<00:00:29.820> term<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.630> qualifying

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
look at the long term of this qualifying

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.770 
look at the long term of this qualifying
in<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.920> group<00:00:32.160> stage<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:33.090> i<00:00:33.300> think<00:00:33.750> that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
in this group stage but i think that

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.720 
in this group stage but i think that
considering<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> lead<00:00:35.100> against

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
considering they have the lead against

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.490 
considering they have the lead against
guatemala<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> second<00:00:36.870> half<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.290> 10

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
guatemala in the second half with 10

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
guatemala in the second half with 10
minutes<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.610> gave<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:39.149> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
minutes to go and they gave it up I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
minutes to go and they gave it up I
think<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.140> probably<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.530> US<00:00:40.739> will<00:00:40.980> believe

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
think that probably the US will believe

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520 
think that probably the US will believe
that<00:00:41.520> they<00:00:41.670> should<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.690> gotten<00:00:42.960> six<00:00:43.230> points

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that they should have gotten six points

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.529 
that they should have gotten six points
out<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.370> questions<00:00:44.910> about<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
out of all this some questions about the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
out of all this some questions about the
lineups<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.469> Jurgen<00:00:46.829> Klinsmann's<00:00:47.280> teams

has to stand out for me and he didn't

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100 
has to stand out for me and he didn't

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
in particular he was pretty invisible in
absent<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:25.950> most<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> game<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.150> think

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
absent for most of the game so I think

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
absent for most of the game so I think
he<00:01:27.600> obviously<00:01:28.049> has<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> talent<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.890> know<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
he obviously has the talent we know that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
he obviously has the talent we know that
will<00:01:30.000> he<00:01:30.150> pick<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:30.630> once<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> next

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
will he pick it up once the next

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
will he pick it up once the next
qualifiers<00:01:31.590> come<00:01:31.770> up<00:01:31.860> he<00:01:32.130> played<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.549> well<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
qualifiers come up he played so well and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.249 
qualifiers come up he played so well and
that<00:01:32.970> tune<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.329> against<00:01:33.600> Scotland<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> think

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
that tune up against Scotland I think

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.749 
that tune up against Scotland I think
everybody<00:01:34.530> was<00:01:34.650> expecting<00:01:34.890> Landon<00:01:35.400> Donovan

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
everybody was expecting Landon Donovan

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.370 
everybody was expecting Landon Donovan
to<00:01:35.880> play<00:01:36.000> well<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.210> these<00:01:36.299> qualifiers<00:01:36.750> still

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
to play well in these qualifiers still

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
to play well in these qualifiers still
some<00:01:37.560> work<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:37.979> him<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.390> look

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
some work to do for him but if you look

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.390 
some work to do for him but if you look
at<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> roster<00:01:40.140> there<00:01:40.560> might<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.280> more

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
at that roster there might be some more

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
at that roster there might be some more
additions<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.299> forward<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.689> summer<00:01:42.930> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
there one player on the outside you'd

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
today and we're thinking it would be

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
today and we're thinking it would be
interesting<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> player<00:01:50.130> who<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.490> hit

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
interesting to have a player who can hit

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.639 
interesting to have a player who can hit
a<00:01:50.700> free-kick<00:01:51.030> especially<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.899> goal<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.470> saw

of eyes on them what about Jurgen
Klinsmann<00:02:20.970> he<00:02:21.120> might<00:02:21.300> face<00:02:21.510> more<00:02:21.750> pressure

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
make of Jurgen Klinsmann's tactic so far

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.290 
make of Jurgen Klinsmann's tactic so far
so<00:02:26.010> far<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.280> think<00:02:26.370> he's<00:02:26.640> done<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.940> right<00:02:27.060> thing

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
so far I think he's done the right thing

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.580 
so far I think he's done the right thing
I<00:02:27.390> mean<00:02:27.510> obviously<00:02:27.600> against<00:02:28.050> antigua<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
I mean obviously against antigua and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.840 
I mean obviously against antigua and
barbuda<00:02:28.860> they<00:02:29.100> knew<00:02:29.250> they<00:02:29.370> were<00:02:29.430> gonna<00:02:29.520> sit

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
barbuda they knew they were gonna sit

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.160 
barbuda they knew they were gonna sit
back<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:30.900> out<00:02:30.930> an

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
back so you just have to go out an

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.690 
back so you just have to go out an
attack<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.650> don't<00:02:31.830> think<00:02:32.010> he<00:02:32.130> was<00:02:32.220> happy<00:02:32.580> with

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
attack I don't think he was happy with

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.460 
attack I don't think he was happy with
having<00:02:32.850> let<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.300> goal<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.840> was<00:02:34.290> something

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
having let up a goal that was something

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.410 
having let up a goal that was something
I<00:02:34.620> did<00:02:35.130> not<00:02:35.280> want<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.550> do<00:02:35.670> remembering<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.209> group

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
I did not want to do remembering a group

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.360 
I did not want to do remembering a group
stage<00:02:36.690> goal<00:02:36.989> differential<00:02:37.410> could<00:02:37.800> matter<00:02:38.069> in

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
stage goal differential could matter in

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.949 
stage goal differential could matter in
the<00:02:38.489> end<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> don't<00:02:39.569> think<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.810> was<00:02:39.930> a

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the end so I don't think that was a

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.620 
the end so I don't think that was a
something<00:02:40.800> he<00:02:41.069> was<00:02:41.190> happy<00:02:41.489> with<00:02:41.610> but<00:02:42.000> against

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
something he was happy with but against

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.020 
something he was happy with but against
guatemala<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.440> loved<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.069> high<00:02:44.340> tempo<00:02:44.790> there

very very strong and and tried to play a
high<00:02:49.799> temple<00:02:50.220> game<00:02:50.400> which<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.730> what<00:02:50.880> he<00:02:51.090> has

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
high temple game which is what he has

high temple game which is what he has
said<00:02:51.420> he<00:02:51.600> wants<00:02:51.780> from<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.470> tactical<00:02:52.830> standpoint

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
said he wants from a tactical standpoint

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.970 
said he wants from a tactical standpoint
the<00:02:53.700> 433<00:02:54.150> seems<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.019> gelling<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.560> little<00:02:55.860> bit

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
the 433 seems to be gelling a little bit

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.430 
the 433 seems to be gelling a little bit
more<00:02:56.250> I'm<00:02:56.970> still<00:02:57.360> curious<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.080> who's<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
more I'm still curious as to who's the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.199 
more I'm still curious as to who's the
best<00:02:58.650> option<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.250> top<00:02:59.489> Herculez<00:03:00.150> Gomez

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
best option up top Herculez Gomez

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.390 
best option up top Herculez Gomez
startup<00:03:00.840> therefore<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.980> second<00:03:02.310> game

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
startup therefore in the second game

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.979 
startup therefore in the second game
against<00:03:02.640> guatemala<00:03:02.700> was<00:03:03.269> Terrence<00:03:03.569> Boyd<00:03:03.750> up

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
against guatemala was Terrence Boyd up

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.380 
against guatemala was Terrence Boyd up
there<00:03:04.200> against<00:03:04.410> Antigua<00:03:05.239> ultimately<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.330> think

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
there against Antigua ultimately I think

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.850 
there against Antigua ultimately I think
Jozy<00:03:06.810> Altidore's<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> best<00:03:07.470> player<00:03:07.650> when<00:03:07.830> he

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
Jozy Altidore's the best player when he

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.530 
Jozy Altidore's the best player when he
came<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.280> against<00:03:08.489> guatemala<00:03:08.640> he<00:03:09.360> actually

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
came in against guatemala he actually

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.240 
came in against guatemala he actually
started<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.959> energize<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.650> us<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> little<00:03:11.100> bit

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
started to energize the us a little bit

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.039 
started to energize the us a little bit
in<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.489> attack<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.269> think<00:03:12.570> klinsmann<00:03:12.959> will

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
in the attack so I think klinsmann will

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.630 
in the attack so I think klinsmann will
be<00:03:13.140> happy<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.590> I'm<00:03:13.859> pretty<00:03:14.130> happy<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.459> far

be happy and I'm pretty happy so far

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.670 
be happy and I'm pretty happy so far

going to be warm there so that's not

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
games that really matter that's going to

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.220 
games that really matter that's going to
be<00:04:02.850> difficult<00:04:03.000> actually<00:04:03.480> for<00:04:03.750> both<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.139> these

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
be difficult actually for both of these

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.720 
be difficult actually for both of these
teams<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:04.889> probably<00:04:05.190> more<00:04:05.310> different<00:04:05.609> go<00:04:05.670> up

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730
