00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.010 
did change my life and
because<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:04.220> was<00:02:04.370> the<00:02:04.850> first<00:02:04.880> time<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.780> was

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
because it was the first time that I was

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.359 
because it was the first time that I was
truly<00:02:06.320> testing<00:02:06.950> myself<00:02:07.100> against<00:02:07.880> a

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
monumental real world challenge and I

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.720 
monumental real world challenge and I
always<00:02:12.290> felt<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.740> was<00:02:12.860> up<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.220> task<00:02:13.250> but

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
always felt I was up to the task but

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.430 
always felt I was up to the task but
this<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.060> first<00:02:14.270> time<00:02:14.450> we're<00:02:14.690> at<00:02:15.080> rocky

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
this is the first time we're at rocky

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.410 
this is the first time we're at rocky
put<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:15.710> money<00:02:15.890> where<00:02:16.010> my<00:02:16.130> mouth<00:02:16.280> was<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:16.970> see

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
put my money where my mouth was and see

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.880 
put my money where my mouth was and see
could<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.720> really<00:02:17.990> go<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.380> make<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> difference

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
could I really go and make a difference

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.530 
could I really go and make a difference
and<00:02:19.040> could<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.250> really<00:02:19.580> deliver<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.330> and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
and could I really deliver on this and

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.070 
and could I really deliver on this and
so<00:02:21.320> for<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.310> project<00:02:22.820> launched<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.840> can

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080

takes to really improve the state of
health<00:03:29.870> care<00:03:30.110> but<00:03:30.620> what<00:03:30.769> we<00:03:30.890> do<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.190> we<00:03:31.340> i<00:03:31.370> think

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
health care but what we do is we i think

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.229 
health care but what we do is we i think
our<00:03:31.970> unique<00:03:32.630> points<00:03:33.590> are<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.920> fact<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.250> one

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
our unique points are the fact that one

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.259 
our unique points are the fact that one
we<00:03:35.570> focus<00:03:35.989> on<00:03:36.280> delivering<00:03:37.280> healthcare<00:03:37.970> at

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
we focus on delivering healthcare at

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.509 
we focus on delivering healthcare at
scale<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.260> we<00:03:39.290> will<00:03:39.650> look<00:03:39.860> at<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.190> actual

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
scale so we will look at the actual

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.250 
scale so we will look at the actual
burden<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.000> disease<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.570> country<00:03:41.959> if<00:03:42.080> it's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
burden of disease in the country if it's

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.470 
burden of disease in the country if it's
two<00:03:42.500> million<00:03:42.860> people<00:03:43.010> who<00:03:43.370> need<00:03:43.550> treatment<00:03:43.790> we

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
two million people who need treatment we

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.140 
two million people who need treatment we
will<00:03:44.600> design<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.989> program<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:46.160> as<00:03:46.430> early<00:03:46.610> and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
will design a program that as early and

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.090 
will design a program that as early and
quickly<00:03:47.360> as<00:03:47.600> possible<00:03:48.080> can<00:03:48.380> actually<00:03:48.890> treat

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
quickly as possible can actually treat

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.340 
quickly as possible can actually treat
two<00:03:49.340> million<00:03:49.700> people<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.630> second<00:03:50.989> hallmark

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
two million people the second hallmark

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.100 
two million people the second hallmark
of<00:03:51.500> our<00:03:51.800> approach<00:03:52.100> is<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.430> we<00:03:53.110> bring

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
of our approach is that we bring

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.310 
of our approach is that we bring
non-traditional<00:03:54.769> skill<00:03:55.519> sets<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:56.030> bear<00:03:57.019> on

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
non-traditional skill sets to bear on

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.850 
non-traditional skill sets to bear on
traditional<00:03:58.070> healthcare<00:03:58.430> issues<00:03:59.560> having<00:04:00.560> an

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
traditional healthcare issues having an
