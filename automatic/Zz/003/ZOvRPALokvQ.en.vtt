00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
which is probably quite a bit quite a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.870 
which is probably quite a bit quite a
few<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.100> who<00:00:17.220> are<00:00:17.369> planning<00:00:17.760> on

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
generation consoles because ps4 is

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.140 
generation consoles because ps4 is
definitely<00:00:24.680> ahead<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> Xbox<00:00:26.279> one<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.000> this

themselves which is definitely a good

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.020 
themselves which is definitely a good

released a statement that makes pretty

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.800 
released a statement that makes pretty
good<00:02:08.940> sense<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.780> whether

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
good sense of whether

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.440 
good sense of whether
while<00:02:11.500> people<00:02:12.130> are<00:02:12.370> going<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.970> have<00:02:13.209> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
while people are going to have to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.559 
while people are going to have to
purchase<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.670> PlayStation<00:02:15.670> Plus<00:02:15.700> membership

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
purchase a PlayStation Plus membership

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.750 
purchase a PlayStation Plus membership
which<00:02:18.750> will<00:02:19.750> probably<00:02:20.319> run<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.680> about<00:02:20.890> $50

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
which will probably run you about $50

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.210 
which will probably run you about $50
per<00:02:21.970> year<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.319> just<00:02:23.530> depends<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.040> how

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
per year and that just depends on how

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.370 
per year and that just depends on how
you<00:02:24.280> how<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.000> have<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.450> set<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:26.050> can<00:02:26.200> pay

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
you how you have it set up you can pay

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.150 
you how you have it set up you can pay
monthly<00:02:27.720> every<00:02:28.720> three<00:02:29.410> months<00:02:29.590> or<00:02:29.860> every<00:02:29.920> year

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
monthly every three months or every year

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.080 
monthly every three months or every year
I<00:02:30.430> believe<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.840> yeah<00:02:32.080> about<00:02:32.560> $50<00:02:33.519> per<00:02:33.550> year

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090

we're developing many new ways to play

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.170 
we're developing many new ways to play
and<00:03:40.840> connect<00:03:41.410> which<00:03:41.829> requires<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.790> large

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
and connect which requires a large

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.110 
and connect which requires a large
investment<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:44.049> resources<00:03:44.970> considering<00:03:45.970> the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
investment of resources considering the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.620 
investment of resources considering the
cost<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:47.440> try<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.709> keep<00:03:48.010> such<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.489> service<00:03:48.790> free

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
cost to try to keep such a service free

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.949 
cost to try to keep such a service free
and<00:03:50.190> consequently<00:03:51.190> lower<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.880> quality<00:03:52.120> would

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
and consequently lower the quality would

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.800 
and consequently lower the quality would
be<00:03:53.170> absurd<00:03:53.430> we<00:03:54.430> decided<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.030> if<00:03:55.299> that's<00:03:55.569> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
be absurd we decided that if that's the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.539 
be absurd we decided that if that's the
case<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.590> would<00:03:56.680> be<00:03:56.859> better<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.190> receive

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
case and it would be better to receive

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.660 
case and it would be better to receive
proper<00:03:58.359> payment<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.109> continue<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.250> offer<00:04:00.430> a

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670

the ps3 and I'm not even sure about the
ps2<00:05:06.540> but<00:05:07.540> I'm<00:05:07.660> sure<00:05:07.870> they<00:05:08.260> didn't<00:05:08.530> charge<00:05:08.770> for

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
ps2 but I'm sure they didn't charge for

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.110 
ps2 but I'm sure they didn't charge for
ps2<00:05:09.550> either

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
ps2 either

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.840

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
but yeah with ps3 they probably didn't

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.440 
but yeah with ps3 they probably didn't
have<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:16.180> put<00:05:16.390> quite<00:05:17.290> a<00:05:17.410> big<00:05:17.740> quite<00:05:18.520> as<00:05:18.700> big<00:05:19.210> of
