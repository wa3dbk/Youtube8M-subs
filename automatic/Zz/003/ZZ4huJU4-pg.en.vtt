00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.429
 and then good staff decided to make this one 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.389
 an informational on the support of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.660
 gnv looks like it is now a new one 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.330
 rule in relation to this and I went to do 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.070
 the survey of the car that happened 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.650
 happened to fall 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.119
 it is upon some requirements one of the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.840
 requirements are the support the gas support 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.190
 which is no longer that support tiger 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.430
 and that's it postage here and support although in 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 my opinion is stronger than 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.340
 which is approved by Inmetro 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.070
 although it will also explain that this one 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.070
 had to have left with the homologation of the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.480
 inmetro because this is a law of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.199
 2002 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.750
 Leave and if you had to leave. 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.850
 Inmetro call it does not come out as 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.660
 no goal reaction has none 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.560
 type of information that it is from the inmetro 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.000
 I was forced to change the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.549
 CNG's support and the plug case're 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.100
 so I'll explain better and leave 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.290
 now for you what happens you will 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 do the survey if you have this 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.540
 type of media will have to change not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.060
 there's going to be a way and we understand that 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.780
 It's so complicated in my case. 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.090
 requirement that problems that have not 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.150
 they were just the support but let's talk 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.780
 exactly two points and back to the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:46.220
 where the school is when it's tight 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.430
 what is this piece here if it is 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.520
 torn 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.899
 if that piece is torn you 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.420
 does not pass the inspection and support of the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.189
 cylinder where I already showed you 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.899
 that the cylinder holder has to be 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.650
 substituted 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.110
 so in this case here 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.870
 in the replacement bracket we will give a 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.910
 look at which is the support and seal 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.760
 of the inmetro they are demanding now 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.530
 Another point is that the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.150
 sticker on the cylinder of CNG 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.460
 What happens is if you do not 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.290
 December is also going to fall 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.560
 requirement, we understand that this 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.110
 sticker over time it goes and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.500
 released only by highlighting his son 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.860
 installation of gas in 2011 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.230
 We are four years old almost there. 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.250
 use and was at the end finally four 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.920
 years of use 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.290
 last year I did the gas survey and 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.570
 normally without any kind of 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.030
 requirement I no longer had this role 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.390
 this paper is including it is the original 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.230
 who was delivered to me hands on the day of 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.170
 installation 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.770
 this is the document that approves that all 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.209
 the parts were placed in the installation 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.910
 by a quality certificate of the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.780
 installer they are with the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.080
 inmetro 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.690
 Although I already spoke, I do not have 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.269
 sense of inmetro and none 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.260
 My previous support record 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.840
 ok then from 2002 that law all the parts 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.959
 that enter the gnv installation should 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.010
 be with the center of the event and you 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.660
 has the inmetro seal here is on the stand 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.750
 I also liked to show you something that 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.350
 when I did the installation 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.630
 support I will put one little detail 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.310
 for you here the support came out ar $ 22 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.500
 today the cheapest support I've found 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.570
 in the middle of a place where I made the 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:56.830
 installation but they charged me 250 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:59.080
 the normal value is 350 and they said that 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.350
 We are doing you a favor in selling me. 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.140
 for $ 250 a piece that four years ago 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.270
 behind me venerated 22 reais 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.830
 even if you have had all the interest 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.820
 all inflation from 22 to 250 is a 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.489
 absurd 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.850
 it's absurd I would also like to leave 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:24.040
 registered that the line is installer 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.919
 she sold one piece for 22 reais 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.740
 the eleventh four years ago of the best 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.080
 today she comes to me a piece herself piece by 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.280
 teague obligation is already making a 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.730
 update 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.040
 in this system that only one supports it 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:44.710
 You're charging me 150 reais 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:48.880
 and if you could buy this support 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:52.780
 in the move you would be paying as 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.500
 consumer not how to install owner 110 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.810
 real 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.169
 so if you are nationals buy the 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.260
 your support you would buy at 110 reais 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.210
 The problem is that you can not be 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.610
 more support in the car and simply 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.310
 then there and meet the requirement 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.340
 you have to install next to the 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.970
 expense installer because they will 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.850
 give this document here which is the same 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.400
 document that gm presented accounts 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.200
 They made me the gas installation that is the 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.810
 which is attested to by 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:31.780
 registered installer is the same 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:34.360
 document being that now with the 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.229
 support that is the new support it is 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.560
 one yellow 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.850
 the aspects that have been passed on to me by 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.120
 money 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:47.110
 where is this where I did the survey of the 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:51.760
 gas is the next you have to be 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:55.540
 go to the distance between the strap and the head 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.000
 of the cylinder of both ends the same 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.540
 distance on one side has to be 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.120
 on the other the strap it has to be a 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.420
 thicker person is no longer accepted 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.510
 fine detail also follows as I already 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.690
 I also spoke the seal of inmetro where in 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.840
 a strap at any time although it has 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.990
 has been certified by the installer 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:24.760
 was a belt that should by law of 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:27.100
 2002 says to have come with her does not have a 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.480
 Good detail, I 'm making this video. 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.760
 a single issue 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.310
 A lot of people are in doubt I sent them 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.370
 half inboard, the inmetro answered me 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.040
 which addresses this need to make 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.800
 my private opinion plus one way 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.870
 to generate money within this 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.720
 industry that is already more than 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.910
 overwhelmed with money 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.310
 a lot that happens in this country is the 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.950
 question of the extinguisher you have today 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.170
 to change the question now 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.720
 question of support you have to change 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.510
 and so on goes absurd upon 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.940
 absurd my private opinion with 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.830
 the previous support it too 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.740
 better than the current one 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.610
 the current probe I do not trust and 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.940
 previous 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.660
 I trust although it does not have the seal of the 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.260
 inmetro 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:20.110
 That's good, that's the message. 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.390
 shares the hotel lic a lot of people 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.610
 is in doubt about that I 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.440
 I may have had I could have helped some 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.550
 doubts about other people 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:32.920
 feel gnv friend who is there to inspect 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.350
 to check everything right there 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.780
 right seeks to inform with 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.910
 information here each risked go 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.870
 suddenly there share more 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.850
 information 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.420
 A hug, everyone, stay with God until the 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.420
 next
