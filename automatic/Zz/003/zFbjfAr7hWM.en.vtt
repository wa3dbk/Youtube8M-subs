00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.160 
the rebound over the bar what a chance
there<00:02:35.770> for<00:02:35.920> Monaco<00:02:36.370> Luisa<00:02:37.000> Campo<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:37.990> fact

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
there for Monaco Luisa Campo and in fact

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.430 
there for Monaco Luisa Campo and in fact
it<00:02:38.290> deflects<00:02:38.620> off<00:02:38.890> montgomery<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:40.440> that

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
it deflects off montgomery and that

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.010 
it deflects off montgomery and that
probably<00:02:41.740> made<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.070> difference<00:02:42.750> between<00:02:43.750> a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
probably made a difference between a

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:51.240 
probably made a difference between a
goal<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.730> crossbar<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:49.270> full<00:02:49.840> time<00:02:50.220> one<00:02:51.220> a

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
goal and the crossbar so full time one a

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.490 
goal and the crossbar so full time one a
piece
