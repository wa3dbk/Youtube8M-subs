sponge-like<00:00:14.219> shown<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.299> since<00:00:16.260> this

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
sponge-like shown here and since this

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.529 
sponge-like shown here and since this
latex<00:00:16.740> free<00:00:17.279> sponge<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> little<00:00:18.270> bit<00:00:18.390> more

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
latex free sponge is a little bit more

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150 
latex free sponge is a little bit more
dense<00:00:18.810> than<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> ones<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.650> normally<00:00:19.740> get

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
dense than the ones that I normally get

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.759 
dense than the ones that I normally get
from<00:00:20.220> target<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.029> do<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.080> these<00:00:22.230> just

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
from target I do like to what these just

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.300 
from target I do like to what these just
so<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.750> more<00:00:25.650> blended<00:00:26.189> out

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
so that I can get a more blended out

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.970 
so that I can get a more blended out
gradient<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.480> you're<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.260> first<00:00:28.590> stamp

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
gradient so you're going to first stamp

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.830 
gradient so you're going to first stamp
that<00:00:29.310> onto<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:29.939> nail<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:30.599> you're

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
that onto your nail and then you're

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.690 
that onto your nail and then you're
going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.199> use<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> dabbing<00:00:31.800> motion<00:00:32.189> side<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
going to use a dabbing motion side to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.420 
going to use a dabbing motion side to
side<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.210> up<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> down<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.380> help<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> colors

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
side and up and down to help the colors

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.490 
side and up and down to help the colors
blend<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.270> make<00:00:36.450> smooth<00:00:36.809> transitions

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
blend out and make smooth transitions

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.369 
blend out and make smooth transitions
then<00:00:38.489> repeat<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.570> until<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:40.170> full

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
then repeat that until you get full

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.979 
then repeat that until you get full
opacity<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.550> like<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> apply<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.540> top<00:00:42.750> coat

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
opacity and I like to apply my top coat

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.479 
opacity and I like to apply my top coat
right<00:00:43.140> away<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.860> feel<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.190> this

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
right away because I feel like this

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
right away because I feel like this
helps<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> colors<00:00:45.270> blend<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.140> bit

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
helps the colors blend out a little bit

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410 
helps the colors blend out a little bit
more<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.610> want<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> clean<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.210> around

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
stem and then I go over it to just make

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.490 
stem and then I go over it to just make
it<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.549> more<00:01:05.790> defined<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.140> thicker

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it a little bit more defined and thicker

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.620 
it a little bit more defined and thicker
but<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.520> skinny<00:01:08.939> palm<00:01:09.150> trees<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
but these are skinny palm trees so you

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.899 
but these are skinny palm trees so you
don't<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> make<00:01:10.049> them<00:01:10.229> too<00:01:10.560> thick<00:01:10.909> once

nail to nail to create you know a little

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.179 
nail to nail to create you know a little
bit<00:01:17.490> more<00:01:17.610> intricacy<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> want<00:01:20.100> to

draw your leaves and you can go about
this<00:01:22.380> two<00:01:23.189> different<00:01:23.520> ways<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.840> either

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
this two different ways you can either

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.899 
this two different ways you can either
start<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.860> center<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.460> flick<00:01:26.880> your

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
start from the center and flick your

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.340 
start from the center and flick your
brush<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.720> words<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.470> create<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.610> um<00:01:30.350> palm

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
brush at words to create that um palm

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.420 
brush at words to create that um palm
tree<00:01:31.740> leaf

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
tree leaf

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.340 
tree leaf
and<00:01:33.610> this<00:01:34.300> is<00:01:34.450> kind<00:01:34.630> of<00:01:34.750> like<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.960> weird<00:01:35.230> angle

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
and this is kind of like a weird angle

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.710 
and this is kind of like a weird angle
for<00:01:35.800> me<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.250> apologize<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.150> then<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.690> other

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
for me so I apologize and then the other

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.450 
for me so I apologize and then the other
way<00:01:38.050> that<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.290> can<00:01:38.440> do<00:01:38.620> it<00:01:38.740> is<00:01:38.920> from<00:01:39.310> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
way that you can do it is from the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.390 
way that you can do it is from the
outside<00:01:39.880> inwards<00:01:40.210> toward<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.930> center<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.560> I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
outside inwards toward the center and I

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.910 
outside inwards toward the center and I
like<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.090> switch<00:01:43.300> up<00:01:43.330> these<00:01:43.690> two<00:01:44.020> ways<00:01:44.260> because

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
like to switch up these two ways because

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920 
like to switch up these two ways because
some<00:01:45.430> sometimes<00:01:46.120> it's<00:01:46.300> more<00:01:46.330> comfortable<00:01:46.810> for

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
some sometimes it's more comfortable for
