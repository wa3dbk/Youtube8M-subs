is perfect for anyone who's like me and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.019 
is perfect for anyone who's like me and
who<00:00:25.199> was<00:00:25.350> absolutely<00:00:25.769> rubbish<00:00:26.250> at<00:00:26.640> looking

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
who was absolutely rubbish at looking

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.460 
who was absolutely rubbish at looking
after<00:00:27.300> indoor<00:00:27.660> houseplants

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
after indoor houseplants

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.600 
after indoor houseplants
I<00:00:28.730> find<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.269> looking<00:00:31.230> after<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.250> garden

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
I find that looking after the garden

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
I find that looking after the garden
plants<00:00:32.969> are<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.149> lot<00:00:33.329> easier<00:00:33.719> because<00:00:34.020> I'm<00:00:34.140> in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
plants are a lot easier because I'm in

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260 
plants are a lot easier because I'm in
and<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.160> garden<00:00:35.550> quite<00:00:35.790> often

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and out of the garden quite often

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
and out of the garden quite often
whereas<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.290> houseplants<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.980> find<00:00:38.309> that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
whereas with houseplants I find that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.069 
whereas with houseplants I find that
they<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.790> become<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.420> another<00:00:39.690> part<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
they just become like another part of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.810 
they just become like another part of
the<00:00:40.200> furniture<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.399> completely

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the furniture and I just completely

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.170 
the furniture and I just completely
forget<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.420> they're<00:00:42.600> there<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.110> I

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
forget that they're there so I

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.880 
forget that they're there so I
absolutely<00:00:45.180> love<00:00:45.629> plants<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.320> hardly<00:00:46.710> need

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
absolutely love plants that hardly need

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.729 
absolutely love plants that hardly need
any<00:00:47.100> sunlight<00:00:47.760> hardly<00:00:48.539> need<00:00:48.690> any<00:00:48.870> water<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
any sunlight hardly need any water and

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.380 
any sunlight hardly need any water and
definitely<00:00:50.219> don't<00:00:50.399> need<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> any<00:00:50.850> maintenance

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.130 
definitely don't need to any maintenance
whatsoever<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.640> my<00:00:54.000> top<00:00:54.329> three<00:00:54.809> of

whatsoever so this is my top three of
those<00:00:55.640> houseplants<00:00:56.640> I've<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.120> had<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
those houseplants I've actually had and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.299 
those houseplants I've actually had and
I've<00:00:59.100> still<00:00:59.460> got<00:00:59.730> they're<00:01:00.210> still<00:01:00.750> alive<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.440> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
I've still got they're still alive and I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.030 
I've still got they're still alive and I
absolutely<00:01:03.149> love<00:01:03.809> them<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.589> need

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
absolutely love them because they need

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.610 
absolutely love them because they need
hardly<00:01:05.369> any<00:01:05.549> work

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.100 

so<00:01:09.620> at<00:01:09.890> number<00:01:10.220> three<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.630> money<00:01:11.840> plant

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
so at number three is the money plant

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.460 
so at number three is the money plant
now<00:01:12.620> this<00:01:12.920> one<00:01:13.220> goes<00:01:13.640> in<00:01:13.970> my<00:01:14.270> windowsill<00:01:14.660> on

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
now this one goes in my windowsill on

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.380 
now this one goes in my windowsill on
the<00:01:15.710> top<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.070> stairs<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:16.940> literally

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
the top of the stairs so I literally

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.330 
the top of the stairs so I literally
walk<00:01:17.690> past<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.170> every<00:01:18.560> single<00:01:18.740> day<00:01:18.980> I<00:01:19.160> walk

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
walk past it every single day I walk

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.280 
walk past it every single day I walk
past<00:01:19.400> it<00:01:19.820> maybe<00:01:20.000> five<00:01:20.390> times<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.960> day

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
past it maybe five times a day

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.670 
past it maybe five times a day
and<00:01:21.640> it's<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:22.880> become<00:01:23.300> just<00:01:23.780> an<00:01:23.990> ornament<00:01:24.500> on

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
and it's just become just an ornament on

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.730 
and it's just become just an ornament on
the<00:01:25.250> window<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.060> be<00:01:26.180> honest<00:01:26.450> as<00:01:27.350> you<00:01:27.560> can

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
the window so to be honest as you can

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.040 
the window so to be honest as you can
see<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.310> did<00:01:28.640> need<00:01:28.910> a<00:01:29.120> little<00:01:29.360> bit<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.570> watering

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
see it did need a little bit of watering

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.660 
see it did need a little bit of watering
it<00:01:30.170> has<00:01:30.350> gone<00:01:30.620> a<00:01:30.650> little<00:01:30.890> bit<00:01:30.979> dry<00:01:31.160> you'll<00:01:31.340> find

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
it has gone a little bit dry you'll find

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.120 
it has gone a little bit dry you'll find
that<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.120> leaves<00:01:32.390> go<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.960> little<00:01:33.440> bit<00:01:33.530> dry<00:01:33.830> and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
that the leaves go a little bit dry and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.530 
that the leaves go a little bit dry and
a<00:01:34.220> bit<00:01:34.250> brittle<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.970> they'll<00:01:35.180> go<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.360> little

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
a bit brittle and they'll go a little

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.110 
a bit brittle and they'll go a little
bit<00:01:35.720> discolored<00:01:36.110> when<00:01:36.860> they<00:01:37.100> need<00:01:37.370> when<00:01:37.970> the

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
bit discolored when they need when the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.900 
bit discolored when they need when the
plant<00:01:38.390> needs<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.050> water<00:01:39.320> I've<00:01:40.070> let<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:40.759> just

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
plant needs and water I've let you just

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.520 
plant needs and water I've let you just
watered<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.660> probably<00:01:41.900> won't<00:01:42.140> need<00:01:42.380> to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
watered it and I probably won't need to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.950 
watered it and I probably won't need to
water<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:42.979> one<00:01:43.220> again<00:01:43.790> for<00:01:44.090> probably

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
water this one again for probably

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.469 
water this one again for probably
another<00:01:45.290> few<00:01:45.560> weeks<00:01:45.800> so<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:46.640> really<00:01:46.910> easy<00:01:47.000> it

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
another few weeks so it's really easy it

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.230 
another few weeks so it's really easy it
doesn't<00:01:47.780> need<00:01:48.290> much<00:01:49.160> sunlight<00:01:49.460> either<00:01:49.850> I<00:01:49.970> mean

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
doesn't need much sunlight either I mean

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.450 
doesn't need much sunlight either I mean
I<00:01:50.300> put<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:50.660> one<00:01:50.840> on<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.170> windowsill<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.040> to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
I put this one on the windowsill but to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.010 
I put this one on the windowsill but to
be<00:01:52.550> honest<00:01:52.759> I<00:01:52.820> know<00:01:52.910> it<00:01:53.390> can<00:01:53.660> survive

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
be honest I know it can survive

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.749 
be honest I know it can survive
elsewhere<00:01:54.710> because<00:01:54.890> I've<00:01:55.160> had<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:55.580> one

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
elsewhere because I've had this one

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.969 
elsewhere because I've had this one
elsewhere<00:01:56.330> I've<00:01:56.720> had<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.200> one<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.710> dark

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
elsewhere I've had this one in a dark

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.499 
elsewhere I've had this one in a dark
corner<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.610> it's<00:01:58.729> been<00:01:58.910> absolutely<00:01:59.330> fine

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
corner and it's been absolutely fine

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.180 
corner and it's been absolutely fine
I've<00:01:59.780> had<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.080> one<00:02:00.229> in<00:02:00.380> direct<00:02:00.770> sunlight<00:02:00.979> and

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
I've had this one in direct sunlight and

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.999 
I've had this one in direct sunlight and
it's<00:02:01.460> been<00:02:01.580> absolutely<00:02:01.940> fine<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.619> one<00:02:03.830> is

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
it's been absolutely fine so this one is

start<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.590> droop<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.099> when<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.510> little

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
start to droop and when it's a little

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.289 
start to droop and when it's a little
bit<00:04:05.780> dry<00:04:06.049> in<00:04:06.470> there<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.069> since<00:04:07.849> I've<00:04:08.000> had<00:04:08.120> this

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
bit dry in there and since I've had this

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.759 
bit dry in there and since I've had this
one<00:04:08.480> I<00:04:08.510> haven't<00:04:08.840> needed<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.140> water<00:04:09.319> it<00:04:09.530> yet<00:04:09.650> and

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
one I haven't needed to water it yet and

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.319 
one I haven't needed to water it yet and
I've<00:04:09.859> had<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.010> for<00:04:10.160> about<00:04:10.400> two<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.849> three<00:04:11.090> weeks

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
I've had it for about two to three weeks

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.619 
I've had it for about two to three weeks
so<00:04:12.200> this<00:04:12.739> probably<00:04:13.099> this<00:04:13.579> one<00:04:13.849> only<00:04:14.030> again

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
so this probably this one only again

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.319 
so this probably this one only again
needs<00:04:14.989> watering<00:04:15.349> about<00:04:15.590> once<00:04:15.799> a<00:04:15.950> month<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.400> it

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
needs watering about once a month and it

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.199 
needs watering about once a month and it
does<00:04:17.840> recommend<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.650> you<00:04:18.799> do<00:04:19.039> spritz<00:04:19.669> it<00:04:19.880> but

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
does recommend that you do spritz it but

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.360 
does recommend that you do spritz it but
