00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
boxes so I don't know if I'm gonna do

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.560 
boxes so I don't know if I'm gonna do
unboxing<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.259> this<00:04:25.470> or<00:04:25.650> not<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.310> una<00:04:27.180> and

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
unboxing of this or not just a una and

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.640 
unboxing of this or not just a una and
an<00:04:27.930> aesthetical<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.740> rogue<00:04:28.979> hero<00:04:30.470> there<00:04:31.470> we

go

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.820 
go
but<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.509> reason<00:04:33.810> why<00:04:33.900> this<00:04:33.960> means<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.500> lot<00:04:34.650> to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
but the reason why this means a lot to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.909 
but the reason why this means a lot to
me<00:04:34.979> because<00:04:35.160> they<00:04:35.990> sold<00:04:36.990> out<00:04:37.139> on<00:04:37.410> write<00:04:37.680> stuff

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
me because they sold out on write stuff

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.890 
me because they sold out on write stuff
and<00:04:38.130> they<00:04:38.220> end<00:04:38.430> up<00:04:38.520> getting<00:04:38.699> it<00:04:38.970> but<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.479> paid

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
and they end up getting it but I paid

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.800 
and they end up getting it but I paid
the<00:04:40.800> regular<00:04:41.699> price<00:04:41.940> not<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.300> sale<00:04:42.539> price

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
the regular price not the sale price

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.900 
the regular price not the sale price
which<00:04:43.080> sucks<00:04:43.590> but<00:04:43.949> at<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.250> same<00:04:44.400> time<00:04:44.639> I
