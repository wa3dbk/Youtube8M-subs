00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.359 

in<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.779> previous<00:00:27.960> video<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.769> discussed<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
in the previous video we discussed the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.460 
in the previous video we discussed the
four<00:00:29.640> mark<00:00:29.970> point<00:00:30.269> modes<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.839> specific

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
four mark point modes and specific

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.439 
four mark point modes and specific
conditions<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.640> mode<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:32.940> those

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
conditions to have the mode for those

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.600 
conditions to have the mode for those
sensors<00:00:33.960> automatically<00:00:34.680> set<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.340> mark

page<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> d<00:00:36.720> ed<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.920> if<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.129> remember<00:00:38.519> in

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
page of the d ed now if you remember in

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.130 
page of the d ed now if you remember in
the<00:00:38.850> HUD<00:00:39.059> demonstration<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.840> when

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the HUD demonstration that when

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.799 
the HUD demonstration that when
conditions<00:00:40.500> weren't<00:00:41.010> met<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.059> fcr<00:00:42.600> or

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
conditions weren't met for the fcr or

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.170 
conditions weren't met for the fcr or
the<00:00:42.960> tgp<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.040> mode<00:00:44.309> would<00:00:44.519> be<00:00:44.640> automatically

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the tgp the mode would be automatically

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.170 
the tgp the mode would be automatically
set<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> HUD<00:00:46.190> now<00:00:47.190> does<00:00:47.400> that<00:00:47.430> mean<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:47.820> if

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
set to HUD now does that mean that if

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.360 
set to HUD now does that mean that if
the<00:00:48.360> sensor<00:00:48.690> we're<00:00:48.989> using<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.409> fcr<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.070> can't

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the sensor we're using as fcr we can't

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.130 
the sensor we're using as fcr we can't
use<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.000> those<00:00:51.210> conditions<00:00:51.390> aren't<00:00:51.870> met

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
use it if those conditions aren't met

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.950 
use it if those conditions aren't met
the<00:00:52.739> answer<00:00:53.040> is<00:00:53.159> no<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:54.030> mode<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.600> needs<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the answer is no the mode just needs to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.069 
the answer is no the mode just needs to
be<00:00:55.079> changed<00:00:55.409> to<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.979> sensor<00:00:56.399> we're<00:00:56.610> using<00:00:57.079> now

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
be changed to the sensor we're using now

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.380 
be changed to the sensor we're using now
for<00:00:58.470> this<00:00:59.189> demonstration<00:00:59.400> we<00:00:59.879> are<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.299> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
for this demonstration we are going to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.380 
for this demonstration we are going to
be<00:01:00.449> using<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:00.900> fcr<00:01:01.350> again<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.890> an<00:01:02.070> example<00:01:02.430> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
be using the fcr again as an example so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.740 
be using the fcr again as an example so
as<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> refresher<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.409> fcr<00:01:04.890> conditions<00:01:05.339> are

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
as a refresher the fcr conditions are

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.350 
as a refresher the fcr conditions are
nav<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:07.140> air-to-ground<00:01:07.560> master<00:01:08.460> mode<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:09.150> are

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
nav or air-to-ground master mode we are

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.020 
nav or air-to-ground master mode we are
in<00:01:09.509> ccrp<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:12.170> FCR<00:01:13.310> GM<00:01:14.310> mode<00:01:14.580> we

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
in ccrp as you can see FCR GM mode we

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.399 
in ccrp as you can see FCR GM mode we
are<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.570> GM<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.350> GMT<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.990> fcr

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
are not in GM we are in GMT the fcr

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.960 
are not in GM we are in GMT the fcr
needs<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> sensor<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.369> interest<00:01:20.759> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
needs to be the sensor of interest and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.749 
needs to be the sensor of interest and
we<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> white<00:01:22.530> border<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
we have that with a white border and a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.060 
we have that with a white border and a
target<00:01:24.150> needed<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.630> locked<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.829> have

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
target needed to be locked and we have

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.450 
target needed to be locked and we have
no<00:01:26.220> targets<00:01:26.640> locked<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> from<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.009> point<00:01:29.100> we

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
no targets locked so from this point we

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
no targets locked so from this point we
push<00:01:29.729> mark<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.469> as<00:01:31.469> expected<00:01:33.020> HUD<00:01:34.020> mode<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
push mark and as expected HUD mode is

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.700 
push mark and as expected HUD mode is
set<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.039> our<00:01:35.249> mark<00:01:35.549> page<00:01:36.079> now<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.530> need<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
set on our mark page now all we need to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.660 
set on our mark page now all we need to
do<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.189> by<00:01:38.490> pushing<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.119> button<00:01:39.149> one<00:01:39.810> either

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
do is by pushing a button one either

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.149 
do is by pushing a button one either
pushing<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.850> buttons<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.389> through<00:01:42.600> nine<00:01:42.630> or

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
pushing the buttons one through nine or

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.809 
pushing the buttons one through nine or
sequins<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.399> dcs<00:01:44.999> which<00:01:46.310> we<00:01:47.310> change<00:01:47.609> it<00:01:47.789> to

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
sequins on the dcs which we change it to

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.559 
sequins on the dcs which we change it to
the<00:01:48.450> sensor<00:01:48.749> we're<00:01:48.899> using<00:01:49.109> FC<00:01:49.859> are<00:01:50.329> now<00:01:51.329> going

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
the sensor we're using FC are now going

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.889 
the sensor we're using FC are now going
to<00:01:51.659> RFC<00:01:52.049> are<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:53.039> simply<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.780> move<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to RFC are we simply just move the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
to RFC are we simply just move the
cursor<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.469> point<00:01:55.770> where<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.069> want<00:01:56.310> our

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
cursor to the point where we want our

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.699 
cursor to the point where we want our
mark<00:01:56.880> point<00:01:57.209> to<00:01:57.569> be<00:01:57.689> set<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:59.659> and<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:01.469> pushed

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
mark point to be set up and we pushed

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.690 
mark point to be set up and we pushed
EMS<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.780> there's<00:02:03.780> our<00:02:03.990> mark<00:02:04.229> point<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:05.280> let's

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
EMS up there's our mark point now let's

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.029 
EMS up there's our mark point now let's
move<00:02:05.999> our<00:02:06.240> radar<00:02:06.929> cursor<00:02:07.319> out<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
move our radar cursor out of the way and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.100 
move our radar cursor out of the way and
right<00:02:08.789> there<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.420> our<00:02:09.869> mark<00:02:10.200> point<00:02:11.270> so<00:02:12.270> again

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
right there is our mark point so again

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.940 
right there is our mark point so again
the<00:02:13.590> previous<00:02:13.980> video<00:02:14.340> only<00:02:14.880> showed<00:02:15.950> methods

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the previous video only showed methods

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.809 
the previous video only showed methods
to<00:02:17.190> get<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.670> where<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.510> mode<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.410> DC

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
to get it to where the mode on the DC

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.300 
to get it to where the mode on the DC
yeah<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.970> d<00:02:21.120> ed<00:02:21.450> page<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:22.050> automatically<00:02:22.920> set

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
yeah the d ed page is automatically set

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.520 
yeah the d ed page is automatically set
but<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.940> doesn't<00:02:24.180> mean<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.260> can't

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
but that doesn't mean that you can't

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.309 
but that doesn't mean that you can't
change<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:27.120> adjust<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.569> use<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
change it to adjust to use for the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.370 
change it to adjust to use for the
sensor<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.800> you're<00:02:29.010> using
