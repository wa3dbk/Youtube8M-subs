Scituate or chicken with redneck one
called<00:00:22.109> type<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.130> fish<00:00:25.670> they<00:00:26.670> get<00:00:26.910> really<00:00:27.539> busy

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
called type of fish they get really busy

called type of fish they get really busy
get<00:00:28.260> ate<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.519> nine<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.599> ten<00:00:30.779> inches<00:00:31.199> in

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
get ate like like nine to ten inches in

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.450 
get ate like like nine to ten inches in
length<00:00:35.239> their<00:00:36.239> fins<00:00:36.540> are<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.380> wavy<00:00:37.649> like

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
length their fins are really wavy like

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.810 
length their fins are really wavy like
here<00:00:38.700> they're<00:00:38.910> um<00:00:40.280> smaller<00:00:41.280> things<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
here they're um smaller things on the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.030 
here they're um smaller things on the
bottom<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.450> two<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.040> they

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
bottom you see these two right here they

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.229 
bottom you see these two right here they
fill<00:00:44.280> around<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.760> throat<00:00:44.850> they're

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
fill around your throat they're

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.760 
fill around your throat they're
sensitive<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.110> fish<00:00:46.260> touch<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.680> they

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
sensitive so if fish touch them they

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.040 
sensitive so if fish touch them they
freak<00:00:47.010> out<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.219> jump<00:00:47.780> there's<00:00:48.780> pretty<00:00:49.020> much

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
freak out and jump there's pretty much

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
freak out and jump there's pretty much
like<00:00:49.289> sensors<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.980> them<00:00:50.160> um

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
like sensors of them um

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.439 
like sensors of them um
the<00:00:52.739> water<00:00:53.010> temperature<00:00:53.550> should<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:54.090> in

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the water temperature should be in

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.240 
the water temperature should be in
between<00:00:56.180> 78<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:58.129> 83<00:00:59.129> degrees<00:00:59.820> I'd<00:01:00.090> say<00:01:00.620> um<00:01:01.620> pH

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
between 78 and 83 degrees I'd say um pH

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.549 
between 78 and 83 degrees I'd say um pH
so<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:02.879> stay<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.320> six

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
so they can actually stay in the six

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.270 
so they can actually stay in the six
point<00:01:04.769> five<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.689> seven<00:01:06.689> point<00:01:06.900> eight<00:01:07.140> pH<00:01:07.830> range

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
point five to seven point eight pH range

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.130 
point five to seven point eight pH range
so<00:01:10.280> that's<00:01:11.280> pretty<00:01:11.520> good<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.630> pH<00:01:12.900> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so that's pretty good but my pH this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.100 
so that's pretty good but my pH this
aquarium<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.770> seven<00:01:14.100> point<00:01:14.310> four

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
aquarium is seven point four

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.609 
aquarium is seven point four
I've<00:01:16.110> Guppies<00:01:16.530> neon<00:01:16.890> tetras<00:01:17.310> angelfish

Guppies<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.610> Untied<00:01:35.939> shown<00:01:36.119> here<00:01:36.450> but

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
Guppies in the Untied shown here but

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
Guppies in the Untied shown here but
when<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.650> bigger<00:01:37.920> their<00:01:38.220> mouths<00:01:38.369> like

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
when they get bigger their mouths like

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.310 
when they get bigger their mouths like
right<00:01:38.909> handle<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.299> something<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.840> small

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
right handle on something really small

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
right handle on something really small
when<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.579> bigger<00:01:41.850> they<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.270> actually

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
when they get bigger they can actually

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.700 
when they get bigger they can actually
eat<00:01:42.920> baby<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:44.189> these<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.490> these<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.710> they

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
eat baby got these like these and they

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
eat baby got these like these and they
can<00:01:46.890> sometimes<00:01:47.159> eat<00:01:47.520> neon<00:01:47.790> tetras<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.420> not

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
can sometimes eat neon tetras it's not

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.649 
can sometimes eat neon tetras it's not
fast<00:01:48.840> enough<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.340> think<00:01:50.939> neon<00:01:51.210> tetras<00:01:51.540> are

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
fast enough but I think neon tetras are

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.090 
fast enough but I think neon tetras are
fast<00:01:51.899> enough<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.350> move<00:01:52.470> away<00:01:52.649> from<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
fast enough to move away from the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.200 
fast enough to move away from the
angelfish<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.229> that's<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.350> me<00:01:55.619> um<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:57.030> don't

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
angelfish so that's just me um you don't

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
angelfish so that's just me um you don't
want<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> keep<00:01:57.570> them<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.869> any<00:01:58.140> small<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.920> iam

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
want to keep them in any small for iam

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.330 
want to keep them in any small for iam
or<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.850> ten<00:02:00.329> gallon<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.990> five<00:02:01.740> gal<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
or like a ten gallon or five gal and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.859 
or like a ten gallon or five gal and
I've<00:02:02.430> seen<00:02:02.640> people<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.210> them<00:02:03.450> into<00:02:03.659> ten

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
I've seen people have them into ten

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.160 
I've seen people have them into ten
gallon<00:02:04.280> but<00:02:05.280> their<00:02:05.759> organs<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.540> stuff<00:02:07.020> inside

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
gallon but their organs and stuff inside

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.169 
gallon but their organs and stuff inside
of<00:02:07.500> them<00:02:07.619> grow<00:02:07.860> too<00:02:08.099> fast<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.580> their<00:02:08.700> body<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of them grow too fast for their body and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.220 
of them grow too fast for their body and
they<00:02:09.270> kill

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
they kill

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.390 
they kill
they<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.410> with<00:02:11.590> five<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.490> 15<00:02:13.000> years<00:02:13.480> I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
they can with five to 15 years I

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.240 
they can with five to 15 years I
rephrase<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.430> two<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.970> fifteen<00:02:16.360> years<00:02:17.010> um<00:02:18.010> I

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
rephrase that two to fifteen years um I

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.880 
rephrase that two to fifteen years um I
had<00:02:18.400> three<00:02:18.700> angelfish<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.450> one<00:02:19.890> but
