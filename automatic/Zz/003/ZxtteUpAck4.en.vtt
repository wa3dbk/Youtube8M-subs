00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
of the series so when I get to that part

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.320 
of the series so when I get to that part

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the show then you can click away I think

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.740 
the show then you can click away I think
this<00:00:11.460> show<00:00:11.639> had<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> lot<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.059> fantastic<00:00:12.480> things

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
this show had a lot of fantastic things

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.070 
this show had a lot of fantastic things
going<00:00:13.349> for<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.620> which<00:00:14.070> made<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.969> very<00:00:15.420> fun

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
going for it which made it a very fun

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.769 
going for it which made it a very fun
viewing<00:00:16.890> experience<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> same<00:00:18.510> time<00:00:18.720> I

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
viewing experience at the same time I

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.359 
viewing experience at the same time I
also<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.350> there<00:00:19.529> were<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> lot<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> really

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
also think there were a lot of really

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.300 
also think there were a lot of really
fixable<00:00:21.000> issues<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.980> kind<00:00:23.279> of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
fixable issues in it that kind of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.300 
fixable issues in it that kind of
dragged<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.910> down<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.630> times<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.320> think<00:00:25.650> that

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
dragged it down at times I think that

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.339 
dragged it down at times I think that
they<00:00:26.550> tried<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.880> take<00:00:27.119> on<00:00:27.330> almost<00:00:27.750> too<00:00:28.109> much

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
they tried to take on almost too much

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.299 
they tried to take on almost too much
story<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.670> there<00:00:30.060> were<00:00:30.210> times<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:31.380> large

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
story so there were times when large

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.370 
story so there were times when large
chunks<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> episodes<00:00:33.360> would<00:00:33.570> go<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
chunks of episodes would go by and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260 
chunks of episodes would go by and
characters<00:00:35.100> would<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.520> be<00:00:35.640> noticeably

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
characters would just be noticeably

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.630 
characters would just be noticeably
missing<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.110> certain<00:00:37.500> events<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.520> only

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
missing and certain events kind of only

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.569 
missing and certain events kind of only
occurred<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.930> orchestrate<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.770> situation<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
occurred to orchestrate a situation that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.510 
occurred to orchestrate a situation that
didn't<00:00:42.120> feel<00:00:42.390> organic<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.829> being<00:00:44.040> said<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.309> do

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
didn't feel organic that being said I do

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.910 
didn't feel organic that being said I do
think<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> story<00:00:45.750> itself<00:00:46.200> was<00:00:46.469> unique

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
think that the story itself was unique

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.549 
think that the story itself was unique
and<00:00:47.100> interesting<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.110> there<00:00:49.110> were<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
and interesting and there were a lot of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.240 
and interesting and there were a lot of
memorable<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.960> likable<00:00:51.960> characters<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
memorable and likable characters the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310 
memorable and likable characters the
method<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.640> storytelling<00:00:54.300> itself<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.870> fresh

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
method of storytelling itself was fresh

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.410 
method of storytelling itself was fresh
and<00:00:55.680> good<00:00:56.190> enough<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> almost<00:00:57.149> could

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and good enough so that it almost could

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
and good enough so that it almost could
have<00:00:57.510> sustained<00:00:57.930> itself<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.649> did<00:00:59.129> struggle

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
have sustained itself I did struggle

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.549 
have sustained itself I did struggle
with<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> universe<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.629> bit<00:01:00.989> because<00:01:01.260> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
with the universe a bit because it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.520 
with the universe a bit because it
seemed<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> lot<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> effort<00:01:02.640> was<00:01:02.789> put<00:01:02.940> into

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
seemed like a lot of effort was put into

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.070 
seemed like a lot of effort was put into
making<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.700> real<00:01:06.000> life<00:01:06.330> EK<00:01:06.780> bakudo

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
making it like the real life EK bakudo

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.289 
making it like the real life EK bakudo
but<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.890> much<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.299> magical

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but then there was so much like magical

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450 
but then there was so much like magical
and<00:01:09.510> supernatural<00:01:10.320> stuff<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.979> throw<00:01:11.400> it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and supernatural stuff just throw it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460 
and supernatural stuff just throw it
into<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.210> was<00:01:12.240> normal<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.080> think<00:01:13.409> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
into it like it was normal I think that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.050 
into it like it was normal I think that
the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.890> half<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> series<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> lot

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the first half of the series was a lot

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.370 
the first half of the series was a lot
better<00:01:15.330> than<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> second<00:01:16.020> half<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
better than the second half of the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.640 
better than the second half of the
series<00:01:16.710> simply<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.330> focus<00:01:18.659> was<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
series simply because the focus was a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
series simply because the focus was a
lot<00:01:19.920> more<00:01:19.950> interesting<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.030> think<00:01:21.060> that's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
lot more interesting and I think that's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.410 
lot more interesting and I think that's
a<00:01:21.920> universally<00:01:22.920> held<00:01:23.220> opinion<00:01:23.880> among<00:01:24.150> fans

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a universally held opinion among fans

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.109 
a universally held opinion among fans
still<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:26.040> never<00:01:26.159> lose<00:01:26.460> anything<00:01:26.700> from

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
still you never lose anything from

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.260 
still you never lose anything from
washing<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> series<00:01:27.900> besides<00:01:28.350> time<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
washing a series besides time so I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.800 
washing a series besides time so I
recommend<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:31.079> if<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:31.759> into

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
recommend it if you're into

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.210 
recommend it if you're into
unconventional<00:01:33.810> type<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.229> stories<00:01:34.590> but

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
unconventional type of stories but

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.140 
unconventional type of stories but
that's<00:01:35.369> where<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> stop<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that's where I'm going to stop the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
that's where I'm going to stop the
review<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.659> move<00:01:36.840> into<00:01:37.229> analysis<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.100> you've

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
review and move into analysis so you've

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.460 
review and move into analysis so you've
not<00:01:38.549> seen<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> end<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> series<00:01:39.689> then

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
not seen to the end of the series then

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.649 
not seen to the end of the series then
stop<00:01:40.770> watching<00:01:41.250> right<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.880> spoke<00:01:42.329> vaguely

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
part but now I'm going to get into some

characters<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.940> would<00:03:36.359> have<00:03:36.480> hated<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.840> see

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
characters and I would have hated to see

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.319 
characters and I would have hated to see
them<00:03:37.230> go<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.680> think<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.220> finale<00:03:38.519> obviously<00:03:39.120> was

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
them go I think the finale obviously was

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.870 
them go I think the finale obviously was
supposed<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.959> center<00:03:40.320> around<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.890> three<00:03:41.370> main

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
supposed to center around the three main

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.660 
supposed to center around the three main
kids<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.810> everyone<00:03:43.170> else<00:03:43.560> contributed<00:03:44.489> in

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
kids and everyone else contributed in

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.880 
kids and everyone else contributed in
getting<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.150> kids<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:46.049> point<00:03:46.380> for<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
getting the kids to that point for the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.720 
getting the kids to that point for the
finale<00:03:47.220> but<00:03:48.000> honestly<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:49.440> three<00:03:49.829> kids<00:03:50.430> were

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
finale but honestly the three kids were

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.699 
finale but honestly the three kids were
kind<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.209> worst<00:03:51.390> part<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.930> show<00:03:52.140> the

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
kind of the worst part of the show the

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.110 
kind of the worst part of the show the
only<00:03:52.890> halfway<00:03:53.070> interesting<00:03:53.579> one<00:03:53.730> was<00:03:53.880> keyed

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
only halfway interesting one was keyed

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.640 
only halfway interesting one was keyed
up<00:03:54.150> but<00:03:54.329> not<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.780> much<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:54.989> he<00:03:55.260> was<00:03:55.290> able<00:03:55.530> to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
up but not so much that he was able to

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.180 
up but not so much that he was able to
carry<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.700> scene<00:03:57.090> with<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.390> two<00:03:57.570> dead<00:03:57.840> weights

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
carry a scene with the two dead weights

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.990 
carry a scene with the two dead weights
sometimes<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.430> see<00:03:59.579> there's<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.820> lot<00:03:59.970> of

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
sometimes you can see there's a lot of

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.849 
sometimes you can see there's a lot of
interesting<00:04:00.510> ideas<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:01.230> go<00:04:01.380> into<00:04:01.560> something

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
interesting ideas that go into something

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.610 
interesting ideas that go into something
but<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.280> falls<00:04:02.579> short<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.500> what<00:04:04.500> it

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
but it falls short of what it

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.990 
but it falls short of what it
potentially<00:04:04.709> could<00:04:05.160> have<00:04:05.549> pulled<00:04:05.819> off

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
potentially could have pulled off

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.690 
potentially could have pulled off
because<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.569> some<00:04:07.019> execution<00:04:07.799> issues<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.430> think

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
because of some execution issues I think

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.309 
because of some execution issues I think
dorama<00:04:09.329> Rock<00:04:09.540> could<00:04:09.750> have<00:04:09.840> easily<00:04:10.049> been

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
dorama Rock could have easily been

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.940 
dorama Rock could have easily been
excellent<00:04:10.859> but<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.430> couple<00:04:11.819> of<00:04:12.000> missteps<00:04:12.950> made

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
excellent but a couple of missteps made

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.099 
excellent but a couple of missteps made
it<00:04:14.100> only<00:04:14.250> kind<00:04:14.579> of<00:04:14.670> decent<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:15.359> know<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.840> sound

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
it only kind of decent I know I sound

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.900 
it only kind of decent I know I sound
really<00:04:16.500> harsh<00:04:16.769> but<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:17.340> only<00:04:17.489> because<00:04:17.609> I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
really harsh but that's only because I

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.860 
really harsh but that's only because I
see<00:04:18.540> how

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
see how

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.449 
see how
good<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.260> show<00:04:19.440> could<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:19.739> been<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.220> I'm<00:04:20.430> a

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
good the show could have been and I'm a

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.550 
good the show could have been and I'm a
little<00:04:20.729> disappointed<00:04:21.000> by<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.570> but<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.410> show

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
little disappointed by that but the show

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.580 
little disappointed by that but the show
did<00:04:22.800> have<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.010> lot<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.250> really<00:04:23.910> great<00:04:24.389> things<00:04:24.590> so

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
did have a lot of really great things so

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.680 
did have a lot of really great things so
despite<00:04:25.949> my<00:04:26.190> criticisms<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.210> have<00:04:27.540> to

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
despite my criticisms I have to

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.390 
despite my criticisms I have to
acknowledge<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.290> fact<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.830> was<00:04:28.949> able<00:04:29.280> to

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
acknowledge the fact that it was able to

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.570 
acknowledge the fact that it was able to
shift<00:04:29.699> tones<00:04:30.260> very<00:04:31.260> quickly<00:04:31.680> it<00:04:32.310> could<00:04:32.490> be

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
shift tones very quickly it could be

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.700 
shift tones very quickly it could be
very<00:04:32.610> creepy<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.330> suspenseful<00:04:34.020> in<00:04:34.229> one<00:04:34.410> scene

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
very creepy and suspenseful in one scene

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.620 
very creepy and suspenseful in one scene
and<00:04:34.919> then<00:04:35.010> suddenly<00:04:35.340> shift<00:04:35.880> just<00:04:36.270> something

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
and then suddenly shift just something

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.980 
and then suddenly shift just something
really<00:04:37.410> funny<00:04:37.650> inherently<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.760> was<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.479> funny

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
really funny inherently it was a funny

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.550 
really funny inherently it was a funny
show<00:04:40.380> but<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.460> was<00:04:41.669> able<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.270> pull<00:04:42.630> off<00:04:42.660> serious

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
show but it was able to pull off serious

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.140 
show but it was able to pull off serious
scenes<00:04:43.919> without<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.460> feeling<00:04:44.669> out<00:04:45.000> of<00:04:45.030> place

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
scenes without it feeling out of place

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.719 
scenes without it feeling out of place
and<00:04:46.020> as<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.290> said<00:04:46.350> everyone<00:04:46.860> somehow<00:04:47.280> connected

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
and as I said everyone somehow connected

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.060 
and as I said everyone somehow connected
in<00:04:47.880> some<00:04:48.090> way<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.300> it<00:04:48.570> was<00:04:48.660> always<00:04:48.900> fun<00:04:49.320> waiting

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
in some way so it was always fun waiting

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.710 
in some way so it was always fun waiting
for<00:04:50.370> that<00:04:50.460> reveal<00:04:50.820> there<00:04:51.300> were<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.479> few

for that reveal there were a few

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.140 
for that reveal there were a few
characters<00:04:52.169> who<00:04:52.410> did<00:04:52.800> fail<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.520> pull<00:04:53.729> off<00:04:53.910> the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
characters who did fail to pull off the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.260 
characters who did fail to pull off the
exciting<00:04:54.630> reveal<00:04:54.979> like<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.610> motorcycle

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
exciting reveal like the motorcycle

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.379 
exciting reveal like the motorcycle
policeman<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.470> shinra's<00:04:59.190> dad<00:04:59.460> both<00:05:00.000> of<00:05:00.270> those

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
policeman and shinra's dad both of those

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.969 
policeman and shinra's dad both of those
characters<00:05:00.900> appeared<00:05:01.289> in<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.500> second<00:05:01.830> half

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
characters appeared in the second half

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.260 
characters appeared in the second half
like<00:05:02.220> they<00:05:02.340> were<00:05:02.430> going<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.610> be<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:02.760> huge<00:05:02.970> deal

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
like they were going to be a huge deal

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.730 
like they were going to be a huge deal
but<00:05:03.539> then<00:05:03.750> they<00:05:03.930> never<00:05:04.199> did<00:05:04.440> anything

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
but then they never did anything

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.920 
but then they never did anything
following<00:05:05.430> their<00:05:05.550> introduction<00:05:06.090> episode<00:05:06.510> but

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
following their introduction episode but

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.050 
following their introduction episode but
kadota<00:05:07.380> did<00:05:07.860> get<00:05:08.070> an<00:05:08.190> opportunity<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.880> prove

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
kadota did get an opportunity to prove

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.379 
kadota did get an opportunity to prove
that<00:05:09.240> he<00:05:09.360> belonged<00:05:09.720> there<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.370> Shizuo<00:05:11.370> got<00:05:12.000> to

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
that he belonged there and Shizuo got to

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.939 
that he belonged there and Shizuo got to
do<00:05:12.539> something<00:05:12.900> as<00:05:13.020> well<00:05:13.199> that<00:05:13.530> we<00:05:13.590> had<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.830> wait

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
do something as well that we had to wait

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.950 
do something as well that we had to wait
until<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.550> second<00:05:14.880> half<00:05:14.910> for<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.330> payoff<00:05:15.660> I

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
until the second half for the payoff I

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.840 
until the second half for the payoff I
could<00:05:16.440> see<00:05:16.650> how<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.919> aim<00:05:17.250> was<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.699> keep

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
could see how the aim was to keep

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.610 
could see how the aim was to keep
everyone<00:05:18.180> woven<00:05:18.660> together<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:19.229> for<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.440> most

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
everyone woven together and for the most

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.439 
everyone woven together and for the most
part<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.979> think<00:05:20.010> they<00:05:20.669> pulled<00:05:20.910> that<00:05:21.000> off<00:05:21.060> very

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
part I think they pulled that off very

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.240 
part I think they pulled that off very
well<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:22.080> one<00:05:22.260> character<00:05:22.590> who<00:05:22.889> kind<00:05:23.160> of

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
well the one character who kind of

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.400 
well the one character who kind of
remained<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.120> storyline<00:05:24.479> no<00:05:24.840> matter<00:05:25.050> what

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
remained in the storyline no matter what

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.540 
remained in the storyline no matter what
was<00:05:25.860> always<00:05:26.310> Isaiah<00:05:26.970> because<00:05:27.870> he<00:05:28.590> made<00:05:29.130> it<00:05:29.340> his

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
was always Isaiah because he made it his

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.670 
was always Isaiah because he made it his
business<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:30.120> always<00:05:30.720> be<00:05:30.960> up<00:05:31.260> in<00:05:31.530> other

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
people's business and he can kind of be

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.850 
people's business and he can kind of be
attributed<00:05:34.590> as<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:35.910> show's<00:05:36.210> main<00:05:36.860> antagonist

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
mostly from having too many ideas and

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.560 
mostly from having too many ideas and
too<00:05:59.310> many<00:05:59.490> characters<00:05:59.699> and<00:06:00.240> trying<00:06:00.449> to

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
too many characters and trying to

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.360 
too many characters and trying to
squeeze<00:06:00.900> them<00:06:01.080> all<00:06:01.349> into<00:06:01.680> a<00:06:01.800> show<00:06:02.039> that<00:06:02.070> was

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
squeeze them all into a show that was

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.520 
squeeze them all into a show that was
too<00:06:02.639> short<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.630> if<00:06:03.780> it<00:06:03.870> had<00:06:04.050> done<00:06:04.260> some

too short and if it had done some

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.439 
too short and if it had done some
whittling<00:06:04.979> I<00:06:05.190> think<00:06:05.490> that<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:05.760> first<00:06:05.970> half<00:06:06.300> of

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
whittling I think that the first half of

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.510 
whittling I think that the first half of
a<00:06:06.510> series<00:06:06.900> could<00:06:07.229> have<00:06:07.380> stood<00:06:07.650> on<00:06:07.830> its<00:06:07.949> own<00:06:08.190> and

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
a series could have stood on its own and

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.060 
a series could have stood on its own and
been<00:06:08.789> really<00:06:09.090> great<00:06:09.270> as<00:06:09.660> it<00:06:09.990> is<00:06:10.139> I<00:06:10.410> liked<00:06:10.889> it
