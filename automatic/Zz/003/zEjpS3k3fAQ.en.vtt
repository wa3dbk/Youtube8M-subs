00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.750 
and it is a high-waisted bathing suit I

but i really like these because i find

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.640 
but i really like these because i find
it<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.519> different<00:04:16.700> style<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.750> there's<00:04:18.530> the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
it a different style and there's the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.979 
it a different style and there's the
little<00:04:18.799> orange<00:04:19.160> mousse<00:04:19.610> on<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.269> side<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:20.750> the

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
little orange mousse on the side on the

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.210 
little orange mousse on the side on the
back<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:22.580> next<00:04:22.940> one<00:04:23.530> wasn't<00:04:24.530> meant<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.920> be<00:04:24.950> all

back the next one wasn't meant to be all
together<00:04:25.460> i<00:04:25.910> think<00:04:26.180> these<00:04:26.510> two<00:04:26.810> were<00:04:26.960> sold

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.130 
together i think these two were sold
together<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.310> this<00:04:28.640> one<00:04:28.850> was<00:04:28.970> separately<00:04:29.390> but

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
together and this one was separately but

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.750 
together and this one was separately but

i decided to buy all three of them
because<00:04:32.330> they<00:04:33.050> could<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.440> can<00:04:33.620> mix<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.430> match
