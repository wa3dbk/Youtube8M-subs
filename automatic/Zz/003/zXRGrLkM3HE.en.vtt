00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.150
 dear gaming friends my serious and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.509
 these are the daily news on wednesday shortly 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:15.179
 summarized for you so is with me 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 it's Tuesday night just over 24 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 watch it time to see if I still 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.500
 Wednesday morning get online otherwise 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 I certainly have that up 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.890
 Wednesday afternoon I have myself today 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.330
 evenings with a blog 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.619
 I've been busy too 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.750
 I'm not going to bock anymore 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.099
 Simyo says the format has me on it 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.420
 always personally correct in the past 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.550
 I liked it then for a while 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.410
 somehow so backwarded now but 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.600
 with a topic what then, so to speak 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.710
 directly to the viewer as to if 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.300
 She also wanted to watch it, I have one 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 second skyrim video is taken as 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.719
 it's just such a video just where I am 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 a little bit but a bit 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.420
 running around in my world and so on 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 and so on and three again 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.450
 Of course, even with me every day 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.559
 on the recording program therefore now 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.360
 a little later than usual 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.469
 Here it is already relatively warm me 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.239
 I hope the sweat is not mine 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.870
 very on the forehead and now you 're done 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.660
 continue with newsweek news but sounds 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.729
 somehow handicapped or start 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.189
 Let's talk about news about gamescom 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.159
 2015 and now was known or 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.250
 has confirmed phil spencer of microsoft 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.080
 that one quantum break of remmel 's there 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.720
 are the makers of alan wake now 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.189
 finally finally probably on 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.020
 the gamescom will see what is that for 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.490
 the description and indeed have many 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.990
 from you or I have it up 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.909
 every case on the e3 misses there 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.080
 was not shown there and phil spencer 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.700
 just said it again 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.799
 that he is very happy that draw the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.150
 this time until gamescom again 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.369
 has given more and he would be very 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.049
 Excited about the result what she did 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.090
 if not everything was delivered to me 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.420
 it is deceptive 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.759
 Microsoft Press Conference or 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.670
 performance from the fourth augusta she 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.290
 You are certainly more personal than that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.119
 old alan wake friend i am happy 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.130
 Just look what they are after now 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.780
 will deliver 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.060
 second thing also by phil spencer 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.090
 was published and it works 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.850
 star wars battlefront from electronic 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.469
 arts and indeed it has virtually confirmed 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.030
 that first of all attention on the 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.409
 Play xbox one star wars battlefront 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.239
 so can not on the pc and also 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.520
 not on the playstation 4 but the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.700
 xbox has almost the exclusive deal 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.319
 home and that 's it 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.910
 access that's this month's contribution 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.340
 to perform the iran electronic arts 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.110
 could that be 45 euros a month and 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.489
 This gives you some advantages and more 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.140
 then it is also part of star wars 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.880
 Battlefront can play first 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.230
 there is no exact information about it yet 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.610
 I would assume that that 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.340
 similar to the other titles so far 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.640
 even five to seven days earlier 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.739
 could be another fifa scandal 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.250
 electronic arts and so on today 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.640
 also known that actually one 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.069
 woman will be on the cover of fifa 16 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.410
 oh my god will be so exactly 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.970
 a woman and a man on the cover 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.160
 but that is only in three countries 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.340
 and my knowledge is that america 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.840
 Canada and Australia in Germany 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.549
 no woman on the cover made 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.930
 I'm not so sure about that either 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.040
 that deserves because I had been following 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.850
 personally not so special 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.830
 female football 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.190
 but I would have been shit 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.209
 I have to confess now 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.530
 Women's football jokes of me now 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.640
 in the comments but I like 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.470
 actually does not matter 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.510
 Woman or man on the cover as long as it is 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.310
 not always messi is one now 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.340
 really bored for years now 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.530
 year then everything is okay peter hines of 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.690
 bethesda has again now 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.880
 fallout 4 and to the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.609
 supposed criticism see the game 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.959
 Crap out and I have one too 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.150
 few times read under the two 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.040
 trailers I uploaded again 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.750
 that the people got stuck 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.880
 of because he looks like shit the game 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.870
 The game is shit is for the graphic 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.760
 and so on 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.290
 and now explicitly again 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.660
 really answered for a long time 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.880
 and he also said it's in 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.709
 so far just a game with it 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.780
 the greatest possible freedom with the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.880
 to make the greatest possible reality and it 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.440
 Do not care about playing with the 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.030
 to deliver the nicest graphics 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.420
 yes and he then also something 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.220
 smaller directly as well as evidence 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.350
 used that as well as never with 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.030
 the approach is all 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.430
 all the prettiest and the most beautiful 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.920
 apg but it should be about it 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.049
 go the most real and and best world 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.030
 where you just talk to everyone 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.799
 where you can open a book 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.850
 knew how to read in the book too 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.340
 is possible and he really has 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.440
 mentions that you can choose 1000 cheese 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.599
 roll down a mountain can do that 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.670
 can you marl google cheese from me 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.110
 and 1000 skyrim will be collateralised 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.640
 find the funny videos and he says 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.890
 that makes easily the worlds in 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.630
 best of all that they are just real 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.010
 and feel real when you get a grenade 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.560
 at least in the room then you can do it 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.790
 first look where every single where 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.710
 every single object was simple 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.740
 flew by the explosion and 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.150
 it is not somehow now image 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.580
 and a texture of the world but 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.200
 should be right world and point out 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.900
 Do you want to work behind and mine? 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.610
 tip my dear cheeky four graphics 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.960
 criticize and I'm just that 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.720
 graphic clock before God the Lord 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.240
 look at a scan anja to death 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.140
 murdered my mouth but something like that 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.550
 sofar always play and I 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.650
 think that's the case with fallout 4 too 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.450
 so even if you do not have it yet 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.590
 should be pretty enough and I think so 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.900
 that's a fantastic atmosphere 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.180
 hamburgs karim also had without the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.010
 high-resolution textures that until then yes 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.890
 itself has really passed from 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.000
 Start in the first 15 to 30 minutes 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.550
 such an atmosphere 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.510
 hh that's the one who has packed and me 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.830
 believe we will be back 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.390
 Fallout 4 experience I am completely 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.980
 safe and after that become the men 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.070
 come and everything until you can not do it anymore 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.290
 to punish and I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.980
 Four certainly requires one of the 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.170
 hottest tips of the summer you should 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.150
 ready to be beta tester of windows 10 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.340
 or even own a xbox one 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.470
 It is now possible almost your xbox 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.020
 train games either on the windows 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.570
 tablet or on windows 10 over to 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.890
 I then asked myself what to stream 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.330
 It should be honest because the game 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.400
 is still running on the xbox tree 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.020
 it does not spit on the xbox but there 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.810
 stream that on my pc 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.520
 in the future, this xbox one app 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.620
 also be extended again against 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.360
 chad and such stories we will 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.400
 but this was explained in more detail sense 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.170
 He is really grateful for that 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.880
 for this 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.040
 witcher 3 makes so currently only the 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.590
 negative headlines doing so turned 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.900
 a little bit around the patch 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.090
 1.07 and that should be on the consoles 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.000
 partly strong strong problems with the 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.040
 apps have one hears that some 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.140
 some players at the playstation of 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.280
 30 really dropped 20 fps 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.430
 are and it is very easy 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.600
 hakelige feels as before and also me 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.400
 have so little bit more 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.870
 problems than before i have two 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.850
 had moments where the game so find 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.140
 second of a second jerks off I have 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.150
 even a dwarf above now in 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.110
 see and hang the air in the house 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.390
 such stories with me 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.210
 It is still minimal water to 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:47.130
 error causes but on the 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.750
 official twitter page on facebook 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.370
 one has already commented that one 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.230
 at the moment with high speed at it 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.690
 This bugs really works 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.160
 to fix what you are there in a timely manner 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.050
 Report and son yourself if you 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.180
 I would have problems with the
