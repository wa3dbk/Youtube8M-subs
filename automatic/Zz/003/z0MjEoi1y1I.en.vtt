00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.230
 the staff already have a wind carburetor 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.820
 and variable 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:17.760
 this carburetor it belongs to a 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:22.320
 tornado 250 is that collaborator he was 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.439
 doomed for mechanical hair 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.130
 the owner the tiago to buy another 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.000
 right contributor telling him that he 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.040
 is having an internet problem 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 now I do not see any problem yet 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.320
 do not open 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 I do not know how the rubber is, he's alone. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.960
 that if the problem was becoming 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.520
 here it counts 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.920
 this one has should cost around 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.510
 R $ 30 40 reais 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:57.629
 No, I do not think it's not logical, you. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:01.500
 buy a carburetor pay 400 500 600 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:04.670
 real value being that if it is a problem 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.110
 even mainly you can compare 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.710
 $ 40 in it sure he passed 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.240
 diagnostic noel did not walk on the bike 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.180
 she has a problem and a mass 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.700
 spin that bike she's drowning 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.790
 I have two diagnoses can be some 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.400
 problem that I will not open yet in the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.720
 the right player needle to finish 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.060
 like quetta 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.240
 or it may be that valve of March 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.750
 it works different from the right car 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.850
 because that air valve 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.450
 the chaos the car carburetor has a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.820
 valve of passing March 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.700
 fuel right here in fashion 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.409
 fuel and send it to and then 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.259
 explaining how to disassemble it goes 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.509
 explain how it works for 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.770
 you have an idea that can be 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:09.119
 symptom is also have to take great care in 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 installation is all okay right because 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.250
 because because I believe it can be 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.430
 this here 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:22.290
 because she works like this here 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:30.310
 in her formulation here has is the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:34.600
 uai here right here in the butterfly 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.810
 admission and here the water intake 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:42.610
 right when it when a vacuum between 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:47.380
 here entering here ends up entering 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.020
 here is also this hole that this 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.650
 and when the Basque enters the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.209
 here the bigger cow he does this 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.690
 swimming pool 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:02.950
 sure he goes up on that he is 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.620
 climbing it opens the needle a needle 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.120
 spring that press down it to 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.670
 needle 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.760
 only when you are on the move 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.650
 spin proves too high here 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.820
 inside the butterfly is open too 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.200
 right 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.239
 What happens is the mixture starts to get 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.989
 Poor because it's because he's coming in. 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.120
 a lot of air 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.750
 So this story starts to get pop 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.980
 then this maximum valve 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.860
 she gets the knife in here right 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:42.790
 here where is the iac has the base 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.680
 of rubber that works had a target 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.680
 he goes in here 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:56.019
 Eliab it opens it opens a ball 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.840
 pulls the navy here and the vacuum what the 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.410
 Basque makes him escape doing this 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.630
 matter of being certain what will happen 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.370
 He is going to go down a little bit to 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.360
 to enrich the mixture 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.070
 correct 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.799
 Of course he has to make a mix 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.049
 correct not help much here but vacuum 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.840
 often have no fuel because 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.450
 the fuel also when it is in 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.900
 a vote he will not enter just for 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.789
 here they leave organized by it not only goes 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.370
 for organizing that there could be for 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.570
 here o 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:34.160
 if you look I have furim west here 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.050
 wants to donate the mix from where I go 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.090
 regular mix right 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:44.240
 then screw this I'm here it 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.150
 it works like you see that furlani 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.590
 then that hole he will also pass 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.960
 fuel here 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.630
 Alright then it will do much more 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.160
 fuel 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.380
 then this valve has that it is 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.990
 working what you have cissa 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.880
 locked has holes 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.320
 here she has even the few were of 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.990
 Progressions is not like the carburetor 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.169
 never having enough strength and projection 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.590
 but if the hole where the article passes is 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:15.970
 locked occurring because much because 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:21.440
 CONAR because she has this tip here 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:23.810
 it is connected to the breather hose of the 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.580
 the valve cover 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.320
 right carburetor 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.599
 it is attached side of the carburetor in the water 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.229
 right then it's connected here 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:38.900
 and here they'll suck it there and finish it 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:42.260
 messing up here is black with 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.800
 good coal right here in this here 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.250
 It has to be well cleaned this pain favor. 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.620
 he does not look like he was clean 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.419
 he already passed I think in the hand of one of the 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.099
 mechanics do not know everyone said that 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.229
 clean employees if they do not have 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:00.560
 no one could be that they spent a 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.930
 charred mirror in here and clean 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.599
 It's just me and what I do not recommend. 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:13.010
 because I do not recommend because the mirror 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:15.380
 charring a resident without dismantling 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:19.699
 he has plastic parts here 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.289
 inside rubber and will end up drying out 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.630
 and damaging so you have to 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.330
 dismantling, you must remove the 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.039
 Rubber and to do only had then I 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.840
 I 'm going to dismount it and I 'm going to pre-order it. 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.510
 cleaning and carburetor 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.729
 let us see how what is right when 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.530
 says to ride and dismount your dream is 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.900
 find something wrong, I'll go 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.080
 give you what it is 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.080
 who
