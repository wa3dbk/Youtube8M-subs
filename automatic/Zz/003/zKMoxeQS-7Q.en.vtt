from the layer below to show through
from<00:00:39.300> then<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.989> process<00:00:40.470> is<00:00:40.710> really<00:00:41.100> all

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
from then on the process is really all

about<00:00:41.520> trial<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.120> error<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.540> use<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.500> magic

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
about trial and error I use the magic

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
about trial and error I use the magic
wand<00:00:44.070> tool<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.730> select<00:00:44.910> different<00:00:45.300> patches<00:00:45.780> of

wand tool to select different patches of
color<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.710> use<00:00:46.949> the<00:00:47.160> hue<00:00:47.460> saturation

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
color and then I use the hue saturation

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.000 
color and then I use the hue saturation

colors individually through the three
variables

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.530 

this<00:00:56.740> video<00:00:57.040> is<00:00:57.280> shown<00:00:57.520> at<00:00:57.670> about<00:00:57.940> eight<00:00:58.180> times

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
this video is shown at about eight times

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.720 
this video is shown at about eight times
normal<00:00:59.200> speed<00:00:59.350> so<00:00:59.530> you<00:00:59.830> can<00:01:00.040> see<00:01:00.280> it's<00:01:00.460> just<00:01:00.640> a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
normal speed so you can see it's just a

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.550 
normal speed so you can see it's just a
lot<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.150> same<00:01:01.390> process<00:01:01.870> over<00:01:02.320> and<00:01:02.440> over

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
lot of the same process over and over

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.250 
lot of the same process over and over
again<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:04.030> what<00:01:04.210> I<00:01:04.270> will<00:01:04.480> do<00:01:04.600> sometimes<00:01:05.020> it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
again now what I will do sometimes it's

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.690 
again now what I will do sometimes it's
jumped<00:01:05.500> ahead<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:06.160> create<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.430> layer<00:01:06.670> for

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
jumped ahead and create a layer for

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.560 
jumped ahead and create a layer for
things<00:01:07.300> like<00:01:07.420> glows<00:01:08.310> anything<00:01:09.310> that<00:01:09.940> is<00:01:10.090> going

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
things like glows anything that is going

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.060 
things like glows anything that is going
to<00:01:10.660> have<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:10.810> haze<00:01:11.050> around<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.620> I'll<00:01:11.800> put<00:01:11.950> on<00:01:11.980> a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
to have a haze around it I'll put on a

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.100 
to have a haze around it I'll put on a
separate<00:01:12.460> layer<00:01:12.640> set<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.570> layer<00:01:13.810> mode<00:01:14.080> to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
separate layer set that layer mode to

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.340 
separate layer set that layer mode to
screen<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:15.220> then<00:01:16.090> just<00:01:16.540> bigger<00:01:16.810> color<00:01:17.020> and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
screen and then just bigger color and

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
screen and then just bigger color and
airbrush<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:17.950> over<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.310> spot<00:01:18.580> that<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.820> want

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.560 

sometimes<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.550> flats<00:01:25.820> aren't<00:01:26.120> exactly<00:01:26.480> the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
sometimes the flats aren't exactly the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.120 
sometimes the flats aren't exactly the
way<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.750> want<00:01:27.050> them<00:01:27.230> so<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:27.440> do<00:01:27.560> have<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:27.950> go<00:01:28.100> in

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
way I want them so I do have to go in

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.110 
way I want them so I do have to go in
and<00:01:28.780> manually<00:01:29.780> draw<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:30.650> more<00:01:30.860> shapes<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.970> do

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
and manually draw in more shapes to do

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.560 
and manually draw in more shapes to do
that<00:01:32.300> I<00:01:32.330> use<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.750> pencil<00:01:32.990> tool<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:34.330> it's<00:01:35.330> just

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
that I use the pencil tool and it's just

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.510 
that I use the pencil tool and it's just
a<00:01:35.660> question<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:36.140> finding<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.680> color<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.490> I

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
a question of finding the color that I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.670 
a question of finding the color that I
do<00:01:37.610> want<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.240> putting<00:01:38.870> a<00:01:38.960> bar<00:01:39.170> on<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:41.680> that's

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
do want and putting a bar on it that's

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.650 
do want and putting a bar on it that's
the<00:01:42.800> same<00:01:43.070> process<00:01:43.550> that<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.760> use<00:01:44.030> for<00:01:44.270> two-tone

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
the same process that I use for two-tone

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.780 
the same process that I use for two-tone
coloring<00:01:45.230> I<00:01:45.440> will<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:46.310> take<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.580> pencil

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
coloring I will just take the pencil

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.660 
coloring I will just take the pencil
tool<00:01:47.090> go<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:48.050> pick<00:01:48.530> either<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.920> lighter<00:01:49.340> or<00:01:49.640> a

tool go in pick either a lighter or a
darker<00:01:50.090> color<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:50.540> then<00:01:51.350> create<00:01:52.220> shadows<00:01:52.790> or

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
darker color and then create shadows or

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.120 
darker color and then create shadows or
highlights<00:01:53.480> depending<00:01:53.990> on<00:01:54.140> what<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.830> cover

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
highlights depending on what the cover

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.250 
highlights depending on what the cover
calls<00:01:55.400> for<00:01:57.970> if<00:01:58.970> I<00:01:59.120> have<00:01:59.300> a<00:01:59.330> section<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.930> smaller

calls for if I have a section of smaller
elements<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:01.040> will<00:02:01.310> often<00:02:01.490> treat<00:02:01.790> them<00:02:01.910> as<00:02:02.000> a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
elements I will often treat them as a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.940 
elements I will often treat them as a
group<00:02:02.270> I'll<00:02:02.960> make<00:02:03.170> sure<00:02:03.320> they're<00:02:03.530> all<00:02:03.680> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.040 
group I'll make sure they're all the
colors<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.400> want<00:02:04.580> them<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:04.910> be<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.300> then

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
colors that I want them to be and then

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.230 
colors that I want them to be and then
select<00:02:06.890> them<00:02:06.979> all<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:07.430> change<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.060> color

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
select them all and change the color

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.190 
select them all and change the color
globally<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:10.000> also<00:02:11.000> use<00:02:11.450> what<00:02:11.660> are<00:02:11.690> known<00:02:11.900> as

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
globally I also use what are known as

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.770 
globally I also use what are known as
color<00:02:12.590> holds<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.910> where<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.240> take<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
color holds this is where you take the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.110 
color holds this is where you take the
inks<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.560> replace<00:02:16.160> them<00:02:16.459> with<00:02:16.490> something

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
inks and replace them with something

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.930 
inks and replace them with something
other<00:02:17.510> than<00:02:17.810> black<00:02:18.050> as<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:19.250> can<00:02:19.370> see<00:02:19.550> here<00:02:19.910> I

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
other than black as you can see here I

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.640 
other than black as you can see here I
did<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.270> on<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.480> legs<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.230> background

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
did it on the legs and in the background

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.490 
did it on the legs and in the background
and<00:02:22.010> it's<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.700> way<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.260> make<00:02:24.260> something

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
and it's just a way to make something

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.310 
and it's just a way to make something
seem<00:02:24.800> like<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.250> different<00:02:25.370> texture<00:02:25.850> or

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
seem like it's a different texture or

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.840 
seem like it's a different texture or
also<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.860> know<00:02:27.950> turn<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.340> into<00:02:28.550> something

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
also you know turn it into something

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.290 
also you know turn it into something
that<00:02:29.090> falls<00:02:29.270> back<00:02:29.570> in<00:02:29.750> space<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.120> great

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
that falls back in space it's a great

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.030 
that falls back in space it's a great
technique<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.750> use<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.080> things<00:02:33.470> like<00:02:33.770> energy

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
technique to use for things like energy

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.770 
technique to use for things like energy
projections<00:02:34.910> anything<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.959> glows<00:02:36.110> really

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.550 

I<00:02:40.760> try<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.819> keep<00:02:42.000> most<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.600> color<00:02:42.959> values

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
I try to keep most of the color values

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.360 
I try to keep most of the color values
at<00:02:44.300> maybe<00:02:45.300> about<00:02:45.620> 75%<00:02:46.620> at<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> darkest

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
at maybe about 75% at the darkest

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.000 
at maybe about 75% at the darkest
sometimes<00:02:48.270> 80%<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.319> really<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.709> all<00:02:49.860> about

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
sometimes 80% it's really just all about

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.940 
sometimes 80% it's really just all about
feel<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.150> main<00:02:51.390> thing<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.990> since<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.740> is

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
feel the main thing is since this is

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.490 
feel the main thing is since this is
comic-book<00:02:53.310> coloring<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:55.020> always<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.470> to

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
comic-book coloring you always want to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.100 
comic-book coloring you always want to
make<00:02:55.650> sure<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.190> inks<00:02:56.550> stand<00:02:56.970> out<00:02:57.810> as

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
make sure that the inks stand out as

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
make sure that the inks stand out as
their<00:02:58.319> own<00:02:58.470> thing

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
their own thing

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.610 
their own thing
they're<00:02:59.700> what<00:02:59.970> gives<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.630> drawing<00:03:00.930> its

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
they're what gives the drawing its

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.590 
they're what gives the drawing its
definition<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.000> don't<00:03:03.180> really<00:03:03.330> want

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
definition so you you don't really want

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.410 
definition so you you don't really want
to<00:03:03.660> compete<00:03:04.020> with<00:03:04.080> those<00:03:05.030> when<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.060> was<00:03:06.270> first

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
to compete with those when I was first

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.380 
to compete with those when I was first
starting<00:03:06.660> out<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.260> would<00:03:08.040> try<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.910> really

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
starting out I would try and and really

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.140 
starting out I would try and and really
mimic<00:03:09.780> almost<00:03:10.260> what<00:03:10.890> was<00:03:11.040> realistic<00:03:11.550> painting

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
mimic almost what was realistic painting

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.810 
mimic almost what was realistic painting
and<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:13.590> would<00:03:13.860> just<00:03:14.070> make<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> inks<00:03:14.670> get

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
and that would just make the inks get

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.670 
and that would just make the inks get
lost<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> darkness<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.080> other<00:03:16.290> colors

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
lost in the darkness of the other colors

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.780 
lost in the darkness of the other colors
in<00:03:18.800> addition<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.890> grouping<00:03:20.160> things<00:03:20.250> by<00:03:20.489> color

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
in addition to grouping things by color

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.330 
in addition to grouping things by color
I<00:03:21.060> also<00:03:21.269> used<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.989> channels<00:03:22.500> palette<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:23.070> save

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
I also used the channels palette to save

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.820 
I also used the channels palette to save
selections<00:03:24.269> this<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.200> really<00:03:25.470> convenient

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
selections this is really convenient

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.650 
selections this is really convenient
when<00:03:26.130> you're<00:03:26.310> dealing<00:03:26.580> with<00:03:26.760> large<00:03:27.209> groups<00:03:27.450> of

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
when you're dealing with large groups of

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.210 
when you're dealing with large groups of
things<00:03:27.930> such<00:03:28.380> as<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.680> tables<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
things such as the tables in the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.119 
things such as the tables in the
foreground

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.380 

once<00:03:33.129> I'm<00:03:33.280> happy<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.790> basic<00:03:34.150> color

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
once I'm happy with the basic color

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.300 
once I'm happy with the basic color
scheme<00:03:34.480> that's<00:03:35.230> when<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> really<00:03:35.890> get<00:03:36.040> down<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
scheme that's when I really get down to

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.449 
scheme that's when I really get down to
the<00:03:36.549> actual<00:03:36.970> rendering<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.720> piece<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.459> will

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
the actual rendering of the piece I will

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.430 
the actual rendering of the piece I will
do<00:03:39.909> the<00:03:40.090> two-tone<00:03:40.450> coloring<00:03:40.870> which<00:03:41.019> is<00:03:41.170> just

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
do the two-tone coloring which is just

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.559 
do the two-tone coloring which is just
picking<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.950> light<00:03:42.129> or<00:03:42.280> darker<00:03:42.580> color<00:03:42.790> Here<00:03:43.540> I

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
picking a light or darker color Here I

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.990 
picking a light or darker color Here I
am<00:03:43.659> creating<00:03:44.409> a<00:03:44.440> highlight<00:03:44.830> on<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.819> yellow

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
am creating a highlight on the yellow

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.020 
am creating a highlight on the yellow
part<00:03:46.299> of<00:03:46.390> Iron<00:03:46.569> Man's<00:03:46.780> armor<00:03:47.790> while<00:03:48.790> this

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
part of Iron Man's armor while this

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.140 
part of Iron Man's armor while this
isn't<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.480> final<00:03:49.720> stage<00:03:50.110> it's<00:03:50.560> pretty<00:03:50.980> close

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
isn't the final stage it's pretty close

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.110 
isn't the final stage it's pretty close
after<00:03:53.019> this<00:03:53.200> we<00:03:53.680> then<00:03:53.830> go<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.730> start<00:03:55.000> to

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
after this we then go in and start to

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.270 
after this we then go in and start to
render<00:03:55.299> things<00:03:55.629> a<00:03:55.750> bit<00:03:55.930> more<00:03:55.959> with<00:03:56.950> things

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
render things a bit more with things

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.960 
render things a bit more with things
like<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.579> burn<00:03:57.790> tool<00:03:58.090> or<00:03:58.360> even<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.379> airbrush

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
like the burn tool or even the airbrush

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.360 
like the burn tool or even the airbrush
the<00:04:00.970> very<00:04:01.239> final<00:04:01.780> stage<00:04:02.049> is<00:04:02.409> to<00:04:02.860> create<00:04:03.340> a

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
the very final stage is to create a

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.520 
the very final stage is to create a
filter<00:04:03.670> over<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.180> entire<00:04:04.480> piece<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:05.319> gives

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
filter over the entire piece that gives
