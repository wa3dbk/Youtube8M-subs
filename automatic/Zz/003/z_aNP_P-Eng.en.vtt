00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:19.370
 of hairs 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.370
 I have been working here in Alava for 39 years 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.800
 an arrangement of cars of all kinds of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.890
 vehicles the same sheet metal subjects 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.910
 mechanical electricity a bit of everything 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.430
 maintenance then those repairs 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.739
 good is an annual maintenance let's say 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.580
 normal walks around 207 euros 300 and 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.960
 diesel every 60 thousand kilometers 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.070
 increases because it changes all 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 filters and it can be about 400 and then 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.430
 well also usually every 40 thousand 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.470
 to see that walk 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.620
 changing brake pads in the 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.070
 covered that that also 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.070
 it increases quite 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.340
 a normal normal person let's say to walk 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.230
 about ten fifteen thousand kilometers 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.070
 a year a normal person who walks 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.020
 a relative of prisoners we will walk 30 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.480
 even some up to 40 thousand kilometers 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.670
 a year which we are talking about 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.490
 double the expense of a normal person 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.390
 we can talk about a person who was walking 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 visiting prisoners 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.000
 a set of covers have to change 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.890
 per year if it is for land that is 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.490
 possibility of snow has to have 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.130
 the game of snow and summer we are already 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.590
 talking at least six wheels which 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.509
 the price is rising 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.110
 we talk about then quietly close to 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.840
 thousand euros 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.240
 that in covers find more 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.009
 kilometers the clutch deteriorates and 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.209
 you have to make the change 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.289
 of the distribution then they come out 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.219
 of meego 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.840
 even in four years five simply 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.609
 already for kilometers you have to change the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.579
 vehicle because we are talking about that is 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:20.739
 has been able to reach then to 150 thousand 200 thousand 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.450
 kilometers then you're talking about 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.409
 she a car are you talking about twenty 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.120
 a thousand euros 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.299
 is more in a person who has the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.409
 family, let's say in CÃ¡diz or in a port 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.840
 little down below a month minimum are two thousand 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.700
 minimum kilometers there are times between 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.129
 vis a vis and visit as they are four thousand 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.859
 at the end of the year we are talking a 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.439
 heap of kilometers and that's the people 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.120
 who have been in their twenties in 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.939
 the jail you are talking about a 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.750
 kilometers of miles that goes with 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:55.720
 money the risk of the road etc etc 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.060
 etc be good exactly I do not know how many 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.700
 I know quite modest it is one of them 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.060
 for example I know that you have already changed three 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.780
 cars no longer carries here 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.200
 in prison 21 22 years then in 22 years 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.590
 he already spent 3 cars and the one he has now 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.599
 already has 150 160 thousand kilometers that is 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.390
 that we affirm ourselves again to change 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.670
 then it is another problem if 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.310
 suffer a slightly fat breakdown that does not 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.340
 can be solved for the weekend 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.959
 they are already disabled or they have 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.989
 to turn to another person who leaves them 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.769
 the vehicle with what many times 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.140
 I know if we are going to leave the car here 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.519
 we are also carrying the 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.920
 maintenance of vans 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.010
 eminem chin that is good 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.260
 we all know who is an agent that 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.569
 is lending a hand for the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.190
 relatives to take them and bring them and 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.290
 I can say that for example with 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.700
 vans and we have already the fourth 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.770
 van here in gasteiz 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.930
 and they are all staying with 300,000 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.879
 kilometers around it 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.209
 we are here day more than a million 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.840
 kilometers the prisons and this does not 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.840
 should be 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.160
 as in the background is a decision 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.639
 policy of telling them to finish how much 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.639
 before
