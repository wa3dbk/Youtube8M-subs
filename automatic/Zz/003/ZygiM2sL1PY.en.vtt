ahead and set that aside the case itself
is<00:00:51.570> held<00:00:51.870> together<00:00:52.020> by<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> series<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> tabs

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
is held together by a series of tabs

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
is held together by a series of tabs
I'll<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
I'll see if you can see them on the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.160 
I'll see if you can see them on the
inside<00:00:55.949> there<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> little<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.239> what

you're going to want to do is start with
the<00:00:59.699> solid<00:00:59.910> edge<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.629> from<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> inside<00:01:01.980> just

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the solid edge and from the inside just

the solid edge and from the inside just
kind<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.940> pull<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.019> little<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.920> can

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
kind of pull a little bit and you can

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.480 
kind of pull a little bit and you can
separate<00:01:05.519> those<00:01:05.760> tabs<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:07.189> you'll<00:01:08.189> hear<00:01:08.369> them

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
separate those tabs out you'll hear them

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.880 
separate those tabs out you'll hear them
click<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.270> separate<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.680> go<00:01:10.799> along

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
click as they separate as you go along

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
click as they separate as you go along
you'll<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> corner<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> once<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you'll get to the corner and once you

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.660 
you'll get to the corner and once you
can<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.540> right<00:01:16.110> side<00:01:16.439> corners<00:01:16.920> off<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
can get the right side corners off the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.980 
can get the right side corners off the
rest<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.420> pretty<00:01:18.720> much<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.500> pop<00:01:19.740> right<00:01:19.770> off

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
rest will pretty much just pop right off

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
rest will pretty much just pop right off
so<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.500> case<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.430> three<00:01:24.270> separate

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
so as you can see case is three separate

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.160 
so as you can see case is three separate
pieces<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.909> insert<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> phone<00:01:27.509> start<00:01:28.049> with

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pieces to insert the phone start with

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.130 
pieces to insert the phone start with
the<00:01:28.259> silicone<00:01:28.650> case<00:01:29.329> slide<00:01:30.329> your<00:01:30.360> phone<00:01:30.720> into

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the silicone case slide your phone into

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.630 
the silicone case slide your phone into
it<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:32.420> spots<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.189> lock<00:01:35.189> button

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
it there are spots for the lock button

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.910 
it there are spots for the lock button
as<00:01:35.880> well<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.110> volume<00:01:37.500> rockers

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.590 

that<00:01:44.920> sleeve<00:01:45.220> fits<00:01:45.460> around<00:01:45.580> there<00:01:45.940> all<00:01:46.150> the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
that sleeve fits around there all the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.840 
that sleeve fits around there all the
way<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.940> take<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.390> sleeve<00:01:49.659> and<00:01:50.820> insert<00:01:51.820> it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
way so take the sleeve and insert it

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.090 
way so take the sleeve and insert it
into<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.840> bottom<00:01:53.380> section<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:59.890> you're

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
into the bottom section and then you're

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.210 
into the bottom section and then you're
going<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.250> want<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.490> start<00:02:00.850> with<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.780> side

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
going to want to start with the side

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.150 
going to want to start with the side
with<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:04.170> opening<00:02:05.170> for<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.500> volume<00:02:05.710> and

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
with the opening for the volume and

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.719 
with the opening for the volume and
vibration<00:02:07.119> switch<00:02:08.070> best<00:02:09.070> way<00:02:09.220> I've<00:02:09.280> found<00:02:09.340> is

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
vibration switch best way I've found is

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.780 
vibration switch best way I've found is
to<00:02:10.179> just<00:02:11.050> get<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> corners<00:02:11.650> locked<00:02:11.920> in<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
to just get the corners locked in and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.370 
to just get the corners locked in and
then<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.940> side<00:02:16.180> pretty<00:02:16.630> much<00:02:16.810> just<00:02:17.050> slides

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
then the side pretty much just slides

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.880 
then the side pretty much just slides
right<00:02:17.560> together<00:02:19.170> once<00:02:20.170> you've<00:02:20.320> got<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.500> on

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
right together once you've got that on

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.060 
right together once you've got that on
the<00:02:21.160> other<00:02:21.280> side<00:02:21.900> again<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.560> can<00:02:23.739> just<00:02:23.860> kind

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
the other side again you can just kind

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.710 
the other side again you can just kind
of<00:02:24.100> work<00:02:24.280> with<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> little<00:02:24.910> bit<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.239> push-pull

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
of work with a little bit of a push-pull

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.690 
of work with a little bit of a push-pull
motion<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.290> find<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.100> best<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.400> lock<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
motion I find it's best to lock the

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.000 
motion I find it's best to lock the
corners<00:02:28.060> down<00:02:28.209> first<00:02:28.739> you'll<00:02:29.739> hear<00:02:29.920> them

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
corners down first you'll hear them

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.729 
corners down first you'll hear them
click<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.750> then<00:02:31.750> just<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.820> little<00:02:33.820> bit<00:02:33.970> of

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
click and then just a little bit of

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.410 
click and then just a little bit of
pushing<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.010> pulling<00:02:36.840> very<00:02:37.840> slightly<00:02:39.420> we'll

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
pushing and pulling very slightly we'll

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.590 
pushing and pulling very slightly we'll
get<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.660> other<00:02:40.810> side<00:02:41.019> locked<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.600> there

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
get the other side locked in and there

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.320 
get the other side locked in and there
you<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:46.300> protective<00:02:46.840> capsule<00:02:47.320> case

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
you have it the protective capsule case

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.870 
you have it the protective capsule case
to<00:02:49.330> get<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.570> off<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:51.100> kind<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.400> get<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.730> can

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
to get it off you kind of get you can

to get it off you kind of get you can
work<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.239> same<00:02:52.450> way<00:02:52.660> with<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.170> phone<00:02:53.440> in
