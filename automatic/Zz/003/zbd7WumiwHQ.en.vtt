have to keep in mind that the masseter

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.390 
have to keep in mind that the masseter
muscle<00:00:45.720> is<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.840> from<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.440> angle<00:00:47.130> of<00:00:47.220> the

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
muscle is going from the angle of the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.479 
muscle is going from the angle of the
jaw<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.050> way<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.380> cheek<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.340> as

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
jaw all the way to the cheek so it's as

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.829 
jaw all the way to the cheek so it's as
diagonal<00:00:50.970> line<00:00:51.390> heading<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:53.160> way<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.850> one

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
diagonal line heading that way and one

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.930 
diagonal line heading that way and one
of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.019> things<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.530> beginners<00:00:56.280> miss<00:00:56.640> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
of the things that beginners miss is

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.990 
of the things that beginners miss is
that<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> zygomatic<00:00:58.470> bone<00:00:58.769> becomes<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> plane

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that the zygomatic bone becomes a plane

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.540 
that the zygomatic bone becomes a plane
change<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.410> you're<00:01:01.530> looking<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> face

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
change so if you're looking at the face

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.460 
change so if you're looking at the face
from<00:01:03.360> below<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.450> the<00:01:06.450> zygomatic<00:01:07.200> bone

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
from below like this the zygomatic bone

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.200 
from below like this the zygomatic bone
basically<00:01:08.460> cuts<00:01:08.760> across<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.950> then

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
basically cuts across like here and then

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.360 
basically cuts across like here and then
that's<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.659> transition<00:01:13.230> plane<00:01:13.830> for<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> face

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
that's a transition plane for the face

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.210 
that's a transition plane for the face
and<00:01:14.640> then<00:01:15.300> it<00:01:15.600> will<00:01:15.840> start<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.230> cut<00:01:16.500> backwards

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and then it will start to cut backwards

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.390 
and then it will start to cut backwards
so<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.909> cuts<00:01:18.180> backwards<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.920> towards<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
so it cuts backwards and in towards the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.990 
so it cuts backwards and in towards the
ear<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.510> can<00:01:21.690> see<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.260> ma<00:01:22.530> actors<00:01:23.370> like

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
ear you can see this on ma actors like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.440 
ear you can see this on ma actors like
Acura<00:01:24.480> Knightley<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.620> strong<00:01:25.980> jaw<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.760> so

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
Acura Knightley really strong jaw and so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.960 
Acura Knightley really strong jaw and so
the<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.350> place<00:01:28.590> where<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.890> see<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.310> plane

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the the place where you see the plane

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.580 
the the place where you see the plane
change<00:01:30.330> so<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.810> looking<00:01:31.050> at<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.350> face

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
change so that your looking at my face

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.220 
change so that your looking at my face
right<00:01:31.830> now<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.600> you're<00:01:33.600> trying<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> find

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
right now and you're trying to find

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.520 
right now and you're trying to find
where<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:35.090> face<00:01:36.090> ends<00:01:36.750> basically<00:01:37.260> from<00:01:37.410> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
where the face ends basically from a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.380 
where the face ends basically from a
front<00:01:37.830> view<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.970> you're<00:01:39.090> gonna<00:01:39.180> say<00:01:39.360> about

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
front view so you're gonna say about

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.680 
front view so you're gonna say about
right<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.290> maybe<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.600> at

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
right here maybe and then if you look at

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.480 
right here maybe and then if you look at
it<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:42.930> below<00:01:43.140> you'll<00:01:44.010> see<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.340> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it from below you'll see that that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.780 
it from below you'll see that that
actually<00:01:44.520> curves<00:01:45.240> around<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.410> in<00:01:46.790> there's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
actually curves around and in there's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.600 
actually curves around and in there's
even<00:01:48.210> more<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.470> from<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> side<00:01:50.040> view<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
even more of it so from a side view you

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.150 
even more of it so from a side view you
might<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.290> place<00:01:52.590> where<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.920> face

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
might put that the place where the face

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.870 
might put that the place where the face
ends<00:01:53.670> back<00:01:53.940> here<00:01:54.440> but<00:01:55.440> in<00:01:55.620> actuality<00:01:56.010> you<00:01:56.700> need

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
ends back here but in actuality you need

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.140 
ends back here but in actuality you need
to<00:01:56.970> move<00:01:57.150> it<00:01:57.360> forward<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.050> here<00:01:58.670> that's<00:01:59.670> where

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
to move it forward to here that's where

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.270 
to move it forward to here that's where
the<00:02:00.360> face<00:02:00.660> ends<00:02:01.170> from<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.410> front<00:02:01.650> view<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.010> then

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the face ends from a front view and then

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.790 
the face ends from a front view and then
you<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.730> this<00:02:03.210> left<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.320> sculpt

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
you have all of this left the sculpt

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.460 
you have all of this left the sculpt
that's<00:02:05.700> something<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.150> we<00:02:06.270> miss<00:02:06.480> but<00:02:07.320> that's

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
that's something that we miss but that's

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.130 
that's something that we miss but that's
something<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.039> cover<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.509> facial
