and success there we are puzzle clear

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.880 
and success there we are puzzle clear
that's<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:40.949> there<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> game<00:00:41.519> and<00:00:42.890> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that's all there is to the game and it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.880 
that's all there is to the game and it
works<00:00:44.280> all<00:00:44.429> the<00:00:44.460> better<00:00:44.670> for<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.449> let's<00:00:46.230> go

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
works all the better for it so let's go

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
works all the better for it so let's go
back<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.100> our<00:00:47.249> main<00:00:47.489> menu<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.449> puzzle

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
back to our main menu this is the puzzle

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.779 
back to our main menu this is the puzzle
select<00:00:49.230> area<00:00:49.620> let's<00:00:50.100> try<00:00:50.249> that<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.460> again<00:00:50.550> I'm

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
select area let's try that one again I'm

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.759 
select area let's try that one again I'm
going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.089> a<00:00:51.300> much<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.170> faster<00:00:52.440> version

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
going to do a much much faster version

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.880 
going to do a much much faster version
instead<00:00:53.339> now<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:54.780> should<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.440> super

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
instead now and that should be a super

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.309 
instead now and that should be a super
cool<00:00:56.039> record-breaking<00:00:56.670> time<00:00:57.109> and<00:00:58.109> then<00:00:58.229> we

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
cool record-breaking time and then we

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:00.200 
cool record-breaking time and then we
are<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.800> our<00:00:58.979> best<00:00:59.129> time<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.879> we've<00:00:59.999> set<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
are that's our best time so we've set a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.509 
are that's our best time so we've set a
new<00:01:00.359> record<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.260> we've<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.739> star<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
new record and we've got the star and

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.729 
new record and we've got the star and
fantastic<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.050> whole<00:01:04.170> idea<00:01:04.200> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.620> game

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
fantastic so the whole idea of the game

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.400 
fantastic so the whole idea of the game
is<00:01:04.950> that<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.520> are<00:01:05.940> trying<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:06.930> everything

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
is that you are trying to use everything

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.990 
is that you are trying to use everything
within<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> environment<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.730> get<00:01:08.910> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
within the environment to get the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760 
within the environment to get the
fastest<00:01:09.390> possible<00:01:09.570> times<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.230> get<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.530> best

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
fastest possible times to get your best

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.270 
fastest possible times to get your best
times<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.000> star<00:01:12.300> rating<00:01:13.280> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
times and to get the the star rating and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.800 
times and to get the the star rating and
it's<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:15.210> much<00:01:15.990> much<00:01:16.230> much<00:01:16.670> harder<00:01:17.780> than<00:01:18.780> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it's a much much much harder than it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.730 
it's a much much much harder than it
sounds<00:01:19.170> basically<00:01:20.040> em<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> let's<00:01:22.380> move<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
sounds basically em so let's move that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.500 
sounds basically em so let's move that
along<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.220> I'm<00:01:24.090> finding<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:26.000> I'm<00:01:27.000> finding

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
along there I'm finding that I'm finding

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.020 
along there I'm finding that I'm finding
that<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.960> game<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.710> nun<00:01:29.010> really<00:01:29.250> nice<00:01:29.580> mix

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that the game is a nun really nice mix

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.690 
that the game is a nun really nice mix
of<00:01:30.330> sort<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> action<00:01:31.620> gameplay<00:01:32.100> whereby<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
of sort of action gameplay whereby you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
of sort of action gameplay whereby you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
really need to move your hands fast you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
really need to move your hands fast you
really<00:01:34.710> need<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:35.010> thinking<00:01:35.040> quickly<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
really need to be thinking quickly and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.590 
really need to be thinking quickly and
but<00:01:36.830> engaging<00:01:37.830> with<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.640> tiles<00:01:39.000> very<00:01:39.270> fast

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
but engaging with the tiles very fast

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.770 
but engaging with the tiles very fast
but<00:01:40.470> also<00:01:40.620> it<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.670> sort<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.420> straight<00:01:42.630> up

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
but also it is a sort of straight up

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.090 
but also it is a sort of straight up
puzzler<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.260> that<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:43.620> you<00:01:43.830> need<00:01:44.010> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
puzzler in that way because you need to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.470 
puzzler in that way because you need to
think<00:01:44.250> about<00:01:44.370> how<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> water<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.120> going<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.390> be

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
think about how the water is going to be

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.240 
think about how the water is going to be
reacting<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.200> how<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:46.920> sort<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.160> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
reacting and how it what sort of a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.360 
reacting and how it what sort of a
channel<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.300> to<00:01:48.450> be<00:01:49.010> taking<00:01:50.010> threw<00:01:50.220> up

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
channel it's going to be taking threw up

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.970 
channel it's going to be taking threw up
throughout<00:01:51.000> each<00:01:51.180> stage<00:01:51.510> so<00:01:52.290> let's<00:01:52.470> let's<00:01:52.770> do

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
throughout each stage so let's let's do

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.280 
throughout each stage so let's let's do
that<00:01:53.130> let's<00:01:53.730> get<00:01:53.880> rid<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.480> then<00:01:54.840> get

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that let's get rid of that and then get

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
that let's get rid of that and then get
rid<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.550> works<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.910> my<00:01:57.060> advantage

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
rid of that that works is my advantage

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.100 
rid of that that works is my advantage
and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.830> can<00:01:59.010> go<00:01:59.100> over<00:01:59.160> there<00:01:59.460> and<00:02:00.110> what

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and then I can go over there and what

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.390 
and then I can go over there and what
else<00:02:01.260> can<00:02:01.410> I<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.620> all<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.980> that's<00:02:02.190> not<00:02:02.280> going

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
else can I do all know that's not going

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.160 
else can I do all know that's not going
to<00:02:02.490> work<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.790> very<00:02:02.880> well<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.150> me<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.390> instead

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to work out very well for me so instead

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.510 
to work out very well for me so instead
of<00:02:04.230> going<00:02:04.350> through<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.800> could<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.310> go

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
of going through there I could just go

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.640 
of going through there I could just go
there<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:07.050> we<00:02:07.140> are<00:02:07.230> there<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.530> go

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
there and there we are there you go

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.800 
there and there we are there you go
managed<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.980> complete<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.789> stage

managed to complete that stage
it's<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.620> pretty<00:02:12.890> neat<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.209> not<00:02:14.450> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
it's it's pretty neat it is not the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.390 
it's it's pretty neat it is not the
platformer<00:02:15.290> perhaps<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.800> some<00:02:16.130> people

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
platformer perhaps that some people

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.510 
platformer perhaps that some people
would<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.880> up<00:02:17.660> for<00:02:18.069> but<00:02:19.069> then<00:02:19.280> at<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.459> same

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
would be up for but then at the same

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.630 
would be up for but then at the same
time<00:02:19.880> it<00:02:20.090> doesn't<00:02:20.120> really<00:02:21.160> pretend<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.280> be<00:02:22.370> or

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
time it doesn't really pretend to be or

time it doesn't really pretend to be or
anything<00:02:23.030> like<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.180> it's<00:02:23.480> not<00:02:23.630> really

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
anything like that it's not really

you<00:02:27.770> do<00:02:27.920> how<00:02:28.130> am<00:02:28.160> I<00:02:28.250> gonna<00:02:28.370> do<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:28.700> stage

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
you do how am I gonna do this stage

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.150 
you do how am I gonna do this stage
mmm-hmm<00:02:32.200> can<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.500> go<00:02:34.780> or<00:02:35.780> we're<00:02:36.590> not<00:02:36.739> right

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
mmm-hmm can we go or we're not right

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.610 
mmm-hmm can we go or we're not right
click<00:02:37.400> over<00:02:37.610> here<00:02:37.670> where<00:02:38.660> do<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.780> go<00:02:38.989> now<00:02:39.230> why

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
click over here where do I go now why

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.590 
click over here where do I go now why
should<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:39.860> go<00:02:39.980> up<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:40.550> I<00:02:40.730> there<00:02:41.239> we<00:02:41.300> go<00:02:41.420> so

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
should I go up if I there we go so

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.030 
should I go up if I there we go so
finally<00:02:41.930> over<00:02:42.200> there<00:02:42.350> then<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.709> get<00:02:42.860> that

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
finally over there then I can get that

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.630 
finally over there then I can get that
one<00:02:43.570> and<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.790> could<00:02:46.790> try<00:02:47.830> or<00:02:48.830> if<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.130> move<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.340> on

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
one and I could try or if I move that on

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.580 
one and I could try or if I move that on
the<00:02:49.730> way<00:02:49.850> then<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.150> can<00:02:50.269> move<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.570> there<00:02:50.900> what

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
the way then I can move that there what

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.509 
the way then I can move that there what
I<00:02:51.620> think<00:02:51.860> we're<00:02:51.950> getting<00:02:52.040> somewhere<00:02:52.370> now

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
I think we're getting somewhere now

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.610 
I think we're getting somewhere now
because<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.330> fires<00:02:53.600> gone<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.019> can<00:02:54.110> then<00:02:54.290> place

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
because that fires gone I can then place

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.949 
because that fires gone I can then place
that<00:02:54.650> next<00:02:55.190> time<00:02:55.340> there<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.090> there<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.810> then

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
that next time there and there and then

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.220 
that next time there and there and then
done<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.910> pattern<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.450> there<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.200> a

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
done there is a pattern and there is a

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.970 
done there is a pattern and there is a
fastest<00:03:01.130> route<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.459> completing<00:03:02.300> each<00:03:02.360> stage

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
fastest route to completing each stage

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.050 
fastest route to completing each stage
but<00:03:04.900> there's<00:03:05.900> also<00:03:06.080> just<00:03:06.500> just<00:03:07.459> completing

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
but there's also just just completing

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.250 
but there's also just just completing
the<00:03:08.150> stage<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.720> completing<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.110> stage

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the stage and just completing the stage

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.380 
the stage and just completing the stage
is<00:03:09.380> actually<00:03:09.650> quite<00:03:09.739> satisfying<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.610> failed<00:03:11.150> so

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
is actually quite satisfying I failed so

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.360 
is actually quite satisfying I failed so
far<00:03:11.530> certainly<00:03:12.530> for<00:03:12.620> somebody<00:03:12.860> who's<00:03:12.980> not<00:03:13.160> I'm

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
far certainly for somebody who's not I'm

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.250 
far certainly for somebody who's not I'm
not<00:03:13.730> massively<00:03:14.239> into<00:03:14.570> puzzle<00:03:14.870> games<00:03:15.049> that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
not massively into puzzle games that

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.009 
not massively into puzzle games that
much<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.980> for<00:03:16.340> me<00:03:16.489> that<00:03:16.519> totally<00:03:17.120> works<00:03:17.329> you

also see there's a lady over here and if
I<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.170> move<00:03:21.350> this<00:03:21.530> other<00:03:21.739> way<00:03:21.920> oh<00:03:22.299> she<00:03:23.299> escapes

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
I can move this other way oh she escapes

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.930 
I can move this other way oh she escapes
