with us this right here is not going to

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:27.560 
with us this right here is not going to
be<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.780> bad<00:05:25.110> option<00:05:25.320> at<00:05:25.979> all<00:05:26.039> in<00:05:26.940> fact<00:05:27.120> one<00:05:27.419> thing

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
be a bad option at all in fact one thing

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.690 
be a bad option at all in fact one thing
we<00:05:27.659> can<00:05:27.870> do<00:05:28.460> do<00:05:29.460> away<00:05:29.639> with<00:05:29.669> half<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.300> bread

15-20 grams
