talked about the air search has been
suspended<00:00:06.750> today<00:00:07.080> so<00:00:07.319> what's<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.010> impact<00:00:08.490> of

that suspension and do you know when the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.290 
that suspension and do you know when the
air<00:00:11.309> search<00:00:11.610> will<00:00:11.880> actually<00:00:12.210> resume

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.839 

that's<00:00:19.960> right<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.470> air<00:00:20.679> search<00:00:21.130> has<00:00:21.609> been

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
that's right the air search has been

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.240 
that's right the air search has been
suspended<00:00:22.300> so<00:00:22.630> far<00:00:22.960> this<00:00:23.560> is<00:00:23.740> because<00:00:24.039> of<00:00:24.070> the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
suspended so far this is because of the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.420 
suspended so far this is because of the
tropical<00:00:24.820> storm<00:00:25.210> that<00:00:25.570> didn't<00:00:26.560> close<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.310> the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
tropical storm that didn't close to the

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.210 
tropical storm that didn't close to the
search<00:00:27.669> area<00:00:28.000> yesterday<00:00:28.739> the<00:00:29.739> weather<00:00:29.980> is

search area yesterday the weather is

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.069 
search area yesterday the weather is
still<00:00:30.340> not<00:00:30.759> holding<00:00:31.059> up<00:00:31.359> today<00:00:31.539> that's<00:00:31.930> why

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
still not holding up today that's why

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.720 
still not holding up today that's why
they<00:00:32.199> spend<00:00:32.590> at<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.710> air<00:00:32.949> search<00:00:33.250> in<00:00:34.090> case<00:00:34.449> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
they spend at the air search in case of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.819 
they spend at the air search in case of
safety<00:00:36.730> concerns<00:00:36.760> but<00:00:37.629> the<00:00:37.809> important<00:00:38.769> thing

be resumed the air search will be

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.230 
be resumed the air search will be
resumed<00:01:11.110> but<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.860> would<00:01:12.220> imagine<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.700> they

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
resumed but I would imagine that they

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.029 
resumed but I would imagine that they
will<00:01:13.420> be<00:01:13.450> waiting<00:01:13.750> for<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.320> word<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.770> clear

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
will be waiting for the word to clear

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.999 
will be waiting for the word to clear
enough<00:01:15.429> for<00:01:16.060> them<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.240> take<00:01:16.840> off<00:01:17.020> and<00:01:17.050> find<00:01:17.920> a

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
enough for them to take off and find a

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.680 
enough for them to take off and find a
surface<00:01:18.429> search<00:01:18.670> but<00:01:18.970> this<00:01:19.119> surface<00:01:19.479> search

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
surface search but this surface search

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.350 
surface search but this surface search
has<00:01:20.259> been<00:01:20.500> going<00:01:20.800> on<00:01:20.920> for<00:01:20.979> over<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.940> month<00:01:22.210> now

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
has been going on for over a month now

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.020 
has been going on for over a month now
and<00:01:22.479> they<00:01:22.840> have<00:01:22.869> come<00:01:23.200> up<00:01:23.349> empty<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.190> far<00:01:24.489> so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
and they have come up empty so far so

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.940 
and they have come up empty so far so
the<00:01:25.119> investigators<00:01:25.750> are<00:01:25.959> hoping<00:01:26.020> that<00:01:26.590> the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
the investigators are hoping that the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.309 
the investigators are hoping that the
bluefin<00:01:27.369> 21<00:01:27.880> that's<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.780> water<00:01:29.020> right<00:01:29.289> now

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
bluefin 21 that's in the water right now

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:34.410 
bluefin 21 that's in the water right now
will<00:01:29.739> come<00:01:30.069> up<00:01:30.220> with<00:01:30.399> result<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.950> mh370<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
will come up with result of mh370 and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.419 
will come up with result of mh370 and
you<00:01:34.660> mentioned<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:35.110> bluefin<00:01:35.590> 21<00:01:36.130> which<00:01:36.280> is

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
you mentioned the bluefin 21 which is

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.520 
you mentioned the bluefin 21 which is
expected<00:01:36.819> to<00:01:37.119> end<00:01:37.300> its<00:01:37.569> underwater<00:01:37.989> scanning

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
expected to end its underwater scanning

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.469 
expected to end its underwater scanning
mission<00:01:38.800> this<00:01:38.920> week<00:01:38.979> so<00:01:39.729> our<00:01:39.910> investigators

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
mission this week so our investigators

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.180 
mission this week so our investigators
still<00:01:40.660> optimistic<00:01:41.020> that's<00:01:41.560> something<00:01:42.039> we'll

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
still optimistic that's something we'll

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.440 
still optimistic that's something we'll
be<00:01:42.280> found

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.840 

that's<00:01:50.079> right<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.590> bluefin<00:01:51.039> 21<00:01:51.490> has<00:01:51.700> been

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
that's right the bluefin 21 has been

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.510 
that's right the bluefin 21 has been
searching<00:01:52.180> this<00:01:52.329> priority<00:01:53.200> areas<00:01:53.799> that's

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
searching this priority areas that's

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.429 
searching this priority areas that's
this<00:01:54.880> four<00:01:55.240> points<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.960> Indian<00:01:56.229> Ocean

this four points in the Indian Ocean

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.980 
this four points in the Indian Ocean
they<00:01:56.860> have<00:01:56.950> detected<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.729> pings<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.869> they

mention they have searched the
two-thirds<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:12.010> underwater<00:02:12.519> area<00:02:13.060> this

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
two-thirds of this underwater area this

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.449 
two-thirds of this underwater area this
area<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.750> basically<00:02:14.200> determined<00:02:14.739> by<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
area is basically determined by the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.309 
area is basically determined by the
location<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.180> ping<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.720> they<00:02:17.049> draw<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
location of the ping and they draw a

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.589 
location of the ping and they draw a
10-kilometer<00:02:18.190> radius<00:02:18.220> around<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.360> that's

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
10-kilometer radius around and that's

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.660 
10-kilometer radius around and that's
where<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.019> bluefin<00:02:20.379> 21<00:02:20.799> is<00:02:20.920> looking<00:02:21.340> at<00:02:21.459> now

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
where the bluefin 21 is looking at now

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.600 
where the bluefin 21 is looking at now
it's<00:02:22.019> there<00:02:23.019> two<00:02:23.230> thirds<00:02:23.500> done<00:02:23.650> now<00:02:24.099> they're

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
it's there two thirds done now they're

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.820 
it's there two thirds done now they're
hoping<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.840> rest<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.410> search<00:02:26.590> area

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830
