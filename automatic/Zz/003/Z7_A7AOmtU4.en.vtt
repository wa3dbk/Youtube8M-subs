00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.369 

we're<00:00:05.490> talking<00:00:05.910> about<00:00:06.000> Dodge<00:00:06.540> control<00:00:07.049> arms

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
we're talking about Dodge control arms

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.129 
we're talking about Dodge control arms
and<00:00:07.620> why<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.280> should<00:00:08.700> pick<00:00:09.139> adjustable

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
and why you should pick adjustable

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.299 
and why you should pick adjustable
control<00:00:10.320> arms<00:00:10.980> over<00:00:11.880> fixed<00:00:12.269> control<00:00:12.690> arms

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
control arms over fixed control arms

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.609 
control arms over fixed control arms
here<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.639> an<00:00:14.940> example<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.020> fixed

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
here we have an example of a fixed

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.420 
here we have an example of a fixed
control<00:00:16.980> arm<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> Dodge<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:19.250> we<00:00:20.250> made

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
control arm for a Dodge and we made

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.310 
control arm for a Dodge and we made
these<00:00:20.609> because<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.600> lot<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.960> people<00:00:22.289> just

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
these because a lot of people just

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.439 
these because a lot of people just
wanted<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> replace<00:00:23.130> their<00:00:23.460> stock<00:00:23.880> control

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
wanted to replace their stock control

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.200 
wanted to replace their stock control
arms<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.050> they're<00:00:25.199> good<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
arms and they're good just for that the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.689 
arms and they're good just for that the
problem<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> lift<00:00:28.740> or<00:00:29.220> you

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
problem is is if you have a lift or you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.500 
problem is is if you have a lift or you
have<00:00:29.880> different<00:00:30.480> years<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:31.019> Dodge<00:00:31.610> trucks<00:00:32.610> and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
have different years of Dodge trucks and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.139 
have different years of Dodge trucks and
then<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.530> custom-make<00:00:34.950> these<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
then we have to custom-make these to the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.750 
then we have to custom-make these to the
measurements<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.870> want<00:00:37.399> we<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.579> make

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
measurements that you want we can make

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.799 
measurements that you want we can make
them<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.090> any<00:00:39.239> length<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:42.120> custom<00:00:42.629> make

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
them in any length and so we custom make

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.490 
them in any length and so we custom make
them<00:00:42.840> pretty<00:00:43.290> easily<00:00:43.579> but<00:00:44.579> they<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.789> take<00:00:45.120> time

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
them pretty easily but they do take time

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.299 
them pretty easily but they do take time
we<00:00:46.500> put<00:00:47.149> polyurethane<00:00:48.149> bushings<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.309> then

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
we put polyurethane bushings in and then

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.410 
we put polyurethane bushings in and then
they<00:00:50.520> come<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.149> steel<00:00:51.840> shims<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.850> shims<00:00:54.420> are

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
they come with steel shims the shims are

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.029 
they come with steel shims the shims are
what<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> bolts<00:00:58.100> go<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.510> the<00:01:00.800> shim<00:01:01.800> right

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
what the bolts go into the shim right

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.210 
what the bolts go into the shim right
there<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> older<00:01:03.510> Dodge<00:01:03.719> style<00:01:04.229> lower

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
there is for the older Dodge style lower

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.450 
there is for the older Dodge style lower
control<00:01:05.640> arm<00:01:06.049> this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> upper<00:01:07.920> control

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
control arm this is the upper control

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.859 
control arm this is the upper control
arm<00:01:09.180> bolt<00:01:09.860> shim<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.450> shim<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.400> for<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
arm bolt shim and this shim is for the

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.999 
arm bolt shim and this shim is for the
lower<00:01:15.869> control<00:01:16.500> arms<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> newer<00:01:17.820> dodges

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
lower control arms for the newer dodges

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.510 
lower control arms for the newer dodges
2002<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> above<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.369> we<00:01:23.369> have

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
2002 and above so as you can see we have

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.109 
2002 and above so as you can see we have
different<00:01:23.670> jams<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.200> different<00:01:25.619> sizes

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
different jams we have different sizes

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.980 
different jams we have different sizes
and<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.659> why<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> custom-make

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
and that is why we have to custom-make

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.969 
and that is why we have to custom-make
those<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:32.150> lot<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.299> those<00:01:33.420> asks<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
those and a lot of those asks just a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.840 
those and a lot of those asks just a

the bolts and that's the measurement we
need<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.719> make<00:01:57.930> your<00:01:58.140> fix<00:01:58.469> could<00:01:58.740> draw<00:01:58.979> arms

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
need to make your fix could draw arms
