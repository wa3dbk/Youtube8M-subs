and it's got of course mixed settings
where<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.189> might<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> matte<00:01:53.759> amount<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
where it might be the matte amount of

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.219 
where it might be the matte amount of
torque<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.750> doing<00:01:54.840> some<00:01:55.079> house

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
torque if you're just doing some house

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.170 
torque if you're just doing some house
mixing<00:01:55.680> or<00:01:55.799> whatnot<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:56.969> crank

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
mixing or whatnot and then you can crank

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
mixing or whatnot and then you can crank
up<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.509> torque<00:01:57.869> better<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.890> turntablism

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
up that torque better for turntablism

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.399 
up that torque better for turntablism
and<00:01:59.729> whatnot<00:02:00.030> also<00:02:00.810> has<00:02:00.960> break<00:02:01.170> speed

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
and whatnot also has break speed

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.260 
and whatnot also has break speed
adjustment<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.189> adjust<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.880> amount

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
adjustment so you can adjust the amount

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
adjustment so you can adjust the amount
of<00:02:03.659> time<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.200> takes<00:02:04.320> for<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> brake<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
of time that it takes for the brake to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.190 
of time that it takes for the brake to
turn<00:02:05.310> down<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> turntable<00:02:06.270> very<00:02:06.869> similar

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
turn down on the turntable very similar

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.380 
turn down on the turntable very similar
to<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> CDJ<00:02:08.039> from<00:02:08.340> pioneer<00:02:08.789> or<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.209> like

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
to like a CDJ from pioneer or like like

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.729 
to like a CDJ from pioneer or like like
the<00:02:09.509> Denon<00:02:09.810> CD<00:02:09.840> players<00:02:10.289> so

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
certainly an option that if I was still

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.850 
certainly an option that if I was still
