00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 and 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.700
 very good all kids welcome to 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.470
 a new video and today I'm going to start a 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.570
 kind of series that good will be a 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.830
 series itself but something like a 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.330
 section that I will access at when 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.800
 when I see a game that interests me 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.960
 a lot and that surely in the future 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.630
 to upload what will be what it is and in this 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.340
 case is online ortho online art is 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.710
 a game in development that would come to be 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.150
 something like a son between minecraft and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.440
 the massive role-playing games like goal of 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.610
 warcraft and walter to these things not the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.199
 thank you that game has a 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.720
 aesthetic and we skill very much like 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.339
 the one about minecraft, but how are you? 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.930
 seeing with a graphic section very very 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.940
 very very superior it looks even better than 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.320
 brands with the best shader and all that 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.360
 running a few frames from 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.600
 stable because michael is for this 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.979
 idea and telita the issue is that there is the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.390
 error part is telling us good 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.860
 I see here a lot appeared maika 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.049
 well the thing is that orton lines wat 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.780
 totally online as name indicates 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.339
 also and I do not know how many of one of the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.049
 millions of worlds that are generated at 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.659
 chance and there we can find others 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.299
 players 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.700
 besides that each game each player 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.579
 will have your group of skills races 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.569
 classes and all those things the title 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.310
 It also has a system of 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.630
 protection a clan system and a 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.549
 trading system that I will explain 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.799
 now for example on the one hand we can 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.859
 protect our areas or our 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.209
 creations using some beacons as well 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.380
 the areas also of our clan that 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.580
 then I will explain it a little more 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.260
 ahead 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.330
 what does that varicose vein do 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.160
 inside that area you can not destroy 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.240
 absolutely nothing something that after 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.190
 a little bit remains what I'm going to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.140
 comment with the plans is worth but 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.180
 We can create our own plan and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.180
 enter into a dispute with other plans like this 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.380
 as well as allying ourselves with the plans of 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.450
 the people with whom we get along 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.830
 We have another group of friends and they have their 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.260
 own field we can not help with 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.420
 they as rival clans can 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.100
 assault the area of the enemies and so 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.290
 also how is a world that is something of 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.479
 which I'll talk to you later but what 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.950
 sense would have to attack their world their 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.600
 creations if we're not going to get anything out 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.729
 change apart from trolling them for a while 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.470
 very simple as I said the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.690
 game also has a system of 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.830
 trade what does this mean that by 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.660
 example I'm going apprehensions europe that 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.670
 you understand to imagine that your 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.250
 find a world with a mineral that is 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.840
 super super super super wanted or a 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.730
 resource that looks much much more 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.860
 people and that is only found in that 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.600
 world where centered and that only 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.370
 find in that area where he leaves 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.560
 found then what do you guys do 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.830
 can you protect that area chop that 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.570
 mineral or let's say that collecting that 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.850
 resource and keep it to be able to draw 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.950
 more more more more and you can trade it 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.450
 with players from other worlds or what 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.709
 be in exchange for money and with that money 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.230
 Well, we can improve our clan 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.550
 improve your creation is your 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.620
 your castle whatever you have 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.150
 created as a clan or buy the equipment 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.800
 for your weapons character 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.170
 armor 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.400
 whatever skills I can even I can 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.170
 is saying good if it's just a world 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.570
 it's fine but it 's one of the worlds 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.830
 the thing is the first one a little bit in 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.360
 situation the thing is to talk to the 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.620
 creators of the game in fact I know 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.850
 that I am the first talking youtube 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.620
 Hispanic who has done it because they have 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.520
 said even them and they see things from 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.870
 access to what would be the version 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.880
 pre-alpha what are you going to see now 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.490
 background so they can show the how 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.170
 you see the game now as I said 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.760
 before starting we started in a world 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.000
 at random where we can meet for a 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.890
 lot of people who are in that world and 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.210
 there we can create our own 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.070
 things we will see also what to do 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.600
 others we can not create too 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.130
 portals to travel to other worlds what 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.570
 is what I am going to explain now, I 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.010
 example I started in this desert world 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.270
 where many the creators of the game already 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.420
 they had made their first creations 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.520
 but suddenly I found this 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.650
 is a portal that goes to another world if you 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.420
 you fix it does not have a loading screen nor 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.610
 absolutely nobody you can also see 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.530
 totally how is the world in time 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.850
 real through the portal itself 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.430
 public like the others the truth that is 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.630
 a hoot the effect it gives you is when 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.460
 you see it for the first time as if here 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.170
 last not because you had for another time 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.670
 as a profession or nothing is a window 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.980
 another site and the truth 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.510
 and at the end in that world when you enter 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.000
 totally different you can try 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.260
 creations of other material players 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.420
 that do not exist in the world that was 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.940
 before enemies and pets that were not 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.140
 where I was before and only clear is 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.670
 Do not wait with your arms 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.840
 open precisely but good 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.400
 things you can find in each 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.750
 mundane worlds of things that are not in 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.630
 the previous world what gives 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.799
 almost infinite possibilities to the game 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.419
 we can also find more 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.910
 portals either created by the players 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.290
 or hidden in mines caves where they are 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.300
 the portals are generated so many 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.830
 oneself as randomly or 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.680
 It is very good if you find a 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.060
 portal to protect those areas so that 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 nobody else can use it besides you can 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.210
 give privilege to who can use them 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.490
 and using a plan but being in class 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.419
 They are friends of yours, whatever I say 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.860
 the game possibilities are 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.139
 practically endless and its gameplay 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.370
 the truth we will direct the attention by 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.630
 the issue of how expensive the subject is 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.550
 prince man that is the protection of 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.440
 minecraft and apart a lot of things from 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.900
 role as the trading system the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.690
 clans the skills the classes that yes 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.820
 mounts mascots sea ​​has mogollón 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.860
 model of things that is currently in 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.300
 development is not yet finished and 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.590
 finances through crowdfunding to 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.310
 let them know what is working and I 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.500
 I explain 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.540
 cause is that the game is completed to 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.120
 through people investing 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.210
 in the game say for example you pay x 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.740
 euros and you will have the game when you go out 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.990
 more bonuses if you paid 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.540
 more or less and with that money as they 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.860
 end the game by the card this is 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.180
 does when a company that is creating 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.920
 a game does not have a company of 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.910
 distribution as for example activision 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.220
 or electronic to others 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.350
 'We wanted to get paid the game for later 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.610
 profit in this case in business 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.190
 independent as it was at the time 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.140
 they were moving with minecraft those of 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.120
 terrarium we know how she was independent 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.410
 today because there are millions from clear 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.850
 you can go paying the figure that you 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.640
 you already want to have some benefits and 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.440
 so start it stop the game that 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.210
 always be once it leaves and then 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.610
 would you for example if you pay a 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.170
 little more for you thanks to the beta and 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.180
 special items and pay a little more 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.250
 have access to the alpha and I do not know what 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.150
 bonus if you pay a little more has 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.770
 60 years ago 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.240
 in my case right now that I have access 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.490
 to what would be the fire tests the 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.900
 game that I took this is practically 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.240
 the only thing I'm going to bring the game when 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.800
 make a video this kind of what is 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.419
 and it's generally going to be a game that 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.830
 there's still a long way to go 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.270
 but in which I am pasta interests 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.250
 then it would bring that seville when 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.289
 come out the game would create more in this 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.720
 case as I have links in advance in the 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.479
 pre alpha likewise I will not bring it 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.099
 because it is in a very very very very state 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.630
 prematurely so much that he does not even have 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.490
 sound or to be played do not listen 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.509
 nothing but good I wanted to extract this 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.580
 game so that your pieces of 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.020
 subsistence since as I say has 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.729
 all the ballots being one of the 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.990
 most promising are yet to come so 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.910
 less for pc in the face of games 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.440
