00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.359
 in Spanish 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.769
 tropical medium rock automatically the 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.680
 people of the prestige relationship or 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.789
 because it is the first reference as well as 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.859
 a hare departure 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.660
 the sound here like he called me a lot 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.870
 the attention for the many for the first 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.510
 It was once that it sounded in English 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.160
 but in Spanish you know society if there 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.160
 been used in london singing in 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.079
 Spanish 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 that draws attention has said I suppose 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.620
 that people find a situation 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.900
 similar in buildings or in six rounds and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.340
 automatically returns to the first 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.660
 reference that they had that yes that is a 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.920
 but I really said that 200 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.809
 influence we do not have the service 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.850
 needing I think it's more of a 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.330
 need to categorize we have what 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.540
 you want is not like leaving yourself as such 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:10.090
 any rock with apply everything without 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.090
 However, if the agents back 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.520
 or 60 and he has always liked second 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.160
 as African and in the same way 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.450
 accompany that so that it sounds as 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.490
 suited to the music that are on the other 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.710
 for example hand challenges the rhythms 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.750
 22 on the drums I like to put some 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.750
 equal ladybugs and the guitar 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.580
 African as it pulls you towards a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.770
 side and on that subject on that line 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.610
 me since I started playing the drums 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.610
 as always 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.030
 how to try many types of rhythms 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.970
 different not only comments feels 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.790
 in taking covers of robbery code by can 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.550
 I always always wanted to experiment and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.120
 he played samba rhythms from Mozambique 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.390
 songo is a Cuban cumbia salsa cha 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.640
 all because as always I know how 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.160
 was to play as it sounded then 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.940
 when they arrive incised and we see that it is 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:13.290
 as one is a more tropical sound 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.070
 more dancer as more African then yes 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.100
 when we started the orchards I say the 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.560
 put the rings and that it was like a 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.860
 abyss and quick to see it like that 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.280
 transmit that need to dance a 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.280
 Energy 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.060
 because I lived in Boston when I started 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.370
 do those songs then one day 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.250
 I was in Mexico and a northern 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.739
 those of weather phenomenon then 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.349
 like I wanted the record to have that 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.519
 same feeling of being on point 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.220
 veracruz and that the north then as a 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.319
 arch that the reference to be in a 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.900
 place to wish with tropical and that of 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.740
 suddenly that bridge is annular and it rains 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.890
 been very 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.100
 at random or in summer we recorded as 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.730
 about 7 songs of which only 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.040
 we have used 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.200
 berlin and one that we draw from the cloud that 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.730
 we give them a port and the others and 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.010
 I have a video saved and there are some that 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.230
 we no longer like others so much that 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.750
 let's mix better with more things 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.220
 re-record other things suddenly we did 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.690
 more songs and we're going to record them to 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.000
 blue sheep penalties recorded what 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.790
 we talked sometimes that you are not going to 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.390
 be more common 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.319
 collection of songs more than anything 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.319
 with this 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.290
 of the songs 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.160
 with archive recordings and things that 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.680
 do not 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.050
 if you're thinking it started happening to the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.620
 call it north two- point recordings 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.430
 of music 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.430
 plus 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:09.200
 It's very funny because even the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:14.990
 big festivals the big ones and girls 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.990
 of the band has dominated youtube already 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.329
 that this festival 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.660
 as there are as many places as you have 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.889
 the opportunity to know things that I 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.889
 I had not known the disorder 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.050
 it's one more 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.350
 not even find on the internet the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.350
 trick 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:58.179
 a greeting thank you very much for inviting us 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:59.039
 of the festival let's hope that all the 

00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:02.939
 we had a great time 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.939
