00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 in this class I will teach a trick of 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.660
 mix to achieve surround guitars 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.309
 this is useful when we have only one shot 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.830
 of our guitar and we want to give it a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.990
 stereo effect for this suit example 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.469
 the next electric guitar 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.469
 Y 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.840
 the first step will be to duplicate our 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.560
 guitar track with right button 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.800
 double tracks then let's kick the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.290
 guitar to one side 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.900
 and the copy of the guitar to the other 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.300
 and now let's use the track delay 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.400
 in milliseconds this what it does is 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.200
 delay the track in this case we have 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.240
 a guitar to the left and another to the 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.110
 right and we're going to delay one of the 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.450
 two 10 to 30 milliseconds 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.650
 in this case I'm going to use 20 milliseconds 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.650
 which is an appropriate value 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.910
 as you will have noticed the guitars now 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.670
 sound stereo 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.620
 sound sideways let's see a 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.440
 example of this effect applied to a 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.580
 song suit two tracks the first one is 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.580
 without the added effect 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.600
 and now let's compare it with the same 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.410
 track with the added effect so that 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.410
 notice the difference 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.490
 as you will have noticed the mix now sounds 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.020
 much more open I hope that this 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.670
 trick them serve see you in the next 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.670
