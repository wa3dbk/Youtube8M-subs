ten days we're gonna check it around

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.200 
ten days we're gonna check it around
here<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.349> streets<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.309> usually<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.850> test

her out see what we like about it see
what<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:34.950> dislike<00:00:35.309> about<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.270> report<00:00:36.780> back

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
what we dislike about it and report back

00:00:36.809 --> 00:01:12.539 
what we dislike about it and report back
to<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.110> guys

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.849 

is<00:01:13.549> based<00:01:13.819> off<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.119> Honda<00:01:14.929> Super<00:01:15.229> Cub<00:01:15.259> the

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
is based off the Honda Super Cub the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.399 
is based off the Honda Super Cub the
most<00:01:16.399> produced<00:01:16.700> motorcycle<00:01:17.299> ever<00:01:17.509> made<00:01:17.869> I

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
most produced motorcycle ever made I

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.770 
most produced motorcycle ever made I
think<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.159> somewhere<00:01:19.490> around<00:01:19.670> 60<00:01:20.329> or<00:01:20.450> 70

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
think it's somewhere around 60 or 70

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.319 
think it's somewhere around 60 or 70
million<00:01:21.109> super<00:01:21.649> Cubs<00:01:21.859> were<00:01:22.609> built<00:01:22.850> and

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
million super Cubs were built and

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.559 
million super Cubs were built and
actually<00:01:23.920> Sim<00:01:24.920> has<00:01:25.399> been<00:01:25.670> building<00:01:26.119> onto

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569 
actually Sim has been building onto

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.949 
actually Sim has been building onto
Super<00:01:27.170> Cub<00:01:27.350> formed<00:01:27.740> for<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:27.979> past<00:01:28.810> number<00:01:29.810> of

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
Super Cub formed for the past number of

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.899 
Super Cub formed for the past number of
decades<00:01:30.049> a<00:01:30.560> long<00:01:30.740> time<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.280> they<00:01:31.609> know<00:01:31.759> about

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
decades a long time so they know about

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.059 
decades a long time so they know about
the<00:01:32.149> Super<00:01:32.420> Cub<00:01:32.599> and<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.229> translates<00:01:33.709> well<00:01:33.920> in

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
the Super Cub and it translates well in

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.249 
the Super Cub and it translates well in
this<00:01:34.189> model<00:01:34.579> on<00:01:34.849> the<00:01:35.209> road<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.689> bike<00:01:35.869> was

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
this model on the road the bike was

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.109 
this model on the road the bike was
really<00:01:36.920> fun<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.280> ride

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
really fun to ride

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.649 
really fun to ride
it<00:01:39.109> was<00:01:39.409> very<00:01:40.009> very<00:01:40.310> stable<00:01:40.609> and<00:01:41.000> compared<00:01:41.359> to

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
it was very very stable and compared to

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.959 
it was very very stable and compared to
a<00:01:41.869> rigid<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.649> original<00:01:43.159> Super<00:01:43.489> Cub

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
a rigid the original Super Cub

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.059 
a rigid the original Super Cub
so<00:01:44.119> Sims<00:01:44.899> come<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.170> long<00:01:45.379> way<00:01:45.590> with<00:01:45.799> their

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
so Sims come a long way with their

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.449 
so Sims come a long way with their
chassis<00:01:46.640> design<00:01:46.969> and<00:01:47.799> also<00:01:48.799> when<00:01:49.009> compared<00:01:49.369> to

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
chassis design and also when compared to

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.219 
chassis design and also when compared to
10<00:01:50.000> or<00:01:50.090> 12<00:01:50.299> inch<00:01:50.479> scooter<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:50.899> a<00:01:50.929> lot<00:01:51.110> more

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
10 or 12 inch scooter it's a lot more

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.749 
10 or 12 inch scooter it's a lot more
stable<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.860> corners<00:01:52.219> and<00:01:52.369> one<00:01:52.489> of<00:01:52.610> those

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
stable in the corners and one of those

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.479 
stable in the corners and one of those
would<00:01:53.539> be<00:01:54.099> also<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:56.479> clutch<00:01:56.869> was<00:01:57.590> very<00:01:58.250> very

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
would be also the clutch was very very

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.199 
would be also the clutch was very very
smooth<00:02:00.340> obviously<00:02:01.340> there's<00:02:01.520> no<00:02:01.729> manual

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
smooth obviously there's no manual

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.819 
smooth obviously there's no manual
clutch<00:02:02.420> here<00:02:02.689> it's<00:02:02.840> an<00:02:02.929> Auto<00:02:03.109> clutch<00:02:03.469> inside

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
clutch here it's an Auto clutch inside

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.859 
clutch here it's an Auto clutch inside
the<00:02:03.950> engine<00:02:04.099> so<00:02:04.849> all<00:02:04.969> you<00:02:05.060> have<00:02:05.209> to<00:02:05.359> do<00:02:05.509> is

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
the engine so all you have to do is

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.899 
the engine so all you have to do is
switch<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.679> gears<00:02:07.099> and<00:02:07.280> automatically

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
switch the gears and automatically

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.779 
switch the gears and automatically
engages<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.450> disengages<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.109> clutch<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:10.640> was

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
engages and disengages the clutch it was

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.080 
engages and disengages the clutch it was
very<00:02:11.030> smooth<00:02:11.390> easy<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.019> shift<00:02:12.260> through<00:02:12.620> and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
very smooth easy to shift through and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.979 
very smooth easy to shift through and
overall<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> didn't<00:02:14.329> have<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.480> think<00:02:14.540> about<00:02:14.870> it

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
overall I didn't have to think about it

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.030 
overall I didn't have to think about it
which<00:02:15.079> means<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.530> was<00:02:15.620> working<00:02:15.950> really

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
which means that it was working really

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.470 
which means that it was working really
well

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
well

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.170 
well
brakes<00:02:17.959> wise<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:18.500> bike<00:02:18.739> is<00:02:19.040> really<00:02:20.000> really

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
brakes wise this bike is really really

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.289 
brakes wise this bike is really really
good<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.720> know<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.930> lot<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.680> people<00:02:22.069> when<00:02:23.060> they

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
good I know a lot of people when they

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.300 
good I know a lot of people when they
look<00:02:24.109> at<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.319> bike<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.160> see<00:02:25.280> that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
look at a bike like this and see that

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.860 
look at a bike like this and see that
it's<00:02:25.549> got<00:02:25.639> drums<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.239> both<00:02:26.419> ends<00:02:26.750> they're

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
it's got drums on both ends they're

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.870 
it's got drums on both ends they're
automatically<00:02:27.440> going<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.680> assume<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
automatically going to assume that the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.510 
automatically going to assume that the
stopping<00:02:29.269> power<00:02:29.419> is<00:02:29.569> not<00:02:29.720> going<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.930> be

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
stopping power is not going to be

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.700 
stopping power is not going to be
but<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.210> this<00:02:31.330> case<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.780> drums<00:02:32.050> work<00:02:32.320> really

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
but in this case the drums work really

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.090 
but in this case the drums work really
really<00:02:32.830> well<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:34.330> would<00:02:34.840> even<00:02:34.930> say<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.770> you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
really well I would even say that you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.890 
really well I would even say that you
know<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.670> chassis<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.270> really<00:02:37.540> good<00:02:37.690> the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
know the chassis is really good the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.510 
know the chassis is really good the
brakes<00:02:38.140> are<00:02:38.290> really<00:02:38.410> good<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.920> only<00:02:39.040> limiting

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
brakes are really good the only limiting

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.670 
brakes are really good the only limiting
thing<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:39.940> bike<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:41.080> engine<00:02:41.440> at<00:02:41.560> this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
thing to this bike is the engine at this

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.330 
thing to this bike is the engine at this
point<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:43.420> get<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.690> easily<00:02:43.870> throw<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.410> 150<00:02:45.040> cc

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
point you get to easily throw in 150 cc

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.620 
point you get to easily throw in 150 cc
engine<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.880> think<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.150> chassis<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
engine and I think the chassis and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:04:01.470
