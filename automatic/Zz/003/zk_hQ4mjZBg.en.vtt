00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.670 

and<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:10.610> made<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.209> bit<00:02:12.420> faster<00:02:12.930> but

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and I made this a little bit faster but

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.620 
and I made this a little bit faster but
it<00:02:13.860> literally<00:02:14.160> took<00:02:14.520> me<00:02:14.730> under<00:02:14.880> 10<00:02:15.150> minutes<00:02:15.270> to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
it literally took me under 10 minutes to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.250 
it literally took me under 10 minutes to
strain<00:02:16.020> my<00:02:16.050> entire<00:02:16.500> head<00:02:16.709> of<00:02:16.860> hair<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:21.260> then

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
strain my entire head of hair and then

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.670 
strain my entire head of hair and then
if<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.470> see<00:02:22.709> with<00:02:22.920> my<00:02:23.130> left<00:02:23.730> hand<00:02:23.850> I'm<00:02:24.360> holding

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
if you see with my left hand I'm holding

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.650 
if you see with my left hand I'm holding
the<00:02:25.680> top<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.670> strainer<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.390> kind<00:02:27.600> of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the top of the strainer and I'm kind of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.840 
the top of the strainer and I'm kind of
tightening<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.350> while<00:02:28.739> I'm<00:02:29.010> going<00:02:29.340> down<00:02:29.550> and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
tightening it while I'm going down and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.970 
tightening it while I'm going down and
that<00:02:30.540> makes<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.020> little<00:02:31.290> bit<00:02:31.500> more<00:02:31.650> Schrader

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that makes it a little bit more Schrader

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.150 
that makes it a little bit more Schrader
I've<00:02:32.940> noticed<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.470> now<00:02:34.590> I'm<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:34.830> doing<00:02:35.069> the
