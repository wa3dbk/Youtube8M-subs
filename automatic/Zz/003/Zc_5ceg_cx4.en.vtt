00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
boost we've

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.920 
boost we've
combined<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:10.040> hearing<00:04:10.430> profile<00:04:11.000> D<00:04:11.600> for<00:04:11.900> example

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
combined a hearing profile D for example

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.530 
combined a hearing profile D for example
and<00:04:12.560> further<00:04:13.280> added<00:04:13.700> increased<00:04:14.180> speech

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
and further added increased speech

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.069 
and further added increased speech
intelligibility<00:04:14.840> on<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:16.040> that

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
intelligibility on to that

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.399 
intelligibility on to that
so<00:04:18.889> much<00:04:19.099> for<00:04:19.430> speech<00:04:19.699> boost<00:04:20.030> now<00:04:20.810> let's<00:04:21.139> say
