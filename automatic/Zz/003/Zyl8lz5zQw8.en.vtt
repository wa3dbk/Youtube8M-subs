will<00:00:35.489> probably<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:35.969> fingerprints<00:00:36.570> when

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
will probably get fingerprints when

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.369 
will probably get fingerprints when
attaching<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.160> detaching<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.790> lenses<00:00:39.149> so

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
them I mean damp it in some hot water

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.229 
them I mean damp it in some hot water
just<00:00:51.629> slightly<00:00:52.320> damp<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> let's<00:00:54.000> get<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
just slightly damp it so let's get to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.279 
just slightly damp it so let's get to
work<00:00:55.190> okay<00:00:56.190> 2d<00:00:56.640> attached<00:00:58.399> pinch<00:00:59.960> pinch<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
work okay 2d attached pinch pinch this

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.640 
work okay 2d attached pinch pinch this
right<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.449> inwards<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:06.530> see<00:01:07.530> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
right here inwards and so you see this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.440 
right here inwards and so you see this
is<00:01:07.830> normal<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.689> pinch<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.800 

until<00:01:17.450> it's<00:01:17.630> out<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.610> way<00:01:19.760> now<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:20.540> pull

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
until it's out of the way now just pull

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:29.400 
until it's out of the way now just pull
down<00:01:20.840> from<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:22.310> top<00:01:24.850> it's<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.910> little<00:01:25.940> hard

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.360 

it's<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.560> little<00:01:30.770> different<00:01:31.130> from<00:01:31.190> their

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
it's a little different from their

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.620 
it's a little different from their
directions<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:31.970> I<00:01:32.000> find<00:01:32.270> this<00:01:32.330> to<00:01:32.510> be<00:01:32.540> the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
directions but I find this to be the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:41.110 
directions but I find this to be the
easiest<00:01:34.180> sometimes<00:01:35.830> okay<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:36.920> it's<00:01:37.040> up<00:01:40.120> so

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
easiest sometimes okay and it's up so

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.480 
easiest sometimes okay and it's up so
here<00:01:41.360> are<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.570> frames<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.790> really<00:01:45.490> really

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
late very late just an anatomy and file

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:59.170 
late very late just an anatomy and file
the<00:01:51.290> frames<00:01:51.770> look<00:01:52.009> without<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.810> lenses

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:10.010 

see<00:02:00.140> if<00:02:00.230> I<00:02:00.320> can<00:02:00.440> focus<00:02:00.680> this

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.940 

okay<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.250> let's<00:02:11.430> install<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> frames<00:02:12.030> now

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
I'll just use the exact same frame so

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.090 
I'll just use the exact same frame so
first<00:02:17.630> attach<00:02:18.630> it

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:33.770 

to<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.090> right<00:02:23.240> side<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.410> frame

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
firmly around until this fits inside the

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:57.530 
firmly around until this fits inside the
