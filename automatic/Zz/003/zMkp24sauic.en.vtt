00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
is kind of comparable to the bobby boss

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.360 
is kind of comparable to the bobby boss
hair<00:02:40.300> by<00:02:41.300> boss<00:02:41.600> straight<00:02:42.320> Jackie<00:02:42.950> whatever

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
hair by boss straight Jackie whatever

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.420 
hair by boss straight Jackie whatever
it's<00:02:43.550> called<00:02:43.790> hair<00:02:44.890> yeah<00:02:45.890> they're<00:02:46.190> pretty

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
it's called hair yeah they're pretty

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's called hair yeah they're pretty
much<00:02:46.670> like<00:02:46.730> almost<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.390> same<00:02:47.600> but<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.350> think

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
much like almost the same but I think

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.230 
much like almost the same but I think
this<00:02:48.830> one<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.220> little<00:02:49.340> bit<00:02:49.550> better<00:02:49.730> for

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
this one is a little bit better for

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.040 
this one is a little bit better for
straight<00:02:51.100> so<00:02:52.330> compared<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.720> volleyball

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
straight so compared to the volleyball

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.380 
straight so compared to the volleyball
hair<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.830> hair<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:55.640> straight<00:02:56.000> one<00:02:56.210> I

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
hair in this hair the straight one I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.130 
hair in this hair the straight one I
think<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.170> cuticle<00:02:57.560> army<00:02:57.740> is<00:02:57.830> better<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:59.630> does

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
think the cuticle army is better it does

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.930 
think the cuticle army is better it does
shed<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:01.070> little<00:03:01.190> bit<00:03:01.540> when<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.570> comb<00:03:02.960> it<00:03:02.990> I<00:03:03.940> was

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
shed a little bit when I comb it I was

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.070 
shed a little bit when I comb it I was
cutting<00:03:05.120> my<00:03:05.209> hair<00:03:05.330> in<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.480> bathroom

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
cutting my hair in the bathroom

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.229 
cutting my hair in the bathroom
I<00:03:06.290> have<00:03:06.650> white<00:03:06.860> tie<00:03:07.100> on<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.400> floor<00:03:07.640> so<00:03:08.000> I

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
I have white tie on the floor so I

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.479 
I have white tie on the floor so I
noticed<00:03:09.050> like<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.620> hair<00:03:09.860> was<00:03:10.040> on<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.280> floor

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
noticed like the hair was on the floor

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.510 
noticed like the hair was on the floor
so<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.360> does<00:03:11.540> shed<00:03:11.840> which<00:03:12.470> all<00:03:12.680> hair<00:03:12.950> usually
