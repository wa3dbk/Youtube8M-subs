00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
this gun is very effective it's very

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.109 
this gun is very effective it's very
good<00:00:25.680> for<00:00:25.740> getting<00:00:25.980> chem<00:00:26.310> strikes<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.970> high

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
good for getting chem strikes and high

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.880 
good for getting chem strikes and high
kill<00:00:27.390> gameplays<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.650> stuff

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
kill gameplays all that kind of stuff

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.849 
kill gameplays all that kind of stuff
it's<00:00:29.789> very<00:00:30.179> powerful<00:00:30.449> at<00:00:31.349> some<00:00:31.529> points

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
it's very powerful at some points

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.459 
it's very powerful at some points
overused<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.239> ok<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.809> guess<00:00:34.200> there's<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
overused but that's ok I guess there's a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.680 
overused but that's ok I guess there's a
reason<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.460> especially<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:36.630> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
reason for that and especially when you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.020 
reason for that and especially when you
put<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.079> right<00:00:37.290> setup<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.280> gun<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.969> just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
put the right setup to this gun it just

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.090 
put the right setup to this gun it just
makes<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> gun<00:00:39.540> ten<00:00:39.780> times<00:00:40.020> better<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.800> if

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
makes the gun ten times better so if

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.319 
makes the gun ten times better so if
you're<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.340> using<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.760> set<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.180> would

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
you're not using this set up I would

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.170 
you're not using this set up I would
highly<00:00:42.629> recommend<00:00:43.610> switching<00:00:44.610> some<00:00:44.940> things

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
highly recommend switching some things

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060 
highly recommend switching some things

more<00:01:02.850> passively<00:01:03.239> not<00:01:03.449> camping<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> little

recommend<00:01:06.630> using<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.140> gun<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.619> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

shouting drop shotting
all<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.520> stuff<00:01:14.840> with<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.990> gun<00:01:16.170> so

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
all that kind of stuff with this gun so

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.030 
all that kind of stuff with this gun so
let's<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.830> ahead<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.369> into<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
let's go ahead and get right into it

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.830 
let's go ahead and get right into it
so<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.700> attachments<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.360> am<00:01:21.479> using<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
so for my attachments I am using the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.170 
so for my attachments I am using the
foregrip<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:22.619> obviously<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:23.759> good

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
foregrip which obviously is very good

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
foregrip which obviously is very good
with<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.450> weapon<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.990> does<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> little

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
with this weapon it does have a little

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.710 
with this weapon it does have a little
bit<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.130> recoil<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> fore<00:01:27.150> grip<00:01:27.330> helps

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
bit of recoil and the fore grip helps

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.300 
bit of recoil and the fore grip helps
with<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> would<00:01:28.320> highly<00:01:28.710> recommend<00:01:28.740> using

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
with that I would highly recommend using

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
with that I would highly recommend using
it<00:01:29.549> basically<00:01:30.090> turns<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.450> gun<00:01:30.659> into<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.290> laser

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
it basically turns this gun into a laser

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.800 
it basically turns this gun into a laser
beam<00:01:31.860> very<00:01:32.460> effective<00:01:33.030> definitely<00:01:33.689> use<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
beam very effective definitely use that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.830 
beam very effective definitely use that
the<00:01:34.560> second<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> muzzle<00:01:35.759> brake<00:01:35.970> obviously

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the second is the muzzle brake obviously

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
the second is the muzzle brake obviously
this<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.020> increases<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.590> damage<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.070> longer

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
this just increases the damage at longer

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280 
this just increases the damage at longer
ranges<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.750> got<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> extra

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
ranges so you know you got the extra

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.289 
ranges so you know you got the extra
damage<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.680> got<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> extra<00:01:41.130> range<00:01:41.310> very<00:01:42.030> good

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
damage you got the extra range very good

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.060 
damage you got the extra range very good
I<00:01:42.540> wouldn't<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.290> use<00:01:43.500> anything<00:01:43.770> else

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
I wouldn't really use anything else

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.399 
I wouldn't really use anything else
besides<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:45.060> you're<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.200> if

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
besides this if you're you know if

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.609 
besides this if you're you know if
you're<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.070> insist<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.880> use<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.299> silencer

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
you're if you insist to use the silencer

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.899 
you're if you insist to use the silencer
to<00:01:49.619> stay<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> radar<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.729> going

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
to stay off the radar and you're going

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.280 
to stay off the radar and you're going
for<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.119> Kem<00:01:51.299> strike<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> double<00:01:51.990> Kem<00:01:52.170> strike

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
for a Kem strike or a double Kem strike

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.120 
for a Kem strike or a double Kem strike
then<00:01:53.070> obviously<00:01:53.490> use<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> silencer<00:01:54.390> but

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
then obviously use the silencer but

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
then obviously use the silencer but
really<00:01:56.130> anything<00:01:56.549> else<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.299> needed<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
really anything else is not needed I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.230 
really anything else is not needed I
mean<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> guess<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.070> could<00:01:59.310> use<00:01:59.340> extended

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
that will change for some of them are

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.000 
that will change for some of them are
the<00:02:41.340> attachments<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.120> sometimes<00:02:42.719> a<00:02:43.019> perk<00:02:43.439> but

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
for the most part all SMGs do run a very

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.059 
for the most part all SMGs do run a very
similar<00:02:47.609> setup<00:02:48.389> but<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.439> said<00:02:49.500> some<00:02:49.950> of

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
similar setup but like I said some of

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.500 
similar setup but like I said some of
them<00:02:50.159> do<00:02:50.340> have<00:02:50.370> certain<00:02:50.969> things<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.389> got

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
to change out but in this case that

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.670 
to change out but in this case that
sounds<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.269> amplify<00:02:54.810> are<00:02:54.989> pretty<00:02:55.199> much<00:02:55.319> perks

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
sounds in amplify are pretty much perks

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.379 
sounds in amplify are pretty much perks

area that's just something I like to use
it's<00:03:43.500> very<00:03:43.680> effective<00:03:43.919> but<00:03:44.729> this<00:03:45.030> is

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
it's very effective but this is

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.240 
it's very effective but this is

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
definitely a perk that can be you switch

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.520 
definitely a perk that can be you switch
down<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.459> something<00:03:47.970> else<00:03:48.269> like<00:03:48.840> maybe<00:03:48.870> steady

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
down to something else like maybe steady

down to something else like maybe steady
aim<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.889> really<00:03:50.129> wanted<00:03:50.599> but<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.959> don't

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:52.259

would allow you to get your quick-draw

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.589 
would allow you to get your quick-draw
one<00:04:28.630> less<00:04:28.840> at<00:04:29.259> one<00:04:29.530> less<00:04:29.680> kill<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.509> know

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
one less at one less kill but you know

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:32.999 
one less at one less kill but you know
it<00:04:31.660> really<00:04:31.780> doesn't<00:04:32.139> matter<00:04:32.259> it's<00:04:32.740> not<00:04:32.800> that

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
it really doesn't matter it's not that

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.339 
it really doesn't matter it's not that
big<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.400> deal<00:04:33.580> so<00:04:33.789> this<00:04:34.660> is<00:04:34.720> pretty<00:04:35.020> much<00:04:35.199> the

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
big of a deal so this is pretty much the

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:36.809 
big of a deal so this is pretty much the
loadout<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.800> want<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.069> have<00:04:36.250> leading<00:04:36.699> up<00:04:36.789> to

loadout you want to have leading up to
your<00:04:37.060> bonus<00:04:37.509> scavenger<00:04:38.470> obviously<00:04:38.889> allows

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
your bonus scavenger obviously allows

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.499 
your bonus scavenger obviously allows
you<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.280> replenish<00:04:39.550> your<00:04:39.789> ammo<00:04:40.150> before<00:04:40.419> you

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
you to replenish your ammo before you

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.999 
you to replenish your ammo before you
run<00:04:40.750> out<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:40.930> definitely<00:04:41.289> don't<00:04:41.680> want<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.860> run

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
run out you definitely don't want to run

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.020 
run out you definitely don't want to run
out<00:04:42.099> for<00:04:42.310> ammo

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
out for ammo

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.300 
out for ammo
in<00:04:43.300> any<00:04:43.569> case<00:04:43.840> especially<00:04:44.380> for<00:04:44.620> chem<00:04:44.949> strikes

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
in any case especially for chem strikes

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.850 
in any case especially for chem strikes
and<00:04:45.690> then<00:04:46.690> for<00:04:47.020> quick-draw<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:47.470> just<00:04:47.650> allows

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
and then for quick-draw it just allows

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.760 
and then for quick-draw it just allows
you<00:04:48.039> to<00:04:48.220> aim<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.669> with<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.360> mtar<00:04:49.750> my<00:04:49.990> god<00:04:50.289> it<00:04:50.590> is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
you to aim in with the mtar my god it is

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.460 
you to aim in with the mtar my god it is
so<00:04:50.819> effective<00:04:51.819> it<00:04:51.940> is<00:04:51.970> very<00:04:52.419> very<00:04:52.720> powerful<00:04:53.319> on

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
so effective it is very very powerful on

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.860 
so effective it is very very powerful on
the<00:04:53.680> mtar<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.430> highly<00:04:55.090> recommend<00:04:55.569> using

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
the mtar I highly recommend using

we are using it right before a bonus so
the<00:05:10.000> main<00:05:10.150> point<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:10.479> this<00:05:10.599> is<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:10.930> get<00:05:11.020> your

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
not really going for Kem strikes then

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.670 
not really going for Kem strikes then
you<00:05:15.669> don't<00:05:15.849> really<00:05:15.970> need<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.319> and<00:05:17.319> also<00:05:17.590> those
