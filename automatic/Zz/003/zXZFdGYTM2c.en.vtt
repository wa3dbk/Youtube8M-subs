00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.290
 g then at this point with the pantyhose constantant ask for verona purifier 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.410
 this mastodon where we are at the bottom of my heart and I am responsible 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.049
 operative we try and understand so much for what is happening here that structures 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.980
 this then in this moment we find ourselves in the part we say entry 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.030
 plant 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.330
 It consists of between collectors 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.750
 one that we see raised and two other collectors that travel below 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 the soil that feeds the entrance to the plant is the reed 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.330
 the whole series of direct implementation of and the fact of civilian discharges 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.630
 hey of the industrial discharges of the city of verona and also of some 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.820
 towns near the city 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.380
 some numbers some data 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.050
 then the plant was designed for a potential of 410 thousand 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.600
 equivalent inhabitants 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.850
 and the treatment capacity is about 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.550
 humble hotel liters per second 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.020
 what happens in practice when we have some discharges 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.870
 from the sink in short, night with h 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.930
 and the water is that we unload sink anyway it comes 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.730
 and also from industrial discharges that are above all and if treated then it comes 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.420
 pie the whole part and let's say sandy sediment and dignity de-oiler 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.320
 that is therefore all the part that remains in suspension nl 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.859
 in those elected by some it is created inside the plant 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.189
 before continuing our journey of knowledge in the purifier sector 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.189
 Verona waters below we look at the word the vice president 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.890
 giovanni milazzo 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.729
 a cover meses después esse sabado purifiers throughout the province 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.590
 surely this is the most important one of verona that pathos 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.689
 had the neighboring municipalities as grezzana negrar a buttapietra 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.010
 ah coronese makes important investments on the purifier because I recommend one 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.050
 extremely important thing and purify the water take it clean for 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.380
 then to give back to nature the investments are huge and this 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.270
 it allows to improve the quality of the water respectively 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.919
 here we are in the heart of the purifier 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.769
 we are in the oxidation tank love biological actor 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.839
 which practically allows 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:29.020
 and reduce about 90% of the organic substance 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.879
 and 80% 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.120
 of nutrients that are contained in the discharge waters 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.499
 now we are in the final phase of purification clarification 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.880
 that phase which separates from the discharge side 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.880
 the biomass that is sent to digestion 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:52.369
 now we find ourselves in the discharge phase that this case is the river alice 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.780
 and it is at this point that with our friend donated martinelli always in 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.070
 company of the guardian angels of Verona waters 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.709
 we ask then donated but 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.969
 water even once 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.649
 but what destiny is exactly what fate follows 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.619
 here I would say that we can already materially see what the destiny is 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.349
 of this one 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.779
 and above all or this 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.939
 artificial torrent so it can define you gives the idea of ​​the entity of the 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.549
 episode of this mass 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.930
 destiny has the bise the receptor water body is the say I see a mass 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.739
 very important bacon 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.909
 in this phase the water must have characteristics of lincei before 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.009
 to be entered 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.149
 purified water 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.809
 common as few pollutants as possible 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.579
 aspect is of the greatest importance because 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.019
 how true it is that a thing brought so far dilutes this 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.119
 flow 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:55.939
 we know that surface water can in turn be used in Cusco 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:56.990
 pious vvi 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.150
 therefore liquidated must be reduced to a minimum and for polluting fish metals 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.809
 heavy also I think a biological aspect of the boat and so on 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.819
 however, here at characteristics of success we say and can actually be 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.399
 released on our Po valley at the end the real last ring in a few 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:15.269
 words no 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.470
 I would say yes 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.540
 spiriva I had because the next phase he takes up the ring 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.110
 water evaporation 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.780
 the evaporation then condensation is in the form and the cycle of the excursion e 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.240
 resumes the door as I am. while we will shortly give you an appointment for a 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.009
 another important segment of the large purifier here in the lower aquar in Verona 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.589
 we hear the second part of the interview of Genoese tooth of 

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:44.629
 Veronese waters Giovanni Miozzi 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.819
 investment in the south offers people green results 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.059
 important 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:54.479
 we can't save something like 600 thousand euros in the Verona plants 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.269
 precisely this and in that of the summery alt investment of 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:02.289
 pungent purifiers will also be made in the neighboring municipalities 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.539
 san bonifacio column 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.499
 iris and remote save something like 100 thousand euros a year 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:13.490
 these interventions of ours are the subject of study at the Italian level because only 

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:17.169
 the first time that steps are taken as can be seen of fools excellent from 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.689
 economic points of view and therefore 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:21.360
 we can spam our citizens 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.349
 at this point we can only talk about energy production no 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.260
 exactly we are in the area 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.950
 where digestion and anaerobic are permitting. through 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.940
 these digestion the production of tyffany biogas that have been recovered 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.180
 during the waste processing cycle 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.470
 then 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.140
 who is the final phase. that of electricity and heat production 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.940
 through the aid of a con generazione tower that allows 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.199
 hippie cars support themselves at the sewage treatment plant for about 50% of its own 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.469
 energy requirements
