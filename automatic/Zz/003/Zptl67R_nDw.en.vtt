00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 I show you today like a whole 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.349
 crochet simple leaf I could start 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.860
 with a knot and make 9 air 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.860
 mesh 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.020
 I have nine air I leave the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.730
 first off and make in the upper limb 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.330
 a solid mesh 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 in the next upper limb one more 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.130
 firm mesh in the next upper goes 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.140
 half a stick 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.440
 So I'll go get him and he was through 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.060
 all three then a whole town 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.730
 get into the next limb thread still 22 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.880
 then the next one is still a whole 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880
 little town 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.230
 in the next limb still a whole 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.230
 little town 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.010
 in the next half a stick 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.130
 and in the last you make several 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.190
 half sticks 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.020
 I guess we'll be five 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.620
 have beautiful come to the round 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.620
 2 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.920
 3 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 like here 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.880
 and 5 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.770
 yes I think I'm halfway and round 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.770
 come 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.060
 we are so threads crosswise and this 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.390
 cross threads we would have further in the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.819
 first cross verden there is still one 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.530
 half a stick in the next one 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.860
 whole city again by two 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:10.560
 and again through two then another 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.720
 whole piece a trip the whole 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:20.610
 chopsticks in the next limb of course 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:25.500
 Always half a stick in 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.700
 the next limb into the next one 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.329
 firm mesh and then one more is good 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.099
 Visible there we make a chain 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:40.140
 Masche and I were completely in again 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:50.280
 the tip in there I do one too 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:56.280
 chain stitch then 12 air stitches and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.780
 stab again and join in 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.959
 a chain stitch 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.329
 Now I'll get the thread on the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.139
 rear side and can be the threads of 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:12.049

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.049
