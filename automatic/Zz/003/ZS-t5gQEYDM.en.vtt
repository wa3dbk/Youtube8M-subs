00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.180
 ideas to wrap gifts at Christmas 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.880
 in one night 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.579
 We are together 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:34.050
 we are as we are and we are together 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.050
 planet I want to surprise 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.679
 let's start to plant 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.100
 for any of these designs you have 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:46.729
 that get cardboard boxes some already 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.239
 they come armed and some of the sold 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:54.050
 unarmed in haberdashery haberdashery like 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.140
 they sell you the lid and the base 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.079
 all these designs imply that forrest 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.050
 the lid of the box or if you prefer 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.050
 the whole box with certain paper 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.730
 let's start with the costume design 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.430
 of santa fe ras with wrap the box 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:17.520
 with red luster paper 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.530
 marks a line to the center and on this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.080
 will be placing pads of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.050
 cotton to simulate the closure of the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.790
 jacket you can go placing silicon and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.270
 hence the pad that goes in between 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.240
 undone as you can see 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.929
 then we are going to need a ribbon 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.880
 thick black and this ribbon placed on 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.219
 the bottom part leaving a slight 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.870
 space and you have to go around 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.500
 all the gift 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.050
 then you are going to buy with me with 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.470
 glitter and if you do not sell it as 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.690
 so you hit the glitter and 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.760
 then you make a square like the one 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.160
 it shows but it has to be bigger 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.410
 that the width of the ribbon because it's going to be 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.420
 the buckle and 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.000
 square and goes into this same 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.369
 it has to be the same width 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.990
 this square that goes inside is the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.860
 same width as the ribbon measures 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.000
 as you can see and then you hit it 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.000
 and ready 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.540
 now let's make this snow monkey 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.959
 that the interesting thing is that they fit 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.900
 4 gifts in each box you put a gift 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.599
 and this hat counts as a gift this 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.489
 he runs it with black luster and the base is 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.159
 illustration paper that also puts it 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.439
 with black luster the three boxes as 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.750
 you can see go the ascending level a 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.689
 great a mean and a girl and he runs it 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.849
 with white luster you will place the eyes 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.430
 or you can also draw them with a 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.040
 black marker for the nose of 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.799
 carrot you're going to cut in half a 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.829
 letter sheet and the base will start to roll 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.340
 or wrap around in such a way 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.180
 that goes simulating a cone for the nose 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.269
 as shown 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.180
 before closing a landmark with you put 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.340
 little silicon to fix the shape 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.159
 then he cuts it until you 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.170
 like it or rather so that it does not seem 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.150
 Pinocchio there you will see the size 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.480
 This for example is very long but 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.370
 I found the size and then you paste it 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.180
 nose and also here you can do the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.980
 triangular shape like carrot 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.500
 finally his smile placing 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.590
 several dots is for that 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.709
 Look great and snow hand 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.170
 with down marks black texts to their 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.660
 buttons of the names and then with a 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.959
 piece of blue felt or the color that 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.030
 you like, you are going to cut 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.590
 metro and more or less as of 5 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.599
 centimeters wide to make the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.599
 scarf although the truth the size 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.319
 It depends on the dimensions of your boxes 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.360
 as much as it looks like a scarf in the 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.299
 bottom part you can do as the 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.290
 little tricks that hang by trimming with 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.280
 scissors and ready now let's go with the one of 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.520
 the photograph 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.730
 this time the box is lined with paper 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.829
 kraft and will print a photograph with 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.380
 that special being of some moment 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.980
 memorable and the pictures are going to 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.770
 paste on the bottom because 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.660
 then up goes to a bun and goes the 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.090
 name of the person then if he has 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.260
 have to go a little outlined down the 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.050
 bun wraps the whole box from below and 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.570
 it's just a ribbon cited slim 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.110
 of the design that you like and what 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.919
 We fix it well by placing it and sticking it with 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.129
 silicone later you will make two 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.830
 knots in the center 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:57.919
 and the bands that were left over can be 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.949
 Paste on the same photo that looks good 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.139
 nice as a photograph you gave more than 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.229
 my words that father that your wrap 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.789
 you're finally going to put the 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.789
 name of that special person 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.880
 but well nothing like this that you decorate 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.889
 that's already another level for this has 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.229
 your options you can cover your box with 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.690
 black gloss paper or with black cardboard 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.850
 the difference is that this one is cardboard 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.220
 black for example is much more opaque and 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.020
 luster outshines everyone but their 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.349
 likes not 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.780
 with white down you're going to do the design 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.539
 Christmas that you like you can 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.400
 write a cheesy letter to that person 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.830
 what you want is time for 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.789
 discover and potentiate your gifts 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.789
 artistic 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.920
 I got to be snowflakes like I do not 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.920
 there was a tomorrow 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.330
 you will not miss the one you have as ay not 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.400
 I do not want to unwrap it, do not want it 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.010
 open photo to read instagram but good 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.690
 I repeat, your gifts are going to be famous 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.580
 this Christmas 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.310
 you can decorate it by multiple sides 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.290
 to give it that very own style this 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.560
 latest idea of ​​wrap is very original 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.950
 if we go to a gift to young children or 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.720
 well if we want an adult person 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.139
 revive your childhood you were the box with 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.210
 white cardboard and you put some scratches 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.570
 that later you will seal with tape 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.569
 decorative adhesive and whether you what 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.719
 leave blank 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:34.179
 that you already put a preliminary design 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:37.089
 that you have done for that person 

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:39.610
 what colors are the two options too 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:42.159
 can tell you how it colors what you think 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.869
 what is in the gift no more than in the 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.729
 case if you are a boy and your girlfriend puts a 

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:47.259
 engagement ring and you gave him some 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.509
 flip flops and it came out half 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.539
 counterproductive the matter but use your 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:51.539
 imagination
