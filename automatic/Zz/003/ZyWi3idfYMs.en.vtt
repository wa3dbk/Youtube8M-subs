00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
iPhone keep it as Apple so we click on

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.550 
iPhone keep it as Apple so we click on
to<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.099> does<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> swap<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:15.910> drop<00:03:16.150> down

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
to and it does a swap and then drop down

and<00:03:48.610> then<00:03:49.239> during<00:03:49.450> back<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.079> way<00:03:50.819> we'll<00:03:51.819> go

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
and then during back this way we'll go

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:59.130 
and then during back this way we'll go
on<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.540> su<00:03:53.110> doku<00:03:53.200> game<00:03:53.799> that<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.370> made<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:58.140> like
