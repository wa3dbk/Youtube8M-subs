00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
not go to your doctor and just treat

not go to your doctor and just treat
whatever<00:01:53.359> you<00:01:53.630> think<00:01:53.840> at<00:01:53.960> home<00:01:54.079> with

whatever you think at home with

you're<00:02:05.539> liable<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.840> screw<00:02:06.170> it<00:02:06.289> up<00:02:06.380> if<00:02:06.590> you

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
you're liable to screw it up if you

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.469 
you're liable to screw it up if you
screw<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:07.250> up<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.700> what<00:02:07.820> you<00:02:07.909> could<00:02:08.090> very<00:02:08.390> well

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
screw it up and what you could very well

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.570 
screw it up and what you could very well
do<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.110> give<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.560> wrong<00:02:09.679> antibiotic<00:02:10.400> let's

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
do is give the wrong antibiotic let's

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.710 
do is give the wrong antibiotic let's
say<00:02:10.700> for<00:02:10.910> instance<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.390> give<00:02:11.540> this

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
say for instance that you give this

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.120 
say for instance that you give this
antibiotic<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.440> really<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.770> need<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.980> this

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
antibiotic and really you need to this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.640 
antibiotic and really you need to this
antibiotic<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.300> antibiotic<00:02:14.780> kills

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
antibiotic and this antibiotic kills

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.839 
antibiotic and this antibiotic kills
a<00:02:15.680> completely<00:02:16.099> different<00:02:16.310> strain<00:02:16.640> of

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
a completely different strain of

a completely different strain of
bacteria<00:02:16.939> than<00:02:17.540> this<00:02:17.689> one<00:02:17.900> does<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.620> what<00:02:18.860> we

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
bacteria than this one does then what we

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.740 
bacteria than this one does then what we
quite<00:02:19.250> possibly<00:02:19.700> could<00:02:19.909> have<00:02:20.000> done<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.390> kill

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
quite possibly could have done is kill

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.330 
quite possibly could have done is kill
all<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.079> good<00:02:21.260> bacteria<00:02:21.439> that<00:02:22.099> we're<00:02:22.220> out

all the good bacteria that we're out

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.699 
all the good bacteria that we're out

antibiotics for myself or for a person I
love<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.519> only<00:02:52.700> thing<00:02:52.879> standing<00:02:53.120> between
