00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:09.350 
species of plants that have been highly

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.129 
species of plants that have been highly
prized<00:00:09.680> for<00:00:10.070> their<00:00:10.129> roots<00:00:10.490> in<00:00:10.670> general

there's really two varieties of ginseng

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.459 
there's really two varieties of ginseng
that<00:00:13.790> are<00:00:13.969> commercially<00:00:14.540> grown<00:00:14.809> and<00:00:15.230> those

skinca folios an Asian ginseng which is
panax<00:00:20.239> ginseng<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.500> word<00:00:21.649> ginseng

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
panax ginseng and the word ginseng

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.889 
panax ginseng and the word ginseng
actually<00:00:22.550> stands<00:00:22.820> for<00:00:22.970> two<00:00:23.270> Chinese

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:23.899 
actually stands for two Chinese

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.229 
actually stands for two Chinese
characters<00:00:24.439> that<00:00:24.710> together<00:00:25.070> say<00:00:25.759> man<00:00:26.000> root

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 
characters that together say man root

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.179 
characters that together say man root
because<00:00:26.809> sometimes<00:00:27.200> ginseng<00:00:27.590> roots<00:00:27.770> do<00:00:27.980> tend

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
because sometimes ginseng roots do tend

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.940 
because sometimes ginseng roots do tend
to<00:00:28.250> resemble<00:00:28.700> a<00:00:28.790> human<00:00:29.059> figure<00:00:29.829> ginseng<00:00:30.829> is

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
to resemble a human figure ginseng is

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
growing ginseng in a forest situation

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.010 
growing ginseng in a forest situation
the<00:00:37.730> first<00:00:38.000> would<00:00:38.270> be<00:00:38.420> called<00:00:38.690> woods

cultivated which cultivated ginseng is

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.170 
cultivated which cultivated ginseng is
defined<00:00:42.590> by<00:00:42.830> the<00:00:42.890> fact<00:00:43.220> that<00:00:43.370> some<00:00:43.820> sort<00:00:44.120> of

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
defined by the fact that some sort of

mechanical tillage is utilized to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.710 
mechanical tillage is utilized to

essentially woods cultivated ginseng is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.270 
essentially woods cultivated ginseng is
grown<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:50.630> beds<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.290> those<00:00:51.800> beds<00:00:52.100> are

require some sort of spraying for

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.270 
require some sort of spraying for
diseases<00:01:00.110> because<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.739> plants<00:01:01.040> are<00:01:01.130> going<00:01:01.220> to

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
diseases because the plants are going to

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.520 
diseases because the plants are going to
be<00:01:01.340> crowded<00:01:01.880> and<00:01:02.090> you<00:01:02.840> will<00:01:02.989> end<00:01:03.200> up<00:01:03.350> with

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
be crowded and you will end up with

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.100 
be crowded and you will end up with
roots<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:04.070> will<00:01:04.339> grow<00:01:04.579> fairly<00:01:05.239> large<00:01:05.449> fairly

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
roots that will grow fairly large fairly

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.960 
roots that will grow fairly large fairly
quickly<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:07.100> they<00:01:07.190> will<00:01:07.340> not<00:01:07.490> really

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
quickly but they will not really

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.630 
quickly but they will not really
resemble<00:01:08.659> wild<00:01:09.350> ginseng<00:01:09.830> which<00:01:10.010> of<00:01:10.190> course<00:01:10.220> is

20 pounds per acre would be about an

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.800 
20 pounds per acre would be about an
appropriate<00:01:37.760> planting<00:01:38.180> rate<00:01:38.330> for<00:01:38.540> wild

appropriate planting rate for wild
simulated<00:01:39.080> ginseng<00:01:39.830> and<00:01:40.100> that's<00:01:40.640> going<00:01:40.909> to

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
simulated ginseng and that's going to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.390 
simulated ginseng and that's going to
result<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.600> ideally<00:01:42.440> about<00:01:42.650> one<00:01:42.950> plant<00:01:43.280> per

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
result in ideally about one plant per

result in ideally about one plant per
square<00:01:43.790> foot<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.299> that's<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.810> population

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
square foot so that's the population

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.469 
square foot so that's the population
that<00:01:45.560> you'd<00:01:45.680> be<00:01:45.830> shooting<00:01:46.220> at<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.640> quite

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
that you'd be shooting at and quite

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.510 
that you'd be shooting at and quite
often<00:01:47.689> with<00:01:47.930> wild<00:01:48.200> simulated<00:01:48.409> ginseng<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.369> do

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
often with wild simulated ginseng you do

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.420 
often with wild simulated ginseng you do
not<00:01:49.640> need<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:51.320> spray<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.680> generally<00:01:52.280> don't

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
not need to to spray you generally don't

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.190 
not need to to spray you generally don't
need<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.729> use<00:01:52.850> any<00:01:53.030> pesticides<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.930> of<00:01:53.990> course

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
need to use any pesticides and of course

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.870 
need to use any pesticides and of course
we'd<00:01:54.830> certainly<00:01:55.189> wouldn't<00:01:55.400> want<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.580> use<00:01:55.700> any
