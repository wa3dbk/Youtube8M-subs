00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
to do is what I was trying to describe

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.599 
to do is what I was trying to describe
with<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.789> napkin<00:00:18.029> earlier<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.930> tissue

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
with the napkin earlier the tissue

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.849 
with the napkin earlier the tissue
basically<00:00:20.609> if<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.600> see<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> zigzag

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
basically if you can see here a zigzag

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.970 
basically if you can see here a zigzag
I've<00:00:23.730> used<00:00:24.119> by<00:00:24.539> pinking<00:00:25.260> shears<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.710> put<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
I've used by pinking shears and put a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.820 
I've used by pinking shears and put a
zigzag<00:00:26.460> edge<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.420> hope<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.619> that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
zigzag edge on here hope you to see that

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.040 
zigzag edge on here hope you to see that
anyway<00:00:29.220> that's<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> reflect<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.480> cut

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
anyway that's going to reflect the cut

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.290 
anyway that's going to reflect the cut

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
about an inch or so to him you Zig

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
about an inch or so to him you Zig
zagged<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.680> finish<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> edge<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.640> keep<00:00:38.790> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
zagged is to finish the edge to keep it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.110 
zagged is to finish the edge to keep it

pant<00:00:56.670> leg<00:00:56.760> inside<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.800> film<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> up

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
pant leg inside out now your film is up

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.270 
pant leg inside out now your film is up
like<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.879> you've<00:01:00.180> got<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.600> finished<00:01:00.960> edge

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
like this you've got your finished edge

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
like this you've got your finished edge
to<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.820> blind<00:01:03.180> hem<00:01:03.480> stitch<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.650> have

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
to do the blind hem stitch all you have

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
to do the blind hem stitch all you have
to<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> simplify<00:01:07.439> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
to do is that I'm going to simplify this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.020 
to do is that I'm going to simplify this
because<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.130> can't<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.729> pants

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
because it I can't do this with pants

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.600 
because it I can't do this with pants
but<00:01:09.450> basically<00:01:10.290> you're<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> fold<00:01:10.830> back

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
but basically you're going to fold back

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.710 
but basically you're going to fold back
down<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:15.619> when<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.740> sew<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.759> zig<00:01:18.060> zaggy<00:01:18.360> edge

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
down so when you sew the zig zaggy edge

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260 
down so when you sew the zig zaggy edge
there<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.670> sewing

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
there is what you're going to be sewing

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.820 
there is what you're going to be sewing
on<00:01:21.500> your<00:01:22.500> presser<00:01:23.930> it's<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.350> right

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
on your presser it's going to go right

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
on your presser it's going to go right
on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> edge<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.360> because<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> want

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
on the edge here because what you want

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
on the edge here because what you want
it<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.130> zip<00:01:29.430> zip<00:01:30.000> your

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it to do is you want to zip zip your

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.780 
it to do is you want to zip zip your
straight<00:01:30.570> stitches<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> sags<00:01:32.490> it's

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
straight stitches then when it sags it's

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.390 
straight stitches then when it sags it's
going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.119> over<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.890> take<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.159> bite

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
going to go over and take a little bite

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.149 
going to go over and take a little bite
out<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.150> tack<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.869> three<00:01:37.829> stitches

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
out of there and tack it three stitches

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
out of there and tack it three stitches
so<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> zig<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.689> Rin<00:01:40.049> three

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so that's going to zig and Rin three

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.130 
so that's going to zig and Rin three
stitches<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.000> fold<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
stitches so this is how you fold it I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.289 
stitches so this is how you fold it I
don't<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.130> helps<00:01:44.520> any<00:01:47.119> but<00:01:48.119> that's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
don't know if that helps any but that's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.929 
don't know if that helps any but that's
what<00:01:48.390> you're<00:01:48.570> trying<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:50.549> now<00:01:50.880> I'm

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
