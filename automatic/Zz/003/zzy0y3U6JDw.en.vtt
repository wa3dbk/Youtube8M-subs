00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.949
 with today's video we want to show you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.300
 what can i do which system on 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.869
 based on our tried this mobile 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.910
 home 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.320
 brewery distillery complex here 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.740
 heart is pepelats possible 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.730
 look at it is installed distiller 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:36.800
 here are all the elements assembled on the frame right 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.390
 on wheels can be moved as you like 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.070
 for brewing we have ears 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.520
 installed the reclusive you are a conductor with 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.520
 with a mixer take 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.789
 heating the mash takes place using 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.670
 steam generator so poets 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.680
 insulated steam pipe enters the hermit 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.750
 steam generator explodes settings 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.479
 worked as a steam generator it becomes 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.909
 boiler we give it cold water here 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.940
 and set the temperature to 80 degrees 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.619
 then pump this water through the hoses 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.840
 for the horizontal bar well, probably now in brief 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.430
 show on the water how it happens 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.649
 brewing cycle on this main steam 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:30.659
 water generator while it fills 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.659
 the future can fill the congestion 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.680
 level indicators you can see that the water covered 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.509
 so-called 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.070
 it will be enough for us to 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.090
 experience shutting off the water supply 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.600
 turn on the heating of the steam generator boil 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.980
 dad went to the horizontal bar goes heating water and 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.460
 which is located 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.460
 fine 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.409
 well, this is an indicator 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.920
 our rubbing is over 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.450
 but drove all pause now to us 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.090
 you need to transfer the steam generator to the mode 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.980
 boiler there now about 100 degrees 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.390
 as the speaker horn is now pouring 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.640
 supplement it with cold water and turn it on 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.420
 heating if there is a temperature control possible 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.150
 just put the thermostat on at 820 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.090
 transferred to us acts as a cook 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.580
 Already ready to receive Suslov so here 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.980
 how to do it but those who brewed beer 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.380
 know that the first of the conditionally merges into 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.720
 eat waiting for the transparent wort 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.540
 return it for dolnik when it goes 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.570
 transparent and start the belly is reset 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.320
 the towers are thus starting to flood 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.150
 filtered court and of course it will 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.150
 do not so powerful jet 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.240
 most likely nonetheless depends on 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.080
 filtration rate 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.460
 absolutely no matter now here and one more 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.300
 an important point that I would like to 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.590
 show this is the wash water supply from 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.800
 boiler steam generators for this our 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.890
 pump installed 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.190
 hose from the pump abstracted gas then and on 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.580
 three tabs 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.300
 turn on the pump 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.300
 teach transparent 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.750
 Finally I want to say one thing in 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.900
 our previous films criticized us 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.849
 for the design of the hermetic mixer 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.120
 used stuffing box 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.280
 so we redesigned to make 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.500
 doing it this way right now 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.629
 there is a sealed knot there 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.650
 gland set here vodka about the moon 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:13.769
 I'll show you how I'm going to 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:13.769
 we put the shaft spin 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:45.710
 such questions we have 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:45.710
 fixation happens cotter pin year 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.860
 advertising so on
