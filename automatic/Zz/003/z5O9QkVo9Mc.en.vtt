can<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.449> explain<00:00:24.720> why<00:00:24.930> we're<00:00:25.140> seeing<00:00:25.289> this

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
can you explain why we're seeing this

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.759 
can you explain why we're seeing this
sell-off<00:00:26.930> well<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> lot<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
sell-off well I think you have a lot of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.290 
sell-off well I think you have a lot of
speculators<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.670> are<00:00:29.760> selling<00:00:29.970> gold

speculators that are selling gold

speculators that are selling gold
there's<00:00:30.570> no<00:00:30.720> doubt<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.230> how<00:00:31.500> much<00:00:31.650> more

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
there's no doubt about it how much more

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.799 
there's no doubt about it how much more
downward<00:00:32.189> pressure<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.090> exert<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
downward pressure they can exert in the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.870 
downward pressure they can exert in the
days<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.200> weeks<00:00:34.260> ahead<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.980> hard<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> sell<00:00:35.610> I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
days and weeks ahead it's hard to sell I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.670 
days and weeks ahead it's hard to sell I
know<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.930> do<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
know but what I do know is that the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.670 
know but what I do know is that the
price<00:00:37.860> can't<00:00:38.280> stay<00:00:38.640> down<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:40.260> reason

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
price can't stay down here if one reason

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.020 
price can't stay down here if one reason
you<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.980> mentioned<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> cost<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
you just mentioned the cost of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
you just mentioned the cost of
production<00:00:42.360> most<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> world's<00:00:43.680> minds

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
production most of the world's minds

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.279 
production most of the world's minds
can't<00:00:44.460> even<00:00:44.820> produce<00:00:45.059> gold<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:46.020> twelve

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
can't even produce gold for twelve

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.410 
can't even produce gold for twelve
hundred<00:00:46.410> dollars<00:00:46.770> an<00:00:46.890> ounce<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.820> obviously<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
hundred dollars an ounce so obviously a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
hundred dollars an ounce so obviously a
commodity<00:00:48.989> can't<00:00:49.230> stay<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.829> long<00:00:49.860> below<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
commodity can't stay for long below the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
commodity can't stay for long below the
cost<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:51.030> production<00:00:51.300> because<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.199> not

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
cost of production because you're not

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.020 
cost of production because you're not
going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.649> any<00:00:52.800> supply<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.610> that's

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
going to have any supply and that's

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.760 
going to have any supply and that's
going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> take<00:00:54.449> care<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.750> price<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
going to take care of price because the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
going to take care of price because the
supply<00:00:55.949> goes<00:00:56.430> away<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.120> price<00:00:57.390> has<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:57.989> up

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
supply goes away the price has to go up

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
supply goes away the price has to go up
so<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.010> things<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.340> people<00:00:59.699> have

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
so one of the things that people have

so one of the things that people have
said<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> reason<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.109> gold<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
said the reason you want to have gold is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.560 
said the reason you want to have gold is
the<00:01:02.190> monetary<00:01:02.550> policy<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.120> only<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the monetary policy not only in the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.050 
the monetary policy not only in the
United<00:01:03.600> States<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.500> also<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.949> Japan<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.519> going

United States but also in Japan is going

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880 
United States but also in Japan is going
to<00:01:06.150> bring<00:01:06.330> about<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.750> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> inflation

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
to bring about the kind of inflation

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.929 
to bring about the kind of inflation
where<00:01:08.100> you're<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> need<00:01:08.610> something

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
where you're going to need something

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.060 
where you're going to need something
like<00:01:09.060> gold<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.510> protect<00:01:09.840> yourself<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.920> the

like gold to protect yourself but the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
like gold to protect yourself but the
critics<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.580> say<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.970> inflation

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
critics of that say that inflation

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
critics of that say that inflation
hasn't<00:01:12.900> even<00:01:12.990> appeared<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.740> United

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
hasn't even appeared in the United

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.520 
hasn't even appeared in the United

but<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.490> looks<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.850> wrong<00:01:19.400> well<00:01:20.400> no<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
but it looks like you're wrong well no I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
but it looks like you're wrong well no I
think<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> government<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.110> wrong

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
think it's the government that's wrong

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.929 
think it's the government that's wrong
they're<00:01:22.680> hiding<00:01:23.070> behind<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.640> phony

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
they're hiding behind these phony

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.910 
they're hiding behind these phony
measures<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.750> purport<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> tell<00:01:25.590> us<00:01:25.740> what

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
measures that purport to tell us what

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219 
measures that purport to tell us what
the<00:01:26.040> inflation<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> CPI<00:01:27.659> or<00:01:27.780> the

the inflation is like the CPI or the

the inflation is like the CPI or the

personal consumption expenditure index

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.660 
personal consumption expenditure index
but<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.869> definition<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.560> inflation<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.280> an

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
but the definition of inflation is an

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.069 
but the definition of inflation is an
expansion<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> money<00:01:33.570> supply<00:01:33.630> that's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
expansion in the money supply that's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.840 
expansion in the money supply that's
literally<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.829> means<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.490> money<00:01:35.670> supply

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
literally what it means the money supply

literally what it means the money supply
and<00:01:36.060> supply<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.630> credit<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:37.049> being<00:01:37.259> inflated

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and supply of credit are being inflated

and supply of credit are being inflated
the<00:01:38.400> result<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.180> prices<00:01:39.420> rise<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the result is that prices rise but the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.140 
the result is that prices rise but the
Fed<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.829> not<00:01:41.100> acknowledging<00:01:41.729> nor<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
Fed is not acknowledging nor is the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
Fed is not acknowledging nor is the
government<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.810> extent<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> which<00:01:43.380> consumer

government the extent to which consumer
prices<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.939> fact<00:01:45.180> rising<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
prices are in fact rising and one of the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
prices are in fact rising and one of the
reasons<00:01:46.649> they're<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.280> rising<00:01:47.520> even<00:01:47.820> faster

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
reasons they're not rising even faster

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.420 
reasons they're not rising even faster
is<00:01:48.659> because<00:01:49.259> we've<00:01:49.470> been<00:01:49.500> able<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.979> export

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
is because we've been able to export

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.100 
is because we've been able to export
that<00:01:50.700> inflation<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.390> our<00:01:51.509> trading<00:01:51.810> partners

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that inflation to our trading partners

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.319 
that inflation to our trading partners
that's<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> reasons<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.090> cost

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
that's one of the reasons that the cost

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
that's one of the reasons that the cost
of<00:01:54.570> mining<00:01:54.990> has<00:01:55.079> gone<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.649> much<00:01:55.710> remember

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
of mining has gone up so much remember

of mining has gone up so much remember
