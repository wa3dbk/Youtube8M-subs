cream stick it right down there there we
go

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.669 

what's<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.550> magic<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:47.050> magic<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.500> in<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
what's the magic the magic is in the

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.529 
what's the magic the magic is in the
texture<00:01:48.099> saw<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.429> little<00:01:48.729> hills<00:01:48.940> and<00:01:49.119> valleys

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
texture saw the little hills and valleys

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.449 
texture saw the little hills and valleys
it<00:01:49.780> acts<00:01:49.990> as<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.289> repellent<00:01:50.830> this<00:01:51.130> repels

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
it acts as a repellent this repels

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.330 
it acts as a repellent this repels
everything<00:01:51.880> away<00:01:52.090> almost<00:01:52.720> like<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:52.959> Teflon<00:01:53.410> so

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
everything away almost like a Teflon so
