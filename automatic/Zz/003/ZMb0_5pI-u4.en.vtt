00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.910 
contact information listed here and you
know<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.689> guess<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.350> date<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.799> this

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
know I guess the date on this

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.670 
know I guess the date on this
publication<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.970> older<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.680> 2006

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
publication is a little older it's 2006

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.210 
publication is a little older it's 2006
and<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.820> other<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.240> said<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> think<00:01:27.990> what<00:01:28.290> 2008

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and the other one said I think what 2008

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.289 
and the other one said I think what 2008
yeah<00:01:29.640> that's<00:01:29.850> right

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
yeah that's right

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
yeah that's right
2008<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.189> bit

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
2008 so this one this is a little bit

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
2008 so this one this is a little bit
older<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:32.880> doesn't<00:01:33.570> newer<00:01:33.780> information<00:01:34.020> count

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
older so doesn't newer information count

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.039 
older so doesn't newer information count
for<00:01:34.680> something<00:01:34.950> sure<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.880> counts<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.900> would

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
for something sure it counts so would

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
for something sure it counts so would
you<00:01:37.170> rather<00:01:37.290> use<00:01:37.590> older<00:01:37.979> information<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.729> can

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you rather use older information you can

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
you rather use older information you can
trust<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.509> questionable<00:01:40.049> new<00:01:40.229> information

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
