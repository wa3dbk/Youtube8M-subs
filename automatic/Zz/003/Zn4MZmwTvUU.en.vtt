00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
is obviously already in tune for this

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.260 
is obviously already in tune for this
video<00:00:15.480> but<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:17.290> best<00:00:17.590> way<00:00:17.860> to<00:00:17.920> tune<00:00:18.279> is<00:00:18.610> with<00:00:19.060> a

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
video but the best way to tune is with a

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.189 
video but the best way to tune is with a
tuner<00:00:19.900> and<00:00:20.880> generally<00:00:21.880> speaking<00:00:22.240> of<00:00:22.360> 14<00:00:22.780> basis

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
there's not a lot of vibration as they

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.800 
there's not a lot of vibration as they
as<00:02:25.239> they<00:02:25.570> press<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.019> e<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.680> press<00:02:26.890> your<00:02:27.130> e

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
as they press the e and you press your e

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.210 
as they press the e and you press your e
you<00:02:28.810> should<00:02:29.049> have<00:02:29.170> been<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.380> lot<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.890> parade

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
you should have been a lot of a parade

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.340 
you should have been a lot of a parade
if<00:02:30.489> your<00:02:30.730> key<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.030> vibrate<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:31.840> you're<00:02:31.959> nope<00:02:32.170> if

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
if your key is vibrate if you're nope if

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.069 
if your key is vibrate if you're nope if
your<00:02:32.500> bass<00:02:32.709> strings<00:02:33.100> are<00:02:33.280> vibrating<00:02:34.079> faster

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
your bass strings are vibrating faster

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.590 
your bass strings are vibrating faster
it's<00:02:35.590> probably<00:02:35.859> shocked<00:02:36.549> if<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:37.090> vibrating

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
it's probably shocked if this vibrating

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.390 
it's probably shocked if this vibrating
slow<00:02:38.079> is<00:02:38.680> probably<00:02:39.310> fled<00:02:40.260> alright<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:42.220> get

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
slow is probably fled alright we get

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.710 
slow is probably fled alright we get
into<00:02:42.640> more<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.030> later<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.799> got<00:02:44.950> e<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.720> D

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
into more of that later so you got e a D

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.809 
into more of that later so you got e a D
G<00:02:47.590> right<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:50.829> you're<00:02:51.010> counting<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.609> rush

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
G right so if you're counting in a rush

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.250 
G right so if you're counting in a rush
and<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.209> have<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.540> do<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.930> get<00:02:53.049> your

and you have to do what you get your

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.710 
and you have to do what you get your
keyboard<00:02:53.620> player<00:02:53.799> player<00:02:54.100> eat<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:55.329> then<00:02:55.600> you

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
keyboard player player eat and then you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.490 
keyboard player player eat and then you
play<00:02:55.959> octave<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.650> octave<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.430> basically<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
play octave and octave is basically the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.260 
play octave and octave is basically the
same<00:02:59.530> note<00:03:00.100> higher

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.090 

on<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.630> next<00:03:05.870> string<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:06.590> if<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.740> started

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
on the next string so if you started

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.420 
on the next string so if you started
each<00:03:07.250> train<00:03:07.990> come<00:03:08.990> up<00:03:09.140> one<00:03:09.500> two<00:03:09.800> three<00:03:09.830> four

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
each train come up one two three four

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.260 
each train come up one two three four
five<00:03:10.490> six<00:03:10.790> seven<00:03:11.630> friends<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:13.310> then<00:03:13.730> go<00:03:13.940> up<00:03:14.090> to

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
five six seven friends and then go up to
