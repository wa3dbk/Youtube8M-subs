00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
purpose the PM event there is fixed into

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
purpose the PM event there is fixed into
the<00:00:33.809> roof<00:00:34.160> using<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.750> mess<00:00:36.750> stick<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:38.399> take<00:00:38.640> up

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the roof using a mess stick to take up

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.459 
the roof using a mess stick to take up
the<00:00:39.350> corrugations

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
the corrugations

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.680 
the corrugations
in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.460> profile<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> roof<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.570> see

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
in the profile of the roof you can see

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
in the profile of the roof you can see
that<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> there's<00:00:43.469> two<00:00:43.590> corrugated<00:00:44.129> profile

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that is there's two corrugated profile

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
that is there's two corrugated profile
I'll<00:00:45.570> use<00:00:45.780> plenty<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.920> domestic<00:00:47.750> here<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
I'll use plenty of this domestic here to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.630 
I'll use plenty of this domestic here to
actually<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> difference<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
actually make up a difference in the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.790 
actually make up a difference in the
corrugations<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.510> other<00:00:52.350> thing<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.680> might

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
corrugations and other thing you might

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
corrugations and other thing you might
notice<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.309> high<00:00:53.550> point<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> roof<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
notice the high point of the roof is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.130 
notice the high point of the roof is
along<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:55.590> line<00:00:55.949> here<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.660> there's<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> top

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
along this line here so there's the top

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.849 
along this line here so there's the top
of<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> slope<00:00:58.620> any<00:00:59.039> water<00:00:59.489> at<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.510> side

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
of the slope any water at this side

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.660 
of the slope any water at this side
drain<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:03.199> any<00:01:04.199> water<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.460> side

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
drain that way any water on this side

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.280 
drain that way any water on this side
are<00:01:05.909> actually<00:01:06.150> drain<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:06.960> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
are actually drain that way because this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
are actually drain that way because this
intersects<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> high<00:01:08.100> point<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.880> won't<00:01:09.750> get

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
intersects the high point so won't get

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.039 
intersects the high point so won't get
any<00:01:10.020> standing<00:01:10.590> water<00:01:11.600> at<00:01:12.600> all

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
any standing water at all

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.219 
any standing water at all
now<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.220> Tama<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.600> event<00:01:15.900> things<00:01:16.110> are

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
now these Tama and so event things are

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.080 
now these Tama and so event things are
quite<00:01:16.439> good<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.799> they're<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.580> an<00:01:17.729> electric

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
quite good as they're on an electric

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.679 
quite good as they're on an electric
motor<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.570> I've<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.780> got<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.110> wide<00:01:19.710> in

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
motor when I've all got that wide in

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.429 
motor when I've all got that wide in
it's<00:01:21.689> gonna<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.619> able<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.210> extract<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.900> cooking

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
it's gonna be able to extract my cooking

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.770 
it's gonna be able to extract my cooking
fumes<00:01:25.770> which<00:01:26.009> would<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> sinking

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
actually fits on the other side of this

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.770 
actually fits on the other side of this
board<00:02:32.220> I've<00:02:32.430> already<00:02:32.700> made<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.060> board<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.540> I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
board I've already made the board so I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.530 
board I've already made the board so I
need<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.680> actually<00:02:34.830> cut<00:02:35.250> out<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.790> hole<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
need to actually cut out a hole in the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.320 
need to actually cut out a hole in the
board<00:02:36.780> exactly<00:02:37.230> where<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> Terr<00:02:37.830> event<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:39.030> in

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
board exactly where the Terr event is in

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.140 
board exactly where the Terr event is in
the<00:02:39.420> way<00:02:39.600> I'm<00:02:40.050> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.350> do<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.880> can<00:02:42.000> see

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
the way I'm going to do that you can see

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.449 
the way I'm going to do that you can see
I<00:02:42.180> fixed<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.630> term<00:02:42.840> event<00:02:43.140> temporarily<00:02:43.770> on

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
I fixed the term event temporarily on

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.270 
I fixed the term event temporarily on
the<00:02:44.959> framing<00:02:45.959> there<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.620> marked<00:02:46.980> out<00:02:47.130> with

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
the framing there and marked out with

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.699 
the framing there and marked out with
pencil<00:02:47.900> round<00:02:48.950> where<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.180> corners<00:02:51.180> are<00:02:51.709> of

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
pencil round where the corners are of

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.040 
pencil round where the corners are of
that<00:02:53.100> just<00:02:53.520> not<00:02:53.760> add<00:02:53.910> on<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.330> framing<00:02:54.720> and

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that just not add on to the framing and

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.270 
that just not add on to the framing and
then<00:02:55.800> what<00:02:56.040> I've<00:02:56.160> done<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.580> I've<00:02:57.110> fixed<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.410> bit

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
then what I've done is I've fixed a bit

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.870 
then what I've done is I've fixed a bit
of<00:03:00.800> duct<00:03:01.800> tape<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.190> each<00:03:02.310> corner<00:03:02.610> with<00:03:02.820> a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
of duct tape in each corner with a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.870 
of duct tape in each corner with a
sticky<00:03:03.120> side<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:04.260> way<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.520> what<00:03:05.670> I'm<00:03:05.760> going

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
sticky side this way and what I'm going

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.290 
sticky side this way and what I'm going
to<00:03:05.940> do<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.450> take<00:03:07.320> this<00:03:07.550> boarding<00:03:08.550> here<00:03:08.730> press

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
to do is take this boarding here press

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.590 
to do is take this boarding here press
it<00:03:09.630> up<00:03:10.320> against<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:12.049> the<00:03:13.489> roof<00:03:14.489> there<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
it up against and the roof there and the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.990 
it up against and the roof there and the
poor<00:03:16.200> bits<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.560> duck<00:03:16.799> typing<00:03:17.040> each<00:03:17.340> corner

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
poor bits of duck typing each corner

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.930 
poor bits of duck typing each corner
stick<00:03:18.299> onto<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.410> boarding<00:03:19.799> so<00:03:20.220> I'll<00:03:20.459> have

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
stick onto the boarding so I'll have

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.910 
stick onto the boarding so I'll have
their<00:03:21.090> positions<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.630> corners<00:03:22.019> marked

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
their positions of the corners marked

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.170 
their positions of the corners marked
out<00:03:23.280> exactly<00:03:23.930> where<00:03:24.930> they<00:03:25.019> should<00:03:25.049> be<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:26.180> and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
out exactly where they should be and and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.300 
out exactly where they should be and and
then<00:03:27.420> all<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.720> need<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.080> do<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.350> join<00:03:29.100> those

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
then all I need to do is join those

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.670 
then all I need to do is join those
corners<00:03:29.820> up<00:03:29.940> those<00:03:30.480> duct<00:03:30.720> tape<00:03:30.959> pieces<00:03:31.350> up

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
corners up those duct tape pieces up

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.620 
corners up those duct tape pieces up
with<00:03:31.920> with<00:03:32.670> pencil<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.680> cut<00:03:34.680> out<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.950> hole

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
with with pencil and cut out the hole

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.310 
with with pencil and cut out the hole
hopefully<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.750> hole<00:03:36.900> should<00:03:37.110> be<00:03:37.370> in<00:03:38.370> exactly

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
hopefully the hole should be in exactly

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.600 
hopefully the hole should be in exactly
the<00:03:40.320> right<00:03:40.470> place<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.070> that's<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.400> another

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
the right place so that's just another

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.340 
the right place so that's just another
little<00:03:41.790> tip<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:42.810> marking<00:03:43.680> out<00:03:44.090> on<00:03:45.140> roofs<00:03:46.140> if

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
little tip for marking out on roofs if

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.740 
little tip for marking out on roofs if
you<00:03:46.500> need<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.799> do<00:03:47.299> something<00:03:48.299> similar<00:03:48.540> you

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
you need to do something similar you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.820 
you need to do something similar you
have<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.989> similar<00:03:49.400> marking<00:03:50.400> out<00:03:50.549> problem<00:03:50.970> and

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
have a similar marking out problem and

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.050 
have a similar marking out problem and
these<00:03:52.830> spaces<00:03:53.100> here<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.610> course<00:03:53.760> will<00:03:53.940> be

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
these spaces here of course will be

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.199 
these spaces here of course will be
filled<00:03:54.330> with<00:03:54.860> rockport<00:03:56.000> insulation<00:03:57.000> when

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
filled with rockport insulation when

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.710 
filled with rockport insulation when
this<00:03:57.420> board<00:03:58.019> is<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.760> screwed<00:03:59.760> up<00:03:59.910> against<00:04:00.600> all

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
this board is and screwed up against all

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.460 
this board is and screwed up against all
that<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.170> framing<00:04:01.860> that's<00:04:02.790> forming<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.299> very

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
that and framing that's forming a very

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.039 
that and framing that's forming a very
nice<00:04:04.519> insulated<00:04:05.519> roof<00:04:06.299> profile<00:04:06.840> which<00:04:07.019> is

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
nice insulated roof profile which is

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.930 
nice insulated roof profile which is
important<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:08.120> stop<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.269> condensation<00:04:10.019> so

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
important to stop the condensation so

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.220 
important to stop the condensation so
there's<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:12.030> little<00:04:12.420> bit<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.600> progress<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:13.290> the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
there's a little bit of progress on the

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.960 
there's a little bit of progress on the
fitting<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.040> roof<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.790> roof

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
fitting the roof and the roof

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.129 
fitting the roof and the roof
construction<00:04:16.750> oh<00:04:16.810> that's<00:04:17.109> been<00:04:17.459> helpful<00:04:18.459> and

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
construction oh that's been helpful and

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.210 
construction oh that's been helpful and
until<00:04:20.139> next<00:04:20.530> time<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:21.010> shall<00:04:21.820> see<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.030> later
