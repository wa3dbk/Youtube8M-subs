no padding and there is lace outside but

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.800 
no padding and there is lace outside but
the<00:03:40.230> lace<00:03:40.560> doesn't<00:03:41.400> really<00:03:41.580> show<00:03:42.060> through<00:03:42.450> my

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
the lace doesn't really show through my

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.770 
the lace doesn't really show through my
tops<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:44.010> that's<00:03:44.310> not<00:03:44.580> really<00:03:44.880> a<00:03:44.910> problem<00:03:44.970> and
