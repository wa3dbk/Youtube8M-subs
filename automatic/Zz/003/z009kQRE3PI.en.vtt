00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
every single one of them has come out

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.520 
every single one of them has come out
male<00:05:10.129> killer<00:05:11.120> blast<00:05:11.419> is<00:05:11.629> a<00:05:11.659> super<00:05:12.229> pastel

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
male killer blast is a super pastel

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.300 
male killer blast is a super pastel
pinstripe<00:05:13.460> spider<00:05:14.740> so<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.860> cool<00:05:16.039> thing<00:05:16.069> about

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
pinstripe spider so the cool thing about

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.040 
pinstripe spider so the cool thing about
this<00:05:16.610> is<00:05:16.789> if<00:05:16.909> you<00:05:17.000> breed<00:05:17.210> this<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.539> a<00:05:17.569> normal

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
this is if you breed this to a normal

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.600 
this is if you breed this to a normal
the<00:05:18.469> worst<00:05:18.710> thing<00:05:18.919> you<00:05:19.009> can<00:05:19.159> produce<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:19.580> a

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
the worst thing you can produce is a

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.420 
the worst thing you can produce is a
pastel<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.509> you<00:05:21.199> also<00:05:21.409> produce<00:05:21.889> a<00:05:22.009> variety<00:05:22.400> of

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
pastel and you also produce a variety of

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.209 
pastel and you also produce a variety of
bumblebees<00:05:22.819> lemon<00:05:23.389> blast<00:05:23.629> and<00:05:24.080> spinner<00:05:24.919> blast

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 
bumblebees lemon blast and spinner blast

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.350 
bumblebees lemon blast and spinner blast
too<00:05:26.469> so<00:05:27.469> very<00:05:27.949> powerful<00:05:28.190> male<00:05:28.699> for<00:05:29.000> breeding

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
too so very powerful male for breeding

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.399 
too so very powerful male for breeding
and<00:05:29.569> like<00:05:29.690> I<00:05:29.719> said<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:29.930> think<00:05:30.020> we've<00:05:30.229> hatched

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
and like I said I think we've hatched

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.159 
and like I said I think we've hatched
all<00:05:30.620> four<00:05:30.889> of<00:05:30.919> them<00:05:31.099> already<00:05:31.400> this<00:05:31.550> year<00:05:32.169> the

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
all four of them already this year the

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.809 
all four of them already this year the
last<00:05:33.409> one<00:05:33.650> I<00:05:33.680> wanted<00:05:34.009> to<00:05:34.069> show<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.340> for<00:05:34.669> right

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
last one I wanted to show you for right

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.959 
last one I wanted to show you for right
now<00:05:34.849> is<00:05:35.300> another<00:05:35.569> double<00:05:36.259> recessive<00:05:36.849> this<00:05:37.849> is

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:37.969 
now is another double recessive this is

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.809 
now is another double recessive this is
an<00:05:38.090> albino<00:05:38.419> genetic<00:05:39.080> stripe<00:05:39.500> we<00:05:40.460> produced

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
an albino genetic stripe we produced

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.610 
an albino genetic stripe we produced
this<00:05:41.000> from<00:05:41.240> breeding<00:05:41.539> double<00:05:41.870> hat<00:05:42.050> albino

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
this from breeding double hat albino

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.219 
this from breeding double hat albino
stripe<00:05:43.009> -<00:05:43.190> double<00:05:43.490> hat<00:05:43.610> albino<00:05:43.940> stripe<00:05:44.360> this

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
stripe - double hat albino stripe this

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.749 
stripe - double hat albino stripe this
is<00:05:45.379> the<00:05:45.469> first<00:05:45.710> one<00:05:46.009> and<00:05:46.310> we<00:05:46.370> got<00:05:46.520> really

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
is the first one and we got really

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.969 
is the first one and we got really
really<00:05:46.939> lucky<00:05:47.509> with<00:05:47.599> this<00:05:47.779> one<00:05:47.840> we<00:05:48.139> hit<00:05:48.409> a<00:05:48.439> male

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
really lucky with this one we hit a male

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.189 
really lucky with this one we hit a male
so<00:05:49.520> now<00:05:49.939> we'll<00:05:50.120> raise<00:05:50.330> this<00:05:50.629> guy<00:05:50.840> up<00:05:51.020> and

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
so now we'll raise this guy up and

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.409 
so now we'll raise this guy up and
replace<00:05:51.529> our<00:05:51.710> double<00:05:52.069> hat<00:05:52.219> male<00:05:52.490> with<00:05:53.210> the

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
replace our double hat male with the

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.260 
replace our double hat male with the
actual<00:05:53.719> visible<00:05:54.319> double<00:05:54.680> recessive<00:05:55.009> male<00:05:55.460> so

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
actual visible double recessive male so

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.029 
actual visible double recessive male so
next<00:05:57.020> year<00:05:57.229> we<00:05:57.319> should<00:05:57.500> be<00:05:57.590> able<00:05:57.650> to<00:05:57.740> produce<00:05:57.860> a

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
next year we should be able to produce a

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.950 
next year we should be able to produce a
lot<00:05:58.069> of<00:05:58.250> albino<00:05:58.940> stripes<00:05:59.330> from<00:05:59.509> him<00:05:59.750> we<00:05:59.870> have

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
lot of albino stripes from him we have

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.540 
lot of albino stripes from him we have
three<00:06:00.199> double<00:06:00.500> hat<00:06:00.650> females<00:06:01.069> that<00:06:01.190> he'll<00:06:01.400> be

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
three double hat females that he'll be

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.070 
three double hat females that he'll be
breeding<00:06:01.759> all<00:06:02.000> three<00:06:02.270> of<00:06:02.360> those<00:06:03.969> so<00:06:05.080> that's

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080
