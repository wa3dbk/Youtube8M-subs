00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.050
 although we have this piece where they go 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.880
 the injectors did remember the video 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.910
 It was dirty and now we have 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.130
 perfectly clean 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.650
 which we are going to proceed to put this is 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.190
 the packaging that goes clean is new and goes 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.470
 instead 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.939
 replaced by the old man who was this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.939
 by then we have this piece 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.500
 You have to give 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.500
 to proceed to put in the screws 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.230
 squeeze in 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.780
 ah 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.079
 we're just going to hold and we're not going to 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.760
 press hard because we are doing more 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.760
 adjustments in the other parts 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.910
 but we are already assembling and all the pieces 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.500
 that we are going to carry clean , which 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.500
 that was the purpose 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.150
 of gasoline 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.150
 the next 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.780
 let's take the first injector 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.930
 all are equal ie 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.400
 each one to me does not matter the simple side 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.549
 we put the first ring that is the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.549
 latest 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.020
 we already have it here 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.420
 and so
