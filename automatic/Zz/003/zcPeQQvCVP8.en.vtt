00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:04.520
 I'm one was here about commenting and 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.930
 I bring you a pretty frenetic gameplay 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.280
 in truth they are two gameplays of butt and 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.200
 you know that the games of a tope are 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.030
 very very short and good I'll leave you 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.190
 Well, as I was telling you, even though 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.640
 claudio ticos gameplays super frenetic 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.380
 100% off 100% butt gusts pretty 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.609
 low the truth departures as I follow very 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.079
 short because mole matches last 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.880
 very little but it is a game mode to me 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.710
 I love it because people lately 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.599
 me so when I put then 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.130
 normally already to fire then more than 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.109
 get me games just play 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.970
 it happens to try to pass it well and to stop it is 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.250
 one of the ways that sometimes I get it 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.140
 games of which game as roasted as in 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.940
 this case that I'm running for the most 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.399
 painting without worrying because people 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.739
 you know that if they do not kill inside those 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.420
 30 seconds then they explode then 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.859
 you have to give yourself a little bit of life like this 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.070
 that this game is one of the successes 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.329
 that has had the good guy claudio 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.769
 Sincerely good I had to wanted 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.850
 take advantage of this gameplay that good 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.640
 you are seeing that I am testing the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.530
 capture a new one that you will have 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.239
 surely on Friday the unboxing is 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.100
 a new captor having half that 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.749
 It will interest many and not you 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.710
 I want to talk a lot more because I think 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.180
 that will interest all of you 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.990
 You want to start YouTube or those that 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.939
 you want 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.680
 buy a new one like mine 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.490
 for example, I was fucked but the pv 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.380
 ere is going to be a good opportunity 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.640
 because it is quite cheap and as you can see 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.369
 record a pretty good quality 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.289
 then the problem of the audio that 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.909
 you saw in the modern warfare2 the empire 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.890
 nostalgic was because we had the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.880
 video format in this was also 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.250
 wrong the format but I got 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.450
 perfectly adjust the sound no longer 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.740
 you are going to have more sound problems in 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.909
 what happened the other day as in 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 war skirt so do not worry anymore 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.689
 was the format had this these others 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.520
 gameplays that I had taken while the 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.850
 I tried and while trying to play 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.380
 a while to 360 because this one that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.030
 place between 60 is equal you see that the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.399
 textures are a little different is 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.560
 because it's 360 is not one since the aguán 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.330
 I have the average view to show you the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.520
 again and in the 360 ​​and in the play 3 I'm going 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.259
 to use the other to see new media 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.240
 although the play 3 I do not play anything just the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.679
 for direct use of optique since 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.539
 I do not like it too much and I only have 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.880
 practically to play online the 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.080
 whites 2 so good I wanted to use 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.429
 this example as I said before for 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.020
 talk a little bit about how the channel is 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.500
 because there are people who ask me for series that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.090
 I'm not going up anymore and well I think that 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.350
 moment the thing works pretty well and 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.780
 then that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.780
 removes all kinds of things to the channel and 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.760
 as I said a little bit in the costs that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.650
 I did then 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.939
 you do not have you are not alone in the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.709
 channel in all of you just like it 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.629
 that we go up in warfare 3 in infected to 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.310
 another one likes you another likes 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.379
 nostalgic and want it to go up 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.030
 example only black ops 1 that only upload 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.860
 whites 2 or that this gives súa modern 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.560
 warfare 3 modern warfare 2 that only goes up 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.879
 at 25 to guti 4 then the good thing that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.200
 has the channel I believe right now is 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.519
 that even if it's just call of duty and 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.810
 although on Sundays you know that it is 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.159
 introducing a new series that by the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.239
 moment marches quite well and that is 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.480
 giving a little more variety to the 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:51.170
 channel because I think that comes very well 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.790
 true because that gives you a new day 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.900
 people who want to open another type of 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.180
 videos or you're tired of every duty 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.829
 Well, go in and in fact good here 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.409
 to finish the first gameplay with a 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.790
 22 24 to 2 and then the same map but with 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.500
 the vector a weapon that lately I 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.480
 is charming I have an aim 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.159
 pretty good with this gun and the truth 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.659
 is that it kills a lot so he has 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.310
 ever uploaded to the channel but as the 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.720
 I have a combination very very 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.650
 good so I leave it in the background 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.989
 while I comment what I had to 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.849
 comment and good what I was saying 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.799
 the good series I have thought this end 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.810
 week ie plants against zombies 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.980
 every Sunday uploaded minutes 2 - 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.840
 last Sunday I had problems 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.129
 as you know I think connection and 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.120
 they are arranged at least you know 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.450
 that during the week I do not have problems 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.040
 but 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.750
 what you expect to see as at the end of 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.440
 week see how the connection arrives and everything 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.019
 that and also good I plan to go up 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.420
 this weekend apart from plants 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.400
 against zombies or slender man or minecraft 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.530
 the hunger games will be 2.0 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.760
 obviously and I do not know if I 'll play with 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.900
 someone else the hunger games for 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.430
 make it a little more entertaining but 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.260
 Well, the survey is worth as I said yesterday 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.640
 same as the name of the series of 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.019
 I tried it'll change because of 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.190
 the survey by twitter that's how the 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.870
 Friday for example that I put to 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.670
 record what you want the weekend 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.340
 seasonal part with such view and 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.799
 Well, there I will read more better than in 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.910
 what is it called on youtube 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.950
 that it's hard for me to count the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.690
 comments then on twitter asked for 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.549
 retweet or fav and so on then directly 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.730
 twitter, what can I add ? 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.650
 you prefer more not later with respect to 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.630
 other series you ask me a lot of mentality 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.489
 nuclear that would increase that better said 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.320
 in this game that happens in this game 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.180
 Well, you have the problem that 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.330
 people change a lot the maps are a 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.160
 little strangers and weapons kill quite 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.360
 then it is very exasperating to take out game 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.580
 and I'm bad 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.740
 get out of cannes or I do not know or I'm not good at 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.150
 game I think it's not already you see 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.340
 seeing that in this example and for example 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.430
 from to stop 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.889
 I do not know how I like to play when it's a 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.270
 game that is is to play a bag that is 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.460
 run on the map that is to look for the 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.139
 people and such well if I enjoy when something 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.430
 I hope is that taking out game did not enjoy 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.680
 in tried yes because it's a series that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.660
 I have a great time but I do not think that 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.070
 right now have the motivation as per 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.020
 example had the harassment is to remember that 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.280
 the harassment is when I was more or less 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.870
 just the game I said that my only 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.620
 motivation right now in the target this 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.880
 will be competitive and take nuclear no 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.350
 that was much more fun because the 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.350
 maps were more dynamic there were more 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.000
 variety of weapons and well I do not know 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.830
 He liked the white 2 and always will 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.490
 I said no although I always see now 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.780
 same more as novelty the cost then 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.340
 because something is at stake because sometimes 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.220
 in when equal this type of games 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.780
 molan molan quite but it does not amuse me 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.220
 take out game and you know right now 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.229
 I'm in when competitive but that 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.250
 I'm punishing I do not know if I'll come back for the 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.720
 I 'm not comfortable enough 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.220
 quite with a lot more time to 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.320
 play other things or to study more 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.760
 but at the moment and so I 'm not going 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.320
 to compete again although this will continue 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.270
 obviously going up to solve mode 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.770
 league that I also have a prepared a 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:42.050
 clan war gameplay good this one 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.490
 and it was to raise the clan with frank and so 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.889
 we take out the camouflage of the division of 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.360
 diamond the yellow and the chance of 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.490
 to finish the season I think it was 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.229
 yesterday or before yesterday and we won so 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.789
 we won and we won the best 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.500
 frank will have unlock camouflage 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.569
 count of casualties that already had it 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.159
 It's red to show you with the shotgun and 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.870
 the next if we win we will get the 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.190
 invitation to diamond and if we win the 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.699
 diamond then we will have to camouflage 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:08.060
 special diamond so it will be cool 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:09.470
 and good that I bundled in the gameplay to 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.389
 basically what I said I have a 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.770
 Black good gameplay modes 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.330
 cannes of this game is interesting a 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.500
 like it's double so I think it's going 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.509
 to like and about them came 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.039
 day increases that at the moment I'm not going to 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.210
 go up and if you added them the same is once or
