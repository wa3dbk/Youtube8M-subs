00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
extremely heavy I mean I'm actually

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.299 
extremely heavy I mean I'm actually
normally<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> fan<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> phones<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
normally a fan of phones that have a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.410 
normally a fan of phones that have a
little<00:00:41.550> bit<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.730> weight<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.300> this

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
little bit of weight to them but this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.750 
little bit of weight to them but this
one<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.719> definitely<00:00:42.960> overbearing<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.160> can't

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
one is definitely overbearing I can't

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.069 
one is definitely overbearing I can't
imagine<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.210> ever<00:00:45.450> being<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.809> comfortable

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
imagine this ever being a comfortable

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
imagine this ever being a comfortable
weight<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> hold<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> hands<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.430> really<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
weight to hold in the hands it really is

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
weight to hold in the hands it really is
about<00:00:48.030> twice<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.600> heavy<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:49.050> most<00:00:49.350> other

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
about twice as heavy as most other

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.130 
about twice as heavy as most other
phones<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.420> got<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> really

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
phones I think so that's got a really

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.170 
phones I think so that's got a really
nice<00:00:52.289> finish<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> back<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.280> sort<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
nice finish on the back it's sort of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
nice finish on the back it's sort of
grippy<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> same<00:00:55.500> time<00:00:55.739> doesn't

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
grippy but at the same time doesn't

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
grippy but at the same time doesn't
attract<00:00:56.309> him<00:00:56.460> any<00:00:56.610> fingerprints<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.840> whole

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
attract him any fingerprints the whole

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.349 
attract him any fingerprints the whole
design<00:00:58.320> aesthetic<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:59.010> more<00:00:59.399> similar<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
design aesthetic is more similar to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.060 
design aesthetic is more similar to
something<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> iPhone<00:01:01.170> 6<00:01:01.770> with

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
something like that of the iPhone 6 with

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.460 
something like that of the iPhone 6 with
it's<00:01:02.219> 2.5<00:01:02.579> DS<00:01:03.090> slightly<00:01:03.510> curved<00:01:03.750> display<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
it's 2.5 DS slightly curved display and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
it's 2.5 DS slightly curved display and
it's<00:01:05.129> sort<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.369> tapered<00:01:05.790> edges<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.270> looks

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it's sort of tapered edges it looks

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's sort of tapered edges it looks
really<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:06.720> nice<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.530> also<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> 5

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
really really nice so we also have a 5

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
really really nice so we also have a 5
megapixel<00:01:08.549> front<00:01:09.060> camera<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.570> well<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> 13

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
megapixel front camera as well as the 13

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.800 
megapixel front camera as well as the 13
megapixel<00:01:10.590> rear<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.520> dual<00:01:11.790> LED<00:01:11.970> flash<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
megapixel rear with dual LED flash and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
megapixel rear with dual LED flash and
just<00:01:13.020> below<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.260> we<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> fingerprint

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
just below that we have the fingerprint

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
just below that we have the fingerprint
sensor<00:01:14.580> which<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.509> nice<00:01:15.659> addition

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
sensor which is a really nice addition

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.039 
sensor which is a really nice addition
more<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.040> later<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> packaging<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
more on that later so the packaging that

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.749 
more on that later so the packaging that
actually<00:01:19.380> came<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.860> pretty<00:01:20.070> standard<00:01:20.430> it's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
actually came in is pretty standard it's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.700 
actually came in is pretty standard it's
nothing<00:01:21.000> spectacular<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:22.140> box<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.500> kind<00:01:22.619> of

nothing spectacular the box is kind of

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.810 
nothing spectacular the box is kind of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
data between them there are apps for

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.060 
data between them there are apps for
this<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.110> fact<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.320> it's<00:02:31.500> built-in<00:02:31.860> is

detect<00:03:18.240> your<00:03:18.390> fingerprint<00:03:18.930> 10<00:03:19.230> different

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
detect your fingerprint 10 different

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.500 
detect your fingerprint 10 different

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
times when you set it up which is a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
times when you set it up which is a
little<00:03:21.600> bit<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.050> pain<00:03:22.260> admittedly<00:03:22.740> but<00:03:23.250> it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
little bit of a pain admittedly but it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
little bit of a pain admittedly but it
is<00:03:23.490> great<00:03:23.820> at<00:03:24.000> detecting<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.480> finger<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.990> if

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.450 

this<00:03:44.930> BK<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.500> real<00:03:45.710> downside<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.370> this

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
this BK is a real downside of this

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.820 
this BK is a real downside of this
device<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:47.030> has<00:03:47.180> literally<00:03:47.600> no<00:03:47.960> bass<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.590> no

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830

richness<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.610> sound<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.120> sounds<00:03:50.420> very

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
richness to the sound and it sounds very

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.210 
richness to the sound and it sounds very
tinny<00:03:50.930> indeed<00:03:51.350> as<00:03:51.560> well<00:03:51.740> as<00:03:51.890> not<00:03:52.070> being

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
tinny indeed as well as not being

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.100 
tinny indeed as well as not being
particularly<00:03:52.550> loud<00:03:52.850> so<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.660> film<00:03:53.870> really

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
particularly loud so this film really

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.510 
particularly loud so this film really
confuses<00:03:54.680> me<00:03:54.800> because<00:03:55.070> then<00:03:55.190> on<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.400> other

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
confuses me because then on the other

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.250 
confuses me because then on the other
hand<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.910> camera<00:03:56.240> is<00:03:56.330> actually<00:03:56.480> really<00:03:56.960> good

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
hand the camera is actually really good

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.380 
hand the camera is actually really good
at<00:03:57.440> punches<00:03:57.830> well<00:03:58.010> above<00:03:58.040> its<00:03:58.400> weight<00:03:58.460> you<00:03:59.270> can

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
at punches well above its weight you can

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.820 
at punches well above its weight you can
see<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.720> we<00:03:59.780> have<00:03:59.870> a<00:03:59.900> really<00:04:00.200> nice<00:04:00.440> color

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
see that we have a really nice color

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.260 
see that we have a really nice color
balance<00:04:01.250> here<00:04:01.460> with<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.730> good<00:04:01.940> amount<00:04:02.120> of

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
balance here with a good amount of

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
strong vibrant detail is also pretty up

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.860 
strong vibrant detail is also pretty up
there<00:04:07.280> clearly<00:04:07.850> not<00:04:08.060> in<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.270> same<00:04:08.480> league<00:04:08.690> as

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
something like the LG g4 but definitely

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.790 
something like the LG g4 but definitely
above<00:04:11.660> average<00:04:12.020> for<00:04:12.050> something<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.620> this

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
above average for something of this

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.590 
above average for something of this
price<00:04:13.100> if<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.550> sort<00:04:13.760> of<00:04:13.820> look<00:04:14.060> at<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.270> buttons

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
price if you sort of look at the buttons

on<00:04:14.750> this<00:04:14.870> xbox<00:04:15.260> controller<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.770> can<00:04:15.950> see<00:04:16.070> that

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
on this xbox controller you can see that

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.890 
on this xbox controller you can see that
they're<00:04:16.400> really<00:04:16.430> glowing<00:04:17.000> in<00:04:17.269> their<00:04:17.390> own<00:04:17.510> hue

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
they're really glowing in their own hue

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.960 
they're really glowing in their own hue
and<00:04:18.109> actually<00:04:18.500> very<00:04:19.070> distinguished<00:04:19.640> I<00:04:19.790> really

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
and actually very distinguished I really

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.340 
and actually very distinguished I really
think<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.329> color<00:04:20.540> vibrance<00:04:20.959> here<00:04:21.109> is

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
think that the color vibrance here is

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.680 
think that the color vibrance here is
totally<00:04:21.829> on<00:04:21.950> point<00:04:22.220> so<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.090> video<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.510> thing

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
totally on point so the video this thing

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.450 
totally on point so the video this thing
captures<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.290> not<00:04:24.530> the<00:04:24.680> best<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:25.160> mean<00:04:25.280> it's<00:04:25.400> a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
captures is not the best I mean it's a

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.100 
captures is not the best I mean it's a
little<00:04:25.550> bit<00:04:25.790> juddery<00:04:26.150> there's<00:04:26.540> no<00:04:26.690> optical

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
little bit juddery there's no optical

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.690 
little bit juddery there's no optical
image<00:04:27.290> stabilization<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:28.310> although<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.610> is

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
image stabilization and although it is

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.150 
image stabilization and although it is
1080p<00:04:29.270> at<00:04:29.480> 30<00:04:29.660> frames<00:04:29.840> per<00:04:30.020> second<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.830> doesn't

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
1080p at 30 frames per second it doesn't

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.890 
1080p at 30 frames per second it doesn't
quite<00:04:31.310> feel<00:04:31.520> as<00:04:31.700> smooth<00:04:32.000> as<00:04:32.300> something<00:04:32.690> on<00:04:32.810> the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
quite feel as smooth as something on the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.409 
quite feel as smooth as something on the
flagship<00:04:33.350> I<00:04:33.590> think<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.820> overall<00:04:35.240> the

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
flagship I think so that overall the

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.450 
flagship I think so that overall the
camera<00:04:35.720> is<00:04:35.870> really<00:04:36.110> quite<00:04:36.470> good<00:04:36.500> underneath

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
camera is really quite good underneath

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.730

it's<00:05:39.410> average<00:05:39.560> but<00:05:40.490> then<00:05:40.610> us<00:05:40.910> she<00:05:41.090> considered

a bullets flying all over the place but

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.600 
a bullets flying all over the place but
then<00:06:00.320> again<00:06:00.410> it's<00:06:00.650> a<00:06:00.770> decent<00:06:01.130> game<00:06:01.160> at<00:06:01.430> that
