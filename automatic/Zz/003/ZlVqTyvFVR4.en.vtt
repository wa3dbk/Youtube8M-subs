just using regular all-purpose flour

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.340 
just using regular all-purpose flour
which<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.220> also<00:00:17.520> called<00:00:17.850> plain<00:00:18.359> flour<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:19.020> some

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
which is also called plain flour in some

which is also called plain flour in some
countries<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.300> my<00:00:21.449> 1<00:00:21.840> cup<00:00:22.170> of

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
countries so I have my 1 cup of

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.820 
countries so I have my 1 cup of
all-purpose<00:00:22.800> flour<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:24.240> bowl<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.830> simply

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
all-purpose flour in my bowl I simply

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.240 
all-purpose flour in my bowl I simply
grab<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.730> 1<00:00:27.090> tablespoon<00:00:27.720> measure<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.590> I'm

grab a 1 tablespoon measure and I'm
going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> remove<00:00:29.789> 2<00:00:30.630> tablespoons<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.009> there's

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
going to remove 2 tablespoons so there's

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.400

take<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.590> away<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.300> now<00:00:39.300> we're<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
take that away and now we're going to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.920 
take that away and now we're going to
grab<00:00:40.620> our<00:00:40.890> cornstarch<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.510> we're<00:00:42.660> simply

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
grab our cornstarch and we're simply

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.100 
grab our cornstarch and we're simply
going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> add<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:44.480> 1/2<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:51.110> I'll

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
going to add in 1/2 and that is it I'll

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.040 
going to add in 1/2 and that is it I'll
grab<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> whisk<00:00:53.180> then<00:00:54.180> I'll<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.449> whisk<00:00:54.750> this

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
grab a whisk then I'll just whisk this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.180 
grab a whisk then I'll just whisk this
so<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.489> well<00:00:56.670> combined<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:58.190> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
so that's really well combined and that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.260 
so that's really well combined and that
is<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.030> need<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.079> create<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:02.219> own

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
is all you need to do to create your own

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.039 
is all you need to do to create your own
cake<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> pastry<00:01:03.960> flour<00:01:04.110> at<00:01:04.530> home<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.900> by

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
cake and pastry flour at home so by

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
cake and pastry flour at home so by
removing<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.799> little<00:01:08.220> bit<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.460> our<00:01:08.580> flour<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
removing a little bit of our flour and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.490 
removing a little bit of our flour and
adding<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.750> cornstarch

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
adding in cornstarch

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980 
adding in cornstarch
we<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.189> dropped<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.760> overall<00:01:12.390> protein

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we have dropped the overall protein

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.149 
we have dropped the overall protein
content<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> our<00:01:14.369> flour<00:01:15.200> all-purpose<00:01:16.200> flour

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
content of our flour all-purpose flour

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.940 
content of our flour all-purpose flour
is<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:18.030> 10<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.509> 12<00:01:18.780> percent<00:01:18.990> protein

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
is about 10 to 12 percent protein

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
is about 10 to 12 percent protein
however<00:01:20.640> by<00:01:21.000> adding<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.450> cornstarch<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
however by adding in the cornstarch and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
however by adding in the cornstarch and
removing<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.460> bit<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> flour<00:01:23.970> we

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
removing a little bit of the flour we

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.100 
removing a little bit of the flour we
have<00:01:24.810> dropped<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.890> around<00:01:26.009> 8%<00:01:27.110> cake

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
have dropped this down to around 8% cake

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.069 
have dropped this down to around 8% cake
and<00:01:28.320> pastry<00:01:28.740> flour<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:29.310> around<00:01:30.000> 7<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.840> 9

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and pastry flour are around 7 to 9

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
and pastry flour are around 7 to 9
percent<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.829> depends<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> brand<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
percent it depends on the brand that you

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.700 
percent it depends on the brand that you
buy<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.020> have<00:01:34.170> done<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.500> we've

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
buy but what we have done is we've

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.069 
buy but what we have done is we've
dropped<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.220> protein<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.540> happens<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
dropped the protein and what happens is

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.050 
dropped the protein and what happens is
this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.829> give<00:01:38.040> us<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:38.729> tender

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
this is going to give us a more tender

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.380 
this is going to give us a more tender
less<00:01:39.930> chewy<00:01:40.350> type<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.400> batter<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.240> is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
less chewy type of batter when it is

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.380 
less chewy type of batter when it is
baked<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:44.189> there's<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.579> no<00:01:44.820> magic<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
baked so there's really no magic to it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.060 
baked so there's really no magic to it
all<00:01:45.720> we've<00:01:45.930> done<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> we've<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.649> done<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
all we've done is we've just done a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.010 
all we've done is we've just done a
little<00:01:47.430> bit<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.790> mixing<00:01:48.479> around<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.899> some

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
little bit of mixing around with some

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.050 
little bit of mixing around with some
ingredients<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.220> created<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.850> at

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
ingredients and we have created this at

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480 
ingredients and we have created this at
home<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> next<00:01:52.710> time<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.250> a
