hating<00:00:41.870> however<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.200> small<00:00:43.379> mounted<00:00:43.890> dodge

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
hating however the small mounted dodge

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.260 
hating however the small mounted dodge
it<00:00:44.309> provides<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.840> menial<00:00:46.789> it's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.000> really

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
it provides is so menial it's not really

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.389 
it provides is so menial it's not really
worth<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> especially<00:00:48.690> when<00:00:49.260> we're<00:00:49.469> being<00:00:50.039> hit

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
worth it especially when we're being hit

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.760 
worth it especially when we're being hit
in<00:00:51.110> ICC<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:53.129> think<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.789> 20%<00:00:54.090> dodge<00:00:54.770> so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
in ICC for I think it's 20% dodge so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.580 
in ICC for I think it's 20% dodge so
yeah<00:00:56.210> basically<00:00:57.210> look<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.320> feel

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
yeah basically look into what you feel

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.900 
yeah basically look into what you feel
you<00:00:58.770> need<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> most<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> good<00:00:59.670> balance

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you need the most have a good balance

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.959 
you need the most have a good balance
since<00:01:00.449> that's<00:01:01.520> you<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:02.670> want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> be

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
since that's you don't want to be

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.310 
since that's you don't want to be
overpowered<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.570> once<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> then

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
overpowered and once that and then

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.420 
overpowered and once that and then
lacking<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.830> another<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:07.010> if<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.220> feel

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
lacking in another so if you feel

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.250 
lacking in another so if you feel
that<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.150> need<00:01:10.330> more<00:01:10.570> defense<00:01:10.870> than<00:01:10.960> anything

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
that you need more defense than anything

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.610 
that you need more defense than anything
else<00:01:11.560> go<00:01:12.550> ahead<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:13.900> you<00:01:14.050> think<00:01:14.110> you<00:01:14.470> need

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
else go ahead if you think you need

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.190 
else go ahead if you think you need
stamina<00:01:15.010> like<00:01:15.430> I<00:01:15.580> do

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
stamina like I do

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.650 
stamina like I do
stack<00:01:17.200> stamina<00:01:18.180> anything<00:01:19.180> else

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
stack stamina anything else

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.260 
stack stamina anything else
