so<00:00:01.650> today's<00:00:02.250> video<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.820> how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.360> identify<00:00:04.080> if

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
so today's video is how to identify if

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.870 
so today's video is how to identify if
your<00:00:05.009> lucky<00:00:05.370> bamboo<00:00:06.230> has<00:00:07.230> off<00:00:07.710> cut<00:00:08.429> or<00:00:08.700> off

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
your lucky bamboo has off cut or off

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.950 
your lucky bamboo has off cut or off
shoots<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.929> are<00:00:10.080> about<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.469> grow<00:00:11.509> now<00:00:12.509> it's

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
shoots that are about to grow now it's

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.749 
shoots that are about to grow now it's
kind<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.259> hard<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> tell<00:00:13.860> but<00:00:14.429> if<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.639> look

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
kind of hard to tell but if you look

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
kind of hard to tell but if you look
very<00:00:14.790> carefully<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.450> will<00:00:15.870> find<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.320> so

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
very carefully you will find it so

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.570 
very carefully you will find it so
you'll<00:00:17.550> see<00:00:20.630> right<00:00:21.630> over<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.430> don't<00:00:23.430> know

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
you'll see right over here I don't know

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.089 
you'll see right over here I don't know
if<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.390> or<00:00:24.510> not<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.920> you'll<00:00:25.920> see

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
if you can see it or not but you'll see

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.570 
if you can see it or not but you'll see
a<00:00:26.130> little<00:00:26.340> dimple<00:00:28.099> that's<00:00:29.099> coming<00:00:29.460> out<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
a little dimple that's coming out of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.790 
a little dimple that's coming out of
there

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
there

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.040 
there
I'll<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.980> try<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> rotate<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.899> you'll<00:00:33.899> see

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I'll just try to rotate it you'll see

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.180 
I'll just try to rotate it you'll see
that<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> if<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.980> turn<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.370> sideways

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
that there and if I turn it sideways

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.889 
that there and if I turn it sideways
you'll<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.760> slightly<00:00:39.600> higher

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
you'll see that it is slightly higher

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.280 
you'll see that it is slightly higher
there<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.579> an<00:00:42.000> offshoot<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.110> will

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
there so that is an offshoot that will

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.720 
there so that is an offshoot that will
eventually<00:00:43.500> grow<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:45.950> will<00:00:46.950> create<00:00:47.579> an

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
eventually grow and will create an

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.950 
eventually grow and will create an
offshoot<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:50.360> now<00:00:51.360> I'll<00:00:51.690> show<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
offshoot like this now I'll show you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.240 
offshoot like this now I'll show you
another<00:00:52.170> piece<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> lucky<00:00:52.890> bamboo<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:55.250> where

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
another piece of lucky bamboo here where

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.880 
another piece of lucky bamboo here where
I've<00:00:56.879> looked<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.320> don't<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.739> any

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I've looked at it and I don't see any

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.330 
I've looked at it and I don't see any
offshoots<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.289> don't<00:01:01.739> believe<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.160> one

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
offshoots so I don't believe this one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.609 
offshoots so I don't believe this one
here<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.090> any<00:01:03.270> objects<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
here will have any objects but what you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.399 
here will have any objects but what you
want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.930> cut<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.110> lucky

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
want to do is you want to cut this lucky

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
want to do is you want to cut this lucky
bamboo<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.850> able<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.830> produce<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
bamboo to be able to produce more of the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.429 
bamboo to be able to produce more of the
bamboo<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.830> do<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:18.570> want

bamboo now what you can do is you want

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.770 
bamboo now what you can do is you want
to<00:01:19.500> cut<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.220> these<00:01:20.460> stocks<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.630> are

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to cut it off at these stocks that are

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630 
to cut it off at these stocks that are
here<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.860> want<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.249 
here and you want to do that at a
reasonable<00:01:24.360> rate<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:26.420> ideally<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
reasonable rate now ideally what you

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.880 
reasonable rate now ideally what you
want<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.369> shoot<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.680> top

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
want to have is one shoot in the top

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.469 
want to have is one shoot in the top
half<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.729> shoot<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.150> bottom

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
half and then one shoot in the bottom

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.149 
half and then one shoot in the bottom
half<00:01:33.659> now<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.259> case<00:01:34.439> unfortunately<00:01:35.070> we

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
half now in this case unfortunately we

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.770 
half now in this case unfortunately we
don't<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.360> don't<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
don't have that so we don't have the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.550 
don't have that so we don't have the
luxury<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.200> cutting<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:39.409> whereas<00:01:40.409> in

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
luxury of cutting that one whereas in

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.060 
luxury of cutting that one whereas in
this<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.950> here

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.430 

you'll<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.940> that<00:01:45.150> we<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:46.620> this<00:01:46.860> end<00:01:48.440> one

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
you'll see that we have on this end one

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.860 
you'll see that we have on this end one
offshoot<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.790> another<00:01:51.180> option<00:01:51.600> over<00:01:51.840> here

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
offshoot here another option over here

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.010 
offshoot here another option over here
and<00:01:52.800> on<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> top<00:01:53.460> side<00:01:53.730> we'll<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.780> over

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and on the top side we'll see one over

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
and on the top side we'll see one over
here<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.440> one<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:55.800> here<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.370> another<00:01:56.460> one

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
here and one over here and another one

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.600 
here and one over here and another one
over<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.300> we<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.420> three<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:57.930> top<00:01:58.610> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
over here so we have three up top so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.580 
over here so we have three up top so
what<00:01:59.790> we<00:01:59.970> can<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.690> can<00:02:00.900> basically<00:02:01.110> cut

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
what we can do is we can basically cut

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.850 
what we can do is we can basically cut
this<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.890> half<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.900> place<00:02:03.900> this<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.380> water<00:02:04.620> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
this in half and place this on water and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.340 
this in half and place this on water and
that<00:02:05.310> will<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:05.690> grow<00:02:06.690> from<00:02:06.720> there<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:09.360> what

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
that will then grow from there so what

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.230 
that will then grow from there so what
we're<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.740> do<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.370> my<00:02:11.520> next<00:02:11.790> video<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
we're going to do is on my next video I

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.930 
we're going to do is on my next video I
will<00:02:12.360> show<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.780> how<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.410> cut<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.190> how<00:02:14.880> to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
will show you how to cut this and how to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.630 
will show you how to cut this and how to
create<00:02:15.600> off<00:02:15.930> cuttings<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.740> inspire<00:02:17.520> your
