becomes<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.579> tutorial<00:00:43.670> like<00:00:44.670> trying<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
becomes a tutorial like trying to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.670 
becomes a tutorial like trying to
protect<00:00:45.780> their<00:00:45.870> territory<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> other

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
protect their territory from the other

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940 
protect their territory from the other
guinea<00:00:46.890> pig<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:48.260> then<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
guinea pig and then what you can do you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.010 
guinea pig and then what you can do you
can<00:00:50.070> put<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> grid<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> wall<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> playpen<00:00:51.600> if

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
can put a grid a wall in the playpen if

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.500 
can put a grid a wall in the playpen if
you<00:00:52.110> want<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.610> they<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:54.030> smell<00:00:54.329> each

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you want to so then they can smell each

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
you want to so then they can smell each
other<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.110> although<00:00:55.860> there's<00:00:56.070> another

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
other and although there's another

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.599 
other and although there's another
guinea<00:00:56.550> pig<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.899> therefore<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.289> don't

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
guinea pig and so therefore they don't

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
guinea pig and so therefore they don't
fight<00:00:59.609> right<00:00:59.789> away<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> put<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
fight right away and then if you put the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.779 
fight right away and then if you put the
wall<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.309> leave<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.760> that

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
wall in there you can leave it like that

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.260 
wall in there you can leave it like that
for<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.390> half<00:01:03.660> hour<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:05.119> once<00:01:06.119> all

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
for about a half hour and then once all

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.090 
for about a half hour and then once all
the<00:01:06.390> chattering<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.770> squealing

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the chattering and all the squealing

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.420 
the chattering and all the squealing
calms<00:01:08.430> down<00:01:08.750> what<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
calms down what you can do is that you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.880 
calms down what you can do is that you
can<00:01:11.670> take<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.030> grid<00:01:12.330> wall<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> then<00:01:13.530> now

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
can take off the grid wall and then now

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.859 
can take off the grid wall and then now
they<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.250> interact<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.820> each<00:01:14.880> other<00:01:15.030> there

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
they can interact with each other there

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.390 
they can interact with each other there
