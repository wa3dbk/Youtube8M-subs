00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
right about going to a regular screen

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.130 
right about going to a regular screen
rather<00:01:59.370> than<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.640> school<00:01:59.970> for<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.270> blind<00:02:00.300> but

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
rather than a school for the blind but

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.260 
rather than a school for the blind but
at<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.560> time<00:02:01.620> when<00:02:02.400> when<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.760> happened<00:02:03.180> I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
at that time when when that happened I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.360

people<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:06.110> thought<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.440> what<00:02:07.590> can

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
people I thought you know what can

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.830 
people I thought you know what can
people<00:02:07.980> give<00:02:08.460> me<00:02:08.850> credit<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.270> what<00:02:09.540> I've<00:02:09.630> done

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
people give me credit for what I've done

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
people give me credit for what I've done
just<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:10.560> disabled<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.400> they

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
just because I'm disabled like they

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.230 
just because I'm disabled like they
can't<00:02:11.970> see<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.870> skill<00:02:13.230> or<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.620> talent<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.580> I

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
can't see the skill or the talent that I

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.900 
can't see the skill or the talent that I
that<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.690> have<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.650> because<00:02:17.040> they<00:02:17.460> can't<00:02:17.700> see

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
that I have just because they can't see

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.380 
that I have just because they can't see
past<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.900> disability<00:02:19.130> so<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.460> was<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> shift<00:02:20.970> to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
past the disability so it was a shift to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.870 
past the disability so it was a shift to
the<00:02:21.660> challenge<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.320> proving<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.950> them<00:02:23.160> that

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
the challenge of proving to them that

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.280 
the challenge of proving to them that
they<00:02:24.000> were<00:02:24.090> wrong<00:02:24.360> about<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:25.020> know<00:02:25.110> their

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
they were wrong about you know their

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.890 
they were wrong about you know their
misconceptions<00:02:26.220> about<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.760> disabled<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
misconceptions about the disabled and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.870 
misconceptions about the disabled and
and<00:02:28.140> what<00:02:28.380> they<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:28.980> achieve<00:02:29.100> or<00:02:29.580> can't

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
and what they can achieve or can't

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:49.530 
and what they can achieve or can't
achieve

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.960 

we<00:02:50.540> did<00:02:50.840> her<00:02:50.990> watches<00:02:51.770> equipped<00:02:52.070> fairnie<00:02:52.580> like

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
we did her watches equipped fairnie like

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.600 
we did her watches equipped fairnie like
the<00:02:53.120> other<00:02:53.240> steps<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:54.200> she<00:02:54.800> rules<00:02:55.130> about

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
the other steps and she rules about

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:06.100 
the other steps and she rules about
beyond<00:02:56.030> expectations

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.470 

I'm<00:03:07.110> pretty<00:03:07.409> familiar<00:03:07.620> with<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.159> math<00:03:08.480> things

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
I'm pretty familiar with the math things

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.449 
I'm pretty familiar with the math things
happening<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.590> was<00:03:10.799> actually<00:03:11.010> amazed<00:03:11.430> that

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
happening and I was actually amazed that

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.780 
happening and I was actually amazed that
there<00:03:11.819> was<00:03:11.939> fish<00:03:12.170> you<00:03:13.170> know<00:03:13.290> drying<00:03:14.040> stood

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
there was fish you know drying stood

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.300 
there was fish you know drying stood
that<00:03:14.939> would<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:16.129> natural<00:03:17.129> for<00:03:17.159> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that would have to be natural for the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.009 
that would have to be natural for the
Victorian<00:03:17.790> look<00:03:18.120> quite<00:03:18.329> well<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:18.810> not<00:03:18.959> only

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
Victorian look quite well and not only

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.470 
Victorian look quite well and not only
that<00:03:19.349> score<00:03:20.310> very<00:03:20.549> high<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.819> -<00:03:21.030> yep<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.360> then

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
that score very high in - yep and then
