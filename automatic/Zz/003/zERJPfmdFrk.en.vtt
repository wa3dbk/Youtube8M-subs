nine to 11 inches long so here's the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.820 
nine to 11 inches long so here's the
chrome<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:25.080> might<00:00:25.199> take<00:00:25.410> them<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.680> little

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
chrome and it might take them a little

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.419 
chrome and it might take them a little
bit<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.160> time<00:00:26.750> to<00:00:27.750> respond<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:28.980> we'll

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
bit of time to respond to it but we'll

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.540 
bit of time to respond to it but we'll
see<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:30.439> be<00:00:31.439> able<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.679> see<00:00:31.859> how<00:00:32.009> aggressively

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
see I be able to see how aggressively

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.450 
see I be able to see how aggressively
they'll<00:00:32.790> snap<00:00:33.090> at<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.480> too<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.110> grab<00:00:35.100> some<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
they'll snap at it too so grab some of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.979 
they'll snap at it too so grab some of
this<00:00:37.520> several<00:00:38.520> pieces<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:41.570> you'll<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.600> what

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
this several pieces here you'll see what

00:00:42.989 --> 00:01:12.450 
this several pieces here you'll see what
they<00:00:43.170> do

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.399 

as<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:13.060> can<00:01:13.180> see<00:01:13.450> they<00:01:13.630> go<00:01:13.840> at<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.020> pretty

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
as you can see they go at it pretty

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.240 
as you can see they go at it pretty
aggressively

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.600 

and<00:01:20.550> what<00:01:21.120> works<00:01:21.300> here<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.010> if<00:01:23.010> one<00:01:23.310> fish

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and what works here is that if one fish

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.630 
and what works here is that if one fish
goes<00:01:23.820> after<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> curl<00:01:24.870> I<00:01:24.900> mean<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.260> others

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
goes after the curl I mean the others

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
goes after the curl I mean the others
learn<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.820> take<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.030> pretty<00:01:27.360> quickly<00:01:27.660> this<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
learn to take it pretty quickly this is

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.160 
learn to take it pretty quickly this is
the<00:01:28.440> way<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.820> we<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> take<00:01:30.450> pellets

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the way that we got them to take pellets

00:01:31.170 --> 00:02:02.160 
the way that we got them to take pellets
as<00:01:31.320> well

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.200 

and<00:02:02.409> we'll<00:02:02.920> just<00:02:03.189> about<00:02:03.310> always<00:02:03.549> track<00:02:04.000> down

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
and we'll just about always track down

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.900 
and we'll just about always track down
every<00:02:04.509> last<00:02:04.689> piece

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:51.000 

this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.179 

as<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:51.849> see<00:02:52.030> they're<00:02:52.209> pretty<00:02:53.189> voracious

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
as you can see they're pretty voracious

00:02:54.189 --> 00:03:08.730 
as you can see they're pretty voracious
in<00:02:54.430> their<00:02:55.590> appetites<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:56.739> this<00:02:57.040> stuff

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.080 

sort<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.520> as<00:03:09.640> a<00:03:09.990> quick<00:03:10.990> aside<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.530> just<00:03:11.710> fed

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
sort of as a quick aside we just fed

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.000 
sort of as a quick aside we just fed
this<00:03:13.090> tank<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.480> bunch<00:03:13.660> of<00:03:13.750> pellets<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
this tank a bunch of pellets so the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.830

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
has been searching around for some

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:33.520 
has been searching around for some
Hikari<00:03:26.290> massive<00:03:26.830> warp<00:03:27.070> pellets

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.540 

smaller<00:03:34.250> Gator<00:03:34.610> in<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:34.940> background<00:03:39.310> here<00:03:40.310> the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.470 

and<00:04:03.710> one<00:04:04.069> fish<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.520> also<00:04:04.850> searching<00:04:05.360> around

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
and one fish is also searching around

unfortunately these Cubans don't like

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.940 
unfortunately these Cubans don't like
pellet<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:12.790> they<00:04:12.940> mainly<00:04:13.269> just<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.950> whole

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950
