00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760 
to go one step further tomorrow oh yeah
definitely<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.180> would<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.630> that's<00:01:46.020> that's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
definitely I would like to that's that's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.240 
definitely I would like to that's that's
my<00:01:46.860> main<00:01:47.130> goal<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.960> far<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.560> haven't<00:01:49.890> won

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
my main goal and so far I haven't won

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.969 
my main goal and so far I haven't won
two<00:01:50.460> titles<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.060> row<00:01:51.090> week<00:01:51.689> by<00:01:51.899> week<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.439> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
two titles in a row week by week and I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.050 
two titles in a row week by week and I
think<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:55.430> nice<00:01:56.430> nice

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
think this would be a really nice nice

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.620 
think this would be a really nice nice
end<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.320> good<00:01:58.710> week<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.280> i<00:02:00.000> still

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
but first oh well I won't know I

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.650 
but first oh well I won't know I
creditor<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.920> guy<00:02:31.100> with<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.640> outside<00:02:32.510> of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
creditor it's a guy with the outside of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.750 
creditor it's a guy with the outside of
probably<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.290> best<00:02:33.500> movement<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.520> cord

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
probably the best movement on the cord

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.800 
probably the best movement on the cord
and<00:02:35.260> hitting<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.380> ball<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:37.130> clean<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.810> very

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
and hitting the ball so clean and very

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720 
and hitting the ball so clean and very
fast<00:02:39.170> means<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.800> he<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:39.950> very<00:02:40.250> close<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.550> the

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
fast means that he is very close to the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.000 
fast means that he is very close to the
baseline<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.450> doesn't<00:02:41.870> give<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.560> much<00:02:42.590> time

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
baseline and doesn't give you much time

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.900 
baseline and doesn't give you much time
at<00:02:43.250> all<00:02:43.340> really<00:02:44.300> returning<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.830> would<00:02:46.190> say<00:02:46.370> the
