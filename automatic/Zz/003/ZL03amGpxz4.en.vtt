00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello swami marakasi you are watching 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.660
 transfer chic position issue 93 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 and we start with an interesting position on 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.049
 new map stalingrad squared f 0 and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.380
 it is worth going here for a fast average 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.600
 tank with good way and position 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.960
 allows to highlight value 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.869
 there are certainly a lot of enemies here 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 and your allies are not averse to them 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.390
 shoot yourself and of course you are here 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.670
 You can do great damage here. 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.280
 there is such an interesting chamber 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.280
 under the cars through which it is very convenient 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.850
 shoot but the enemies will be difficult for 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.579
 you get to but the position is of course very 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.730
 dangerous because you can here 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.670
 throw art probably will be able to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.399
 get around the enemies on the right like this hevik 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.609
 and then they will be able to easily 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 shoot well and so the whole position 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.760
 quite cheerful cheerful and interesting i 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.400
 I advise all the same to go here platoon well 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.409
 or at least should cover you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:17.369
 allies then everything will be quite 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:20.040
 okay next position too 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.150
 is on the map of stalingrad in the square 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.790
 f6 is worth going here on a fast tank with 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.880
 strong tower and preferably here you can 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.880
 perfectly highlight the passing tanks in 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.400
 the beginning of the battle and of course you can 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.890
 shoot besides here it can be a little 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.189
 by tank tower due to these 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.860
 debris opponents quite likely 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.369
 they will want you to avenge you 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.259
 caused them damage and will expect you but in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.590
 Basically it is good for you 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.840
 You can also go back a little and already 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.290
 shoot at enemies right here 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.280
 for sure they will not expect you 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.219
 appear here 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 and thus at least two a 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.759
 maybe even 300 shots done 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.649
 unmatched overall position is quite good though 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.390
 a little risky yet you 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.450
 heading out to center next comes the position on 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.940
 map south coast squared d 9 you 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.300
 need a low medium tank with 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.430
 solid tower such as for example t-34 2 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.099
 object 140 we or t-62a and here you can 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.769
 great to tank due to bumpy 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.580
 relief and restrain enemies who 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.310
 try to break through the center you can 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.190
 it's good to damage them even if your 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.440
 Tank bad in Mr. anyway here it is possible 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.040
 very convenient to shoot 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.010
 Well, and besides, here you can somehow ogre 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.050
 take on enemies to your allies 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.050
 maybe their houses are wives 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.620
 Next is another good position on 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.200
 map of stalingrad in square f2 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.660
 it is worth going there on an average tank with 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.120
 sturdy tower tactics of course 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.550
 risky and worth the ride here 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.650
 if you know what allies are 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.989
 will cover you from three attempts 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.720
 use this position all were 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.959
 successful and put at least 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.319
 four thousand damage but there is also a chance 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.540
 Institute if the allies do not support 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.510
 also worth noting that pretty 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.250
 often here you can meet this sale though 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.769
 at the expense of debris here you can well 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.950
 tank turret and disassemble any 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.739
 enemy recommend here to go to the top 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.200
 when a lot of low-level technology in 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.750
 In this case, even meeting a group 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.090
 enemies can be very effectively disassemble 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.989
 them again provided that behind 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.950
 allies 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.500
 Art here naturally does not shoot through 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:03.680
 Overall cheerful attitude is very funny 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.660
 but risky last for today 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.989
 position is on stalingrad map in 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.290
 square d5 position though simple but 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.350
 but safe it is well suited for 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.169
 tanks with punch and precision gun 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.350
 if your tank has a good overview then 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.960
 You can light those who travel in the center and 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.780
 shoot them this place is good 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.120
 protected and easy to hide here but when 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.150
 this and the enemy is also in the shelter 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.000
 therefore, a powerful weapon is required to 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.860
 punching those who try there 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.960
 you can also damage damage sometimes 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.780
 catch some rascher 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.830
 and disassemble it artov here it seems not 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.050
 should get 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.229
 although I'm more likely all the same 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.419
 There is and on this all friends thanks for 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.400
