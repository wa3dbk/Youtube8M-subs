00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Good afternoon, dear submarine hunters 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.830
 in this video plot we will talk to you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.750
 about a premium suit in marlin ears 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.179
 prestige 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.490
 This costume is the main advantage 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.839
 which in my opinion is very 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.779
 elastic neoprene 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.670
 as you know, what they took stich by some 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.470
 he better adapt to the figure 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.869
 an underwater hunter that is better 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.289
 sticks accordingly warms better 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.390
 further the suit has 3d camouflage under 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.980
 seaweed 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.620
 Here it looks like this way to me 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.950
 like in a suit very few seams like 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.160
 it is known that the less words the brighter 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.379
 a suit breast pad is also made 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.760
 3d 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.460
 element that is , we have a simple 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.980
 armithex and gain and then convex 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.640
 arno test gain all gone then 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.000
 very beautiful high quality seams very 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.909
 very high quality ie seams 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.240
 you almost don't feel like they are here 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240
 in this way 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.049
 the costume helmet is sewn 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.220
 the suit has an anatomical cut bobry 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.080
 the tail is made of very elastic 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 stretching the material that is for what 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.240
 it's good when we take off the costume we 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.050
 Russia world tail and superimposed 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.090
 good toughness so as not to burst 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.869
 let's say cold water wait for protein 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.860
 in this way it looks like this 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.610
 us a jacket and she has two clips also 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.080
 on a suit 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:59.940
 in the area of â€‹â€‹the elbows there is a scent of this and 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:04.890
 anti abrasion reinforcement 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.240
 that last to the end of the hands and on the hands 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.450
 we have 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.310
 obturation is also stitched here 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.090
 I did the obturation itself which 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:20.730
 It goes more just as you do not know what 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:24.209
 better fit your hand that on and off 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.410
 we are made with lyamochkami lyamochkami 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:37.430
 also stitched here so as not to peel off 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:40.019
 not right here amiss April kneecaps 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.110
 very big 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.030
 go to the end of the legs made of material 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.790
 rmat with also highlighted 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.670
 this format with thicker 3d camouflage 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.920
 and here we kept the drawing part 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.920
 3d camouflage elements 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.900
 the suit has an anatomical cut 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.489
 here we see how our knees are bent 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.370
 human natural position knees 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:10.019
 curved and kneeling we have 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.150
 special items that help 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:17.600
 underwater hunter but when moving 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:21.269
 like bending your knees more elastic 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.120
 perform these movements so as not to 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:28.100
 hold down hunter movements exactly 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.240
 is this element made and 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.910
 on elbows more precisely under elbows 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.220
 suit is recommended especially in the cold 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.300
 time of year when costume requirements 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.450
 very very demanding and how good 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.450
 great suit look suit
