00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.910
 now I am we would avoid video has the 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.549
 first time you see me very happy 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.290
 It is an honor to do with you how they are 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.480
 today I bring you like a 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.549
 emotion a little rougher than always 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.690
 because the dismissal reasons for my 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.640
 inner happiness 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.960
 the first one is because last week there 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.089
 I could upload video for questions 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.570
 I do not feel I do not know what is that I think 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.099
 of marriage nothing 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.510
 I do not know how to explain it the video is 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.400
 strange then I bring like that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.530
 accumulated happiness have to endure 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.879
 a little more so you know the second one is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.220
 because I just learned to make some 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.750
 nails have to know that they have to 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.460
 know that this is already like that of the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590
 old school what does it mean that no 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.090
 it's like nothing new but it does not matter 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.710
 because as well as I already all the ignite 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 surely there will be someone who does not know 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.760
 and it's good for you and this video is going 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 to be quick as you can the time of 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.039
 Grandpa, let's start with the video 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.190
 and now that I saw three tips in case 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.679
 Do you want your husband to be like you? 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.839
 it's perfect I do not know if it would be but I 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.880
 it sounds like finally then watling 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.740
 are three very basic things but I think 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.780
 that many times like we forget 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.580
 he and our so father the first one is that 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.320
 for example follow the ribbon networks of 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.320
 before other than the jewelry we 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.900
 to start from scratch many latitudes 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.090
 your dreams are the same size as the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.550
 same shape is shortened from them 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.900
 fabrics so you do not have one thing left 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.610
 mind and the other you want to go like 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.830
 people who bite them that is not 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.330
 like that very attractive I would like 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.450
 have them long but I always have 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.590
 cortitas man had all that 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.060
 I the truth is that I do not sew and 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.190
 realize in dreams and I always have them 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.440
 as painted he did not let them breathe and 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.720
 to live happy I am always stressed 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.640
 frustrated or in an uncomfortable situation 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.710
 I start to remove the nail polish with my nails 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.229
 or currents carries like that ripping 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.570
 it's not something either of my 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.280
 Banking the nail cachos not but sincere 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.320
 like wearing down and then staying with 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.090
 layers that that ugly when you get them good 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.070
 that paints also in the same ones that you 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.690
 they serve for the top part not with 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.600
 any because if you're not going to stay 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.759
 with terol or without nails do not see buy yourself a 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.410
 special and as they have several sections 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.270
 after which and you have left 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.730
 shining and now let's start 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.370
 tell us the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.769
 alone with appointments for makeup 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.269
 a little water three tapes that you like 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.610
 how are they together 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.590
 the combination a color nail polish 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 white that will be the base last 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.700
 a little nail polish remover 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.840
 exaggerate exaggerate a little less and some 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.420
 of these 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.489
 let's start painting all of them 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.050
 our nails white because it goes 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.000
 to be the base since they are all 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.310
 painted let's wait for it to dry 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.920
 super good as I am the most 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.840
 desperate over life he used a 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.299
 spray that I just bought in sant and that 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:58.239
 I love it because to have the process of 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:59.530
 dried if you want that there is that 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.120
 enter skin you do not have this you can 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.650
 use any oil you have in 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.960
 your house carefully without ruining your 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.850
 nails I felt like a drink 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.350
 let's start putting our sponge 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.350
 in water and removing all the excess 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.000
 it's like he's a gentleman in you but 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.770
 without a lot of pressure 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.850
 some color I do not want to be marked 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.850
 you can touch up 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.600
 and at the end with acetone in a well 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.460
 these remove all the excesses but for 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.170
 save you this step you can use a 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.209
 little Vaseline alguerÃ³ 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.520
 so I'm going to put a shine to make 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:45.590
 that these problems the poor do not see 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.590
 good for the light but I leave a photo 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.340
 remember that we have facebook and that 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.680
 we have in the you can follow me and those 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.150
 things had they wrote everything silly that 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.430
 it occurs to me during the day only 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.810
 I have a facebook on twitter the only ones 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.820
 that I have I have it in the part of 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.530
 down the others are scammers because 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.730
 not only did it hurt my heart 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.680
 for certain the truth does not matter to me but 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.600
 I do not care what you think ximena 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.320
 so if the links are very good 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.460
 I leave you at the bottom and 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.080
 not overwhelming me claim that that 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.370
 it's not Fridays watching the videos 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.370
 young children 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.350
 and we also have twitter for 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.220
 then we can all tolerate someone 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.220
 excuse the light 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.680
 and then when I do that I kind of like 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.680
 wears 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:54.040
 they sell them in beauty stores and in 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:56.460
 beauty and value that's why it's not going 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.460
