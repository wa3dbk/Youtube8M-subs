nope that's pretty much it and here is

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.999 
nope that's pretty much it and here is
the<00:01:23.159> case<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.830> is

the case so as you can see it is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.920 
the case so as you can see it is
actually<00:01:27.680> two<00:01:28.680> tone<00:01:28.920> colors<00:01:29.630> this<00:01:30.630> particular

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
actually two tone colors this particular

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.120 
actually two tone colors this particular
one<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.369> gunmetal<00:01:32.790> color<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.890> this<00:01:34.890> one

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
one is the gunmetal color and this one

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.069 
one is the gunmetal color and this one
has<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.840> rubber<00:01:36.840> casing<00:01:37.290> inside<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.009> outside

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
this is a little bit harder plastic so

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
this is a little bit harder plastic so
let's<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> device<00:01:47.790> inside<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:50.090> case<00:01:51.170> so

two pieces and i'm going to apply the
rubber<00:02:00.840> version<00:02:01.350> first<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.790> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
rubber version first as you can see it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.240 
rubber version first as you can see it
is<00:02:03.360> applied<00:02:03.689> already<00:02:04.369> now<00:02:05.369> i'm<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.090> fit

is applied already now i'm going to fit
the<00:02:08.250> plastic<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.060> hard<00:02:09.239> plastic<00:02:09.420> version<00:02:10.050> so

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the plastic the hard plastic version so

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.280 
the plastic the hard plastic version so
first<00:02:11.430> i<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:12.000> put<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.480> side<00:02:12.720> because

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
first i will put this side because

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.649 
first i will put this side because
there<00:02:13.469> are<00:02:13.680> buttons<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.849> side<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
there are buttons on this side and the

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.490 
there are buttons on this side and the
other<00:02:15.719> side<00:02:15.860> was<00:02:16.860> very<00:02:17.189> easy<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.700> put<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:19.170> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
other side was very easy to put so the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.000 
other side was very easy to put so the
case<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:19.769> actually<00:02:20.930> little<00:02:21.930> bit<00:02:22.140> actually

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
case is actually little bit actually

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.250 
case is actually little bit actually
quite<00:02:23.219> a<00:02:23.250> lot<00:02:23.489> bulkier<00:02:24.420> as<00:02:24.629> compared<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.590> the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
quite a lot bulkier as compared to the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.479 
quite a lot bulkier as compared to the
official<00:02:28.260> HTC<00:02:28.769> one<00:02:29.400> case<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:31.189> however<00:02:32.189> it

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
official HTC one case and however it

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.630 
official HTC one case and however it
seems<00:02:32.909> to<00:02:33.409> provide<00:02:34.409> a<00:02:34.470> nice<00:02:35.010> bit<00:02:35.609> of

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
seems to provide a nice bit of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.710 
seems to provide a nice bit of
protection<00:02:36.019> because<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.650> will<00:02:37.859> actually

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
protection because it will actually

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.750 
protection because it will actually
sustain<00:02:39.720> most<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.230> your<00:02:40.500> from<00:02:40.920> even<00:02:41.579> edge

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
sustain most of your from even edge

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.869 
sustain most of your from even edge
impacts<00:02:42.569> as<00:02:42.719> well<00:02:43.049> at<00:02:43.379> least<00:02:44.129> that's<00:02:44.430> what<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
impacts as well at least that's what it

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.220 
claims and I have no way to test this

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
brand new HTC One m8 so let's check out

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.479 
brand new HTC One m8 so let's check out
the<00:02:56.730> cutouts<00:02:57.239> at<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.720> bottom<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.169> have

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
the cutouts at the bottom we have

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.170 
the cutouts at the bottom we have
cutouts<00:02:59.489> for<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.000> micro<00:03:00.750> USB<00:03:01.109> cable<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
cutouts for the micro USB cable and the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.830 
cutouts for the micro USB cable and the
headphone<00:03:03.180> jack<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:05.239> on<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.389> side<00:03:06.599> actually

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
headphone jack and on the side actually

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.069 
headphone jack and on the side actually
we<00:03:07.200> don't<00:03:07.409> have<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.829> cutouts<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:08.939> the<00:03:09.419> volume

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
we don't have the cutouts for the volume

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.460 
we don't have the cutouts for the volume
button<00:03:10.439> rather<00:03:10.709> we<00:03:10.919> have<00:03:11.209> rubber<00:03:12.209> wrap<00:03:12.689> button

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
button rather we have rubber wrap button

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.670 
button rather we have rubber wrap button
for<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.950> volume<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:14.810> let's<00:03:15.810> see<00:03:16.019> how<00:03:16.290> well<00:03:16.650> it

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
for the volume and let's see how well it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.879 
for the volume and let's see how well it
works<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.400> as<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.510> can<00:03:18.690> see<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:19.139> works<00:03:19.470> nicely

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
works and as you can see it works nicely

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.909 
works and as you can see it works nicely
there<00:03:20.340> are<00:03:20.549> no<00:03:20.729> issues<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.620> same<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.799> case

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
there are no issues and same is the case

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.089 
there are no issues and same is the case
with<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.340> top<00:03:23.549> power<00:03:23.760> button<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:24.449> has<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
with the top power button it has the

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.640 
with the top power button it has the
rubber<00:03:26.099> padding<00:03:26.699> on<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.030> top<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.629> it<00:03:28.229> works

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
rubber padding on the top and it works

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.710 
rubber padding on the top and it works
pretty<00:03:29.400> well<00:03:29.549> no<00:03:30.419> issues<00:03:30.720> here<00:03:32.329> also<00:03:33.329> if<00:03:33.540> you

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
pretty well no issues here also if you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.330 
pretty well no issues here also if you
look<00:03:33.930> from<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.290> side<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.769> does<00:03:34.919> have<00:03:35.099> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
look from the side it does have the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.170 
look from the side it does have the
raised<00:03:35.639> edges<00:03:36.329> so<00:03:37.109> it's<00:03:38.040> going<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.400> withstand

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
raised edges so it's going to withstand

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.219 
raised edges so it's going to withstand
most<00:03:39.989> of<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:40.290> impact<00:03:40.680> even<00:03:41.250> if<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.940> fell<00:03:42.329> face

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
most of the impact even if it fell face

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:47.119 
most of the impact even if it fell face
down<00:03:43.849> only<00:03:44.849> problem<00:03:45.449> will<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.129> small

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
down only problem will be the small

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.580 
down only problem will be the small
pebbles<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.879> rocks<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.659> will<00:03:48.989> touch<00:03:49.530> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
pebbles and rocks that will touch the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.640 
pebbles and rocks that will touch the
screen<00:03:49.979> and<00:03:50.400> which<00:03:51.060> can<00:03:51.299> bypass<00:03:51.599> these<00:03:52.109> edges

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
screen and which can bypass these edges

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.099 
screen and which can bypass these edges
but<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.190> flat<00:03:53.430> surfaces<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.269> don't<00:03:54.449> think<00:03:54.540> it

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
but the flat surfaces I don't think it

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.629 
but the flat surfaces I don't think it
will<00:03:55.349> be<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> problem<00:03:55.859> because<00:03:56.250> this

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
will be a problem because this

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.830 
will be a problem because this
particular<00:03:57.680> side<00:03:58.680> has<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.180> plastic<00:04:00.180> as<00:04:00.629> well

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
particular side has the plastic as well

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.170 
particular side has the plastic as well
as<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.199> rubber<00:04:01.500> padding<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:02.609> it's<00:04:02.909> going<00:04:03.090> to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
as the rubber padding so it's going to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.309 
as the rubber padding so it's going to
sustain<00:04:03.659> most<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.199> the<00:04:04.409> impacts<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:06.169> still<00:04:07.169> it

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
sustain most of the impacts and still it

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.360 
sustain most of the impacts and still it
looks<00:04:07.500> nice<00:04:07.829> but<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.819> has<00:04:09.090> made<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.340> device<00:04:11.340> a

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
looks nice but it has made the device a

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.869 
looks nice but it has made the device a
lot<00:04:11.790> bulkier<00:04:12.359> as<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:12.989> see<00:04:13.259> here<00:04:13.889> so<00:04:14.609> for

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
lot bulkier as you can see here so for

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.969 
lot bulkier as you can see here so for
the<00:04:15.060> protection<00:04:15.659> sometimes<00:04:16.259> you<00:04:16.440> have<00:04:16.470> to

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
the protection sometimes you have to

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.280 
the protection sometimes you have to
sacrifice<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.509> thin<00:04:18.870> as

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
sacrifice the thin as

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.500 
sacrifice the thin as
and<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:20.430> form<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.330> device<00:04:21.630> I'm<00:04:22.290> not<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:23.510> fan

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
and the form of the device I'm not a fan

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.820 
and the form of the device I'm not a fan
of<00:04:24.780> such<00:04:25.110> type<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.350> cases<00:04:26.000> but<00:04:27.000> since<00:04:27.270> i

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
of such type of cases but since i

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.160 
of such type of cases but since i
actually<00:04:28.830> prefer<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.610> use<00:04:29.820> speakin<00:04:30.570> cases<00:04:30.960> so

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
actually prefer to use speakin cases so

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.550 
actually prefer to use speakin cases so
I<00:04:31.200> like<00:04:31.620> this<00:04:31.860> case<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:33.570> brought<00:04:33.840> this<00:04:34.320> one

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
I like this case and I brought this one

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.660 
I like this case and I brought this one
just<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.580> test<00:04:35.820> how<00:04:36.450> well<00:04:36.840> this<00:04:37.710> one<00:04:37.920> goes<00:04:38.160> if<00:04:38.520> I

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
just to test how well this one goes if I

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.790 
just to test how well this one goes if I
find<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.600> this<00:04:39.810> is<00:04:40.020> too<00:04:40.200> heavy<00:04:40.410> then

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
find that this is too heavy then

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.140 
find that this is too heavy then
obviously<00:04:41.370> i'm<00:04:41.940> gonna<00:04:42.090> replace<00:04:43.820> this<00:04:44.820> case

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
obviously i'm gonna replace this case

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.110 
obviously i'm gonna replace this case
with<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.840> either<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.890> official<00:04:47.580> case<00:04:47.790> or

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
with the either the official case or

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.440 
with the either the official case or
some<00:04:48.420> other<00:04:49.110> thin<00:04:49.650> case<00:04:50.090> so<00:04:51.090> i'm<00:04:51.180> going<00:04:51.330> to

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
some other thin case so i'm going to

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.180 
some other thin case so i'm going to
test<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.840> remote<00:04:52.140> control<00:04:52.530> functionality<00:04:52.920> of

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
test the remote control functionality of

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.570 
test the remote control functionality of
the<00:04:53.670> HTC<00:04:54.210> One<00:04:54.480> m8<00:04:54.930> whether<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:56.280> remote

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
the HTC One m8 whether the remote

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.070 
the HTC One m8 whether the remote
functionality<00:04:57.150> works<00:04:57.420> with<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:59.220> case<00:04:59.580> on

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
functionality works with the the case on

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.440 
functionality works with the the case on
so<00:05:01.080> I'm<00:05:01.350> back<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.860> actually<00:05:02.490> i<00:05:02.700> have<00:05:02.880> tested

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
so I'm back and actually i have tested

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.740 
so I'm back and actually i have tested
the<00:05:03.920> remote<00:05:04.920> control<00:05:05.310> functionality<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:06.330> it

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
the remote control functionality and it

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.590 
the remote control functionality and it
is<00:05:06.930> not<00:05:07.260> working<00:05:07.770> at<00:05:08.220> all<00:05:08.400> from<00:05:09.150> any<00:05:09.390> distance

even from the closest point i am not

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.990 
even from the closest point i am not
able<00:05:13.170> to<00:05:13.410> turn<00:05:13.590> on<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.920> TV<00:05:14.070> using<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.820> remote

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.450 
able to turn on the TV using the remote
control<00:05:15.630> function<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:16.740> if<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.980> are<00:05:17.070> going<00:05:17.280> to

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
control function so if you are going to

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.730 
control function so if you are going to
buy<00:05:17.640> this<00:05:17.700> case<00:05:18.150> obviously<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:19.290> need<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.560> keep

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
buy this case obviously you need to keep

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.040 
buy this case obviously you need to keep
in<00:05:19.890> mind<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.790> are<00:05:20.820> going<00:05:21.150> to<00:05:21.330> lose<00:05:21.720> the

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
in mind that you are going to lose the

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.930 
in mind that you are going to lose the
remote<00:05:23.120> control<00:05:24.120> functionality<00:05:24.800> so<00:05:25.940> actually

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
remote control functionality so actually

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.420 
remote control functionality so actually
when<00:05:27.120> i<00:05:27.180> bought<00:05:27.690> this<00:05:27.870> case<00:05:28.140> it<00:05:28.830> was<00:05:29.100> not

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
when i bought this case it was not

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.470 
when i bought this case it was not

it is listed I probably might have

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.000 
it is listed I probably might have
missed<00:05:37.340> this<00:05:38.340> particular<00:05:39.380> function<00:05:40.380> of<00:05:40.620> this

missed this particular function of this

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.850 
missed this particular function of this
case<00:05:41.340> or<00:05:41.820> rather<00:05:42.090> lack<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.290> function<00:05:43.710> you<00:05:43.830> can

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
case or rather lack of function you can

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.810
