00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
white pipe on the back of the machine

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.200 
white pipe on the back of the machine
and<00:00:27.310> it<00:00:27.369> goes<00:00:27.609> all<00:00:27.820> to<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:28.180> sink<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:29.820> blow<00:00:30.820> a

and I also blow out from here I can see

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.130 
and I also blow out from here I can see
that<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:44.320> inside<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:44.980> machine<00:00:45.430> is<00:00:46.140> is

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
that the inside of the machine is is

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.290 
that the inside of the machine is is
also<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:50.289> inside<00:00:51.250> of<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.489> machine<00:00:51.820> is<00:00:51.969> also

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
also the inside of the machine is also

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.260 
also the inside of the machine is also
working<00:00:53.110> no<00:00:53.530> problem<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:57.309> comes<00:00:57.969> to<00:00:58.180> the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
working no problem and it comes to the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
here when I start the machine it goes

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.670 
here when I start the machine it goes
through<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.910> washing<00:01:04.600> cycles<00:01:05.080> no<00:01:05.260> problem

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
through the washing cycles no problem

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.969 
through the washing cycles no problem
but<00:01:05.860> when<00:01:06.400> it<00:01:06.490> comes<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.119> drain<00:01:07.450> cycle

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
but when it comes to drain cycle

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.960 
but when it comes to drain cycle
I<00:01:09.689> hear<00:01:10.689> the<00:01:10.869> click<00:01:11.170> sound<00:01:11.490> must<00:01:12.490> rub<00:01:12.760> it's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
because the water water comes through

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.810 
because the water water comes through
here<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.250> there<00:02:54.550> might<00:02:54.730> be<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:55.120> leak<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.570> here
