00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.889
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.410
 from me in this video introduces you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.139
 again a new trick of tauss before 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.990
 This is an extension for the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.539
 Camera app and is called camera tweak 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.010
 I'm going to the camera app now 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.980
 I 'll take it that's easy 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.289
 times out of the iphone age so it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.640
 you can see it all better once 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.470
 we here in the display this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.149
 button which you simply activate 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 or disable 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.260
 I can then once the white balance 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.860
 enable or disable 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.600
 as I would like that and then 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.500
 then pretty much down on this other one 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.899
 button can click and if i am there 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 go up once in the first field 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.129
 I once the possibility of the normal 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.989
 Mode so with the normal autofocus 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.149
 and so to choose here 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.250
 and when I go up here 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.890
 press then we come this new one 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.799
 mode I would like to enter here now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.840
 then take a look at iphone 5 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.729
 moment is that still pretty dark and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.820
 what this circle chases him here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.890
 move then this turns on this 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.030
 has a place where that has brighter or 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.530
 should be darker 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.689
 So if I'm the circle here until 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.580
 Move down there is the silence 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.170
 brighter then the whole picture gets darker 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.020
 if I move this up 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.820
 then the whole picture up there is just 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.100
 the whole thing gets a little bit darker 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.720
 Image gets that will with the normal 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.490
 I can still square here 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.040
 to choose the sharpness at which point 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.770
 now the focus should be set 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.850
 and so on which one here again 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.540
 normal pure press yes then it is again 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.060
 all in one 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.970
 and which whole is disabled again 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.939
 the made autofokus as well as the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.920
 iphone camera is the field then 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.320
 just there I can do such a timelapse 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.270
 to make shots which always all 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.640
 select two seconds 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.689
 I can also select minutes 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.100
 I just have to go down to this one 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.259
 press two arrows 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.390
 he is standing every two minutes but me 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.619
 I want to stay here now because we do not have enough 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 time just have seconds 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.230
 If I now here the photo 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.690
 then do you see 2 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.120
 once and now the picture is taken 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.200
 the whole thing repeats itself then all 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.670
 two seconds 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.680
 and i can be a super 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.180
 then make time-lapse shots too 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.620
 Now you want to stop again 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.799
 just here in the middle of this 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.519
 Press fabric symbol 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.769
 next to it we have the 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.110
 self-timer because I want two times 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.299
 seconds off and also like when 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.340
 previous will be after two seconds 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.420
 the photo just made it today depending on today 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.150
 then just have one again 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.459
 self-timer and then I can here 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.349
 activate this grid if I 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.269
 that's what we have then just this 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.980
 strange grid here is also quite 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.410
 handy for some photos you have 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.290
 he would like to do it completely 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.810
 different so that you go the old ones 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.879
 now the photo gives which the whole 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.250
 go again on video there is there 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.840
 also other attitudes also here 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.180
 I can then the white balance of course 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.670
 reactivate or then down here 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.239
 with the button I can then also here 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.340
 Again this mode with the lighting 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.220
 The sensor of each setting you have to 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.760
 just more then a little bit through 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.459
 then fix it when I'm at it on this 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.069
 horse I can go here this frame 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.829
 Rate change depending on how many pictures 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.750
 has to be done per second 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.000
 I would always do that though 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.889
 30 let that is quite normal too 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.959
 then I can take good care of it then 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:44.130
 So the resolution will change from 960 x 540 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:47.700
 or 1920 x 1080 what is the normal 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.709
 resolution is 1280x720 and so on 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.319
 there are a lot of different and 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.690
 then on the far right I can see the size 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.760
 a I would have activated here 4 x 3 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.540
 then I can still activate here 16 9 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:04.799
 or two to 35 to 1 there are too 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.209
 very different resolution formats yes 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.010
 It should be all over again 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.099
 been from this new one 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.400
