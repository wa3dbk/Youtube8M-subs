00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.820
 Yesterday I talked about the release of the Grand Theft Auto 5 and how 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.450
 Hold the Schultz edge on a copy of the game the next day 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.040
 The shooting took place at the Washington DC Maritime Square 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.309
 In part blame this and other violent video games for violence, we are 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.310
 This is completely rejected and there is no evidence that the academy 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.000
 Refers to a violent video game or violent film that causes some people to commit violence 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.510
 Laws 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.189
 We also learned now that the Grand Theft Auto 5 has got eight hundred 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.580
 Million dollars 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.680
 The first day they went out around the world 24 hours 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.500
 Eight hundred million dollars Lewis is absolutely incredible 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.809
 If compared to some movies versions 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.170
 Top three owners this year at the box office movie or Ironman 3 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.590
 (2) and a man of a solid man of iron 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.820
 663 million 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.020
 Grand Theft Auto in One Day $ 800 Million Of course Grand Theft Auto costs a lot 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.640
 More 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.149
 Who shall do to one ticket to a man of iron and a shield to tell you that 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.729
 This is really a start to be another one of the ways that rifle sets 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.330
 Attention is diverted from the fact of the gun problem for a while we had 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.030
 Mental health databases 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 Which we discussed in one way or another implicitly racist manner 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.460
 Now that there were a number of other things too 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.110
 Gun-free zones and so on, and now they are starting to turn their attention to 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.600
 Video game so we have to expect this to continue 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.810
 I got voicemail actually for being a video game 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.909
 I want to play this for you now Hi David 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.430
 Michelle Love I just want to thank you for defending the reality 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.729
 Video Games Voting Video Game Full 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.820
 Arm hysteria I have funny 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.180
 I have never heard of anyone bring up 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.460
 This point has been the answer to video games 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.950
 In seven days, the time grew exponentially more popular 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 Realistic in 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.210
 I think is a violent video games Warcraft X right and yes everyone knows that 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.530
 Between the nineteen seventies and now that violence has generally declined 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.789
 She now has here the thing to play devil's advocate 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.280
 Violence has declined since the 1970s 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.950
 Even with violent video games but you could make the case maybe it could have been 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.970
 Come down without them even just a fact 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.420
 That violence has really declined does not prove any kind of causal relationship there 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.569
 But to be told we do not have any evidence to suggest that video games 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.190
 Actually make people violent 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.610
 And it's just an amazing amount of money Louis Video Game to make it one 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.950
 day 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.470
 It is I hear the cost of the game about 160 million to make 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.040
 I do but you know what is constantly putting a very big game and I think they have got it 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.840
 Divorced
