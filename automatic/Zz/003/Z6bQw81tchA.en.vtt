00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.220
 full top therefore not to 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.680
 keep you waiting only do 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.720

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.699
 enough requests then it is always possible 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.559
 only need to add

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.369
 once understood everything go to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.290
 today's topic is often what I think and 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.229
 many of you watching some kind of anime 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.270
 come across a certain scene that 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.030
 out of the general meaning of the series 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.690
 you wonder why you don't understand 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 It was 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.580
 or what it actually came from right now 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.770
 about and will be composed 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.860
 top spoiler be sorry 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.860
 let's get started 5 of the strangest anime scenes 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.479
 Here I personally hit the one who says that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.860
 they say you bend it is just a joke 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.930
 so much fun ha ha ha this is stupid not 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.170
 understand why she can laugh 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.290
 just someone very much in comedy genre 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.090
 unpretentious 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.550
 I kind of understand that a little bit 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.520
 It is incorrect to discuss anyoneâ€™s rituals. 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.200
 with his samovar so to speak but must 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.690
 there are at least some rules 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.390
 propriety something here with permission 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.820
 say the dance is clearly somewhere outside their scope 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.830
 and maybe even worse but about this even 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.000
 I don't want to think 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.310
 the only thing that this scene was able of 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:19.209
 squeeze me this spanish shame for those 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:21.900
 who came up with it and put in horror here I 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.900
 as it is not very 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.070
 bread tears itself and bleeds 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.140
 fountain to ceiling 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.120
 This is it just described the scene 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.610
 which could give a ride unless 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.290
 agents but there you understand how the world 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.780
 what it consists of 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.600
 it evicts what it means 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.030
 then you are just incredibly mad situations 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.690
 even partly prepared something to this but 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.600
 bread 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.640
 suicide is not the one you are beyond good and 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.850
 evil and even in the post-apocalyptic world 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.360
 Animeshki such out of the ordinary though need 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.110
 admit to quite funny and 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.959
 incredibly strange 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.959
 eat health another time 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.550
 there will be something on like 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.950
 collective image well, that is not 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.020
 single scene or several scenes a 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.480
 whole character who in all this 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.480
 involved is not very traditional 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.790
 the character sounds funny yet 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.770
 and parmon as a litmus test psyche 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.030
 second season's powers of one of my 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.030
 favorite anime 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.830
 just a transvestite forman russia not 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.140
 fits in my head not like that 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.330
 with an explicit site number and not that I'm good 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.459
 and then just this whole set of 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.950
 the above does everything for that 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.620
 so that I and many others just start 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.450
 characters with all my heart hate how 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.280
 a consequence to ignore all that 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.989
 he speaks and not perceive him 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.700
 seriously , do you understand 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.180
 be sure to make the characters so 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.730
 gear operated no it would be better without 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.190
 him absolutely exactly though for me so 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.130
 it would be better without just 2 seasons like 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:04.430
 se of for all expressed let's 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.430
 further for what the client decided 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.580
 yes in beer pit dohera rabid situations 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.710
 what only fornicators are our heroes not 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.810
 fell and incomprehensibly how managed from 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.790
 they get out look at it every 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.880
 day with her country and nowhere but still 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.060
 was that moment that for me still 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.770
 remains outside the zone of understanding though it 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.770
 the plot explains but from the very beginning 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.740
 the series does not leave you feeling that here 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:36.420
 not the place of such a story in to baby dad 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:40.470
 good evening gentlemen i need yours 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.290
 life and apparently our brains are all 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.600
 I understand the killer well chose this style 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.400
 even which to force contrasts with everything 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.860
 the rest of the show though it's still a question 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.130
 he chose him or is it just 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.990
 Madness such well yes question direct 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.300
 sense of clowning begins to happen 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.640
 and not so cute and funny and that with 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.450
 already above want want but here 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.700
 such 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.490
 and it did not occur to you that this is all 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.970
 because of your character 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.669
 parade karl parade god forbid every time 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.710
 when I look back, i'm forgetting 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.750
 what is this series 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.610
 you already write something or even now 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.520
 I think that I am one such idiot and not 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.650
 I understand the hoof code of higher sense 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.650
 This series of this moment to 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.250
 sorry but i really can't do this scene 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.310
 Explain to somehow justify the same 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.370
 not me and other sodomy why is it 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.650
 here plus music soothing blurry 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.960
 the filter shines everywhere after the rain 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.660
 thanks though wet t-shirts competition 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.690
 started though the drooping filed principle 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.530
 let's do a foot massage from and became a peasant 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.710
 to do foot massage is not possible this 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:00.070
 caught all the allusions we have Cinderella Mr. Duc 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.110
 not caught light than sense then 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.330
 well, really yes somehow behind the ears it turns out 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.539
 attracted but here's the truth cut this 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.240
 scene and nothing will change it in any way 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.360
 on the plot his development or characters not 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.610
 influences in no way absolutely unless they 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.510
 by chance seemingly spoken words from 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.060
 l 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.190
 we will part soon as if 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.160
 predict your imminent death but up 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.280
 the end does not create everything and may be aware 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.710
 but because of this rem whimsical massage 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.620
 I really don't take it personally 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:37.950
 I can not and I feel you carry some 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.950
 bullshit would you listen less 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.740
 like today's clear top and the sun 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:48.539
 there are blemishes and even if good 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:52.120
 take a closer look soberly brain 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:54.250
 then you can these very strange gently 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.410
 say moments notice hope that in 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.259
 comments you remember some other 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:01.539
 stupid incomprehensible and completely unnecessary 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:04.349
 booth viewed by you they are bags and on 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:07.360
 this i say goodbye i quit trying again 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:10.860
