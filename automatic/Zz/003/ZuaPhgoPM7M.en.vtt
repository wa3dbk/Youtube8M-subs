way so i will show you how I do my

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.250 
way so i will show you how I do my
particular<00:00:57.979> knitting<00:00:59.019> it's<00:01:00.019> in<00:01:00.170> the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
particular knitting it's in the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.530 
particular knitting it's in the
continental<00:01:00.710> style<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:01.489> believe<00:01:02.120> that's<00:01:02.269> what

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
continental style I believe that's what

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.370 
continental style I believe that's what
it's<00:01:02.690> called<00:01:02.930> my<00:01:03.739> first<00:01:04.040> row<00:01:04.369> I<00:01:04.699> try<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.119> keep

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
it's called my first row I try and keep

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.490 
it's called my first row I try and keep
really<00:01:06.380> tight<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.880> avoid<00:01:08.150> having<00:01:08.780> these<00:01:09.229> big

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
really tight to avoid having these big

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.380 
really tight to avoid having these big
loops<00:01:09.860> on<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.880> bottom<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.420> my<00:01:11.630> square<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:13.850> go

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
loops on the bottom of my square so I go

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.980 
loops on the bottom of my square so I go
in<00:01:14.420> through<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.900> back<00:01:15.640> I've<00:01:16.640> got<00:01:16.909> my<00:01:17.119> working

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990
