spheres and for lodestone yeah a lot a
lot<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.320> hate<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.769> them<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.370> them

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
lot of hate for them we don't want them

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.690 
lot of hate for them we don't want them
doing<00:01:05.640> anything<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> their<00:01:06.780> time<00:01:07.049> alright

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
doing anything on the their time alright

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
doing anything on the their time alright
so<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.150> ever<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.570> something<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.110 
so if they ever do something you
probably<00:01:10.320> lose<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> idea<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.970> just

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
probably lose so but the idea is to just
