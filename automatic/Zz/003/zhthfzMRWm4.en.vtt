00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello it's me simon had to do 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.340
 this video is about to heavy duty 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.200
 mike melzer right now I'm talking a lot 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.549
 it's not just because of me 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.619
 me again very intense with him 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.660
 he is simply someone who is his 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.160
 It was already far ahead of time 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.810
 he has put through theses 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.470
 to support observation through experience 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.150
 could 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.500
 Years later you could do a lot 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.539
 prove what he was back then, so to speak 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.250
 So it was only possible to maintain that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.900
 definitely ahead of its time 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.610
 quite a lot of real things too 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.170
 recognized in my view quite a lot 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 great things I'm not recognized 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 absolute one hundred percent fan and 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.260
 says everything that marc melzer said 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.059
 is correct but there are many good ones 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.649
 and a lot of right stuff on everyone 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.360
 case he goes for example too 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.940
 assuming that the human is one 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.739
 physiological legitimacy has 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.199
 that's where laws of muscle building 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.850
 gives the influence for example too 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.980
 the regeneration and the training times 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.809
 So even the variety of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.940
 training incentive for regeneration 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.829
 that is a very elementary topic in the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.719
 heavy duty he goes for example of it 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.090
 that too, that training 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.619
 simply a form of stress is stress 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 for the muscle stress for the whole 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.540
 Body in muscle third micro traumata 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.670
 on so micro trauma on and exactly that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.960
 Must be overcome somewhere if you can 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.970
 this is now in the super model 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 Compensation looks then you have 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.119
 Of course, somewhere 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 regeneration one has of course 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.030
 also this growth where one says 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.159
 so to speak about the origin again 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.140
 also comes over the process 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.400
 state that prevailed before 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.259
 It's so easy to say 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.060
 taken in the reason he keeps 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.710
 Of course , this model and makes 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.509
 also a lot of my view 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.740
 after is a very interesting thing he 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.900
 Although always speaks of so 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.119
 So things like catholic must be that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.680
 own bodies on their own structures 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 resort if I have enough 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.100
 energy is provided 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.899
 We have to be very careful 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.030
 because what's made of this is this 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.130
 katar bode devil will be beyond measure 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.540
 exaggerated by the industry of such 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 many people who are out there nowhere 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.570
 want to beat profit because they say 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.549
 they have seen through the whole thing 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.979
 Have developed a product against Qatar 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.869
 Bohle states and against the katholen 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.880
 devil and so on and so forth and the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.619
 be careful but still something 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.330
 he said that's right me 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.560
 my where should the energy come from if 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.060
 you do not lead them to the body 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.380
 Of course, the body then has to do it 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.900
 own fabric above 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.940
 where recruiting the whole must be clear 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.320
 Overall in any case very important r 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.970
 keeps saying that you are 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.160
 can come into the training 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.210
 that is, whoever trains too much will 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.800
 his body always in 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.900
 he never sets stress situations 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.150
 according to the model of super compensation 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.160
 somewhere over this initial state 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.990
 also come over the times you were 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.060
 that he is quite interesting that 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.530
 he is someone who says less training 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.720
 is often more 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.040
 So you can not build muscle 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.870
 by handling more training 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.700
 drive immeasurably because the simple 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.710
 physiological laws of the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.840
 Body prevent the whole 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.300
 according to mike menzer gibson 16 days cycle 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.010
 with four workouts and each 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.300
 two to three days break 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.190
 Of course you can see which ones 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.200
 play the regeneration times 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.280
 until it is quite interesting and what also 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.770
 quite interesting that is the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.540
 Training intensity he says six to 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.610
 eight repetitions at a very high 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.520
 Intensity is a key to success 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.840
 the whole without swing but also after 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.430
 high intensity that one too 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.560
 training can do 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.870
 that is, a single sentence on which 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.640
 the whole power reserve of the body when 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.380
 So you want to concentrate that way 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.360
 a high intensity trains that 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.800
 you just make use of it 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.020
 break that is quite interesting 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.150
 that they were given by these clear 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.250
 hear six to eight repetitions 16 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.810
 days cycle four workouts two 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.070
 rest for up to three days 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.260
 those are all things he could 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.180
 at that time only through observations 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.160
 support his own experiences 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.110
 Nowadays you can find much more 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.640
 clues to occupy the whole 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.200
 Of course it is also interesting that he 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.420
 said at that time you need one 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.860
 light calories surplus and even 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.870
 a diet side very carbohydrate 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.370
 be rich just then it was always 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.380
 so on the kick and said why 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.300
 carbohydrates the proteins are still 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.530
 Muscle building blocks why are you saying 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.090
 that the carbohydrates are important 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.620
 of course, today you know that 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.660
 just the carbs what 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.800
 energy suppliers are concerned 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.300
 to play an important role 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.770
 In that sense, of course, was his 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.090
 time ahead and in many others 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.370
 areas very interesting 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.290
 that one has these clear facts from him 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.540
 In the sense, heavy duty is on everyone 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.890
 case a very interesting book what you 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.360
 should definitely look at it 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.470
 I 'll put the link to you in the 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.000
 video description purely 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.680
 We see each of the informant concept 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.390
 already someone ahead of his time 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.410
 at that time I was already very intense 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.150
 with training 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.410
 nutrition should have dealt with 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.970
 in any case, daily times 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.860
 for me are quite a lot of interesting 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.780
 approaches, even if I do not do everything 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.100
 considered correct as we were 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.990
 See you in the next video if you like 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.340
 still have questions for example to the 16 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.180
 days cycle let me in the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.830
 to know comments 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.270
 I like to do a lot again 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.160
 there will definitely be some 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.540
 to be part of what I can do for the best 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.550
 All right, see you next 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.550
 Many greetings from your simon
