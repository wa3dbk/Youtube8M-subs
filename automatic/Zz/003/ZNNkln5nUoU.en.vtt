00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
goes on so while I'm pretty sure it was

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.059 
goes on so while I'm pretty sure it was
like<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> dollar<00:03:14.419> or<00:03:14.900> three<00:03:15.259> dollars<00:03:15.409> i'm<00:03:15.889> not

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069

like clumpy mascara so I would say this

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.010 
like clumpy mascara so I would say this
probably<00:04:25.820> isn't<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.090> one<00:04:26.240> for<00:04:26.420> you<00:04:26.510> but<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.810> use

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
probably isn't the one for you but I use

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.660

it<00:04:27.200> with<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.470> rocket<00:04:27.890> though<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.100> trying<00:04:28.550> to

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
it with the rocket though to trying to

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.970 
it with the rocket though to trying to
separate<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.540> lashes<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:29.960> little<00:04:30.260> bit<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.680> I

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
separate the lashes a little bit and I

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.740 
separate the lashes a little bit and I
think<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.490> works<00:04:31.640> really<00:04:31.820> well<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:32.300> then

think that it works really well and then

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.390 
think that it works really well and then
