 Hi everybody , it's twix day for today. 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:16.859
 It's all worth remembering chocolate 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:19.410
 I'm gentle, I hope 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.480
 now that there is finally the break 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 for s6 is one of the questions was 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 dollar operated at home has no family 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 It's expensive, so stick it well in this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.950
 video show five of my favorites 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.170
 all are incredible additions to the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.030
 but not all are free there 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.710
 go 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.960
 Nowadays the trick I most like is 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.940
 acso it reinvents bar 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.920
 multitasking and shows a preview of the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.360
 applications to slide right 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 detailed media controls with 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 right to the album cover and shortcut to the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.440
 application by sliding 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.519
 bar with quick shortcuts as rotation 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.010
 wifi screen 3g personal access and up 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.540
 even the flashlight beyond the control of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.600
 the spirit is more a central 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.900
 s customization includes fine adjustments 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.689
 and dozens of functions like animations 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.530
 doc resources and cones folders and bar 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.570
 status 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 two of my favorites are the dock in the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.080
 cover flow style and the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.080
 transparent notifications 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.820
 You know that story to change the logo 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.640
 operator or sepe he does it in a 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.740
 much simpler just install and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 select the desired icon 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.600
 if you do not find anything that pleases 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.770
 hundreds of download options in the session 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.770
 it's gifts from the media 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.880
 It's just that I did not go for the ipad you already 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.610
 noted that notifications are not as 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.710
 comfortable on the big screen to improve 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.710
 the emblem incorporates the notifications 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.080
 of montana still no options enough 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.380
 install and enjoy it will be that it's just me 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.450
 which I think should already be in the uece 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.490
 if you send too many messages or 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.180
 frequently enter texts in your parent 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.240
 base 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.520
 swype selection is mandatory with it 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.070
 you can slide your finger on the keyboard 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:27.250
 to navigate through the text and even 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:29.140
 making selections by holding the shift key and 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.610
 these were the tweets I use the most 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.680
 next week you will know which are 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.350
 my favorite apps from india 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.350
 Then it gets smart. 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.450
 point 1.3 it breaks the break then 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.350
 be smart and do not update is that 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.880
 there until the next 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.880
 all twitcams I thought it was 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.140
 every machine the brand wants from me 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.330
 exam 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.330
