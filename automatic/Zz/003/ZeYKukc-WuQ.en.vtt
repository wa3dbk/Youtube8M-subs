00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 And we are now on the border where we have some images 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 collected by our correspondents this morning. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Forward Laia Bonet from Bethlehem 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 This morning we were amazed by this picture 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 people of high purchasing power played golf later 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 having made the Christmas dinner in the same club. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 The Christmas menu and the accommodation was € 360. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 This price is equivalent to that entered annually 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 the people who at the bottom of the image can see 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 on the fence. It is one of the images of inequality 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 extreme that they have denounced in their latest reports 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Both Oxfam Intermón and Caritas 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 which has become famous thanks to a photography by José Palazón 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.500
 Unfortunately the image of people on the fence 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000
 It has become commonplace in recent years. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Tonight, however, has had an unexpected turn. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Yesterday morning a large group of people climbed up 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 to the fence. Among them a woman in advanced state 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 of gestation called Maria. La Maria and her partner, 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 In Josep, they had been in the last few days trying to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 They reached him to a hospital in the neighboring country without success 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 because they did not have money and they were not from the country. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 When crossing the first fence, this young mother 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 He started having pains. Given the situation, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 the couple stayed close to one of the fences 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 for infants. On the other side, a bull and a dromedary 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 They pastured had approached and seemed to want 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Healing the mother and the baby. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 As soon as they have known, the rest of the classmates 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 They have organized a chain to get to the family 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 What was needed for the part, since from our side of the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 border was not wanted to attend to the woman. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 It seems the reason is that if the child had been born 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 In our country, I would have been entitled to residence and 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 There are explicit orders to avoid it anyway. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 The "Civil Romia", which is how the police are known 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 of borders, have argued that they had strict orders 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 to prevent anyone from crossing the border these days 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 And they have tried, without success, to make one of the calls 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 "Hot return" 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 La Maria has been infused during the night. In the morning, Angel, 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 A Senegalese woman who was on the fence has gone 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 passing the message to all the people of Monte Gurugú 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 That the baby was born. People have gone 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Approaching to bring things to the baby and the mother. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 At the end of the day and after a lot of pressure on the newspapers, 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 radio and TV, anonymous citizens and a petition 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 of Change that has collected more than 200 million 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Signatures in a single day, the kings and chief executives of several 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Countries have been interested in the situation and for the baby. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Some have even talked to the mother on a mobile phone. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 All these leaders have decided to have a gesture 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 in front of what happened and as if it were a "gift" to the child 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 they have opened the fence so that everyone could deliver 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 to pass. It was an implicit recognition to everyone 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 We are people alike and that we all have them 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 same rights, we were born where we were born. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 In the usual screams of "Bossa, Bossa" the citizens 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 they crossed the border In declarations to ours 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Cameras explained that this night was born, in fact, 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 His savior, and almost worshiped the baby. For that, 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Their parents have decided to name this child: 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Jesus, who in his language means salvador. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 The authorities are scared to see the reality 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 They have wanted to ignore for so many years and now they are scared 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 It is not ruled out that on the 28th, the day of the innocent, 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Again taking measures against the baby and the rest 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 of people who can end up in a tragedy 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.500
 human as that of 4700 people 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.500
 That this 2014 have officially lost their lives 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.000
 trying to cross the borders. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
