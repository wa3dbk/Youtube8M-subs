talking over a game for 10 minutes it's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
talking over a game for 10 minutes it's
not<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.520> less<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.000> kind<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> less<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
not it's less of a kind of less of it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
not it's less of a kind of less of it
it's<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.009> really<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> channel<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.790> made

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it's not really a channel that is made

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.399 
it's not really a channel that is made
to<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.420> raw<00:01:24.630> videos<00:01:25.020> where<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.320> just

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to just like raw videos where I just

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.899 
to just like raw videos where I just
done<00:01:25.680> them<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.040> take<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.640> thing

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
done them in one take kind of thing

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.480 
done them in one take kind of thing
so<00:01:27.450> therefore<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.560> thought<00:01:28.890> I'd<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> new

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
so therefore I thought I'd make a new

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
so therefore I thought I'd make a new
channel<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.970> didn't<00:01:30.240> kind<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.659> almost

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
channel so I didn't kind of like almost

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.990 
channel so I didn't kind of like almost
kill<00:01:31.650> my<00:01:31.829> channel<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> speak<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
kill my channel so to speak because I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.120 
kill my channel so to speak because I
was<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.750> seeing<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.770> spammed

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
was kind of seeing it as if I spammed

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
was kind of seeing it as if I spammed
out<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:35.610> videos<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.299> three<00:01:36.450> videos<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.720> day<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
out two videos or three videos a day I

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
out two videos or three videos a day I
savored<00:01:37.409> either<00:01:37.590> GT<00:01:37.890> our<00:01:38.009> minecraft<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
savored either GT our minecraft and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.090 
savored either GT our minecraft and
something<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.570> another<00:01:39.900> game<00:01:40.170> along<00:01:41.070> with

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
something like another game along with

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.770

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
other doing other channels of it I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
other doing other channels of it I
thought<00:01:43.259> other<00:01:43.530> channels<00:01:43.890> other<00:01:44.040> videos<00:01:44.460> it
