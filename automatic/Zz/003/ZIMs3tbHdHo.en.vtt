00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 we live in a world where there are 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.780
 fearsome dangers we could list the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.960
 quickly and it would still take us a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.260
 good time because they are many and each one 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.980
 worse than the other but and if we put on 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.779
 the table this interesting question which 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.439
 is the most dangerous thing or object in the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.840
 planet the most terrible something that still 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.600
 being real seems out of a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.270
 nightmare that far exceeds not only 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.110
 science fiction but nightmares 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.040
 from anyone what you are about to see 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.829
 it is worthy of the worst of the other horrors 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.500
 is to say that what is clearly the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.879
 thing or the most dangerous object in the world 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.899
 It is 100% lethal any form of life 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 that comes close enough will die not 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.910
 there is possibility of salvation does not exist 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.000
 level of security that allows you to do 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.060
 prisons without fierce shrinking 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.390
 and the time of life that is not 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.410
 matter that you are a man a wolf a 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.490
 tiger a rhinoceros or something bigger 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:23.210
 even bets are off 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:26.240
 if you are in your range of six 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.470
 months will be watching you if you come 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.140
 more your life is reduced to only seven days 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.770
 and if you have it in front when passing the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.340
 late or at dawn you will be dead or 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.340
 dead 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.659
 is in ukraine near the city 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.909
 abandoned of prípiat for more signs- 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.400
 Chernobyl the most dangerous object of 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.210
 planet is inside a place 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.210
 miserable unhappy very technical and very 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.050
 dark in the remains of the central 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:07.030
 nuclear vladimir ilich lenin and what are you 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.830
 seeing right now in this photo 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.590
 beyond thoughts 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.990
 ignominious inspires in the terror that 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.360
 infuse this mass you have to start 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.470
 saying that the person you are seeing 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.560
 in the photo 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.069
 he died in fact in a completely act 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.250
 despicable of absolute respect for the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.560
 human dignity this poor man and 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.480
 he died in a nuclear suit to whom 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.150
 they sent to take a picture of the object 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.030
 time later accompanied by others 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.790
 workers to whom conveniently never 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.989
 they were warned of the danger they were running 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.620
 they also died as I said before to much 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.530
 more than this distance is impossible 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.800
 survive he managed to approach him by the 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.989
 suit he wore but even so only 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.290
 I was winning a few hours of 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.290
 lifetime 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.140
 but what is this really and how did it come 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.750
 there when the worst catastrophe happened 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.040
 nuclear history on April 26 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.280
 of the year 1986 one of the reactors of the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.880
 plant exploded but this was only the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.550
 Start 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.860
 the radioactive components are 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.930
 they warmed up in such a way that they melted 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.480
 not only the concrete iron of the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.040
 nuclear chimney but also the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.540
 sand coating that had 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.239
 put in order to avoid the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.120
 radioactivity in a matter of seconds 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.820
 a lake of magma penetrated the compresses 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.780
 of security and devoured fiercely all 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:42.030
 the gates and finally free and 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.580
 recalcitrant came the dream to 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.739
 then the long-suffering workers of the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.470
 extinct Soviet Union who 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.050
 understand the disaster firsthand 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.780
 of biblical proportions that this 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.850
 it meant they decided to stay behind 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.489
 do everything possible so that all the damage 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.489
 originated was not as bad as I could 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.370
 become even at the expense of their lives 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.129
 that they knew had come to an end 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.370
 I did not care if they ran they were already 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.950
 practically dead they only had few 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.979
 hours ahead they devoted to their 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.199
 families from hell so that 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.359
 could escape from prípiat eloy 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.359
 abandoned town on time 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.840
 the radioactive magma that slipped 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.270
 slowly down the chimney there was 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.630
 exploded penetrated the roof and started to 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.480
 spread through the lower floors 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.880
 eating everything in its wake finally the 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.580
 greater deposit of this abominable mixture 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.970
 he stayed here in what would be known to him 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.310
 its shape as the foot of the elephant or 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.130
 jellyfish for the Russians 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.680
 it's a complex subject but I would express it 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.230
 Clearly the amount of radiation 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.340
 in the environment it is calculated by a system 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:03.750
 of unit called ruin genius 15th in 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.240
 geniuses is a normal radiation level 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.340
 50 ro in geniuses is what usually 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.370
 get in laboratories where it 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.210
 You need to wear protection to be 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:20.230
 exposed to 75 rhone geniuses already you start 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.020
 to hurt you will suffer dizziness and vomiting 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.140
 hundred in geniuses are capable of 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:31.150
 cause hair loss is 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:34.990
 exposed to 300 rhone geniuses is fatal to be 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.600
 victim still for a few minutes of 400 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.670
 ruin and geniuses would poison your body of 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.630
 so you would only have 2 to 8 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.150
 Weeks of life exposure to 600 royne 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.650
 geniuses would cause severe damage to your skin 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.620
 damage to your liver pancreas brain 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.110
 Blood would not live more than two days 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.170
 milo in geniuses that is considered a 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.540
 brutal and strange dose would destroy your 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.820
 nervous system and it could kill you in 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.690
 three minutes 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:12.450
 the foot of the elephant today to 28 years of 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.450
 disaster issues 10,000 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.449
 and everything that comes close to this object 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.729
 dies even from long before 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.309
 getting to see it can kill any 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.610
 way of life and has been responsible 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:33.430
 even from which animals in the forests 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.409
 surrounding the plant as for example 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.569
 wolves are born with deformities 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:43.649
 if you are wondering how they have 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:46.199
 taken these more modern photographs the 

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:48.719
 answer is simple has been by means of 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:52.110
 robots equipped with cameras and systems 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:54.919
 live streaming expensive thing 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.959
 because even they do not survive 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.770
 even the appliances are damaged at 

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:04.069
 photograph it 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.300
 by far the most dangerous object and 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:09.610
 fearsome of the world 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.770
 if I asked you this is 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.780
 if the video you liked please give it 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.349
 thumb up and share it with your 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.870
 friends 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:19.150
 add you to my social networks in 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.400

 Goodnight
