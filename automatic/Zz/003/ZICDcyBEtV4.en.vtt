sick v's hijack open with the King Jack

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.589 
sick v's hijack open with the King Jack
there<00:00:24.590> and<00:00:24.910> I'll<00:00:25.910> get<00:00:26.060> back<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.240> that<00:00:26.360> in<00:00:26.480> just

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
there and I'll get back to that in just

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.599 
there and I'll get back to that in just
a<00:00:26.779> minute<00:00:26.960> but<00:00:27.259> I'm<00:00:27.800> folding<00:00:28.070> this<00:00:28.310> four<00:00:28.550> or

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
a minute but I'm folding this four or

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.550 
a minute but I'm folding this four or
five<00:00:28.759> suited<00:00:29.179> on<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.449> button<00:00:29.720> against<00:00:30.320> that

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
five suited on the button against that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.439 
five suited on the button against that
under<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.890> gun<00:00:31.039> open<00:00:31.429> normally<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.239> would

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
under the gun open normally that would

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.869 
under the gun open normally that would
be<00:00:32.540> a<00:00:32.570> call<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.500> with<00:00:33.800> short<00:00:34.160> stacks<00:00:34.430> in<00:00:34.670> both

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
be a call but with short stacks in both

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.740 
be a call but with short stacks in both
the<00:00:35.089> blinds<00:00:35.330> I<00:00:35.600> think<00:00:35.780> I'm<00:00:35.870> getting<00:00:35.989> shoved<00:00:36.320> on

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
the blinds I think I'm getting shoved on

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.090 
the blinds I think I'm getting shoved on
probably<00:00:38.750> in<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.410> neighborhood<00:00:39.530> of<00:00:39.800> twenty

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
probably in the neighborhood of twenty

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.470 
probably in the neighborhood of twenty
percent<00:00:40.339> of<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.550> time<00:00:40.670> maybe<00:00:40.940> even<00:00:41.180> more

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
percent of the time maybe even more

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.119 
percent of the time maybe even more
after<00:00:41.780> I<00:00:42.050> call<00:00:42.350> there's<00:00:42.589> going<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.769> be<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.860> shelf

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
after I call there's going to be a shelf

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.100 
after I call there's going to be a shelf
behind<00:00:43.309> me<00:00:43.730> I<00:00:43.879> just<00:00:44.360> think<00:00:44.449> that<00:00:44.570> makes<00:00:44.839> stand

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
behind me I just think that makes stand

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.009 
behind me I just think that makes stand
unprofitable<00:00:45.890> with<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:46.879> better<00:00:47.690> suited

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
unprofitable with a better suited

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.469 
unprofitable with a better suited
connector<00:00:48.559> like<00:00:48.769> 8-9<00:00:49.369> suited<00:00:49.879> nine<00:00:50.239> ten

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
connector like 8-9 suited nine ten

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.289 
connector like 8-9 suited nine ten
suited<00:00:50.869> I'd<00:00:51.019> probably<00:00:51.229> call<00:00:51.619> anyway<00:00:52.070> but<00:00:53.059> with

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
suited I'd probably call anyway but with

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.930 
suited I'd probably call anyway but with
more<00:00:54.019> marginal<00:00:54.530> hand<00:00:54.799> I<00:00:55.129> think<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:55.549> it

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
more marginal hand I think that it

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.310 
more marginal hand I think that it
becomes<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.330> fold<00:00:56.510> because<00:00:56.689> of<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.110> short

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
becomes a fold because of the short

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.380 
becomes a fold because of the short
stacks<00:00:57.619> and<00:00:57.799> the<00:00:57.890> blinds<00:00:58.100> there<00:00:58.430> I<00:00:58.610> getting

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
stacks and the blinds there I getting

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.320 
stacks and the blinds there I getting
back<00:00:59.420> to<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.839> King<00:01:00.049> Jack<00:01:00.290> three<00:01:00.619> bet<00:01:00.799> I<00:01:01.330> like

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
back to the King Jack three bet I like

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.929 
back to the King Jack three bet I like
the<00:01:02.510> three<00:01:02.720> bet<00:01:02.900> there<00:01:03.199> because<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:04.430> a

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
the three bet there because it's a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.380 
the three bet there because it's a
pretty<00:01:05.150> strong<00:01:05.449> hand<00:01:05.869> but<00:01:06.650> not<00:01:07.610> quite<00:01:08.000> strong

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
pretty strong hand but not quite strong

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.520 
pretty strong hand but not quite strong
enough<00:01:08.630> for<00:01:08.810> me<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:08.990> be<00:01:09.049> excited<00:01:09.470> about

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
enough for me to be excited about

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.550 
enough for me to be excited about
calling<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.159> against<00:01:10.549> an<00:01:10.670> unknown<00:01:10.820> there

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
calling it against an unknown there

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.960 
calling it against an unknown there
especially<00:01:12.560> because<00:01:12.710> he's<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.100> little<00:01:13.729> bit

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
especially because he's a little bit

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.730 
especially because he's a little bit
less<00:01:14.240> than<00:01:14.450> full<00:01:14.659> stack<00:01:14.960> that<00:01:15.380> makes<00:01:15.590> my

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
less than full stack that makes my

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.470 
less than full stack that makes my
positional<00:01:16.220> advantage<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.760> bit<00:01:16.910> less<00:01:17.120> and

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
positional advantage a bit less and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.840 
positional advantage a bit less and
makes<00:01:17.630> calling<00:01:18.080> even<00:01:18.620> less<00:01:18.950> appealing<00:01:19.220> though

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
makes calling even less appealing though

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.010 
makes calling even less appealing though
I<00:01:19.880> would<00:01:20.120> be<00:01:20.210> three<00:01:20.420> betting<00:01:20.630> rather<00:01:20.780> than

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
I would be three betting rather than

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.170 
I would be three betting rather than
calling<00:01:21.290> against<00:01:21.770> an<00:01:21.860> unknown<00:01:22.040> there<00:01:22.490> even<00:01:23.060> if

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
calling against an unknown there even if

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.030 
calling against an unknown there even if
he<00:01:23.240> did<00:01:23.390> have<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:23.540> full<00:01:23.750> stack<00:01:27.040> calling

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
he did have a full stack calling

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.530 
he did have a full stack calling
wouldn't<00:01:28.280> be<00:01:28.370> a<00:01:28.400> disaster<00:01:29.060> I<00:01:29.240> think<00:01:29.450> you

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
wouldn't be a disaster I think you

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.540 
wouldn't be a disaster I think you
probably<00:01:29.659> do<00:01:30.020> show<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.230> prop<00:01:30.710> a<00:01:30.920> very<00:01:31.280> slight

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
probably do show a prop a very slight

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.730 
probably do show a prop a very slight
profit<00:01:31.820> for<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.210> call<00:01:32.420> there<00:01:32.659> if<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.530> play<00:01:33.710> it

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
profit for a call there if you play it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.110 
profit for a call there if you play it
well<00:01:33.950> post<00:01:34.190> flop<00:01:34.430> but<00:01:34.700> you're<00:01:34.820> going<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.000> be<00:01:35.090> in

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
well post flop but you're going to be in

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.090 
well post flop but you're going to be in
tough<00:01:35.360> situations<00:01:35.570> against<00:01:36.350> an<00:01:36.440> unknown<00:01:36.590> much

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
tough situations against an unknown much

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.520 
tough situations against an unknown much
more<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:37.520> than<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:38.000> three<00:01:38.210> bet<00:01:38.390> pot<00:01:38.659> because

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
more so than the three bet pot because

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.730 
more so than the three bet pot because
in<00:01:39.830> a<00:01:39.920> three-bet<00:01:40.250> pot<00:01:40.490> if<00:01:41.450> he<00:01:42.140> for<00:01:42.350> bets<00:01:42.560> we

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
in a three-bet pot if he for bets we

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.730 
in a three-bet pot if he for bets we
just<00:01:42.920> fold<00:01:43.190> if<00:01:43.880> he<00:01:44.030> calls<00:01:44.300> we<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.440> pretty

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
just fold if he calls we just pretty

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.630 
just fold if he calls we just pretty
much<00:01:45.890> go<00:01:46.040> with<00:01:46.190> top<00:01:46.340> pair<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:47.590> on<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.190> flop<00:01:49.370> ah

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
much go with top pair and on the flop ah

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.190 
much go with top pair and on the flop ah
and<00:01:52.000> maybe<00:01:53.000> see<00:01:53.270> bet<00:01:53.420> left<00:01:53.630> some<00:01:53.870> boards

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
and maybe see bet left some boards

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.840 
and maybe see bet left some boards
probably<00:01:54.740> mostly<00:01:54.979> check<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.340> back<00:01:55.490> if<00:01:55.670> we're

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
probably mostly check it back if we're

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.820 
probably mostly check it back if we're
called<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.360> miss<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.260> flop<00:01:57.470> I<00:01:59.710> like<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
called and miss the flop I like the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.260 
called and miss the flop I like the
three<00:02:01.040> bet<00:02:01.190> both<00:02:01.430> because<00:02:03.070> well<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.100> think<00:02:04.270> the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
three bet both because well I think the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.640 
three bet both because well I think the
three<00:02:05.479> bet<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.840> as<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:05.990> bluff<00:02:06.229> preflop

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
three bet just as a bluff preflop

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.859 
three bet just as a bluff preflop
probably<00:02:07.070> shows<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.310> profit<00:02:07.700> against<00:02:08.000> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
probably shows a profit against the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.960 
probably shows a profit against the
range<00:02:09.500> with<00:02:09.739> which<00:02:09.890> most<00:02:10.159> people<00:02:10.310> are<00:02:10.549> opening

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
range with which most people are opening

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.130 
range with which most people are opening
there<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.450> then<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.659> range<00:02:11.810> with<00:02:11.989> which

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
there and then the range with which

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.420 
there and then the range with which
they're<00:02:12.319> playing<00:02:12.590> against<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.040> three<00:02:13.280> bet

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
they're playing against the three bet

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.949 
they're playing against the three bet
I'm<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:14.030> going<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.239> take<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.420> down<00:02:14.599> often

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
I'm just going to take it down often

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.860 
I'm just going to take it down often
enough<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.319> show<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.470> profit<00:02:15.739> but<00:02:16.510> then<00:02:17.510> King

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
enough to show a profit but then King

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.929 
enough to show a profit but then King
jack<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.349> hint<00:02:18.650> that<00:02:18.920> plays<00:02:19.190> pretty<00:02:19.730> well

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
jack is a hint that plays pretty well

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.300 
jack is a hint that plays pretty well
post<00:02:20.209> flop<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.439> do<00:02:21.499> happen<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:21.920> get<00:02:22.069> called

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
post flop if I do happen to get called

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.450 
post flop if I do happen to get called
in<00:02:22.489> that<00:02:22.639> spot

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.180 

so<00:02:29.970> I'm<00:02:30.180> three<00:02:30.420> bang<00:02:30.570> 6v<00:02:31.080> with<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.740> suited

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
so I'm three bang 6v with can do suited

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.040 
so I'm three bang 6v with can do suited
again<00:02:32.490> here<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:34.530> definitely<00:02:35.870> toward<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
again here it's definitely toward the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.510 
again here it's definitely toward the
very<00:02:37.260> bottom<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.830> hands<00:02:38.100> I'd<00:02:38.220> consider

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
very bottom of the hands I'd consider

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.060 
very bottom of the hands I'd consider
three<00:02:38.850> betting<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.450> spot<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:39.690> this

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
three betting with in a spot like this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.770 
three betting with in a spot like this
but<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.370> actually<00:02:41.730> think<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.240> favorable

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
but I actually think it's a favorable

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.570 
but I actually think it's a favorable
spot<00:02:42.990> to<00:02:43.140> be<00:02:43.230> three<00:02:43.440> bang<00:02:43.590> again<00:02:43.920> because<00:02:44.400> of

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
spot to be three bang again because of

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.710 
spot to be three bang again because of
the<00:02:44.670> fact<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.060> through<00:02:45.240> by<00:02:45.360> them<00:02:45.480> last

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
the fact that I through by them last

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.620 
the fact that I through by them last
orbit<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.940> sometimes<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.210> to<00:02:48.240> just<00:02:48.450> sort

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
orbit and sometimes I like to just sort

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.060 
orbit and sometimes I like to just sort
of<00:02:48.720> pick<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> fight<00:02:49.350> with<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.530> player<00:02:49.800> who<00:02:49.980> I've

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
of pick a fight with a player who I've

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.700 
of pick a fight with a player who I've
got<00:02:50.280> position<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.350> hope<00:02:52.350> they'll

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
got position on and hope they'll

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.140 
got position on and hope they'll
overreact<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.880> my<00:02:54.570> aggression<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:56.090> sort<00:02:57.090> of

overreact to my aggression and sort of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.140 
overreact to my aggression and sort of
spew<00:02:57.480> against<00:02:57.810> me<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:57.960> mean<00:02:58.200> he<00:02:58.320> shoved<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.710> my
