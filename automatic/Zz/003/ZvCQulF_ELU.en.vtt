00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.310
 or the one that also dreams recipe group 

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.090
 super easy is to make a lemonade 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.300
 of strawberries 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.090
 and hope you like it 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.750
 for the first recipe is a kind of 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.310
 another p 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.529
 we are going to need a blender 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.990
 we are also going to need a cup of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.880
 frozen strawberries making the chairs 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.940
 frozen you can put the strawberries and a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.510
 ice cup 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.870
 or two lemons a cup of water and sugar 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.820
 this is optional then let's mix 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.800
 all those ingredients of our 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.310
 blender until you have them all right 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.310
 mixed 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.400
 then we serve it in our glass and 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.010
 we put our straw and ready this 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.340
 line is very rich seriously 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.340
 I recommend 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.840
 the second recipe we're going to need a 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.789
 glass of water 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.789
 about three or four strawberries 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.990
 One lemon's juice 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.990
 and the juicer if you want 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.440
 let's invent a knife to cut 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.820
 the dams 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.070
 and also in this sugar that is optional 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.990
 this idea the truth is that it is very much 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.630
 easier than the previous one but it remains 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.390
 equally delicious 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.460
 and first let's put our the juice 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.159
 of lemon in our in our glass of 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.159
 water and we will mix it with sugar 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.020
 then we are going to cut our strawberries 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.670
 in small pieces and those pieces the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.429
 let's put inside the glass 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.830
 and then we're going to mix so that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.860
 combine the flavors if you want you can 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.950
 add ice and do not forget to add a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.099
 company at the top of tuba shadow that 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.099
 see 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.470
 and the truth that is for me my favorite and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.959
 is super rich I recommend the two 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.170
 ideas and I hope you liked this
