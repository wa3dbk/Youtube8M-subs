sometimes when you see interviews I

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.400 
sometimes when you see interviews I
don't<00:03:57.730> know<00:03:57.820> if<00:03:57.910> he's<00:03:58.090> like<00:03:58.270> crazy<00:03:58.930> high<00:03:59.350> or

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
for a guy who sometimes doesn't make

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.449 
for a guy who sometimes doesn't make
much<00:04:07.180> sense<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:08.140> deal<00:04:08.350> with<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.800> ton<00:04:09.430> of

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
much sense to deal with a ton of

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.150 
much sense to deal with a ton of
pressure<00:04:10.420> on<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.260> then<00:04:11.680> when<00:04:11.830> you<00:04:11.920> don't

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
pressure on you and then when you don't

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.650 
pressure on you and then when you don't
handle<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:12.640> right<00:04:12.820> and<00:04:13.030> then<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.300> get<00:04:13.450> another

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
handle it right and then you get another

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.930 
handle it right and then you get another
ton<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.410> pressure<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:15.130> then<00:04:15.519> something<00:04:15.910> like

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
ton of pressure and then something like

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.659 
ton of pressure and then something like
