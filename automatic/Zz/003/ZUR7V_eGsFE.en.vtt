well and it looks like me sitting there
with<00:01:50.920> green<00:01:51.460> light<00:01:51.729> coming<00:01:52.329> out<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.689> the<00:01:53.530> book

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
with green light coming out of the book

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.330 
with green light coming out of the book
so<00:01:55.060> there<00:01:55.240> there's<00:01:55.450> no<00:01:55.600> line<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.840> sight<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:57.280> you

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so there there's no line of sight if you

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.010 
so there there's no line of sight if you
did<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.579> with<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.700> infrared<00:01:58.180> thing<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.780> probably

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
did it with a infrared thing it probably

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.020 
did it with a infrared thing it probably
wouldn't<00:01:59.170> have<00:01:59.289> worked<00:01:59.500> but<00:02:00.219> there<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.759> looks

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
wouldn't have worked but there it looks

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.670 
wouldn't have worked but there it looks
like<00:02:01.180> there's<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.509> glowing<00:02:02.049> green<00:02:02.409> light

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
like there's a glowing green light

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.980 
like there's a glowing green light
coming<00:02:03.070> out<00:02:03.159> with<00:02:03.280> Jill<00:02:03.430> McNally's<00:02:03.990> boot

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
coming out with Jill McNally's boot

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:15.880 
coming out with Jill McNally's boot
while<00:02:05.740> I'm<00:02:05.890> sitting<00:02:06.100> there<00:02:06.399> having<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.600> read

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.950 

you
