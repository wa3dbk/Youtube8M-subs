the reason we're doing the no food is to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.009 
the reason we're doing the no food is to
really<00:03:35.549> give<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.970> digestive<00:03:36.540> system<00:03:36.930> a

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
really give the digestive system a

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.550 
really give the digestive system a
chance<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.100> grade<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.790> clear<00:03:39.180> itself<00:03:39.690> to

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
chance and a grade to clear itself to

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.050 
chance and a grade to clear itself to
let<00:03:40.709> everything<00:03:40.920> go<00:03:41.190> through<00:03:41.220> so<00:03:41.940> that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
let everything go through so that

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.550 
let everything go through so that
everything<00:03:42.420> that's<00:03:42.570> stored<00:03:42.810> up<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.350> walls

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
everything that's stored up on the walls

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.160 
everything that's stored up on the walls
over<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.950> last<00:03:44.130> however<00:03:44.670> many<00:03:44.850> years<00:03:45.209> can

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
over the last however many years can

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.360 
over the last however many years can
have<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> chance<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:48.090> excreted<00:03:49.370> also

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
have a chance to be excreted also

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.810 
have a chance to be excreted also
allowing<00:03:50.640> us<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:50.940> get<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.500> but<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.609> allows

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
allowing us to get I know but it allows

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.449 
allowing us to get I know but it allows
