use them and why a standard comment in a
lot<00:00:24.400> of<00:00:24.550> my<00:00:24.730> workshops<00:00:25.570> is<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:28.000> seems<00:00:28.330> to<00:00:28.420> be

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
lot of my workshops is there seems to be

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.170 
lot of my workshops is there seems to be
so<00:00:28.869> much<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.320> remember<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:30.070> that's<00:00:30.610> very<00:00:30.910> true

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
so much to remember and that's very true

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.420 
so much to remember and that's very true
if<00:00:31.539> you're<00:00:31.990> memorizing<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:33.250> if<00:00:33.340> you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
if you're memorizing but if you

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.270 
if you're memorizing but if you
understand<00:00:34.150> what<00:00:34.420> happens<00:00:34.870> when<00:00:35.080> you<00:00:35.280> change

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
understand what happens when you change

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.970 
understand what happens when you change
the<00:00:36.400> setting<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.090> what<00:00:37.390> it<00:00:37.540> does<00:00:37.780> then<00:00:38.770> it

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
the setting and what it does then it

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.160 
the setting and what it does then it
becomes<00:00:39.340> natural<00:00:39.970> flow<00:00:40.300> from<00:00:40.600> one<00:00:40.750> setting<00:00:41.020> to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
becomes natural flow from one setting to

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.860 
becomes natural flow from one setting to
another<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.460> that's<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.879> kind<00:00:43.270> of<00:00:43.360> goal<00:00:43.600> of

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
another so that's the kind of goal of

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.610 
another so that's the kind of goal of
these<00:00:43.989> videos<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:45.810> make<00:00:46.810> you<00:00:46.960> understand

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
point-and-shoot this be a very good

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.200

setting<00:01:20.080> for<00:01:20.290> you<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.500> start<00:01:20.799> with<00:01:21.010> because<00:01:21.760> it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
setting for you to start with because it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.760

gives you the same operation as your
point-and-shoot<00:01:24.369> but<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.820> have<00:01:24.940> the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.539 
point-and-shoot but you have the
advantages<00:01:25.690> of<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.900> larger<00:01:26.290> sensor<00:01:26.799> higher

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549

they'll<00:02:02.140> cover<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.439> other<00:02:02.619> auto<00:02:02.950> modes<00:02:03.340> in

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
they'll cover the other auto modes in

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.749 
they'll cover the other auto modes in
future<00:02:03.939> videos<00:02:04.329> so<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.950> is<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.130> really<00:02:06.610> good

let's<00:02:15.129> look<00:02:15.280> at<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.550> advantages<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:17.110> auto

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
let's look at the advantages of the auto

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.509 
let's look at the advantages of the auto
settings<00:02:17.980> auto<00:02:18.910> exposure<00:02:19.950> works<00:02:20.950> really<00:02:21.250> well

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
settings auto exposure works really well

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.630 
settings auto exposure works really well
under<00:02:22.209> ideal<00:02:22.569> conditions<00:02:23.220> out<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.459> white

under ideal conditions out of white

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.809 
under ideal conditions out of white
balance<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.500> also<00:02:26.500> very<00:02:26.769> effective<00:02:27.099> good<00:02:27.550> part

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
balance is also very effective good part

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.770 
balance is also very effective good part
of<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:28.000> time<00:02:28.209> as<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.680> auto<00:02:30.129> ISO<00:02:30.879> if<00:02:31.209> you've<00:02:31.510> got

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
there's no question that a lot of good

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
shots would be missed even if you just

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.080 
shots would be missed even if you just
took<00:02:50.079> 30<00:02:50.380> seconds<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.069> set<00:02:51.250> manual<00:02:51.730> settings

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090

took 30 seconds to set manual settings
on<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.329> camera<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:53.440> automatic<00:02:54.040> mode<00:02:54.239> it's

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
on the camera so in automatic mode it's

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.550 
on the camera so in automatic mode it's
much<00:02:55.450> faster<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:56.110> course<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.470> you're

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
much faster of course and you're

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.920 
much faster of course and you're
prepared<00:02:56.920> for<00:02:57.099> those<00:02:57.930> spur-of-the-moment

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
action there's an equal and opposite

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.600 
action there's an equal and opposite
reaction<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:05.049> there<00:03:05.200> are<00:03:05.410> disadvantages<00:03:05.860> to

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
reaction so there are disadvantages to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.690 
reaction so there are disadvantages to
auto<00:03:06.970> modes<00:03:07.709> one<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.890> weaknesses<00:03:09.069> of<00:03:09.519> auto

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.360 
auto modes one of the weaknesses of auto
modes<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.629> that<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.170> date<00:03:11.379> they<00:03:12.069> haven't

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
couple of reasons plan is that every

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.870 
couple of reasons plan is that every
adjustment<00:04:53.270> that's<00:04:53.960> made<00:04:54.430> on<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:56.270> image<00:04:56.810> in

adjustment that's made on the image in

deteriorate s-- the quality of your end
image<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:08.030> second<00:05:08.690> reason<00:05:08.840> is<00:05:09.200> that<00:05:09.470> those

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
image a second reason is that those

image a second reason is that those
adjustments<00:05:10.370> all<00:05:10.730> take<00:05:10.970> time<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.720> if<00:05:12.200> you

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
adjustments all take time and if you

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.830 
adjustments all take time and if you
take<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.500> wedding<00:05:13.430> photographer<00:05:13.580> for<00:05:14.210> example

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
take a wedding photographer for example

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.290 
take a wedding photographer for example
that's<00:05:15.440> working<00:05:15.860> on<00:05:15.980> fifteen<00:05:16.520> hundred<00:05:17.090> images

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
that's working on fifteen hundred images

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.870 
that's working on fifteen hundred images
and<00:05:17.870> he<00:05:18.500> has<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.770> make<00:05:18.890> adjustments<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.610> them

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
and he has to make adjustments to them

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.930 
and he has to make adjustments to them
all<00:05:20.200> he<00:05:21.200> could<00:05:21.590> spend<00:05:21.890> hours<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.550> hours<00:05:22.700> of

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
all he could spend hours and hours of

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.290 
all he could spend hours and hours of
time<00:05:23.450> in<00:05:24.070> post-processing<00:05:25.070> why<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:26.060> the

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
time in post-processing why is the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.810 
time in post-processing why is the
consistency<00:05:26.840> part<00:05:27.200> so<00:05:27.440> important<00:05:28.010> in<00:05:28.520> some

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
consistency part so important in some

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.030 
consistency part so important in some
programs<00:05:29.270> like<00:05:29.390> Lightroom<00:05:30.050> for<00:05:30.290> example<00:05:30.830> and

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
programs like Lightroom for example and

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.580 
programs like Lightroom for example and
adjustment<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.120> white<00:05:32.330> balance<00:05:32.570> or<00:05:33.050> exposure

adjustment to white balance or exposure

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.360 
adjustment to white balance or exposure
can<00:05:34.520> be<00:05:34.550> made<00:05:35.060> in<00:05:35.390> batches<00:05:35.630> if<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.740> have<00:05:36.830> fifty

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
can be made in batches if you have fifty

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.060 
can be made in batches if you have fifty
images<00:05:37.910> that<00:05:38.510> have<00:05:39.200> all<00:05:39.380> been<00:05:39.560> taken<00:05:39.830> under

images that have all been taken under

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.710 
images that have all been taken under
the<00:05:40.160> same<00:05:40.340> lighting<00:05:40.640> conditions<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.540> you've

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
the same lighting conditions and you've

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.280 
the same lighting conditions and you've
used<00:05:41.960> a<00:05:42.110> manual<00:05:42.520> white<00:05:43.520> balance<00:05:44.080> setting<00:05:45.080> all

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
used a manual white balance setting all

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.800 
used a manual white balance setting all
of<00:05:45.350> the<00:05:45.800> white<00:05:46.010> all<00:05:46.370> of<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:46.760> white<00:05:47.390> balance

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
of the white all of the white balance

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.810 
of the white all of the white balance
will<00:05:47.990> be<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.380> same<00:05:48.620> on<00:05:48.650> those<00:05:49.010> fifty<00:05:49.370> images

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
will be the same on those fifty images

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.210 
will be the same on those fifty images
if<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.510> needs<00:05:50.720> adjustment<00:05:51.350> you<00:05:51.770> can<00:05:51.800> just

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
if it needs adjustment you can just

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.070 
if it needs adjustment you can just
group<00:05:52.460> them<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.940> make<00:05:53.180> that<00:05:53.330> adjustment<00:05:53.510> to

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
group them and make that adjustment to

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.140 
group them and make that adjustment to
all<00:05:54.290> 50<00:05:54.710> images<00:05:54.950> with<00:05:55.280> one<00:05:55.610> click<00:05:55.910> of<00:05:55.940> the

all 50 images with one click of the

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.970 
all 50 images with one click of the
mouse<00:05:56.180> so<00:05:56.990> let's<00:05:57.170> review<00:05:57.380> what<00:05:57.710> we<00:05:57.830> just

mouse so let's review what we just
covered<00:05:58.190> one<00:05:59.180> should<00:05:59.570> use<00:05:59.840> automatic<00:06:00.580> well

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
covered one should use automatic well

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.810 
covered one should use automatic well
when<00:06:02.480> it<00:06:02.600> you<00:06:03.050> don't<00:06:03.290> have<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:03.530> time<00:06:03.919> to<00:06:04.640> make

when it you don't have the time to make
manual<00:06:05.090> adjustments<00:06:05.930> because<00:06:06.050> it<00:06:06.230> could<00:06:06.410> make

auto<00:06:27.440> works<00:06:27.830> great<00:06:28.250> when<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:29.180> conditions<00:06:29.810> are

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
auto works great when the conditions are

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.440 
auto works great when the conditions are
ideal<00:06:29.990> and<00:06:30.680> ideal<00:06:31.430> conditions<00:06:31.970> are<00:06:32.180> generally

ideal and ideal conditions are generally

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.620 
ideal and ideal conditions are generally
when<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:33.140> background<00:06:33.680> and<00:06:33.950> the<00:06:34.280> subject<00:06:35.060> are

when the background and the subject are
lit<00:06:35.870> the<00:06:36.050> same<00:06:37.000> evenly<00:06:38.000> if<00:06:38.390> you<00:06:38.630> have

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
lit the same evenly if you have

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.100 
lit the same evenly if you have
consistent<00:06:39.280> foreground<00:06:40.280> and<00:06:40.550> background
