the airplane so there was a great amount

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.539 
the airplane so there was a great amount
of<00:02:36.060> tool-and-die<00:02:36.900> work<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.739> this<00:02:37.980> area<00:02:38.040> as

Dayton<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.180> certainly<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:43.440> going<00:02:43.980> through<00:02:44.250> a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
Dayton is certainly is going through a

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.440 
Dayton is certainly is going through a
transition<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.390> what<00:02:45.930> they're<00:02:46.140> focusing<00:02:46.680> on

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
transition of what they're focusing on

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.570 
transition of what they're focusing on
and<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:48.050> think<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.739> schools<00:02:49.069> around<00:02:49.310> here

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
and I think the the schools around here

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.500 
and I think the the schools around here
reflect<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.800> UD<00:02:51.800> got<00:02:52.280> right<00:02:52.819> state<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:53.330> have

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
a text center going up across the across
