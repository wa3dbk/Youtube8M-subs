theoretical building and it would have

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.019 
theoretical building and it would have
been<00:06:34.319> really<00:06:34.589> easy<00:06:34.949> to<00:06:35.189> correct<00:06:35.399> final

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
projects because then I would have had a

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.639 
projects because then I would have had a
key<00:06:38.219> but<00:06:38.939> it's<00:06:39.119> it's<00:06:39.419> worth<00:06:39.689> it<00:06:39.960> because<00:06:40.319> the

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:40.649 
key but it's it's worth it because the

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:42.619 
key but it's it's worth it because the
