bottom<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.170> sleeve<00:01:43.470> we<00:01:43.740> were<00:01:43.830> looking<00:01:44.250> at

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
bottom of the sleeve we were looking at

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.070 
bottom of the sleeve we were looking at
it<00:01:44.580> looks<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> straight<00:01:45.900> on<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
it looks or this is straight on the

it looks or this is straight on the
bends<00:01:46.410> in<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:48.180> ILH<00:01:48.690> sleeves<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
bends in and then ILH sleeves the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.230 
bends in and then ILH sleeves the
tougher<00:01:50.850> than<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
tougher than that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:03.880 
tougher than that
yeah<00:02:01.190> LA<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.580> get<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.970> grooves<00:02:03.330> so

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
yeah LA so you get the grooves so

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.670 
yeah LA so you get the grooves so
cooling<00:02:04.890> groups<00:02:06.110> there<00:02:07.110> seems<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.410> be<00:02:07.530> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
cooling groups there seems to be a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.040 
cooling groups there seems to be a
better<00:02:07.860> design<00:02:09.560> 15<00:02:10.560> glued<00:02:10.830> in
