00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.220
 he is just doing / is and now 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.550

00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:00.170
 So far, I'm really happy with 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:02.860
 This round is so perfect the people 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.420
 but everyone should have seen 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.720
 how should I be so smart 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.970
 because here take away the difficult topic 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:15.550
 must be able to stay here 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:19.180
 but if that too the age but if 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.380
 you have no weapon so short this time 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.890

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.890

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:35.040

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.760

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.639
 final match 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.960
 Do not come after that 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.960

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.770

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.170

00:05:42.240 --> 00:06:01.740

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.740
 finally finally 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:26.520
 yes, yes, yes, I definitely found 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.349
 was a very good round rey back then 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.740
 I had really searched for myself 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:33.810
 like six games carrier cargo new 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.669
 town and all the other apps that do it 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.169
 in two games formatted adversary server 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.300
 knows where is that on it writes the 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.569
 Comments on some maps do not exist 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.979
 on micro of 115 on the cod gameserver 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.419
 So I also write in the comments 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.680
 I would be happy if the driver 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.060
 is also a thumb high above 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.159
 I would be happy and then you will see 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.430
 similar video is one and 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.430
