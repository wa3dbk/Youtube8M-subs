 [Music] 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.300
 no no no no I see myself here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.680
 fights 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.730
 go Go 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.730
 goodbye writes 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.729
 [Music] 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.260
 here 

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.760
 [Music] 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.989
 two 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 home sweet home

 [Music] 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.570
 and with friends I am the former of the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.250
 cosmic lizard and here is my friend 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.730
 I'm going to teach them how to do 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.350
 with a dynamite cannon but for 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.060
 human if it's good to start ok ok 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.420
 for this tutorial we're going to need 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.320
 a lot of dynamite material to build 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.770
 that remains a button and several 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.770
 water buckets 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.630
 to start let's make a square 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.610
 7 x 7 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.200
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.229
 [Music] 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.229
 2 3 4 5 6 7 we close it 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:50.340
 and in the middle we're going to put a cube and 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.320
 another one above and we remove the one below 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.840
 now we are going to 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 reign all of him 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.310
 the whole center 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.370
 and here we are going to put 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.090
 like a little column and where we're going 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:19.000
 to put our button ready 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.000
 here we are going to put around rest 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.570
 i 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.320
 and in a good environment on the shore 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.320
 let's put our dynamics 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.870
 ok now the only thing missing in what 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.549
 are missing is to try it and that is going to 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.549
 be a our model friend 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.519
 ahead 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.870
 well we went up we indicated to 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.580
 button and we jump while while passing 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.250
 that 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.100
 and as you can see, it's going to be very, very, very 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.870
 high above the nine medals I have 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.500
 a house in which the one we use for the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.770
 liter and then 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.700
 that's all it does 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.190
 let's try again 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.280
 but 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.620
 tests the cannon is this way 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.730
 They pounce you will not move forward with this 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.450
 attitude will not happen to you exactly 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.819
 vertical the mind will throw you for 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.580
 each brand so what are we going to do 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.850
 is we are going to do with a little one that has 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.840
 a belt to redirect it, let's go up 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.800
 the blocks here 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.800
 we give these 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.810
 and we're going to do it like a tunnel 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.870
 [Music] 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:57.130
 one 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:59.440
 7 2 3 4 5 6 7 so that you leave 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.930
 exactly up and that can 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.850
 serve to have a house very up and 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.560
 you arrive perfectly 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.640
 let's try this again he does it in 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.640
 the same side 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.650
 I think that here it went wrong for me, I 'm going to 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.650
 fix fix it fast 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.889
 although it already requires it is fine and 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.889
 you can try it 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:36.030
 i 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:39.730
 higher to see now if it jumps 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.880
 and you get you do not move for that 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.730
 you went down again in the same spot 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:53.199
 now if you are going to try it 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:55.669
 [Music] 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.669
 almost almost in the same place but you can 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.009
 do this a little bit bigger and you're going to 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.800
 go down exactly at the same point and 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:07.069
 remember this even though the water is 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.509
 covering the dynamite that there is momentum and 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.569
 That can hurt you and why 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:13.449
 you need 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.960
 Precision diamond armor 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.209
 because if you're like this with nothing if you're going to 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.080
 kill eventually and also you 

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:24.939
 I recommend putting water around to 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.459
 when you are going to fall because we are already in 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.879
 creative and obviously we are invincible 

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:29.879
 but 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.320
 when you are making a true map 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.850
 a world of truth as if it stops 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.480
 survive 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.270
 this is not going to help anything so 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:46.110
 this me I notice them 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.080
 for example this comes to you I was 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:53.880
 very very high so it was very high 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.030
 about 150 blocks I believe but you have to 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.340
 there is a is more powerful 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.730
 no more than this is much more practical 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.150
 because they are not so powerful 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:07.520
 they are very strong, they take you very high 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.550
 very high up on the map you can not 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.280
 build up there so you can not 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.060
 do so many things so this is more 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.790
 more more half a level half level is 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.040
 where you can still do things like 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.830
 house that builds up you can you can 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.470
 build a something up using this with 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.470
 a means of transport and that's it and it works 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.410
 very well and I think we have reached the end 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.520
 of this tutorial there will be more more 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.009
 soon 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.950
 and what you love install many good 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:47.839
 thanks for watching and see you later 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:47.839
