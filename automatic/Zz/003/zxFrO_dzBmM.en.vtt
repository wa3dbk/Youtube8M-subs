00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.210
 but if you are still looking for a special leisure tip how about the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.720
 Example with sledging sledging 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.250
 who with the August Hello Exot because they are true numbers but of course two 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.150
 Mechanical engineering students from the TIU Munich the clouds also in the summer or 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.840
 and and just developed the HearUSA course Marie Reißmüller and Karolina 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.840
 Tailors took a good look at the vehicle 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.240
 with 35 pieces 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.970
 Kilometers down the hill the song with the Altimeter Cross 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.310
 Florian Kraus and Stefan Buhr Bohème invented Udo this summer 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.190
 Bush also made debt from being transferred by the light 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.839
 the legs 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.769
 and that's how it will come about and always inflict among them, but the whole thing 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.920
 country 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.150
 by Stefan Ziegler 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.570
 smart engineers 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.290
 specially founded a company 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.240
 to the summer or to develop 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.700
 What they especially like about it 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.340
 you can also do it yourself 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.090
 they are especially important 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.240
 the rest of the costs 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.420
 at the Federal Competition this is only for forest and forest roads 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 is constructed that they do not believe next to the ski slopes 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.799
 Basically Meier always gets paid 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.049
 N / A 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.110
 Today the kids from the ski club were allowed to test the route 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.080
 In winter they go wrong here now it goes with the fast sled 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 Down the hill 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.590
 who forward the SAV my fate, it is auction recognized that it almost only 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.130
 better ISE was 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.479
 and it looked similar to snowboarding over work 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.260
 Weimer 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.430
 also Euro Kor 4 he is in the US 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.690
 and who thinks now must the sled the world the the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.330
 Ascension is wrong 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.120
 because the red lantern literally hooks a little bit in looks 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.120
 the ski lift easily back up the mountain 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.840
 and then the whole fun starts over 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.949
 now so and why why not
