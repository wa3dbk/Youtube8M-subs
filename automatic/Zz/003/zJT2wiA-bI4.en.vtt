00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
three and and we're lucky that this

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.250 
three and and we're lucky that this
particular<00:00:19.950> bike<00:00:20.420> comes<00:00:21.420> already<00:00:21.690> fitted

with the flyscreen

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.480 
with the flyscreen
because<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:25.230> order<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.680> fit<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> flyscreen

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
because in order to fit the flyscreen

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.120 
because in order to fit the flyscreen
you<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.030> fit<00:00:27.240> what's<00:00:27.600> called<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.130> front

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
you have to fit what's called the front

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.650 
you have to fit what's called the front
accessory<00:00:29.730> fitting<00:00:30.240> kit<00:00:30.530> which<00:00:31.530> is<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
accessory fitting kit which is this

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.869

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.990 

basically<00:00:37.710> pair<00:00:38.710> of<00:00:38.800> clamps<00:00:39.039> on<00:00:39.370> each<00:00:39.670> fork

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
basically pair of clamps on each fork

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.720 
basically pair of clamps on each fork
leg<00:00:40.269> and<00:00:40.930> looking<00:00:41.199> at<00:00:41.260> instructions<00:00:41.890> the

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
leg and looking at instructions the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.889 
leg and looking at instructions the
first<00:00:42.760> thing<00:00:43.210> is<00:00:43.449> to<00:00:43.649> fit<00:00:44.649> one<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.920> these<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
first thing is to fit one of these is

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.619 
first thing is to fit one of these is
very<00:00:47.230> nice<00:00:47.469> looking<00:00:48.989> lamps<00:00:49.989> on<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
very nice looking lamps on to the

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.840 
very nice looking lamps on to the
bracket<00:00:53.049> here<00:00:53.260> okay<00:00:53.949> so<00:00:53.979> that's<00:00:54.309> done<00:00:54.430> and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
bracket here okay so that's done and

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.119 
bracket here okay so that's done and
there<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.930> complete<00:00:56.350> assembly<00:00:56.680> the

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
there is the complete assembly the

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.930 
there is the complete assembly the
bracket<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.049> the<00:00:59.049> lamp<00:00:59.379> and<00:00:59.619> is<00:01:00.489> simply<00:01:00.760> much

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
bracket and the lamp and is simply much

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.729 
bracket and the lamp and is simply much
for<00:01:01.149> bolting<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.899> two<00:01:02.049> together<00:01:02.229> and<00:01:02.530> then

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
for bolting the two together and then

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.570 
for bolting the two together and then
putting<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.670> grommet<00:01:04.360> on<00:01:04.770> the<00:01:05.770> cable<00:01:06.399> and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
putting a grommet on the cable and

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.190 
putting a grommet on the cable and
threading<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.390> wiring<00:01:07.920> actually<00:01:08.920> through

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.500 

so<00:01:12.530> there<00:01:12.830> are<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.400> lamps<00:01:13.790> actually<00:01:15.190> fitted

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
so there are the lamps actually fitted

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.870 
so there are the lamps actually fitted
that's<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:18.220> bracket<00:01:19.220> that<00:01:19.310> comes<00:01:19.370> with<00:01:19.790> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
that's the bracket that comes with the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.810 
that's the bracket that comes with the
kit<00:01:20.120> fitted<00:01:20.869> on<00:01:21.080> to<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:22.130> outside<00:01:22.490> of<00:01:22.520> the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
kit fitted on to the outside of the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.050 
kit fitted on to the outside of the
screen<00:01:23.119> in<00:01:23.510> this<00:01:23.659> case<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.670> if<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.790> don't<00:01:25.970> use

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
screen in this case and if you don't use

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.719 
screen in this case and if you don't use
the<00:01:26.180> screen<00:01:26.450> as<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.659> spacer<00:01:27.200> provided<00:01:27.830> in<00:01:28.190> here

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
the screen as a spacer provided in here

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.600 
the screen as a spacer provided in here
and<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.240> fixes<00:01:29.660> on<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.050> fork<00:01:30.460> fixing<00:01:31.460> kit

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
and that fixes on to the fork fixing kit

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.430 
and that fixes on to the fork fixing kit
so<00:01:32.470> so<00:01:33.470> far<00:01:34.570> they<00:01:35.570> look<00:01:35.720> like<00:01:35.900> really<00:01:36.290> good

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
so so far they look like really good

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.639 
so so far they look like really good
quality<00:01:36.650> items

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.590 

all<00:01:41.649> right<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.890> next<00:01:42.070> step<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.270> bit<00:01:43.509> of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
all right the next step is a bit of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.480 
all right the next step is a bit of
disassembly<00:01:44.259> and<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:45.640> we've<00:01:45.759> done<00:01:45.970> is<00:01:47.490> we've

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
disassembly and what we've done is we've

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.120 
disassembly and what we've done is we've
taken<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:49.119> clocks<00:01:49.420> off<00:01:49.689> here<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:50.799> folded

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
taken the clocks off here and folded

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.580 
taken the clocks off here and folded
them<00:01:51.189> back<00:01:51.369> out<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.729> way<00:01:52.110> we've<00:01:53.110> undone

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
them back out of the way we've undone

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.070 
them back out of the way we've undone
the<00:01:53.799> single<00:01:54.220> bolt<00:01:54.430> at<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.329> front<00:01:55.600> of<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.840> fuel

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
the single bolt at the front of the fuel

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.120 
the single bolt at the front of the fuel
tank<00:01:56.380> there's<00:01:57.189> a<00:01:57.310> prop<00:01:57.610> inside<00:01:58.479> which<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.799> run

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
tank there's a prop inside which is run

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.550 
tank there's a prop inside which is run
like<00:02:00.159> an<00:02:00.369> old<00:02:00.520> bonnet<00:02:00.850> prop<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.960> hold<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.350> fuel

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
like an old bonnet prop to hold the fuel

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.440 
like an old bonnet prop to hold the fuel
tank<00:02:02.829> up<00:02:02.979> that's<00:02:03.189> supplied<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.850> it's

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
tank up that's supplied and it's

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.719 
tank up that's supplied and it's
actually<00:02:04.810> located<00:02:05.159> under<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.250> fuel<00:02:06.399> tank<00:02:06.610> on

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
actually located under the fuel tank on

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.820 
actually located under the fuel tank on
the<00:02:06.789> right<00:02:07.119> side<00:02:07.780> here<00:02:08.080> along<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.500> frame<00:02:08.769> just

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
the right side here along the frame just

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.410 
the right side here along the frame just
above<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.880> coil<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:11.489> say<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.549> got<00:02:12.880> clocks<00:02:13.180> up

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
above the coil and say you got clocks up

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.350 
above the coil and say you got clocks up
you<00:02:13.630> got<00:02:13.810> tank<00:02:14.049> up<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.549> you<00:02:15.880> take<00:02:16.150> off

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
you got tank up and then you take off

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.460 
you got tank up and then you take off
the<00:02:16.660> large<00:02:17.170> chromed<00:02:17.680> panel<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:20.290> another

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
the large chromed panel and now another

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.770 
the large chromed panel and now another
little<00:02:20.830> bit<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.040> disassembly<00:02:21.670> we're<00:02:22.330> thinking

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
little bit of disassembly we're thinking

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.470 
little bit of disassembly we're thinking
the<00:02:22.959> side<00:02:23.350> covers<00:02:23.709> off<00:02:23.830> both<00:02:24.100> sides<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
the side covers off both sides and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.509 
the side covers off both sides and
instructions<00:02:26.260> don't<00:02:26.530> tell<00:02:26.799> you<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.250> this

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
instructions don't tell you to do this

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.210 
instructions don't tell you to do this
they<00:02:28.180> say<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:29.319> put<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.250> wire<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:32.230> into<00:02:32.830> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
they say to put this wire up into the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.270 
they say to put this wire up into the
tank<00:02:33.630> via<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.720> routing<00:02:35.170> for<00:02:35.290> an<00:02:35.380> existing<00:02:35.890> cable

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
tank via a routing for an existing cable

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.970 
tank via a routing for an existing cable
here<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.720> actually<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:38.319> much<00:02:38.500> easier

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
here and but actually it's much easier

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.250 
here and but actually it's much easier
if<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.220> take<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.819> piece<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.720> black<00:02:40.900> trim

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
if you take this piece of black trim

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.870 
if you take this piece of black trim
here<00:02:41.620> off<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:42.160> we're<00:02:42.250> going<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.400> take<00:02:42.610> it<00:02:42.760> off

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
here off so we're going to take it off

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.150 
here off so we're going to take it off
I'm<00:02:43.569> going<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.810> run<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.140> cable<00:02:44.530> through<00:02:45.100> the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
I'm going to run the cable through the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.890 
I'm going to run the cable through the
headstock<00:02:45.640> where<00:02:45.880> all<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.329> other<00:02:46.359> cables

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
headstock where all of the other cables

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.770 
headstock where all of the other cables
go<00:02:47.109> into<00:02:48.070> your<00:02:48.310> tank<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:48.730> way<00:02:48.910> when<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
go into your tank that way when the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.620 
go into your tank that way when the
handlebars<00:02:50.350> turn<00:02:50.560> left<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.130> right<00:02:51.510> it's<00:02:52.510> not

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
handlebars turn left and right it's not

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.000 
handlebars turn left and right it's not
going<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:52.930> snapped<00:02:53.230> okay<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.680> we're<00:02:53.980> here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
going to get snapped okay so we're here

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.910 
going to get snapped okay so we're here

under<00:04:21.510> this<00:04:21.660> big<00:04:21.930> bundle<00:04:22.170> of<00:04:22.410> wires<00:04:22.590> where<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
under this big bundle of wires where you

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.820 
under this big bundle of wires where you
can<00:04:23.100> see<00:04:23.220> some<00:04:23.400> blue<00:04:23.610> tape<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.210> then<00:04:24.960> lift<00:04:25.650> it

can see some blue tape and then lift it
up<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.250> under<00:04:27.240> there<00:04:27.480> you<00:04:27.960> will<00:04:28.080> eventually

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
up and under there you will eventually

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.710 
up and under there you will eventually
find<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.340> plug<00:04:29.580> but<00:04:29.790> don't<00:04:30.030> worry<00:04:30.390> if<00:04:30.600> you

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
find the plug but don't worry if you

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.820 
find the plug but don't worry if you
can't<00:04:30.990> see<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.350> straight<00:04:31.560> away

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
can't see it straight away

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.940 
can't see it straight away
we'll<00:04:32.130> be<00:04:32.310> there<00:04:32.750> but<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:33.960> buried<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.590> warn

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
we'll be there but it is buried I warn

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.620 
we'll be there but it is buried I warn
you<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.790> other<00:04:35.940> thing<00:04:36.150> that's<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.390> little<00:04:36.420> bit

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
you the other thing that's a little bit

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.160 
you the other thing that's a little bit
confusing<00:04:36.930> is<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.980> they<00:04:38.450> tell<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.630> connect

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
confusing is that they tell you connect

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.990 
confusing is that they tell you connect
everything<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.920> connect<00:04:41.550> these<00:04:41.700> leads

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
everything so you connect these leads

main part of the frame there and and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.770 
main part of the frame there and and
then<00:04:50.160> there's<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.320> on<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.560> end<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.920> our

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
then there's this and on the end of our

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.600 
then there's this and on the end of our
on<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:55.170> end<00:04:55.290> of<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.560> loom<00:04:56.660> there<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.840> plug

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
on the end of the loom there is a plug

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.430 
on the end of the loom there is a plug
which<00:05:00.800> spectacularly<00:05:01.800> fails<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.700> fit<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:04.050> you

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
which spectacularly fails to fit and you

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.850 
which spectacularly fails to fit and you
can<00:05:04.800> end<00:05:05.130> up<00:05:05.550> thinking<00:05:06.120> oh<00:05:06.690> there<00:05:07.680> isn't

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
can end up thinking oh there isn't

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.100 
can end up thinking oh there isn't
one<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.760> fits<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.570> where<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:10.080> it

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
one that fits this and where is it

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.140 
one that fits this and where is it
what's<00:05:10.470> going<00:05:10.560> on<00:05:10.860> don't<00:05:11.550> worry<00:05:11.730> about<00:05:11.820> this

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
what's going on don't worry about this

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.060 
what's going on don't worry about this
the<00:05:12.750> thing<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.020> get<00:05:13.170> a<00:05:13.200> connect<00:05:13.560> it's<00:05:13.770> just

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
the thing you get a connect it's just

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.190 
the thing you get a connect it's just
the<00:05:14.190> main<00:05:14.430> block<00:05:14.730> here<00:05:15.300> which<00:05:15.570> is<00:05:15.780> under<00:05:16.080> the

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
the main block here which is under the

this<00:05:23.070> one<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.520> for<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.420> switch

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.270 

the<00:05:28.110> last<00:05:28.410> part<00:05:28.740> of

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
the last part of

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.270 
the last part of
Stahl<00:05:29.520> is<00:05:29.850> this<00:05:30.360> which<00:05:31.320> is<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.770> lighting

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
Stahl is this which is the lighting

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.450 
Stahl is this which is the lighting
switch<00:05:33.020> and<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.170> is<00:05:34.350> the<00:05:34.530> fiddly<00:05:34.980> as<00:05:35.040> part<00:05:35.340> of

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
switch and that is the fiddly as part of

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.420 
switch and that is the fiddly as part of
the<00:05:35.610> lot<00:05:35.850> it's<00:05:36.540> simply<00:05:36.990> it's<00:05:37.170> very<00:05:37.410> easy<00:05:37.710> idea

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
the lot it's simply it's very easy idea

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.909 
the lot it's simply it's very easy idea
really<00:05:38.730> it's<00:05:39.120> just<00:05:39.500> connecting<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:40.560> couple<00:05:40.830> of

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
really it's just connecting a couple of

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.560 
really it's just connecting a couple of
wires<00:05:41.070> under<00:05:41.370> here<00:05:41.550> and<00:05:41.730> running<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:42.360> wire

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
wires under here and running the wire

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.140 
wires under here and running the wire
under<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.530> tank<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:43.950> connecting<00:05:44.550> with<00:05:44.760> the

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
under the tank and connecting with the

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.030 
under the tank and connecting with the
connector<00:05:45.570> that<00:05:45.720> is<00:05:45.780> fitted<00:05:46.410> to<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.620> bike<00:05:46.800> and

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
connector that is fitted to the bike and

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.440 
connector that is fitted to the bike and
but<00:05:48.000> it<00:05:48.120> is<00:05:48.180> so<00:05:48.720> fiddly<00:05:49.230> it's<00:05:50.130> got<00:05:50.370> three<00:05:50.700> two

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
but it is so fiddly it's got three two

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.720 
but it is so fiddly it's got three two
bolts<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:51.930> one<00:05:52.169> screw<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:53.250> you<00:05:53.340> get<00:05:53.490> them<00:05:53.610> all

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
bolts and one screw and you get them all

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.580 
bolts and one screw and you get them all
lined<00:05:53.790> up<00:05:54.270> is<00:05:54.510> really<00:05:55.020> really<00:05:55.169> frilly<00:05:55.470> but

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
lined up is really really frilly but

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.530 
lined up is really really frilly but
anyway<00:05:55.830> it's<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.160> simple<00:05:56.850> enough<00:05:57.030> little<00:05:57.270> job

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
anyway it's a simple enough little job

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.980 
anyway it's a simple enough little job
in<00:05:57.810> principle<00:05:58.320> and<00:05:59.030> so<00:06:00.030> that's<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.660> install

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
in principle and so that's the install

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.900 
in principle and so that's the install
basically<00:06:01.440> finished<00:06:01.800> we've<00:06:02.040> connected<00:06:02.370> the

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:02.910 
basically finished we've connected the

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.820 
basically finished we've connected the
switch<00:06:03.180> here<00:06:03.480> we've<00:06:04.140> reconnected<00:06:04.560> the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
switch here we've reconnected the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.590 
switch here we've reconnected the
battery<00:06:05.250> back<00:06:05.669> at<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:05.940> back<00:06:06.060> we've<00:06:06.300> put<00:06:06.480> all

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
battery back at the back we've put all

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.430 
battery back at the back we've put all
of<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.840> panels<00:06:07.160> back<00:06:08.160> on<00:06:08.370> the<00:06:08.490> bike<00:06:09.350> there<00:06:10.350> we

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
of the panels back on the bike there we

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.790 
of the panels back on the bike there we
go

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
go

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.940 
go
I<00:06:10.830> have<00:06:11.700> to<00:06:11.850> say<00:06:12.030> that<00:06:12.530> you<00:06:13.530> know<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.740> quality

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
I have to say that you know the quality

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.650 
I have to say that you know the quality
of<00:06:14.700> the<00:06:14.910> ramps<00:06:15.270> and<00:06:16.200> of<00:06:16.410> the<00:06:16.500> fittings<00:06:16.919> and

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
of the ramps and of the fittings and

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.469 
of the ramps and of the fittings and
it's<00:06:18.660> really<00:06:18.950> absolutely<00:06:19.950> excellent

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
it's really absolutely excellent

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.820 
it's really absolutely excellent
instructions<00:06:21.479> could<00:06:22.320> be<00:06:22.380> a<00:06:22.500> little<00:06:22.710> bit

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
instructions could be a little bit

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.890 
instructions could be a little bit
better<00:06:22.979> but<00:06:23.880> basically<00:06:24.270> sometimes<00:06:24.540> you<00:06:24.720> keep

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
better but basically sometimes you keep

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.920 
better but basically sometimes you keep
you<00:06:24.990> cool<00:06:25.200> and<00:06:25.729> bear<00:06:26.729> in<00:06:26.850> mind<00:06:27.030> that<00:06:27.150> somewhere

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
you cool and bear in mind that somewhere

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.719 
you cool and bear in mind that somewhere
under<00:06:28.229> there<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.650> connectors<00:06:29.100> can<00:06:29.310> be<00:06:29.370> found

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
under there the connectors can be found

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.409 
under there the connectors can be found
it's<00:06:30.330> a<00:06:30.450> very<00:06:30.660> very<00:06:30.900> simple<00:06:31.229> job<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.560> do<00:06:31.710> really

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
it's a very very simple job to do really

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.300 
it's a very very simple job to do really
so<00:06:33.419> very<00:06:33.690> pleased<00:06:33.900> with<00:06:34.080> that<00:06:34.140> install<00:06:35.040> and

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
so very pleased with that install and

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.000 
so very pleased with that install and
hopefully<00:06:36.090> these<00:06:36.240> reel<00:06:36.570> and<00:06:36.840> stop<00:06:37.650> drivers

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
hopefully these reel and stop drivers

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.250 
hopefully these reel and stop drivers
pulling<00:06:38.520> it<00:06:38.640> on<00:06:38.760> me<00:06:38.940> which<00:06:39.120> I<00:06:39.330> usually<00:06:39.870> find

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
pulling it on me which I usually find

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.960 
pulling it on me which I usually find
that<00:06:40.380> they<00:06:40.590> do<00:06:40.650> and<00:06:41.160> then<00:06:41.310> extra<00:06:41.820> lights

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
that they do and then extra lights

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.659 
that they do and then extra lights
always<00:06:42.180> fit<00:06:42.479> them<00:06:42.630> to<00:06:42.750> every<00:06:42.960> bike<00:06:43.140> and<00:06:43.669> these

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
always fit them to every bike and these

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.130 
always fit them to every bike and these
look<00:06:44.850> great<00:06:45.030> anyway<00:06:45.479> just<00:06:45.660> one<00:06:45.840> because

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
look great anyway just one because
