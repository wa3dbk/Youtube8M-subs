and this is a box that it came in and

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.100 
and this is a box that it came in and
doesn't<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.239> how<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.690> particular

name for this all it says that like to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.760 
name for this all it says that like to
distinguish<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.140> one<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> different

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
distinguish this one from a different

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.389 
distinguish this one from a different
box<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.610> curl<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> need<00:00:51.360> right<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
box is the curl and need right here and

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.189 
box is the curl and need right here and
in<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.090> three<00:00:54.300> roller<00:00:54.570> sizes

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
in this there are three roller sizes

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.939 
in this there are three roller sizes
there's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.860> jumbo<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.699> looks<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
there's a jumbo which looks like this I

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.189 
there's a jumbo which looks like this I
think<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.309> an<00:00:59.460> inch<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.899> there's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
think it's like an inch and then there's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.679 
think it's like an inch and then there's
3/4<00:01:01.739> inch<00:01:02.010> which<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:04.820> there<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
3/4 inch which is this and there is I

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.800 
3/4 inch which is this and there is I
think<00:01:06.960> half<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.530> inch<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
think half an inch which is this and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.109 
think half an inch which is this and
each<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.229> has<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.860> side<00:01:11.130> that's<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.490> hole<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
each one has one side that's a hole and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
each one has one side that's a hole and
once<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.780> doesn't<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
once I that's a doesn't and you put the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.850 
once I that's a doesn't and you put the
hole<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.400> into<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.509> hole<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.080> corresponds

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
hole one into the hole that corresponds

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.390 
hole one into the hole that corresponds
to<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.150> heating<00:01:18.420> rollers<00:01:18.780> now<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
to it in the heating rollers now with a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.210 
to it in the heating rollers now with a
curler<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.810> has<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> quicker<00:01:22.710> heat<00:01:23.070> up

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
curler you it has like a quicker heat up

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.490 
curler you it has like a quicker heat up
time<00:01:23.400> generally<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.720> this<00:01:24.900> curler<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> can

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
time generally with this curler I can

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
time generally with this curler I can
heat<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.799> for<00:01:25.979> about<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.880> minute

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
heat it up for about I think a minute

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.649 
heat it up for about I think a minute
and<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.479> hot<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:27.930> ready<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
and it's hot and it's ready to go and

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
and it's hot and it's ready to go and
okay<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.840> gonna<00:01:30.960> go<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.680> pros<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
okay I'm gonna go with the pros the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
okay I'm gonna go with the pros the
curler<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.329> biggest<00:01:33.630> pro<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
curler the one biggest pro to this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
curler the one biggest pro to this
curler<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> heavy<00:01:35.790> hair

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
curler is that if you have a heavy hair

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.880 
curler is that if you have a heavy hair
like<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> lot<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.259> hair<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.829> do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
like I do or a lot of hair like I do

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.390 
like I do or a lot of hair like I do
then<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.780> tends<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.290> set<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> curl<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.040> keep

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
then this tends to set the curl and keep

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.399 
then this tends to set the curl and keep
it<00:01:42.140> over<00:01:43.140> days<00:01:43.560> versus<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.689> falling<00:01:46.079> flat

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
it over days versus it just falling flat

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.770 
it over days versus it just falling flat
once<00:01:46.740> you're<00:01:46.950> out<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.509> if

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
once you're out and that's because if

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.870 
once you're out and that's because if
you<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.020> heavy<00:01:49.229> hairs<00:01:49.619> difficult<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you have heavy hairs difficult for I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
you have heavy hairs difficult for I
mean<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> need<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> lot<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.649> lot<00:01:52.799> of

mean you need a lot of you need a lot of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
mean you need a lot of you need a lot of
heat<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.610> your<00:01:53.850> hair<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.270> able<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.600> set<00:01:54.810> and

heat for your hair to be able to set and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.300

hairspray<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> world<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.950> what

hairspray in the world and that is what

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.899 
hairspray in the world and that is what
this<00:02:00.090> curler<00:02:00.630> does<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.259> me<00:02:01.380> however<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.610> time

this curler does for me however the time

this curler does for me however the time
it<00:02:03.299> takes<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.840> curl<00:02:04.079> your<00:02:04.110> hair<00:02:04.380> tastes<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.770> lot

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
it takes to curl your hair tastes a lot

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
it takes to curl your hair tastes a lot
longer<00:02:05.159> with<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> curler<00:02:05.969> then<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:07.049> rollers

longer with a curler then with rollers

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.859

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
because your hair or your arms tend to

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.479

going going going it's not what you just
put<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.200> in

you just do whatever you want for the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.530 
you just do whatever you want for the
next<00:02:15.210> half<00:02:15.330> an<00:02:15.420> hour<00:02:15.540> also<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.270> thing<00:02:18.480> I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
next half an hour also the one thing I

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.210 
next half an hour also the one thing I
don't<00:02:18.600> think<00:02:18.720> people<00:02:18.930> realize<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.160> I

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
don't think people realize is that I I

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.580 
don't think people realize is that I I
realized<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.180> was<00:02:21.270> doing<00:02:21.390> my<00:02:21.480> hair<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.930> one

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
realized I was doing my hair that one

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.900 
realized I was doing my hair that one
side<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.980> my<00:02:23.100> hair<00:02:23.280> looked<00:02:23.520> kinda<00:02:23.700> different

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
side of my hair looked kinda different

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.580 
side of my hair looked kinda different
than<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.270> other<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.780> wondered<00:02:25.110> why<00:02:25.320> it's<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
than the other and I wondered why it's a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.320 
than the other and I wondered why it's a
talking-to<00:02:25.920> hairdresser<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.760> she<00:02:26.880> said<00:02:27.120> that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
talking-to hairdresser and she said that

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.090 
talking-to hairdresser and she said that
that's<00:02:27.750> because<00:02:28.170> when<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.530> do<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.800> left<00:02:28.920> side

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
that's because when you do the left side

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.190 
that's because when you do the left side
of<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.250> hair<00:02:29.630> most<00:02:30.630> people<00:02:30.840> generally<00:02:30.930> tend

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
of your hair most people generally tend

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.300 
of your hair most people generally tend
to<00:02:31.290> something<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> left<00:02:31.800> side<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.040> their<00:02:32.160> hair

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
to something the left side of their hair

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.620 
to something the left side of their hair
first<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:32.850> if<00:02:32.940> you're<00:02:33.030> right-handed<00:02:33.270> you

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
first of all if you're right-handed you

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.210 
first of all if you're right-handed you
tend<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.020> your<00:02:34.140> left<00:02:34.290> side<00:02:34.500> first<00:02:34.800> I<00:02:35.070> don't

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
tend to do your left side first I don't

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.949 
tend to do your left side first I don't
know<00:02:35.310> why<00:02:35.490> but<00:02:36.209> that's<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> way<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:36.840> is

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
know why but that's just the way it is

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.920 
know why but that's just the way it is
and<00:02:37.850> you're<00:02:38.850> you're<00:02:39.090> kind<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.360> new<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.690> fresh

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
and you're you're kind of new and fresh

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.480 
and you're you're kind of new and fresh
sea<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.230> energy<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.220> certain<00:02:41.459> way

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
sea of energy so you do it a certain way

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.730 
sea of energy so you do it a certain way
when<00:02:42.420> by<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.630> time<00:02:42.959> we<00:02:43.050> make<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.560> side

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
when by the time we make it to this side

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.690 
when by the time we make it to this side
of<00:02:43.890> your<00:02:44.010> head<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.970> are<00:02:45.000> not<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:46.050> energetic

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
of your head you are not as energetic

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.340 
of your head you are not as energetic
and<00:02:47.700> your<00:02:48.239> arms<00:02:48.510> kind<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.840> hurting<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.290> you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
and your arms kind of hurting so you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.110 
and your arms kind of hurting so you
tend<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.590> hold<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:50.190> different<00:02:50.430> position

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
tend to hold it in different position

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.210 
tend to hold it in different position
whether<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.600> realize<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.989> or<00:02:52.200> not<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.680> that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
whether you realize it or not and that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190 
whether you realize it or not and that
ends<00:02:53.550> up<00:02:53.640> making<00:02:53.910> your<00:02:54.270> curls<00:02:54.570> look<00:02:54.750> different

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
ends up making your curls look different

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.350 
ends up making your curls look different
so<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.730> end<00:02:56.880> up<00:02:56.940> doing<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.150> without<00:02:57.239> even

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
so you end up doing that without even

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.729 
so you end up doing that without even
thinking<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.080> are<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.650> be

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
thinking that you are so you have to be

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.290 
thinking that you are so you have to be
careful<00:02:59.160> when<00:02:59.340> you're<00:02:59.489> curling<00:03:00.030> your<00:03:00.209> hair

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
careful when you're curling your hair

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.940 
careful when you're curling your hair
with<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.660> also<00:03:01.200> there's<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.530> much<00:03:01.709> higher

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
with this also there's a much higher

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.590 
with this also there's a much higher
chance<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.520> getting<00:03:02.640> burned<00:03:03.090> with<00:03:03.420> this

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
chance of you getting burned with this

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.940 
chance of you getting burned with this
and<00:03:03.780> I've<00:03:03.840> gotten<00:03:04.230> burned<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:04.770> three

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
and I've gotten burned I think three

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.320 
and I've gotten burned I think three
times<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> big<00:03:05.550> scar<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:05.820> my<00:03:05.880> shoulder

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
times to have a big scar on my shoulder

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.830 
times to have a big scar on my shoulder
from<00:03:06.390> was<00:03:06.600> actually<00:03:06.989> good<00:03:07.620> gets<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:07.950> hot<00:03:08.840> now

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
from was actually good gets that hot now

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.300 
from was actually good gets that hot now
on<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.800> other<00:03:10.950> hand<00:03:11.280> with<00:03:11.730> rollers<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:13.310> like

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
on the other hand with rollers I like

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.490 
on the other hand with rollers I like
these<00:03:14.640> but<00:03:15.150> not<00:03:15.420> enough<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.020> keep<00:03:16.230> them

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
these but not enough to keep them

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.479 
these but not enough to keep them
because<00:03:16.860> my<00:03:17.130> hair<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.780> not<00:03:18.780> as<00:03:18.840> light<00:03:19.410> as<00:03:19.650> other

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
because my hair is not as light as other

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.820 
because my hair is not as light as other
people's<00:03:20.910> hair<00:03:21.090> who<00:03:21.420> rollers<00:03:22.320> would<00:03:22.470> work<00:03:22.650> on

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
people's hair who rollers would work on

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.070 
people's hair who rollers would work on
and<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.489> reason<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.940> because<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.780> heat<00:03:24.930> this

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
and the reason is because you heat this

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.750 
and the reason is because you heat this
up<00:03:25.200> for<00:03:25.380> five<00:03:25.530> minutes<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:26.220> leave<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.610> in<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
up for five minutes you leave it in the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.910 
up for five minutes you leave it in the
box<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.269> heat<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.600> up<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.500> leave<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> lid

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
box you heat it up and you leave the lid

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.490 
box you heat it up and you leave the lid
open<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.630> takes<00:03:30.810> five<00:03:31.019> minutes<00:03:31.230> right

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
open and so it takes five minutes right

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.140 
open and so it takes five minutes right
there<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.860> heat<00:03:32.010> up<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.370> then<00:03:32.880> once<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.120> put

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
there to heat up and then once you put

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.750 
there to heat up and then once you put
it<00:03:33.420> in<00:03:33.660> first<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.040> tend<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.340> get<00:03:35.459> burned

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
it in first of all I tend to get burned

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.970 
it in first of all I tend to get burned
a<00:03:35.940> lot<00:03:36.090> like<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.660> got<00:03:36.870> burned<00:03:37.170> at<00:03:37.290> least<00:03:37.320> like<00:03:37.590> 25

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
a lot like I got burned at least like 25

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.500 
a lot like I got burned at least like 25
times<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.370> got<00:03:38.489> around<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.850> side<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.030> my<00:03:39.269> head

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
times I got around the side of my head

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.120 
times I got around the side of my head
like<00:03:39.540> right<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:40.200> because<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.560> touching<00:03:40.920> my

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
like right here because it's touching my

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.289 
like right here because it's touching my
skin<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:42.440> but<00:03:43.440> then<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:44.459> heat<00:03:44.640> wears<00:03:45.000> out

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
skin and but then the heat wears out

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.180 
skin and but then the heat wears out
pretty<00:03:45.959> soon<00:03:46.230> -<00:03:46.560> look<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.769> would<00:03:46.950> say<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.100> about

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
pretty soon - look I would say in about

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.920 
pretty soon - look I would say in about
ten<00:03:47.430> minutes<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.790> heat<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.120> gone<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.750> once

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
ten minutes the heat is gone and once

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.350 
ten minutes the heat is gone and once
the<00:03:49.019> heat<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.200> gone<00:03:49.440> like<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.459> heatless<00:03:50.850> carla

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
the heat is gone like a heatless carla

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.199 
the heat is gone like a heatless carla
is<00:03:51.390> not<00:03:51.780> gonna<00:03:51.930> keep<00:03:52.320> my<00:03:52.739> hair<00:03:53.040> because<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.120> how

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
is not gonna keep my hair because of how

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.000 
is not gonna keep my hair because of how
thick<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.600> dense<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.110> in<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.470> same<00:03:55.680> shape

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
thick and dense it is in the same shape

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.890 
thick and dense it is in the same shape
that<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.519> would<00:03:56.700> if<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.060> was<00:03:57.239> high<00:03:57.420> heat<00:03:57.720> and

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
that it would if this was high heat and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.440 
that it would if this was high heat and
so<00:03:58.560> what<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.739> realized<00:03:59.190> with<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.640> one<00:03:59.940> is<00:04:00.239> that

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
so what I realized with this one is that

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.979 
so what I realized with this one is that
I<00:04:00.890> went<00:04:01.890> up<00:04:02.040> 30<00:04:02.790> minutes<00:04:03.209> into<00:04:03.329> going<00:04:03.600> out<00:04:03.780> my

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
I went up 30 minutes into going out my

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.110 
I went up 30 minutes into going out my
hair<00:04:04.230> was<00:04:04.440> pin<00:04:04.920> straight<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.430> my<00:04:05.610> hair<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:05.910> not

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
hair was pin straight and my hair is not

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.940 
hair was pin straight and my hair is not
naturally<00:04:06.570> pin<00:04:06.750> straight<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.049> begin<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:07.560> but

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
naturally pin straight to begin with but

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.400 
naturally pin straight to begin with but
because<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:09.000> guess<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.690> don't<00:04:09.959> know<00:04:10.049> I<00:04:10.079> can<00:04:10.380> just

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
because I guess I don't know I can just

rolls and didn't work out for me but at
the<00:04:20.280> same<00:04:20.430> time<00:04:20.640> I<00:04:20.700> tried<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.030> on<00:04:21.269> somebody

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
the same time I tried this on somebody

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.010 
the same time I tried this on somebody
who<00:04:21.750> has<00:04:21.870> much<00:04:22.109> thinner<00:04:22.410> hair<00:04:22.650> than<00:04:22.800> I

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
curling hair like I was rollers the best

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.029 
curling hair like I was rollers the best
way<00:04:40.659> to<00:04:40.690> starts<00:04:41.080> a<00:04:41.199> lot<00:04:41.349> easier<00:04:41.830> than<00:04:41.949> a

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
way to starts a lot easier than a

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.629 
way to starts a lot easier than a
curling<00:04:42.340> iron<00:04:42.659> in<00:04:43.659> my<00:04:43.900> opinion<00:04:44.319> so<00:04:44.620> once<00:04:45.460> I

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
curling iron in my opinion so once I

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.950 
curling iron in my opinion so once I
started<00:04:45.879> doing<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.479> kind<00:04:46.690> of<00:04:46.720> got<00:04:46.870> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
started doing this I kind of got the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.360 
started doing this I kind of got the
courage<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.259> use<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.680> curling<00:04:47.889> iron<00:04:48.099> and<00:04:48.340> that

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
courage to use the curling iron and that

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.309 
courage to use the curling iron and that
came<00:04:48.610> out<00:04:48.759> to<00:04:48.909> be<00:04:49.000> just<00:04:49.479> as<00:04:49.690> good<00:04:49.720> because<00:04:50.139> I

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
came out to be just as good because I

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.839 
came out to be just as good because I
guess<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.620> learned<00:04:51.039> how<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.310> do<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.610> over<00:04:51.789> time

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
guess I learned how to do it over time

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.809 
guess I learned how to do it over time
but<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:53.139> would<00:04:53.650> try<00:04:53.889> a<00:04:53.919> curler<00:04:54.370> see<00:04:54.610> if<00:04:54.699> it's

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
but I would try a curler see if it's

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.430 
but I would try a curler see if it's
right<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.150> you<00:04:55.240> because<00:04:55.479> if<00:04:55.599> it<00:04:55.720> is<00:04:55.930> this<00:04:56.199> ends

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
right to you because if it is this ends

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.719 
right to you because if it is this ends
up<00:04:56.500> saving<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.889> time<00:04:57.069> it<00:04:57.340> could<00:04:57.460> take<00:04:57.550> stuff

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
up saving you time it could take stuff
