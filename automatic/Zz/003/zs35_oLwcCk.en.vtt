apologize if I mispronounced that name
so<00:01:18.229> yes<00:01:20.180> here's<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> actual<00:01:21.659> beyblade<00:01:22.590> itself

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
so yes here's the actual beyblade itself

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.200 
so yes here's the actual beyblade itself
has<00:01:24.750> high<00:01:25.439> defense<00:01:25.799> power<00:01:25.950> high<00:01:26.400> stamina<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
has high defense power high stamina and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.810 
has high defense power high stamina and
some<00:01:27.540> attack<00:01:27.840> power<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:29.130> attack<00:01:29.369> power<00:01:29.549> comes

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
some attack power the attack power comes

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.350 
some attack power the attack power comes
from<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.299> fusion<00:01:30.630> wheel<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.409> energy<00:01:32.360> now

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
from the fusion wheel and the energy now

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.780 
from the fusion wheel and the energy now
some<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.049> might<00:01:34.770> know<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.430> rock

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
some of you might know that a rock

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.330 
some of you might know that a rock
fusion<00:01:35.970> wheel<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.990> defense<00:01:37.650> type<00:01:37.890> fusion

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
fusion wheel is a defense type fusion

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.580 
fusion wheel is a defense type fusion
wheel<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.329> since<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> has<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.170> these<00:01:40.290> notches

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
wheel but since it has all these notches

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.580 
wheel but since it has all these notches
and<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.340> rounded<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.030> does<00:01:42.689> provide<00:01:43.049> recoil

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and it's rounded it does provide recoil

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.060 
and it's rounded it does provide recoil
so<00:01:44.250> after<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.270> rebounds<00:01:46.020> from<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.259> recoil<00:01:46.680> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so after it rebounds from the recoil it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.969 
so after it rebounds from the recoil it
will<00:01:47.430> go<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:48.090> an<00:01:48.180> attack<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.680> also<00:01:49.829> has

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
will go in for an attack and it also has

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.740 
will go in for an attack and it also has
the<00:01:50.280> 100<00:01:50.759> spin<00:01:50.939> track<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> get<00:01:51.420> under<00:01:51.630> its

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the 100 spin track to get under its

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.609 
the 100 spin track to get under its
opponent<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.850> wide<00:01:54.000> prevents<00:01:54.360> perform<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
opponent the wide prevents perform the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.609 
opponent the wide prevents perform the
white<00:01:55.770> defense<00:01:56.490> performance<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.619> provides

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
white defense performance it provides

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.170 
white defense performance it provides
stamina<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.540> defense<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> defense

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
stamina and defense so this is a defense

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.649 
stamina and defense so this is a defense
type<00:02:03.420> beyblade<00:02:04.670> alright<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
type beyblade alright so that's the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.759 
type beyblade alright so that's the
first<00:02:06.930> one<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.890> second<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.369> is

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.960 

twisted<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.810> you're<00:02:14.989> gonna<00:02:15.079> go<00:02:15.939> push<00:02:16.939> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
twisted you so you're gonna go push the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:32.679 
twisted you so you're gonna go push the
fusion<00:02:18.939> eagle<00:02:19.939> energy<00:02:28.510> also<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:30.700> 80<00:02:31.700> 145<00:02:32.420> spin

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
fusion eagle energy also a 80 145 spin

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:51.819 
fusion eagle energy also a 80 145 spin
track<00:02:32.900> which<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.260> need<00:02:33.439> to<00:02:33.560> get<00:02:33.680> out<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:51.049> 80<00:02:51.290> 145

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
track which I need to get out and 80 145

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.869 
track which I need to get out and 80 145
spin<00:02:52.099> track<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:53.690> WD<00:02:54.439> performance<00:02:54.950> tip<00:02:55.129> so

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
spin track the WD performance tip so

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.020 
spin track the WD performance tip so
that<00:02:56.150> comes<00:02:56.359> off<00:02:56.510> of<00:02:56.569> gravity<00:02:57.049> of<00:02:57.109> story<00:02:58.030> so

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
that comes off of gravity of story so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.420 
that comes off of gravity of story so
this<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.989> very<00:03:00.799> high<00:03:01.010> defense<00:03:01.310> that

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
this is a very high defense that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.759 
this is a very high defense that
beyblade<00:03:03.189> all<00:03:04.189> the<00:03:04.609> parts<00:03:04.970> are<00:03:05.379> high<00:03:06.379> defense

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
beyblade all the parts are high defense

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.740 
beyblade all the parts are high defense
tight<00:03:07.730> parts<00:03:09.549> it's<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.670> solid<00:03:11.000> defense<00:03:11.510> side

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
tight parts it's a solid defense side

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.199 
tight parts it's a solid defense side
beyblade<00:03:12.170> with<00:03:12.379> very<00:03:13.159> little<00:03:13.340> stamina<00:03:13.760> but

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
beyblade with very little stamina but

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:22.150 
beyblade with very little stamina but
there<00:03:14.359> is<00:03:14.389> some<00:03:14.949> so<00:03:16.480> yeah<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:18.139> is<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:21.160> these

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
come from the top three highest defense

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.520 
come from the top three highest defense
side<00:03:27.590> beyblades<00:03:28.209> or<00:03:29.209> i<00:03:29.239> should<00:03:29.659> say<00:03:29.810> top<00:03:30.260> two

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
side beyblades or i should say top two

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.319 
side beyblades or i should say top two
and<00:03:30.799> top<00:03:30.949> one<00:03:32.500> because<00:03:33.500> in<00:03:33.769> metal<00:03:34.069> fusion<00:03:34.849> two

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
and top one because in metal fusion two

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.390 
and top one because in metal fusion two
metal<00:03:35.540> fusion<00:03:35.870> series<00:03:36.139> earth<00:03:36.650> eagle<00:03:37.129> is<00:03:37.250> one

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
metal fusion series earth eagle is one

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.460 
metal fusion series earth eagle is one
of<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.549> highest<00:03:37.669> defense<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.810> twist<00:03:39.379> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
of the highest defense and twist the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.439 
of the highest defense and twist the
tempo<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:39.829> gravity<00:03:40.129> two<00:03:40.190> sure<00:03:40.340> are<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:41.269> top

tempo in gravity two sure are the top

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.009 
tempo in gravity two sure are the top
two<00:03:41.659> highest<00:03:42.169> defense<00:03:42.470> in<00:03:42.709> metal<00:03:43.430> masters<00:03:44.019> so

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
two highest defense in metal masters so

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.939 
two highest defense in metal masters so
that's<00:03:45.470> twisted<00:03:46.459> eagle<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.440> now<00:03:48.440> for<00:03:48.500> rock

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
that's twisted eagle and now for rock

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.270 
that's twisted eagle and now for rock
her<00:03:49.220> clean<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.870> need<00:03:51.169> a<00:03:51.349> critically<00:03:52.159> ill

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
her clean you need a critically ill

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:02.710 
her clean you need a critically ill
energy<00:03:55.150> another<00:03:56.150> rock<00:03:56.540> usual

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.690 

also<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.800> rubber<00:04:04.460> flap<00:04:04.760> spin<00:04:05.510> track<00:04:07.240> and

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
also a rubber flap spin track and

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.740 
also a rubber flap spin track and
finally<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:11.440> metal<00:04:12.440> spike<00:04:12.620> performance<00:04:13.190> tip

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
finally a metal spike performance tip

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.160 
finally a metal spike performance tip
which<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.900> can<00:04:15.050> get<00:04:15.170> from<00:04:17.859> /<00:04:18.859> vibration<00:04:20.170> so

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
which you can get from / vibration so

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.360 
which you can get from / vibration so
once<00:04:21.530> use<00:04:21.769> some<00:04:22.010> lists<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:23.300> has<00:04:23.950> high<00:04:24.950> attack

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
once use some lists it has high attack

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.930 
once use some lists it has high attack
high<00:04:25.670> defense<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.390> also<00:04:27.080> high<00:04:27.440> stamina<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.190> is

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
high defense and also high stamina it is

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.570 
high defense and also high stamina it is
a<00:04:29.000> stamina<00:04:29.390> type<00:04:29.710> overall<00:04:33.280> although<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.400> does

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
a stamina type overall although it does

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.360 
a stamina type overall although it does
high<00:04:34.760> have<00:04:35.240> high<00:04:35.600> defense<00:04:36.440> power<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:36.920> high

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
high have high defense power and high

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.360 
high have high defense power and high
attack<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:41.030> attack<00:04:41.330> power<00:04:41.480> comes<00:04:42.290> from<00:04:42.440> the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
attack the attack power comes from the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.150 
attack the attack power comes from the
energy<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:44.150> fusion<00:04:44.780> wheel<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.860> defense

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
energy and fusion wheel the defense

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.760 
energy and fusion wheel the defense
power<00:04:46.340> comes<00:04:47.090> from<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.450> fusion<00:04:47.660> well<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.170> the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
power comes from the fusion well and the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.010 
power comes from the fusion well and the
spin<00:04:49.040> track<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:50.270> stamina<00:04:50.660> comes<00:04:50.810> from

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
spin track and the stamina comes from

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.620 
spin track and the stamina comes from
the<00:04:51.170> performance<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:53.350> so<00:04:54.700> yeah<00:04:55.700> just<00:04:56.450> like

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
the performance it so yeah just like

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.230 
the performance it so yeah just like
rock<00:04:57.080> faces<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.980> recoil<00:04:58.430> from<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.910> rock

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
rock faces the recoil from the rock

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.350 
rock faces the recoil from the rock
fusion<00:04:59.510> wheel<00:04:59.810> allows<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.590> attack<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.610> if

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
fusion wheel allows it to attack and if

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.760 
fusion wheel allows it to attack and if
somehow<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:03.080> gets<00:05:03.320> under<00:05:03.590> its<00:05:03.710> opponent<00:05:04.070> the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
somehow it gets under its opponent the

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.440 
somehow it gets under its opponent the
energy<00:05:06.770> ring<00:05:06.919> will<00:05:07.600> attack<00:05:08.600> from<00:05:09.100> below<00:05:10.100> and

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
energy ring will attack from below and

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.540 
energy ring will attack from below and
also<00:05:11.450> if<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.650> beyblade<00:05:13.010> gets<00:05:13.190> under<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:14.600> are

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
also if a beyblade gets under it the are

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.960 
also if a beyblade gets under it the are
145<00:05:16.550> spin<00:05:17.390> track<00:05:17.570> will<00:05:18.850> have<00:05:19.850> some<00:05:20.120> defense<00:05:21.970> um

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
145 spin track will have some defense um

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.150 
145 spin track will have some defense um
so<00:05:23.750> yeah<00:05:24.320> that<00:05:24.650> is<00:05:24.880> rock<00:05:25.880> Herculeah<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:27.740> those

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
so yeah that is rock Herculeah and those

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.610 
so yeah that is rock Herculeah and those
are<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.310> three<00:05:28.640> combinations<00:05:29.090> I<00:05:29.419> have<00:05:29.630> today
