00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
coverage as I wanted to be and thinking

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.470 
coverage as I wanted to be and thinking
that<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.410> cream<00:02:34.100> foundation<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:35.360> would

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
that it is a cream foundation you would

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.820 
that it is a cream foundation you would
expect<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.020> kind<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.350> full<00:02:36.560> coverage

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
expect it to kind of be full coverage

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.470 
expect it to kind of be full coverage
you<00:02:37.250> probably<00:02:37.520> do<00:02:37.730> like<00:02:37.850> two<00:02:38.060> layers<00:02:38.270> because

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you probably do like two layers because

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.900 
you probably do like two layers because
I'm<00:02:38.720> someone<00:02:39.200> who<00:02:39.290> loves<00:02:39.530> like<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.100> don't<00:02:40.760> say

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.150 
I'm someone who loves like I don't say
thick<00:02:41.210> but<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.260> look<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.920> skin

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
thick but I like to look I like the skin

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.190 
thick but I like to look I like the skin
to<00:02:43.280> look<00:02:43.340> very<00:02:43.400> flawless<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.210> full<00:02:44.600> coverage

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
to look very flawless and full coverage

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.710 
to look very flawless and full coverage

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
so this one is a maybe I think I

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.910

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
probably would repurchase just because I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.230 
probably would repurchase just because I
really<00:02:49.130> like<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.370> finish<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.880> does<00:02:50.060> give

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
really like the finish and it does give

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.330 
really like the finish and it does give

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
because you can't really tell it's there

so<00:03:25.640> but<00:03:26.239> it's<00:03:26.420> covered<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.930> know<00:03:27.049> and<00:03:27.850> think

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
so but it's covered you know and think

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.070 
so but it's covered you know and think
about<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.150> it's<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.450> little<00:03:29.660> bit<00:03:29.750> more<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:29.989> a

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
about this it's a little bit more of a

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.479 
about this it's a little bit more of a
dewy<00:03:30.290> finish<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:30.739> my<00:03:30.920> opinion<00:03:31.220> here<00:03:31.400> is

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
dewy finish it in my opinion here is

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.070 
dewy finish it in my opinion here is
another<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:31.760> opinion<00:03:32.060> but<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:32.690> feel<00:03:32.870> like<00:03:32.900> it's

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
another one opinion but I feel like it's

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.840 
another one opinion but I feel like it's
very<00:03:33.140> dewy<00:03:33.709> like<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:34.220> just<00:03:34.370> needs<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.580> skin

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
very dewy like it just needs a skin

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.380 
very dewy like it just needs a skin
nicely<00:03:35.450> fresh<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.350> dewy<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.799> glowy<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:38.000> if

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
nicely fresh and dewy and glowy so if

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.000 
nicely fresh and dewy and glowy so if
you<00:03:38.570> obviously<00:03:39.049> consider<00:03:39.380> with<00:03:39.530> powder<00:03:39.739> and

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
you obviously consider with powder and

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.789 
you obviously consider with powder and
just<00:03:40.250> leave<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.400> these<00:03:40.790> areas<00:03:41.440> not<00:03:42.440> set<00:03:42.680> with

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
just leave like these areas not set with

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.960 
just leave like these areas not set with
powder<00:03:42.950> so<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.160> way<00:03:43.310> looks<00:03:43.489> very<00:03:43.640> dewy<00:03:43.880> and

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
powder so that way looks very dewy and

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.250 
powder so that way looks very dewy and
I'm<00:03:44.120> not<00:03:44.209> sure<00:03:44.330> is<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.510> what<00:03:44.870> does<00:03:44.989> kind<00:03:45.200> of

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
I'm not sure is it what does kind of

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.970 
I'm not sure is it what does kind of
looks<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.640> on<00:03:46.640> my<00:03:46.910> rib<00:03:46.940> oh<00:03:47.810> there<00:03:48.560> we<00:03:48.620> go<00:03:48.650> and

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
looks like on my rib oh there we go and

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.250 
looks like on my rib oh there we go and
obviously<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.910> looks<00:03:49.940> kind<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.269> like<00:03:50.330> whip<00:03:50.630> my

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
obviously it looks kind of like whip my

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.620 
obviously it looks kind of like whip my
guess<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:51.799> then<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.760> can<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.120> kind<00:03:53.330> of<00:03:53.360> Pat

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
guess and then you can just kind of Pat

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.840 
guess and then you can just kind of Pat
it<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:53.840> i<00:03:54.580> padded<00:03:55.580> it<00:03:55.700> till<00:03:56.000> i<00:03:56.030> got<00:03:57.160> cream<00:03:58.160> auto

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
it and i padded it till i got cream auto

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.400 
it and i padded it till i got cream auto
cream<00:03:59.090> but<00:03:59.239> like<00:03:59.330> a<00:03:59.420> liquid<00:03:59.570> formula<00:04:00.260> as

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
cream but like a liquid formula as

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.289 
cream but like a liquid formula as
opposed<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.190> taking<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.610> other<00:04:01.790> thing<00:04:02.090> and

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
opposed to taking the other thing and

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.570 
opposed to taking the other thing and
i'm<00:04:03.290> going<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.440> rub<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.739> into<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:04.010> skin<00:04:04.400> and

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
i'm going to rub it into the skin and

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.840 
i'm going to rub it into the skin and
it's<00:04:05.570> a<00:04:05.750> little<00:04:06.080> bit<00:04:06.200> watery<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:07.430> right<00:04:07.700> when

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
it's a little bit watery and right when

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.190 
it's a little bit watery and right when
you<00:04:07.910> put<00:04:08.060> on<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.330> can<00:04:08.480> see<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.780> it's<00:04:08.900> still

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
you put on you can see that it's still

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.630 
you put on you can see that it's still
very<00:04:09.260> jewy<00:04:09.739> gets<00:04:10.100> been<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.459> library

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
very jewy gets been to the library

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.060 
very jewy gets been to the library
flexing<00:04:11.180> off<00:04:11.330> of<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.600> but<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.290> does<00:04:12.470> mattify<00:04:13.040> a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
flexing off of it but it does mattify a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.520 
flexing off of it but it does mattify a
tiny<00:04:13.459> tiny<00:04:13.700> bit<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:14.870> doesn't<00:04:15.140> look<00:04:15.170> to

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
tiny tiny bit and it doesn't look to

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.740 
tiny tiny bit and it doesn't look to
overpower<00:04:16.010> you<00:04:16.280> doing<00:04:16.640> but<00:04:17.239> it<00:04:17.359> still<00:04:17.600> leaves

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
overpower you doing but it still leaves

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.009 
overpower you doing but it still leaves
that<00:04:17.870> fresh<00:04:18.169> young<00:04:18.739> skin<00:04:19.729> glow<00:04:20.329> so<00:04:20.630> i<00:04:20.660> like

that fresh young skin glow so i like
that<00:04:21.169> i<00:04:21.229> like<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.650> fact<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:22.040> does<00:04:22.490> that<00:04:22.669> once

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
that i like the fact that does that once

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.730 
that i like the fact that does that once
again<00:04:23.479> i<00:04:23.600> mean<00:04:23.870> i<00:04:24.020> don't<00:04:24.229> like<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.530> it

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
again i mean i don't like is that it

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.070 
again i mean i don't like is that it
doesn't<00:04:25.190> give<00:04:25.340> my<00:04:25.760> skin<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.210> full<00:04:26.570> coverage

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
doesn't give my skin a full coverage

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.100 
doesn't give my skin a full coverage
look<00:04:27.740> or<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:28.040> doesn't<00:04:28.700> um<00:04:29.150> alright<00:04:29.750> but<00:04:29.990> it

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
look or it doesn't um alright but it

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.570 
look or it doesn't um alright but it
doesn't<00:04:30.380> last<00:04:30.470> as<00:04:30.680> long<00:04:30.710> as<00:04:30.919> I<00:04:30.979> wanted<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.370> I

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
doesn't last as long as I wanted to I

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.370 
doesn't last as long as I wanted to I
can<00:04:32.000> still<00:04:32.210> see<00:04:32.330> my<00:04:32.510> skin<00:04:32.810> peeking<00:04:33.140> through

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
can still see my skin peeking through

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.050 
can still see my skin peeking through
and<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.919> don't<00:04:34.130> like<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.460> want<00:04:34.669> my<00:04:34.729> skin<00:04:34.789> to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
and I don't like that I want my skin to

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.580 
and I don't like that I want my skin to
obviously<00:04:35.720> be<00:04:35.870> covered<00:04:36.169> so<00:04:36.260> maybe<00:04:36.440> another

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
obviously be covered so maybe another

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.740 
obviously be covered so maybe another
layer<00:04:36.830> would<00:04:37.430> be<00:04:37.580> great<00:04:37.849> for<00:04:38.030> your<00:04:38.150> skin<00:04:38.210> just

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
layer would be great for your skin just

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.510 
layer would be great for your skin just
to<00:04:39.020> make<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.200> look<00:04:39.320> a<00:04:39.410> little<00:04:39.560> bit<00:04:39.770> more<00:04:40.039> full

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520
