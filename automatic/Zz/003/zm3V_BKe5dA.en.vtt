a<00:01:54.420> bit<00:01:54.570> higher<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:55.020> by<00:01:55.590> increasing<00:01:56.100> his

coordinates along the y axis then I'm

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.200 
coordinates along the y axis then I'm
going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.100> for<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> platform<00:01:59.820> he<00:01:59.909> starts

on<00:02:00.360> by<00:02:00.570> comparing<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> coordinates<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.799> each

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920 
on by comparing the coordinates of each
platform<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.759> Mario's<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.420> move<00:02:03.780> that

platform to Mario's and move that

to reach to do that I'm going to find

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.560 
to reach to do that I'm going to find
the<00:02:59.220> mushroom<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.820> just<00:03:00.000> increase<00:03:00.359> its

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
the mushroom and just increase its

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.420 
the mushroom and just increase its
height<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.810> bit

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.650 

once<00:03:05.430> you've<00:03:05.579> finished<00:03:05.910> editing<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.390> scene

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
once you've finished editing the scene

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:17.640 
once you've finished editing the scene
file<00:03:07.200> save<00:03:07.739> saves<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.489> changes

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.680 

the<00:03:18.640> first<00:03:18.909> thing<00:03:19.120> I'm<00:03:19.209> going<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.390> do<00:03:19.540> to

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
the first thing I'm going to do to

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.720 
the first thing I'm going to do to
rebuild<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.200> ISO<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.799> open<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.280> tools<00:03:21.549> folder

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
rebuild the ISO is open the tools folder

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.160 
rebuild the ISO is open the tools folder
in<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.120> new<00:03:22.269> window<00:03:22.629> so<00:03:22.780> it's<00:03:22.989> easily

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
in a new window so it's easily

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.850 
in a new window so it's easily
accessible<00:03:25.080> next<00:03:26.080> I'm<00:03:26.200> going<00:03:26.349> to<00:03:26.440> go<00:03:26.560> into<00:03:26.709> the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
and then Koro x2 folder here you'll see

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.110 
and then Koro x2 folder here you'll see
the<00:03:32.709> scene<00:03:32.890> folder<00:03:33.310> which<00:03:33.459> will<00:03:33.640> drag<00:03:33.879> in<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
the scene folder which will drag in the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.699 
the scene folder which will drag in the
arc<00:03:34.299> pack<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.780> we<00:03:34.900> downloaded<00:03:35.079> in<00:03:35.409> the<00:03:35.500> last

arc pack that we downloaded in the last
tutorial

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.080 

once<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.440> finishes<00:03:43.739> creating<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> RC<00:03:44.819> file

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
the archive could take a while so I'm

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:59.440 
the archive could take a while so I'm
going<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.519> speed<00:03:50.790> this<00:03:50.940> up

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.970

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
now that it's done compressing I'm going

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.690 
now that it's done compressing I'm going
to<00:04:02.040> rename<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.550> Koro<00:04:02.910> x2<00:04:03.540> SCS<00:04:04.500> now<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.610> is

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
to rename it to Koro x2 SCS now it is

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.180 
to rename it to Koro x2 SCS now it is
ready<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.030> be<00:04:06.210> put<00:04:06.390> into<00:04:06.570> an<00:04:06.750> ISO<00:04:07.200> file<00:04:07.470> first
