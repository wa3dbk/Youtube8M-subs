00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.110
 video created with the support better 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.080
 public VKontakte 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.080
 Barclays. news go in and be aware 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.900
 hello in all the band members 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.480
 Stereo football or rather Pavlik series 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.580
 football gansik on such an event happened 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.310
 in the life of this community i rush you 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.050
 please and release audio conference 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.660
 the project that is successful 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.150
 functioned earlier but occurred 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.890
 some circumstances which are not 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.890
 explain it now and this project 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.470
 successfully stalled then when for example us 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.340
 I came 58 or more 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.620
 Questions that in general already entered history 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.110
 for those who do not really understand what this 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.230
 the project is all very simple and rests on 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.090
 titles when you ask a question about i 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.420
 I try to answer them all pretty 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:07.039
 just today is not today for this period 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.460
 came three questions though matters it 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:12.920
 difficult to name and then let us 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.619
 start your leave and asks how much 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.890
 videos are you planning to release in a week i 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.330
 I do not like to be honest 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.850
 to place their release in 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.119
 calendar plane I consider myself 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.920
 creative person and therefore pound 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.390
 I think all this in some kind of framework 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.830
 wrong because i think i need 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.680
 generally not measured by the amount of a 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.509
 better quality release better week 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.399
 do not miss anything but the candles 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.619
 weeks to release worthy of the role that 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.159
 it will be really interesting to release 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.440
 but just to look 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.360
 by likely it seems to me not very right 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.429
 Ruslan Cycle asks why 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.190
 negative attitude to Spartak I though 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.020
 I myself do not like Spartak but water the club and 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.100
 mud after a match with a leopard in which 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:07.460
 Spartak played well you chelsea 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.039
 very incomprehensible to be honest the text but 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.410
 as I understand 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.459
 Spartak does not compare cel TV series that 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.600
 very correct but they write that 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.330
 watered 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.370
 Spartak after the match with Barcelona dirt I 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.890
 I think that in my opinion this was not to be 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.470
 maybe I missed not arguing maybe but 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:32.840
 mud it pretty 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.060
 wrong to incriminate yourself because 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.140
 what to water and mud after the match with 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.489
 Leopard is pretty stupid considering 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.239
 today's alignment of forces in 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.340
 European world football all the more 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.730
 Spartak even in my one and seriously 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.160
 considered as a competitor he asked but 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.500
 and hate for Spartak seems to me 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.030
 possible only in two cases first 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.010
 is it if you cheer for some 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.470
 Moscow club example cisco and 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.920
 hate Spartak is in your blood 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.090
 the meaning of life can be and the second is 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.330
 actually pretty ordinary problem 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.370
 super clubs which in the past 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.890
 won a lot of trophy awards 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.040
 prestige words favorite country club and so 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.519
 further pretty common symptoms 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.930
 great super club because 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.819
 fans of course they don't like them 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.980
 third place of course except the first 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.560
 Spartak does not need anything but you need to understand 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.440
 that this is a completely different team is not the same 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.690
 which was allowed earlier in the 90s with 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.459
 Oleg romances but for some reason those 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.769
 conquered trophy still stands in 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.620
 reproach here they say there it was 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.599
 Spartacus is now not clear though here 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.000
 recently negatives with the protocol 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.489
 diminished with a hat-trick of various 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.620
 Armenian footballers for this club 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.030
 but the same for example with liverpool 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.150
 also connected when 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.129
 Champions Cup absolute remains on 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.390
 in the reproach of this team is absolutely not 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:04.780
 realizing that now the team is completely different 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.480
 absolutely from scratch from the roots is another 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.110
 the team is true and by the way about 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.540
 liverpool 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.299
 the next question and the author of this question 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.069
 gosh terekhov he writes how you think when 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.549
 liverpool will return to the big four 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.350
 year return liverpool in four 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.710
 quite difficult to name 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.020
 this season is clearly the real one 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.639
 transition season as said and ours she 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.760
 absolutely right because liverpool 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.360
 pursues the most common symptoms 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.650
 transition season when the team 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.349
 unmatched style in unmatched style 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.700
 beats tutankhamun next match 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:45.340
 against southland she fails that to us 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.950
 pretty just talking about 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.710
 liverpool instability in this 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.500
 championship and these symptoms are just the same to 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.389
 Transition season include this year 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.020
 in liverpool of course it will not get into the league 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.889
 champions 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.270
 but next season as they say 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.850
 always fans of liverpool 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.350
 they have a habit at the end 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.020
 season to speak but here is the next season 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.940
 exactly will be Liverpool we there for sure 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.810
 champions league will always say so 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.850
 because it 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.790
 liverpool is a great club and we all 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.040
 probably not want me only one to 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.560
 this red club was in the league 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.350
 champions probably this is good 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.960
 a healthy desire as an exact date probably 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.300
 no one can call but such a release 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.280
 I already got the conference 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.620
 everything seems to be pretty good, but if 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.080
 more questions and more 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.950
 interesting question is of course noticeable 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.470
 improve the quality of these podcasts so 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.050
 By the way, maybe some guests 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.000
 will be interesting and I do not exclude it 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.540
 but it all depends on you and your 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.910
 activity from your asked questions 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.730
 all on this all my name is Mikhail igor 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.370
 Ivanov ask your next questions 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.450
 goodbye world see you in public 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.450
 stereo football
