00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.920 
expects like fletching etc etc which
they<00:02:45.950> really<00:02:46.280> i'm<00:02:46.850> not<00:02:47.030> really<00:02:47.150> think<00:02:47.480> that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
they really i'm not really think that

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.660 
they really i'm not really think that
pretty<00:02:48.140> hundred<00:02:48.860> percent<00:02:49.190> sure<00:02:49.250> they're<00:02:49.550> not

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
pretty hundred percent sure they're not

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.760 
pretty hundred percent sure they're not
going<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.030> touch<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:50.480> shit<00:02:50.780> otherwise<00:02:51.500> it

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
going to touch that shit otherwise it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.110 
going to touch that shit otherwise it
would<00:02:51.890> probably<00:02:52.130> lose<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.400> lot<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.850> other

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
would probably lose a lot of other

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.230 
would probably lose a lot of other
