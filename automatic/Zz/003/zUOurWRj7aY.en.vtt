00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello everybody at 92 cents today I want 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.240
 make a video more mimi complaint 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.700
 it's really the thing that might not be 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.040
 useful for a lot of people but I really 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 I was really annoyed with samsung has 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.180
 a company that I already had cell phone 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.090
 sansung and I have television always praises 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.460
 quite a series samsung 5 that I 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 I have a year and two weeks, that is me 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.130
 I'll show that he's in trouble and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.590
 I can not get through 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.650
 guarantee because of very few days 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.090
 he really was from the beginning a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.770
 little time to open and close the screen 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.380
 but it worked normally it was never 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.820
 nothing that would hinder 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.559
 but last week he simply 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.290
 opened once 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.750
 Look at the size of the hole that opened here. 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.730
 ahead 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 Look here from the side as I was 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.510
 fully open 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.199
 If you look behind I do not know if you can 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 seeing really broken is also 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.750
 missing a part of it and it is with the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.309
 the whole screen gives even fear of opening and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.070
 close I've been trying to keep and a half 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.860
 still on the table while in a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.900
 I solve this hoping to get a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.760
 another backup notebook to power 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.049
 send for assistance that I know 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.090
 will charge me because I could not 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.380
 to go under warranty and visibly a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.689
 engineering problem is a problem of 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.180
 construction of the equipment there is no 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.979
 cheap Protestant equipment he is a 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.680
 Another good thing is that at some stage 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.409
 having a primary effect like this 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.340
 a really bad box construction 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.860
 Look how he's loose here, huh? 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.290
 now it's twisting to prepare not to be 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 very expensive then what until then always 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.649
 praises and samsung semp praises the notebook 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.509
 series 5 but I do not have more 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.659
 courage to recommend the make and model 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.340
 to anyone after this problem 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.770
 that's it, let's hope it's nothing 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.770
 too expensive a hug even more
