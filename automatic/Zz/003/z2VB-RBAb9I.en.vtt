shooter it spin around like crazy of
course<00:00:55.610> okay<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.120> more<00:00:57.300> seriously

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
course okay so a little more seriously

course okay so a little more seriously
you've<00:00:58.050> probably<00:00:58.290> noticed<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.130> a<00:00:59.250> few

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
you've probably noticed in just a few

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
you've probably noticed in just a few
shots<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.790> we've<00:00:59.910> looked<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.480> far<00:01:00.510> how

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
shots that we've looked at so far how

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.440 
shots that we've looked at so far how
great-looking<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> environments<00:01:02.700> are<00:01:02.820> what

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
great-looking the environments are what

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.240 
great-looking the environments are what
really<00:01:03.660> helps<00:01:04.079> add<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.620> is<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
really helps add to these is the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.219 
really helps add to these is the
layering<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> 343<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.750> Vanguard

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
layering that 343 and Vanguard

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620 
layering that 343 and Vanguard
added<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> game<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.370> this<00:01:09.090> shot<00:01:09.300> take<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
look at the top of the screen there's a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.190 
look at the top of the screen there's a
whole<00:01:11.670> other<00:01:11.700> layer<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.630> environment

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
whole other layer to this environment

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.870 
whole other layer to this environment
with<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:13.500> looks<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.710> race<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.130> banshees

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
with what looks like race and banshees

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.370 
with what looks like race and banshees
in<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> vicious<00:01:15.450> battle<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.960> whole<00:01:16.350> other

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.160 
in a vicious battle on a whole other
layer<00:01:16.770> than<00:01:17.220> where<00:01:17.490> we're<00:01:17.700> at<00:01:17.940> it's<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.930> great

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
layer than where we're at it's a great

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
layer than where we're at it's a great
little<00:01:19.320> touch<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.979> really<00:01:20.580> helped<00:01:20.880> add<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
little touch that really helped add a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
little touch that really helped add a
whole<00:01:21.510> new<00:01:21.540> level<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.260> realism<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> game

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
whole new level of realism to the game

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.420 
whole new level of realism to the game
pun<00:01:23.790> intended<00:01:23.970> then<00:01:24.840> again<00:01:25.049> sometimes<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
pun intended then again sometimes that

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
pun intended then again sometimes that
layered<00:01:26.640> effect<00:01:26.970> actually<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.870> detriment

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
layered effect actually was a detriment

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530 
layered effect actually was a detriment
to<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.159> example<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:30.180> we're

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to the game for example here we're

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
to the game for example here we're
exploring<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.290> map<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.740> looks<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.130> we

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
exploring the map and it looks like we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.310 
exploring the map and it looks like we
might<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.670> able<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.940> go<00:01:33.060> over<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.510> but<00:01:33.869> nope

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
might be able to go over there but nope

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.480 
might be able to go over there but nope
that's<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.979> edge<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.340> map

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that's actually the edge of the map

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
that's actually the edge of the map
that's<00:01:35.700> pretty<00:01:36.420> cleverly<00:01:36.960> blended<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
that's pretty cleverly blended with the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.620 
that's pretty cleverly blended with the
rest<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> map<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.940> only<00:01:39.180> once<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> know

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
rest of the map but only once you know

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.660 
rest of the map but only once you know
it's<00:01:39.810> there<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.290> lot<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> times<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.310> won't<00:01:41.520> know

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it's there a lot of times you won't know

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.250 
it's there a lot of times you won't know
it's<00:01:41.820> there<00:01:41.970> because<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.659> edge<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.080> map

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
it's there because the edge of the map

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.010 
it's there because the edge of the map
in<00:01:43.470> many<00:01:44.040> areas<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.000> big<00:01:45.420> giant<00:01:45.780> blue

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
in many areas is this big giant blue

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.810 
in many areas is this big giant blue
wall<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.650> see<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> shot<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
wall like you can see in this shot and

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
wall like you can see in this shot and
the<00:01:47.970> result<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.479> there's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.080> lot<00:01:49.260> of<00:01:49.350> times

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the result is there's a lot of times

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
the result is there's a lot of times
where<00:01:50.070> you'll<00:01:50.250> hit<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.610> edge<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> map

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
where you'll hit the edge of the map

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.850 
where you'll hit the edge of the map
without<00:01:51.180> even<00:01:51.570> knowing<00:01:51.900> it's<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.200> because

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
without even knowing it's there because

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.710 
without even knowing it's there because
it's<00:01:53.010> not<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.400> big<00:01:53.460> blue<00:01:54.240> wall<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
it's not this big blue wall that you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.539 
it's not this big blue wall that you
might<00:01:54.900> be<00:01:55.020> looking<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.920> instead<00:01:56.250> it's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
might be looking for but instead it's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
might be looking for but instead it's
blended<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.299> well<00:01:57.450> into<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> rest<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
blended really well into the rest of the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.280 
blended really well into the rest of the
map<00:01:58.640> now<00:01:59.640> even<00:01:59.939> though<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.360> top-down<00:02:00.960> view

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
map now even though a top-down view

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
map now even though a top-down view
isn't<00:02:01.650> what<00:02:01.740> you'd<00:02:01.890> expect<00:02:02.009> from<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.460> Halo<00:02:02.700> game

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
isn't what you'd expect from a Halo game

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.390 
isn't what you'd expect from a Halo game
these<00:02:03.420> environments<00:02:04.049> look<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> halo

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
these environments look like a halo

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.640 
these environments look like a halo
world<00:02:05.720> everything<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.900> beautifully<00:02:07.439> modeled

continuity across all of the various

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.400 
continuity across all of the various
levels<00:02:12.029> for<00:02:12.779> example<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:13.349> Spartan<00:02:13.739> assault

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410

with whatever these plants are here

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.690 
with whatever these plants are here
remember<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.530> nice<00:02:23.710> snow<00:02:23.980> effects<00:02:24.370> from<00:02:24.520> one

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
remember the nice snow effects from one

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.730 
remember the nice snow effects from one
of<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.850> shots<00:02:25.060> earlier<00:02:25.420> notice<00:02:26.350> how<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.620> this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
of the shots earlier notice how in this

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.500 
of the shots earlier notice how in this
environment<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.430> don't<00:02:27.670> have<00:02:27.880> snow<00:02:28.060> anymore

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
environment we don't have snow anymore

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.120 
environment we don't have snow anymore
but<00:02:29.020> there's<00:02:29.200> still<00:02:29.410> some<00:02:29.680> really<00:02:29.950> nice

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
but there's still some really nice

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.010 
but there's still some really nice
particles<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.000> light<00:02:31.210> if<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.870> look

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
particles in the light if you look

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.540 
particles in the light if you look
closely<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.680> see<00:02:32.860> what<00:02:33.280> looks<00:02:33.430> like

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
closely you can see what looks like

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.670 
closely you can see what looks like
pretty<00:02:34.090> decent<00:02:34.600> sized<00:02:34.750> sprites<00:02:35.170> floating

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
pretty decent sized sprites floating

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.890 
pretty decent sized sprites floating
around<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.160> get<00:02:36.460> this<00:02:36.670> effect<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.630> looks

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
around to get this effect but it looks

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.320 
around to get this effect but it looks
really<00:02:38.470> really<00:02:38.620> nice<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.250> again<00:02:39.520> helps<00:02:40.150> add

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
really really nice and again helps add

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.840 
really really nice and again helps add
to<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.690> game<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.920> course<00:02:42.160> there<00:02:42.670> were<00:02:42.820> some

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
to the game of course there were some

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.400 
to the game of course there were some
technical<00:02:43.270> issues<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.900> we<00:02:43.990> found<00:02:44.200> that

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
technical issues that we found that

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.110 
technical issues that we found that
broke<00:02:44.740> some<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.310> continuity<00:02:45.670> throughout

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
broke some of the continuity throughout

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.540 
broke some of the continuity throughout
the<00:02:46.270> game<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:47.320> example<00:02:47.740> most<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.490> the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
the game for example most of the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.250 
the game for example most of the
lighting<00:02:48.820> in<00:02:49.000> Spartan<00:02:49.390> assault<00:02:49.630> looks<00:02:50.050> like

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
lighting in Spartan assault looks like

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.440 
lighting in Spartan assault looks like
it's<00:02:50.440> baked<00:02:50.710> it's<00:02:51.340> not<00:02:51.550> necessarily<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> bad

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
it's baked it's not necessarily a bad

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.420 
it's baked it's not necessarily a bad
thing<00:02:52.750> but<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.410> can<00:02:53.500> make<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.860> assets<00:02:54.340> that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
thing but it can make the assets that

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.040 
thing but it can make the assets that
don't<00:02:54.760> have<00:02:55.000> baked<00:02:55.240> lighting<00:02:55.450> stand<00:02:55.870> out<00:02:56.020> that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
don't have baked lighting stand out that

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.650 
don't have baked lighting stand out that
much<00:02:56.230> more<00:02:56.680> in<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.520> shot<00:02:57.730> look<00:02:57.970> closely<00:02:58.270> at

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
much more in this shot look closely at

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.110 
much more in this shot look closely at
the<00:02:58.900> barrels<00:02:59.290> here<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.950> scene<00:03:00.190> here<00:03:00.910> let's

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
the barrels here in the scene here let's

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.880 
the barrels here in the scene here let's
pause<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.570> video<00:03:01.810> for<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:02.110> bit<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.710> see

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
pause the video for a bit so you can see

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.320 
pause the video for a bit so you can see
the<00:03:03.010> barrels<00:03:03.280> without<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.610> distraction<00:03:04.210> of

the barrels without the distraction of

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.450 
the barrels without the distraction of
the<00:03:04.630> fighting<00:03:04.990> going<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.410> notice<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.250> yellow

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
the fighting going on notice the yellow

running in the sunlight and then into
the<00:03:52.900> shade<00:03:53.140> did<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:54.010> see<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.160> difference<00:03:54.550> in

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
the shade did you see a difference in

the shade nope

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.400 
the shade nope
that's<00:03:57.970> because<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.570> shade<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:59.050> actually

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
that's because the shade is actually

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.260 
that's because the shade is actually
baked<00:03:59.650> into<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.100> ground<00:04:00.310> textures<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.120> it's

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
baked into the ground textures so it's

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.090 
baked into the ground textures so it's
not<00:04:01.420> interacting<00:04:02.050> with<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.290> character<00:04:02.800> model

as it moves there's no light there to do

as it moves there's no light there to do
that

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.869

you can see here and actually let's

you can see here and actually let's
pause<00:05:17.770> this<00:05:17.979> video<00:05:18.129> again<00:05:18.490> because<00:05:18.639> if<00:05:19.030> you

pause this video again because if you

pause this video again because if you

ground

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.980

you<00:05:21.400> notice<00:05:21.729> the<00:05:21.849> exact<00:05:22.180> same<00:05:22.360> texture<00:05:22.840> that's

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
you notice the exact same texture that's

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.959 
you notice the exact same texture that's
being<00:05:23.229> used<00:05:23.409> for<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.620> lot<00:05:23.800> of<00:05:23.979> the<00:05:24.129> white<00:05:24.370> icy

areas<00:05:25.330> can<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.139> see<00:05:26.289> them<00:05:26.409> here<00:05:27.250> let's

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
areas can you see them here let's

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.559 
areas can you see them here let's
highlight<00:05:27.759> them<00:05:28.000> just<00:05:28.210> so<00:05:28.270> there's<00:05:28.449> a<00:05:28.479> little

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
highlight them just so there's a little

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.869 
highlight them just so there's a little
bit<00:05:28.659> easier<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.050> see<00:05:29.139> sure<00:05:30.129> they're<00:05:30.340> rotated

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 
bit easier to see sure they're rotated

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.040 
bit easier to see sure they're rotated
around<00:05:30.969> differently<00:05:31.509> and<00:05:31.629> it<00:05:31.719> even<00:05:32.020> looks

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
around differently and it even looks

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.689 
around differently and it even looks
like<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.409> one<00:05:32.680> on<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.889> far<00:05:33.159> left<00:05:33.520> is

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
like the one on the far left is

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.939 
like the one on the far left is
stretched<00:05:34.629> a<00:05:34.750> little<00:05:34.840> to<00:05:35.110> fit<00:05:35.319> the<00:05:35.409> geometry

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
stretched a little to fit the geometry

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.769 
stretched a little to fit the geometry
but<00:05:36.430> you<00:05:36.580> can<00:05:36.759> still<00:05:37.000> tell<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:37.479> they're<00:05:37.659> the

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:37.779 
but you can still tell that they're the

but you can still tell that they're the

really<00:06:06.729> the<00:06:06.879> genre<00:06:07.240> itself<00:06:07.719> so<00:06:07.960> well<00:06:08.560> we<00:06:08.650> won't

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
really the genre itself so well we won't

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.290 
really the genre itself so well we won't
really<00:06:08.979> talk<00:06:09.190> about<00:06:09.250> them<00:06:09.610> in<00:06:09.729> this<00:06:09.819> review

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:11.589 
and they didn't affect our scores

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:12.930 
and they didn't affect our scores
because<00:06:12.009> they're<00:06:12.190> outside<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.580> scope<00:06:12.789> of

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
because they're outside the scope of

review it is worth mentioning that

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.510 
review it is worth mentioning that
simply<00:06:17.050> put<00:06:17.259> the<00:06:17.560> game<00:06:17.800> itself<00:06:18.099> is<00:06:18.310> pretty

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
simply put the game itself is pretty

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.700 
simply put the game itself is pretty
short<00:06:18.819> and<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.419> gameplay<00:06:19.690> that<00:06:19.900> there<00:06:20.199> is<00:06:20.379> can

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
short and the gameplay that there is can

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.769 
short and the gameplay that there is can
get<00:06:20.949> pretty<00:06:21.250> repetitive<00:06:21.430> so<00:06:21.969> don't<00:06:22.360> expect<00:06:22.690> to

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:22.779
