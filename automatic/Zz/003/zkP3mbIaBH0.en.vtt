00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
colors in a different colors and I think

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.979 
colors in a different colors and I think
that<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:21.580> sort<00:03:21.910> of<00:03:21.940> purple<00:03:22.330> goes<00:03:22.450> really<00:03:22.750> well

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
that is sort of purple goes really well

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.509 
that is sort of purple goes really well
with<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:24.010> blue<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:25.200> I've<00:03:26.200> used<00:03:26.410> a<00:03:26.530> light<00:03:26.709> gray

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
with the blue and I've used a light gray

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.830 
with the blue and I've used a light gray
and<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.700> think<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:27.940> looks<00:03:27.970> pretty<00:03:28.150> cool<00:03:28.540> with<00:03:28.810> a

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
and I think it looks pretty cool with a

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.900 
and I think it looks pretty cool with a
blue<00:03:29.050> as<00:03:29.170> well<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.130> whole<00:03:30.250> colors<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.700> think

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
blue as well so the whole colors I think

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.940 
blue as well so the whole colors I think
that<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.269> kind<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.540> looked<00:03:31.989> cool<00:03:32.319> together<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
that it kind of looked cool together and

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.890 
that it kind of looked cool together and
this<00:03:33.580> is<00:03:33.640> like<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> computer<00:03:34.330> desk<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:34.690> here
