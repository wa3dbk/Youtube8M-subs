 applied stressed that the problem is not to generate the nature of water 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.430
 of the need for you to establish the moral law on nature 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.910
 of man but one should say about what the dimension more properly 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.960
 human his practical reason is an inalienable theme so much so that it is also true 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.040
 those who deny natural law theoretically embrace it in practice even though 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.730
 This nadia issue is extremely problematic especially when it is necessary to react 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.180
 to a certain positive vegetation considered inhuman and therefore against 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.070
 nature as it came with the totalitarianisms of the 20th century and the second world war from 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.040
 part of the Christians especially Jewish Catholics but also no sects if 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.720
 you feel the need to refer to natural law, so we rightly speak of 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 a return to natural law 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.090
 but as a natural right 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.430
 professor campodonico if you think the subject is particularly current 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.720
 because at the end, natura plays five senses 1 to ascertain the tower 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.550
 biological and the differences of cultures the other meaning on which precisely if 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.430
 the normative one focused 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.690
 nature forces us to ask ourselves if there are better or worse customs than the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.310
 our God, others, this is a cially different meaning from 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.520
 what you normally use 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.770
 not to look ahead as far as the relationship between ethics and nature is concerned 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.229
 the need for a sense of recognition that I love and therefore criticize what 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.550
 does not work in light of this if I skip a judgment that starts from 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.210
 destiny of man and not from the past
