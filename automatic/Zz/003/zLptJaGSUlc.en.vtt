00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
into Senna's winter 2013 collection I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.330 
into Senna's winter 2013 collection I
think<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.319> eyeliner<00:03:27.889> and<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.130> lip

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
think that the eyeliner and the lip

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.400 
think that the eyeliner and the lip
liners<00:03:28.639> are<00:03:28.790> great<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.239> get<00:03:29.389> such<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.989> deep

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
liners are great you get such a deep

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.430 
liners are great you get such a deep
opaque<00:03:31.069> black<00:03:31.760> line<00:03:32.209> with<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.720> felt<00:03:33.230> tip

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
opaque black line with the felt tip

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.740 
opaque black line with the felt tip
eyeliner<00:03:33.889> and<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.700> transfers<00:03:35.180> very<00:03:35.269> smoothly

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
eyeliner and it transfers very smoothly

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.349 
eyeliner and it transfers very smoothly
onto<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.260> skin<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.250> lip<00:03:37.430> liner<00:03:37.639> same<00:03:38.030> it

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
onto the skin the lip liner same it

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.059 
onto the skin the lip liner same it
looks<00:03:38.930> like<00:03:39.109> it<00:03:39.290> won't<00:03:39.380> be<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.590> creamy<00:03:39.920> on

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
looks like it won't be that creamy on

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.500 
looks like it won't be that creamy on
the<00:03:40.099> skin<00:03:40.400> but<00:03:40.579> it<00:03:40.700> actually<00:03:40.849> takes<00:03:41.239> very

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
the skin but it actually takes very

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.300 
the skin but it actually takes very
little<00:03:41.660> pressure<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.290> get<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.889> product<00:03:43.280> to

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
little pressure to get the product to

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.059 
little pressure to get the product to
transfer<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:44.690> you're<00:03:44.810> not<00:03:44.870> scratching<00:03:45.319> at

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
transfer and so you're not scratching at

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.339 
transfer and so you're not scratching at
or<00:03:46.519> pushing<00:03:47.090> at<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.299> skin<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.720> try<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:47.959> get<00:03:48.139> the

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
or pushing at the skin to try to get the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.559 
or pushing at the skin to try to get the
color<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.799> show<00:03:48.829> up<00:03:49.099> on<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.340> lips<00:03:49.549> I<00:03:49.819> really

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.779 
but I will put my thoughts into writing
on<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.930> website<00:04:15.319> the<00:04:16.070> eyeshadow<00:04:16.579> when<00:04:16.729> I

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
on the website the eyeshadow when I

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.479 
on the website the eyeshadow when I
first<00:04:17.030> watched<00:04:17.299> it<00:04:17.539> I<00:04:17.690> did<00:04:18.139> not<00:04:18.289> really<00:04:18.769> like

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
first watched it I did not really like

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.600 
first watched it I did not really like
the<00:04:19.729> color<00:04:20.150> or<00:04:20.389> effect<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:21.470> grade<00:04:21.950> silver

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
the color or effect that grade silver

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.110 
the color or effect that grade silver
and<00:04:23.440> while<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.620> formula<00:04:25.039> i<00:04:25.070> do<00:04:25.220> think<00:04:25.700> has

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
and while the formula i do think has

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.500 
and while the formula i do think has
room<00:04:27.020> for<00:04:27.400> improvement<00:04:28.400> it's

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
room for improvement it's

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.020 
room for improvement it's
little<00:04:29.690> dusty<00:04:30.170> and<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:31.010> strimmer<00:04:31.460> particles

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
little dusty and the strimmer particles

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.960 
little dusty and the strimmer particles
sort<00:04:32.390> of<00:04:32.450> fly<00:04:32.720> everywhere<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:33.920> while<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.370> am<00:04:34.700> NOT

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
sort of fly everywhere so while I am NOT

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.610 
sort of fly everywhere so while I am NOT
a<00:04:35.000> few<00:04:35.450> tree<00:04:35.570> out<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.780> formula<00:04:36.140> when<00:04:36.590> I

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
a few tree out of the formula when I

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.310 
a few tree out of the formula when I
took<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:36.890> picture<00:04:37.190> of<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:38.090> actual<00:04:38.330> color<00:04:38.990> I

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
took a picture of the actual color I

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.600 
took a picture of the actual color I
looked<00:04:39.710> at<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.890> picture<00:04:40.160> i<00:04:40.190> thought<00:04:40.430> wow

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
looked at the picture i thought wow

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.490 
looked at the picture i thought wow
that's<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:41.150> really<00:04:41.210> beautiful<00:04:41.750> color<00:04:42.200> even

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
though when i looked at the swatch I

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.260 
though when i looked at the swatch I
thought<00:04:44.450> oh<00:04:44.660> I'm<00:04:44.870> not<00:04:44.990> really<00:04:45.290> that<00:04:46.270> intrigued
