course<00:03:27.190> there's<00:03:27.459> some<00:03:27.639> distortion<00:03:28.299> when<00:03:28.450> you

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
course there's some distortion when you

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.960 
course there's some distortion when you
shoot<00:03:28.780> roll<00:03:29.049> very<00:03:29.829> easy<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.250> correct<00:03:30.519> imposed
