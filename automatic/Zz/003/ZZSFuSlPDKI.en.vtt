00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to all the friends of youtube today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.750
 I bring you a video that talks about the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.880
 most interesting things about the muscles 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.090
 of the human being good friends with nothing else 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.280
 to add we begin number four on 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.350
 human being has changed the great part of 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.619
 your habits as time has passed 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.420
 one of them is the exercise 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.369
 continuous walks among others what 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.760
 interesting is that it is believed that in the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.980
 last 40 years it has been reduced by 67 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.040
 cent the muscle mass in each of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.350
 the individuals this is still an enigma already 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.630
 that if it were evolution it would only happen in 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.790
 certain parts of the world and as I said 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.010
 this data that I said earlier is 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.379
 global and therefore applies for everything 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.300
 the world without a doubt an interesting and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.370
 that makes us dabble in the changes 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.309
 current and differences between the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.920
 humanity some time ago number 3 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.230
 as you already know for a muscle 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.539
 grow you have to exercise it and force it 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.910
 to the point that it suffers light 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.859
 micro injuries and subsequently this to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.019
 regenerate will do it with more volume and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.000
 therefore with greater resistance 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.050
 a fact that is still a research topic 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.300
 is the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.030
 muscle growth action after 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.040
 perform physical activity without a doubt 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.680
 there are substances that have been proven that what 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.260
 radically accelerate one of these are 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.060
 the anabolic asteroids a breakthrough 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.700
 based on the species that can 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.590
 regenerate totally complex tissues and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.510
 in some cases worms that can 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.550
 regenerating an entire system has been 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.890
 thought of converting exponentially 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.020
 that process that the animal does for 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.300
 regenerate that part of your body and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.490
 focus on muscle regeneration 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.980
 So far there has been a lot but it is expected 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.260
 that a few years this investigation not only 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.060
 serve to rebuild tissues but for 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.640
 cure and replace parts of a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.680
 individual without a doubt an impressive data 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.950
 and that gives us an idea of how far it has 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.350
 come so far science number 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.930
 two during our stay in this 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.660
 world is drawn multiple theories to 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.670
 from simple ideas one of them is 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.680
 they are enigmas like what disease is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.260
 hereditary and which is not in this 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.760
 investigated more than in any other but 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.830
 there is an investigation that was 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.680
 fundamental to continue working with 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.160
 all kinds of diseases is what says 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.470
 that the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.910
 muscle is inherited proportionally to 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.640
 the one that the father has at the age 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.100
 approximately two to five years this is 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.260
 explains the brain in the following way 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.450
 it develops largely until the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.610
 five years so obviously others 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.220
 tissues also do it in their immense 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.260
 most at that age the muscle mass does not 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.630
 he does it mostly but he does give the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.880
 amount necessary for it to be inherited 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.660
 without a doubt an impressive data 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.760
 about the number one muscles in the world 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.830
 has wanted to replace the human being of 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.380
 all its forms a great subject of cinema 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.780
 is the one that says that a human being can 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.820
 to be transformed into a half robot and 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.160
 human an advance they put into practice 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.780
 this and much has already been done is that of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.360
 try to replace muscle mass 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.580
 by hundreds of complex structures 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.500
 organized in order to resemble 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.530
 what a muscle does in its various 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.480
 functions without any doubt the data more 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.460
 impressive not only because it's a 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.670
 breakthrough but because he's already getting 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.650
 in practice good friends in this video 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.720
 I just wanted to make the most of 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.340
 impressive and interesting from my 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.080
 view as 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.060
 talk about the muscles would have a 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.860
 wide variety of impressive data 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.200
 which he did not have 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.450
 listened to you will be surprised of all 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.390
 ways everyone can draw their own 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.970
 conclusions good friends that's all 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.420
 I hope you liked it until the 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.420
 next
