showcasing our newest and coolest gaming

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.900 
showcasing our newest and coolest gaming
monitor<00:00:19.420> it's<00:00:19.869> the<00:00:20.230> largest<00:00:20.670> pc<00:00:21.670> gaming

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
monitor it's the largest pc gaming

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.819 
monitor it's the largest pc gaming
monitor<00:00:22.180> we've<00:00:22.510> made<00:00:22.750> and<00:00:23.050> also<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.680> highest

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
monitor we've made and also the highest

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.359 
monitor we've made and also the highest
resolution<00:00:24.340> so<00:00:25.270> it's<00:00:25.419> a<00:00:25.480> 27<00:00:26.140> inch<00:00:26.369> gaming

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
resolution so it's a 27 inch gaming

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.359 
resolution so it's a 27 inch gaming
monitor<00:00:27.730> that<00:00:28.540> not<00:00:28.720> only<00:00:28.869> has<00:00:29.169> wide<00:00:29.560> qHD

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
monitor that not only has wide qHD

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.479 
monitor that not only has wide qHD
resolution<00:00:30.730> so<00:00:31.599> you've<00:00:31.720> got<00:00:31.980> 1440<00:00:32.980> lines<00:00:33.220> of

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
resolution so you've got 1440 lines of

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:34.740 
resolution so you've got 1440 lines of
resolution<00:00:33.610> instead<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:34.570> traditional

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
resolution instead of the traditional

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.410 
resolution instead of the traditional
1080<00:00:35.470> you<00:00:36.190> also<00:00:36.399> it's<00:00:36.940> one<00:00:37.149> of<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.300> first

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
1080 you also it's one of the first

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.030 
1080 you also it's one of the first
monitors<00:00:37.960> with<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:38.320> new<00:00:38.470> free<00:00:38.739> sync

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
monitors with the new free sync

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.459 
monitors with the new free sync
technology<00:00:39.640> so<00:00:40.239> it<00:00:40.269> eliminates<00:00:40.539> the<00:00:40.960> tearing

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
technology so it eliminates the tearing

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.220 
technology so it eliminates the tearing
and<00:00:41.680> a<00:00:41.710> lot<00:00:41.859> of<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.039> other<00:00:42.190> elements<00:00:42.699> that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and a lot of the other elements that

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.450 
and a lot of the other elements that
have<00:00:44.230> been<00:00:44.410> going<00:00:44.710> on<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:45.010> gamers<00:00:45.309> have<00:00:45.399> been

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
have been going on that gamers have been

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.520 
have been going on that gamers have been
looking<00:00:45.879> at<00:00:45.969> trying<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.269> solve<00:00:46.600> and<00:00:46.899> we've

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
looking at trying to solve and we've

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.049 
looking at trying to solve and we've
been<00:00:47.739> able<00:00:47.859> to<00:00:47.980> do<00:00:48.160> this<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.550> still<00:00:48.789> keep<00:00:48.910> the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
been able to do this and still keep the

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.689 
been able to do this and still keep the
price<00:00:49.269> very<00:00:49.539> affordable<00:00:50.050> yeah<00:00:51.039> you<00:00:51.100> know<00:00:51.280> now

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
price very affordable yeah you know now

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.490 
price very affordable yeah you know now
that<00:00:51.730> seems<00:00:52.449> like<00:00:52.629> free<00:00:52.809> sync<00:00:53.050> had<00:00:53.170> been<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.350> hit

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
that seems like free sync had been a hit

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500 
that seems like free sync had been a hit
of<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.679> show<00:00:53.710> everyone's<00:00:54.339> focusing<00:00:54.699> on<00:00:54.820> LG<00:00:55.269> I

this AMD is a great partner and what's
been<00:01:02.649> nice<00:01:02.829> as<00:01:03.100> we've<00:01:03.249> gone<00:01:03.460> through<00:01:03.730> these

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
been nice as we've gone through these

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.640 
been nice as we've gone through these
synchronization<00:01:05.940> development<00:01:06.940> processes<00:01:07.650> we

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
synchronization development processes we

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.710 
synchronization development processes we
had<00:01:09.130> some<00:01:09.400> really<00:01:09.580> good<00:01:09.700> technology<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.600> we

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
had some really good technology that we

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.170 
had some really good technology that we
had<00:01:10.930> so<00:01:11.200> our<00:01:11.380> first<00:01:11.560> one<00:01:11.920> was<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.130> hybrid<00:01:12.370> where

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
had so our first one was a hybrid where

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.510 
had so our first one was a hybrid where
you<00:01:13.360> had<00:01:13.540> different<00:01:13.900> sync<00:01:14.140> options<00:01:15.130> with

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
you had different sync options with

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.340 
you had different sync options with
either<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:16.090> original<00:01:16.180> traditionally<00:01:17.050> we<00:01:17.170> did

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
either the original traditionally we did

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.530 
either the original traditionally we did
it<00:01:17.470> which<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.980> lot<00:01:18.010> of<00:01:18.190> gaming<00:01:18.580> pros<00:01:18.790> liked<00:01:19.090> or

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
it which a lot of gaming pros liked or

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.930 
it which a lot of gaming pros liked or
the<00:01:19.780> way<00:01:19.900> that<00:01:20.040> our<00:01:21.040> other<00:01:21.310> partner<00:01:21.640> Nvidia

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
the way that our other partner Nvidia

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.700 
the way that our other partner Nvidia
did<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:22.450> then<00:01:22.840> with<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.200> free<00:01:23.440> sync

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
did it and then with the free sync

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.620 
did it and then with the free sync
you've<00:01:23.860> got<00:01:23.980> a<00:01:24.010> lot<00:01:24.190> of<00:01:24.220> options<00:01:24.700> here<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.480> be

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
you've got a lot of options here to be

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.300 
you've got a lot of options here to be
able<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:25.930> find<00:01:26.260> tweak<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.770> games<00:01:27.010> that<00:01:27.220> you

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
want but it well we have that technology

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.130 
want but it well we have that technology
and<00:01:30.880> other<00:01:31.000> people<00:01:31.300> may<00:01:31.420> have<00:01:31.600> at<00:01:31.780> what<00:01:31.930> makes

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
and other people may have at what makes

all of the other things that we put in

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.880 
all of the other things that we put in
there<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.610> are<00:01:36.730> kind<00:01:36.940> of<00:01:36.970> below<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.450> surface

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
there that are kind of below the surface

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.930 
there that are kind of below the surface
when<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:38.980> look<00:01:39.130> at<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.280> monitor<00:01:39.610> you'll<00:01:39.760> see

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
when you look at the monitor you'll see

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.940 
when you look at the monitor you'll see
a<00:01:39.970> little<00:01:40.180> puck<00:01:40.450> that<00:01:41.200> enables<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.710> have

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
a little puck that enables you to have

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.060 
a little puck that enables you to have
multiple<00:01:42.160> settings<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.390> could<00:01:43.630> change

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
multiple settings that you could change

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.020 
multiple settings that you could change
say<00:01:45.070> you're<00:01:45.220> going<00:01:45.400> from<00:01:45.520> one<00:01:45.730> game<00:01:45.880> in

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
another starcraft a counter-strike you

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.580
