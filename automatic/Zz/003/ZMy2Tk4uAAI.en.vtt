00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.050 
at seven chem but i think they should be

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
cards if they bring the left forward

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.140 
cards if they bring the left forward
back<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:09.219> i<00:03:09.280> think<00:03:09.519> they<00:03:09.609> should<00:03:09.790> be<00:03:09.909> left

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.929 
going to be a lot lot more or they could
just<00:04:38.110> get<00:04:38.800> rid<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.159> single<00:04:39.550> formation

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:39.939 
just get rid of the single formation

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:41.999 
just get rid of the single formation
cards<00:04:40.210> make<00:04:40.509> team<00:04:41.139> formation<00:04:41.409> cards<00:04:41.830> come<00:04:41.949> out

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
cards make team formation cards come out

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.550 
cards make team formation cards come out
of<00:04:42.129> packs<00:04:42.310> all<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.699> time<00:04:42.909> and<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:44.110> would

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
of packs all the time and that would

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.080 
of packs all the time and that would
mean<00:04:44.770> there<00:04:45.639> would<00:04:45.669> be<00:04:45.789> a<00:04:45.909> lot<00:04:46.060> cheaper

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
mean there would be a lot cheaper

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.850 
mean there would be a lot cheaper
obviously<00:04:46.719> because<00:04:47.020> there's<00:04:47.409> no<00:04:47.620> single

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
obviously because there's no single

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.290 
obviously because there's no single
formation<00:04:48.340> cards<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.669> Lobby<00:04:48.819> team<00:04:49.060> formation

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
formation cards and Lobby team formation

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.179 
formation cards and Lobby team formation

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189
