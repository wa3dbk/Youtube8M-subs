00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.750 
walking poles beside their obviously
with<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.320> older<00:01:38.590> designs<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:39.040> was<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.160> velcro

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
with the older designs it was a velcro

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.610 
with the older designs it was a velcro
system<00:01:40.270> like<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.450> obviously<00:01:41.080> sometimes<00:01:41.470> it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
system like that obviously sometimes it

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.690 
system like that obviously sometimes it
was<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.770> bit<00:01:41.890> tricky<00:01:42.040> especially<00:01:42.220> if<00:01:42.550> you're

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
was a bit tricky especially if you're

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.040 
was a bit tricky especially if you're
wearing<00:01:42.850> gloves<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.300> get<00:01:43.450> your<00:01:43.570> Walker<00:01:43.750> pole

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
wearing gloves to get your Walker pole

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.410 
wearing gloves to get your Walker pole
in<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:44.680> obviously<00:01:45.190> take<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.610> out<00:01:45.790> what<00:01:46.360> we

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
in and obviously take it out what we

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.120 
in and obviously take it out what we
need<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.690> do<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.960> quite<00:01:47.560> actually<00:01:47.830> put<00:01:48.010> the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
need to do is quite actually put the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.800 
need to do is quite actually put the
walking<00:01:48.520> upon<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.880> traditional<00:01:49.390> loop<00:01:49.510> at<00:01:49.720> the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
walking upon the traditional loop at the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.780 
walking upon the traditional loop at the
bottom<00:01:50.080> there<00:01:50.260> so<00:01:50.620> the<00:01:50.920> base<00:01:51.100> stress<00:01:51.520> there

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
bottom there so the base stress there

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
bottom there so the base stress there
pop<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.510> through<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.900> actual<00:01:53.800> clip<00:01:54.100> itself

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
pop it through the actual clip itself

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.780 
pop it through the actual clip itself
clip<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.930> up<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.229> away<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:56.890> go<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:57.490> no<00:01:57.610> matter

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
clip it up and away you go so no matter

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.670 
clip it up and away you go so no matter
what<00:01:58.000> sort<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.300> size<00:01:58.540> you're<00:01:58.840> walking<00:01:59.229> pole<00:01:59.470> is

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
what sort of size you're walking pole is

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.440 
what sort of size you're walking pole is
and<00:02:00.130> it's<00:02:00.340> going<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.550> hold<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.909> in<00:02:01.000> there<00:02:01.210> noise

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
and it's going to hold it in there noise

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.690 
and it's going to hold it in there noise
safely<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.020> securely<00:02:02.320> also<00:02:02.740> it's<00:02:03.130> easier<00:02:03.580> to

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
safely and securely also it's easier to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.950 
safely and securely also it's easier to
put<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.270> obviously<00:02:04.540> it's<00:02:04.659> going<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.840> be<00:02:04.930> a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
put in and obviously it's going to be a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.480 
put in and obviously it's going to be a
hell<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.229> lot<00:02:05.320> easier<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.770> get<00:02:05.979> it<00:02:06.100> out<00:02:06.280> as

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
hell of a lot easier to get it out as

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.260 
hell of a lot easier to get it out as

this this year and basically keeping it

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.589 
this this year and basically keeping it
one<00:03:08.859> open<00:03:09.280> space<00:03:09.519> which<00:03:09.730> means<00:03:09.970> it's<00:03:10.120> easy<00:03:10.329> to

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
one open space which means it's easy to

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.839 
one open space which means it's easy to
manage<00:03:10.840> easy<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.620> maintain<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:11.980> also<00:03:12.400> means

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
manage easy to maintain and also means

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.879 
manage easy to maintain and also means
less<00:03:13.239> can<00:03:13.540> kind<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.810> go<00:03:13.989> wrong<00:03:14.230> with<00:03:14.349> stitching

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
less can kind of go wrong with stitching

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.860 
less can kind of go wrong with stitching
or<00:03:15.010> anything<00:03:15.189> like<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.459> on<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.819> inside<00:03:16.000> also

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
or anything like that on the inside also

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.119 
or anything like that on the inside also
means<00:03:17.049> keeping<00:03:17.319> everything<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.709> there<00:03:17.889> noise

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
means keeping everything in there noise

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.759 
means keeping everything in there noise
and<00:03:18.519> right<00:03:18.940> now<00:03:19.660> obviously<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.230> hydration

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
and right now obviously is hydration

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.589 
and right now obviously is hydration
compatible<00:03:20.949> so<00:03:21.669> you<00:03:21.730> do<00:03:21.910> have<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.150> hydration

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
compatible so you do have a hydration

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.050 
compatible so you do have a hydration
section<00:03:23.230> there<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:23.590> due<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.730> being<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
section there so due to it being the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.729 
section there so due to it being the
elasticated<00:03:25.540> no<00:03:25.810> matter<00:03:25.989> what<00:03:26.199> sort<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.530> size

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
elasticated no matter what sort of size

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.930 
elasticated no matter what sort of size
that<00:03:26.949> you've<00:03:27.069> got<00:03:27.220> whether<00:03:27.340> it'll<00:03:27.549> be<00:03:27.639> a<00:03:27.669> half

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
that you've got whether it'll be a half

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.030 
that you've got whether it'll be a half
liter<00:03:28.209> ELISA<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.290> up<00:03:29.409> to<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.590> three<00:03:29.889> or<00:03:29.919> even

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
liter ELISA or up to a three or even

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.580 
liter ELISA or up to a three or even
four<00:03:30.310> liter<00:03:30.819> hydration<00:03:31.150> kit<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:32.169> will<00:03:32.290> fit<00:03:32.470> in

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
four liter hydration kit it will fit in

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.280 
four liter hydration kit it will fit in
there<00:03:32.739> nice<00:03:32.919> safely<00:03:33.340> securely<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:34.629> have<00:03:34.930> the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
there nice safely securely you have the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.720 
there nice safely securely you have the
hole<00:03:35.470> on<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.769> side<00:03:35.949> there<00:03:36.220> which<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.549> can

go right before I go on to talk about
the<00:04:01.720> back<00:04:01.870> system<00:04:02.379> there<00:04:02.949> is<00:04:03.069> another<00:04:03.310> little

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
the back system there is another little

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.610 
the back system there is another little
system<00:04:04.209> basically<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.079> front<00:04:05.379> actually

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
system basically that the front actually

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.530 
system basically that the front actually
does<00:04:06.010> have<00:04:06.280> which<00:04:06.699> works<00:04:06.970> really<00:04:07.269> well

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
does have which works really well

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.689 
does have which works really well
obviously<00:04:08.199> with<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.949> being<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.190> forty<00:04:09.549> liter

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:09.699 
obviously with it being a forty liter

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.729 
obviously with it being a forty liter
that<00:04:09.909> kind<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.180> crosses<00:04:10.479> over<00:04:10.720> add<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.989> sack<00:04:11.319> to

that kind of crosses over add a sack to

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.830 
that kind of crosses over add a sack to
an<00:04:11.979> actual<00:04:12.400> rucksack<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.510> what<00:04:13.659> they've<00:04:13.810> done

with it they've given you an access

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.110 
with it they've given you an access
point<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:17.500> bottom<00:04:18.220> so<00:04:18.609> I'll<00:04:18.789> just<00:04:18.940> show

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
point to the bottom so I'll just show

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
literally open it up from the top and

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.839 
literally open it up from the top and
from<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.469> bottom<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.039> away<00:04:24.279> you<00:04:24.340> go

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
from the bottom and away you go

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.600 
from the bottom and away you go
but<00:04:25.360> what<00:04:25.479> also<00:04:25.659> you<00:04:25.840> could<00:04:26.050> do

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
but what also you could do

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.459 
but what also you could do
it<00:04:26.759> uses<00:04:26.939> a<00:04:27.090> zip<00:04:27.419> system<00:04:27.840> as<00:04:27.960> well<00:04:28.080> as<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.289> say

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:28.469 
it uses a zip system as well as to say

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:29.929 
it uses a zip system as well as to say
if<00:04:28.530> you've<00:04:28.680> got<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:29.310> know<00:04:29.430> you're<00:04:29.610> doing<00:04:29.879> a

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.529 
in the 45 plus you know the bigger sole
stole<00:04:52.949> model<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:53.400> it's<00:04:53.520> good<00:04:53.669> to<00:04:53.699> see<00:04:54.000> that<00:04:54.030> so

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
that's the fun bit for you and the

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.089 
that's the fun bit for you and the
internal<00:04:57.449> part<00:04:57.689> let's<00:04:58.229> take<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.530> look<00:04:58.770> at<00:04:58.949> the

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
internal part let's take a look at the

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.640 
internal part let's take a look at the
back<00:04:59.310> system<00:04:59.759> obviously<00:05:00.240> it's<00:05:00.719> a<00:05:00.900> traditional

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
back system obviously it's a traditional

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.040 
back system obviously it's a traditional
rucksack<00:05:02.430> or<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:03.000> style<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.509> so<00:05:03.779> obviously

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
rucksack or the style is so obviously

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.230 
rucksack or the style is so obviously
you<00:05:04.229> always<00:05:04.379> have<00:05:04.620> talked<00:05:05.039> about<00:05:05.310> storage<00:05:05.969> as

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
you always have talked about storage as

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.119 
you always have talked about storage as
well<00:05:06.569> so<00:05:06.840> any<00:05:07.319> bits<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.889> need<00:05:08.039> to

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
well so any bits that you need to

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:09.769 
well so any bits that you need to
quickly<00:05:08.370> grab<00:05:08.699> or<00:05:08.849> anything<00:05:09.029> like<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.300> you

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
quickly grab or anything like that you

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.269 
quickly grab or anything like that you
can<00:05:09.810> quite<00:05:10.050> just<00:05:10.229> grab<00:05:10.469> it<00:05:10.500> pull<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:10.919> out<00:05:11.039> and

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:11.279 
can quite just grab it pull it out and

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.790 
can quite just grab it pull it out and
away<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.090> go<00:05:12.449> so<00:05:12.870> over<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:13.199> will<00:05:13.319> be<00:05:13.439> any<00:05:13.590> GPS

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
away you go so over that will be any GPS

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.249 
away you go so over that will be any GPS
system<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.520> factories<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.240> pack<00:05:15.750> right<00:05:15.960> jacket

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
system and factories a pack right jacket

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.080 
system and factories a pack right jacket
just<00:05:16.469> in<00:05:16.650> case<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.979> heavens<00:05:17.250> open<00:05:17.580> that's<00:05:17.939> a

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
just in case the heavens open that's a

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.300 
just in case the heavens open that's a
really<00:05:18.419> nice<00:05:18.599> and<00:05:18.900> traditional<00:05:19.409> storage<00:05:19.770> area

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
really nice and traditional storage area

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.409 
really nice and traditional storage area
obviously<00:05:21.300> it<00:05:21.930> is<00:05:22.139> a<00:05:22.169> flow<00:05:22.590> system<00:05:23.159> so<00:05:23.729> you

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
obviously it is a flow system so you

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.659 
obviously it is a flow system so you
will<00:05:24.569> see<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.900> actual<00:05:25.050> Ark<00:05:25.590> itself<00:05:26.189> or<00:05:26.550> that

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
will see the actual Ark itself or that

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.209 
will see the actual Ark itself or that
your<00:05:26.909> back<00:05:27.090> plate<00:05:27.419> actually<00:05:28.349> arcs<00:05:29.039> now

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:29.219 
your back plate actually arcs now

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:30.950 
your back plate actually arcs now
obviously<00:05:29.550> in<00:05:29.639> previous<00:05:30.060> years<00:05:30.270> it's<00:05:30.750> gone

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
obviously in previous years it's gone

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.600 
obviously in previous years it's gone
from<00:05:31.139> being<00:05:31.409> dead<00:05:31.680> straight<00:05:32.039> to<00:05:32.250> actually

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
from being dead straight to actually

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.300 
from being dead straight to actually
being<00:05:32.909> really<00:05:33.539> arced<00:05:34.080> um<00:05:34.229> this<00:05:34.889> year<00:05:35.129> though

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
being really arced um this year though

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.769 
being really arced um this year though
it's<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.639> really<00:05:35.969> good<00:05:36.150> structure<00:05:36.539> there's

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
it's a really good structure there's

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.360 
it's a really good structure there's
actually<00:05:37.080> good<00:05:37.259> really<00:05:37.529> good<00:05:37.680> space<00:05:37.949> between

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
actually good really good space between

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.159 
actually good really good space between
the<00:05:38.550> two<00:05:38.759> and<00:05:39.000> it's<00:05:39.389> not<00:05:39.539> affecting<00:05:40.139> the

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
the two and it's not affecting the

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.619 
the two and it's not affecting the
storage<00:05:40.919> as<00:05:41.129> well<00:05:41.159> and<00:05:41.729> that's<00:05:42.089> what<00:05:42.360> improve

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:42.629 
storage as well and that's what improve

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.450 
storage as well and that's what improve
use<00:05:42.779> some<00:05:42.960> of<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.139> years<00:05:43.319> and<00:05:43.560> you<00:05:44.339> know

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
use some of the years and you know

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.219 
use some of the years and you know
there's<00:05:44.699> been<00:05:44.729> a<00:05:44.849> bit<00:05:45.089> of<00:05:45.180> a<00:05:45.240> bow<00:05:45.449> where<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.080> M

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
there's been a bit of a bow where the M

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.680 
there's been a bit of a bow where the M
with<00:05:46.589> the<00:05:47.129> back<00:05:47.580> plate<00:05:47.759> bends<00:05:48.089> in<00:05:48.330> too<00:05:48.509> much

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
with the back plate bends in too much

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.050 
with the back plate bends in too much
and<00:05:48.900> you<00:05:48.990> couldn't<00:05:49.349> score<00:05:49.620> too<00:05:49.860> much<00:05:50.069> but<00:05:50.310> this

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
and you couldn't score too much but this

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.670 
and you couldn't score too much but this
seasons<00:05:51.599> one<00:05:51.779> there's<00:05:52.050> no<00:05:52.229> issues<00:05:52.500> with<00:05:52.620> that
