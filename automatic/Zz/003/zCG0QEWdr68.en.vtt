there now I'm just going to try and get
my<00:03:13.140> health<00:03:13.380> my<00:03:13.670> energy<00:03:14.670> up<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.820> little<00:03:15.030> bit<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.240> I

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
my health my energy up a little bit so I

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.010 
my health my energy up a little bit so I
can<00:03:15.300> show<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.720> stay<00:03:16.260> down<00:03:16.560> his<00:03:16.830> second<00:03:17.190> move

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
can show you stay down his second move

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.120 
can show you stay down his second move
and<00:03:19.020> here<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.160> here<00:03:21.260> might<00:03:22.260> kill<00:03:22.830> them<00:03:22.980> but

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
and here it is here might kill them but

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.900 
and here it is here might kill them but
I<00:03:23.190> guess<00:03:23.490> stay<00:03:23.880> down<00:03:24.060> slide<00:03:25.490> one<00:03:26.490> direction

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
I guess stay down slide one direction

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.990 
I guess stay down slide one direction
and<00:03:27.060> slide<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.510> another<00:03:27.750> direction<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.940> i

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
and slide in another direction and i

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.840 
and slide in another direction and i
think<00:03:30.270> that's<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.540> i'm<00:03:31.260> not<00:03:31.320> sure<00:03:32.190> actually<00:03:32.430> no

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
think that's it i'm not sure actually no

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.650 
think that's it i'm not sure actually no
that<00:03:33.209> isn't<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:36.030> we're<00:03:36.360> just<00:03:36.390> going<00:03:36.570> to
