00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
not a lot of action to go with these

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.740 
not a lot of action to go with these
gimmicks<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.640> back<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.060> fold<00:01:42.299> under<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
gimmicks but the back can fold under and

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
gimmicks but the back can fold under and
you'll<00:01:42.869> use<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> transformation

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you'll use that for the transformation

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
you'll use that for the transformation
but<00:01:45.210> where<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:45.930> pays<00:01:46.140> off<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
but where this really pays off is that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.039 
but where this really pays off is that
you<00:01:47.100> attach<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> double<00:01:48.390> O<00:01:48.479> Gundam<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you attach it to the double O Gundam to

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.469 
you attach it to the double O Gundam to
make<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.649> whole<00:01:50.399> riser<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> very

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
make the whole riser this is a very

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.910 
make the whole riser this is a very
simple<00:01:54.780> kit<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> crack<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> Box

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
simple kit so when you crack the Box

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.010 
simple kit so when you crack the Box
open<00:01:56.310> you're<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> find<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.719> they<00:01:57.869> give

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
open you're going to find that they give

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350 
open you're going to find that they give
you<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> few<00:01:58.799> gray<00:01:59.040> stickers<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.060> add

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you a few gray stickers that you can add

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.300 
you a few gray stickers that you can add
on<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.890> very<00:02:01.890> thin<00:02:01.979> instruction<00:02:02.939> manual<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:04.310> as

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
on a very thin instruction manual and as

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.449 
on a very thin instruction manual and as
far<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:05.610> plates<00:02:06.090> go<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.439> plate<00:02:07.799> has<00:02:08.069> white

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
far as plates go the a plate has white

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.420 
far as plates go the a plate has white
blue<00:02:08.759> grey<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.810> nice<00:02:09.989> touch<00:02:10.259> clear<00:02:10.920> orange

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
blue grey and a nice touch clear orange

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.880 
blue grey and a nice touch clear orange
so

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
so

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.800 
so
the<00:02:12.040> cockpit<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.850> actually<00:02:13.420> transparent

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the cockpit is actually transparent

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.780 
the cockpit is actually transparent
orange<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.650> don't<00:02:14.830> have<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.040> get<00:02:15.190> clear

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
orange you don't have to get clear

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.100 
orange you don't have to get clear
paints<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.209> do<00:02:16.420> with<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.630> lot<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.990> other

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
paints I do with a lot of the other

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.440 
paints I do with a lot of the other
double-o<00:02:17.530> kits<00:02:17.770> you're<00:02:18.550> also<00:02:18.700> gonna<00:02:18.970> get<00:02:19.209> a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
double-o kits you're also gonna get a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.860 
double-o kits you're also gonna get a
set<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.350> poly<00:02:20.590> caps<00:02:20.890> two<00:02:21.580> white<00:02:21.819> sprues<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
set of poly caps two white sprues and a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.110 
set of poly caps two white sprues and a
blue<00:02:23.080> spruce<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:23.740> only<00:02:23.890> four<00:02:24.160> plates<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:24.970> this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
blue spruce so only four plates so this

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.540 
blue spruce so only four plates so this
should<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.330> pretty<00:02:25.450> simple<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.050> build<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
should be pretty simple to build the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.250 
should be pretty simple to build the
manual<00:02:27.940> itself<00:02:28.240> has<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.450> pretty<00:02:28.750> nice<00:02:28.900> cover

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
manual itself has a pretty nice cover

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.070 
manual itself has a pretty nice cover
shot<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.010> O<00:02:30.040> riser<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:31.570> actually<00:02:31.990> of

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
shot of the O riser and it's actually of

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.230 
shot of the O riser and it's actually of
the<00:02:32.170> fold<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.680> variety<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.820> first<00:02:34.060> thing

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
the fold of variety and the first thing

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.880 
the fold of variety and the first thing
that<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.390> noticed<00:02:34.720> about<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.560> all<00:02:35.830> of

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
that I noticed about this is that all of

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.990 
that I noticed about this is that all of
the<00:02:36.250> parts<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:36.820> are<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.900> lot<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.260> line<00:02:38.650> art

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the parts of this are a lot of line art

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.120 
the parts of this are a lot of line art
poses<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.390> story<00:02:41.260> information<00:02:41.860> which

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
poses and story information which

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.559 
poses and story information which
basically<00:02:42.550> means<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:42.970> this<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.300> very

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
basically means that this is a very

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.770 
basically means that this is a very
simple<00:02:44.050> kit<00:02:44.550> when<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.640> look<00:02:45.790> at<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:45.970> back<00:02:46.150> you

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
simple kit when you look at the back you

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.470 
simple kit when you look at the back you
can<00:02:46.959> see<00:02:47.290> some<00:02:47.590> directions<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.459> parts<00:02:48.970> list<00:02:49.030> and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
can see some directions a parts list and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.720 
can see some directions a parts list and
how<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.110> put<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.440> together<00:02:50.640> everything<00:02:51.640> is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
how to put it together everything is

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.610 
how to put it together everything is
very<00:02:51.910> easy<00:02:52.060> bandai<00:02:53.019> keeps<00:02:53.260> getting<00:02:53.500> better

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
very easy bandai keeps getting better

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.470 
very easy bandai keeps getting better
and<00:02:53.739> better<00:02:53.860> with<00:02:54.459> their<00:02:54.670> manuals<00:02:55.090> you'll

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
and better with their manuals you'll

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.729 
and better with their manuals you'll
have<00:02:55.630> no<00:02:55.810> problem<00:02:56.170> putting<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.560> together

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
have no problem putting this together

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.920 
have no problem putting this together
when<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.820> put<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.090> all<00:02:58.150> together<00:02:58.300> usually<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
when you put it all together usually I

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.060 
when you put it all together usually I
like<00:02:59.140> to<00:02:59.260> look<00:02:59.380> at<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> parts<00:02:59.830> individually

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
like to look at the parts individually

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.550 
like to look at the parts individually
but<00:03:00.640> really<00:03:01.030> there's<00:03:01.330> only<00:03:01.510> three<00:03:01.810> parts<00:03:02.140> you

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
but really there's only three parts you

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.370 
but really there's only three parts you
get<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.830> main<00:03:03.030> fuselage<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.360> then<00:03:04.660> two<00:03:05.019> wings

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
get the main fuselage and then two wings

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.479 
get the main fuselage and then two wings
that<00:03:06.310> slap<00:03:06.610> onto<00:03:07.030> either<00:03:07.180> side<00:03:08.070> as<00:03:09.070> for<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
that slap onto either side as for the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.340 
that slap onto either side as for the
wings<00:03:09.670> themselves<00:03:10.269> where<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.690> get<00:03:10.870> mobility

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
wings themselves where you get mobility

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.830 
wings themselves where you get mobility
is<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.920> moves<00:03:12.220> at<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.400> end<00:03:12.610> these<00:03:13.570> two

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
is this moves at the end these two

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.509 
is this moves at the end these two
pieces<00:03:14.050> on<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.440> side<00:03:14.650> can<00:03:14.890> bend<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.310> about

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
pieces on the side can bend and about

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.090 
pieces on the side can bend and about
that<00:03:15.730> much<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.299> these<00:03:16.720> blue<00:03:17.049> pieces<00:03:17.320> can<00:03:17.860> also

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
that much and these blue pieces can also

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.990 
that much and these blue pieces can also
bend<00:03:18.610> out<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.810> about<00:03:20.079> there<00:03:20.790> nothing<00:03:21.790> moves

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
bend out to about there nothing moves

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.360 
bend out to about there nothing moves
down<00:03:22.239> here<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.690> added<00:03:23.350> some<00:03:23.590> gray<00:03:23.769> lining<00:03:24.100> as

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
down here I added some gray lining as

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.550 
down here I added some gray lining as
you<00:03:24.730> might<00:03:24.970> be<00:03:25.090> able<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.299> see<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.170> back

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
you might be able to see in the back

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.100 
you might be able to see in the back
this<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.970> attach<00:03:28.299> itself<00:03:28.660> onto<00:03:28.959> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
this is to attach itself onto the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.440 
this is to attach itself onto the
fuselage<00:03:30.040> but<00:03:30.549> if<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.760> want<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.000> put<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.209> on<00:03:31.269> to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
fuselage but if you want to put it on to

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.180 
fuselage but if you want to put it on to
the<00:03:31.480> O<00:03:31.570> riser<00:03:31.930> then<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:32.440> actually<00:03:32.590> bend<00:03:33.040> it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
the O riser then you actually bend it

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.850 
the O riser then you actually bend it
down<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.640> use<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.840> put<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.110> over<00:03:35.380> just

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
down and use this to put it over just

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.789 
down and use this to put it over just
beside<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.310> GN<00:03:36.610> drive<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.380> main<00:03:38.560> body

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
beside the GN drive for the main body

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.060 
beside the GN drive for the main body
itself<00:03:39.220> what<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.970> have<00:03:40.209> is<00:03:40.690> effectively<00:03:41.290> just

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
itself what you have is effectively just

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.310 
itself what you have is effectively just
the<00:03:42.400> middle<00:03:42.640> section<00:03:42.820> of<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.090> jet<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.480> really

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
the middle section of a jet and really

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.990 
the middle section of a jet and really
there's<00:03:44.500> hardly<00:03:44.739> any<00:03:45.070> mobility<00:03:45.400> nothing

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
there's hardly any mobility nothing

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.990 
there's hardly any mobility nothing
moves<00:03:46.209> here<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:47.320> in<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.530> back<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:48.310> slides

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
moves here but in the back this slides

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.600 
moves here but in the back this slides
out<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.510> then<00:03:49.900> bends<00:03:50.200> down<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.340> also

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
out and then bends down and this also

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.000 
out and then bends down and this also
bends<00:03:52.060> down<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.570> basically<00:03:53.320> this<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.769> going

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
bends down and basically this is going

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.740 
bends down and basically this is going
to<00:03:54.130> strap<00:03:54.519> on<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.060> back<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.420> double-o

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
to strap on to the back of double-o

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.069 
to strap on to the back of double-o
Gundams<00:03:56.110> back<00:03:56.440> just<00:03:57.070> like<00:03:57.250> this<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:59.019> only

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
Gundams back just like this the only

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.840 
Gundams back just like this the only
other<00:03:59.350> point<00:03:59.620> of<00:03:59.829> mobility<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:00.640> this

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
other point of mobility is that this

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.479 
other point of mobility is that this
blue<00:04:01.209> part<00:04:01.480> here<00:04:01.540> can<00:04:02.110> move<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:03.220> put<00:04:03.370> this

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
blue part here can move to put this

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.330 
blue part here can move to put this
together<00:04:03.700> it's<00:04:04.060> very<00:04:04.200> very<00:04:05.200> simple<00:04:05.769> just<00:04:06.130> make

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
together it's very very simple just make

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.860 
together it's very very simple just make
sure<00:04:06.489> that<00:04:06.640> you've<00:04:06.820> got<00:04:06.850> this<00:04:07.209> lined<00:04:07.540> up<00:04:07.750> in

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
sure that you've got this lined up in

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.440 
sure that you've got this lined up in
the<00:04:07.989> same<00:04:08.200> way<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.670> click<00:04:09.670> both<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.269> wings

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
the same way and click both of the wings

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.259 
the same way and click both of the wings
onto<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.500> body<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:13.060> have<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.810> low<00:04:14.140> riser

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
onto the body and you have the low riser

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.410 
onto the body and you have the low riser
here's<00:04:16.269> your<00:04:16.510> flight<00:04:16.720> ESTs

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.700 

and<00:04:20.420> the<00:04:21.200> side<00:04:22.540> and<00:04:24.400> an<00:04:25.400> under<00:04:25.760> shot<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.710> why

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
and the side and an under shot and why

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.610 
and the side and an under shot and why
don't<00:04:27.770> we<00:04:27.950> just<00:04:28.010> barrel<00:04:28.580> roll<00:04:28.790> out<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:28.970> here

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
don't we just barrel roll out of here

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.720 
don't we just barrel roll out of here
already<00:04:30.620> some<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.100> things<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.490> like

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
already some of the things that I like

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.340 
already some of the things that I like
about<00:04:31.910> this<00:04:32.180> is<00:04:32.419> I<00:04:32.450> think<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.870> actually<00:04:32.990> looks

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
about this is I think it actually looks

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.200 
about this is I think it actually looks
pretty<00:04:33.410> sharp<00:04:33.620> it's<00:04:34.580> pleasing<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.180> eye

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
pretty sharp it's pleasing to the eye

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.900 
pretty sharp it's pleasing to the eye
you<00:04:35.840> can<00:04:36.020> move<00:04:36.200> these<00:04:36.410> in<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:36.980> out<00:04:37.100> sort<00:04:37.820> of

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
you can move these in and out sort of

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.060 
you can move these in and out sort of
type<00:04:38.090> fighter<00:04:38.330> ish<00:04:38.600> make<00:04:38.900> it<00:04:39.020> look<00:04:39.200> as<00:04:39.410> cool<00:04:39.680> as

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
type fighter ish make it look as cool as

you want but for me what really stands
out<00:04:42.800> is<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.030> orange<00:04:44.030> cockpit<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.750> fact<00:04:44.960> that

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
out is the orange cockpit the fact that

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.750 
out is the orange cockpit the fact that
they<00:04:45.169> made<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:45.470> in<00:04:45.620> clear<00:04:45.800> parts<00:04:46.130> consistent

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
they made that in clear parts consistent

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.950 
they made that in clear parts consistent
and<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:46.940> don't<00:04:47.090> have<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.330> paint<00:04:47.480> it<00:04:47.600> yourself

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
and you don't have to paint it yourself

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.680 
and you don't have to paint it yourself
is<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.530> real<00:04:48.830> plus<00:04:49.040> for<00:04:49.250> me<00:04:49.280> also<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:50.240> can't

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
is a real plus for me also I can't

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.780 
is a real plus for me also I can't
stress<00:04:50.960> enough<00:04:51.080> buy<00:04:51.680> yourself<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.400> set<00:04:52.669> of

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
stress enough buy yourself a set of

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.880 
stress enough buy yourself a set of
getting<00:04:53.540> them<00:04:53.720> lining<00:04:53.930> markers<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.680> gray

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
getting them lining markers the gray

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.800 
getting them lining markers the gray
goes<00:04:55.130> really<00:04:55.340> well<00:04:55.460> with<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.330> white<00:04:56.510> here

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
goes really well with the white here

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.690 
goes really well with the white here
pretty<00:04:57.380> sure<00:04:57.620> let's<00:04:57.980> see<00:04:58.040> it<00:04:58.190> on<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.400> action

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
pretty sure let's see it on the action

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.880 
pretty sure let's see it on the action
base<00:04:58.880> on<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.990> bottom<00:05:00.260> of<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.410> OH<00:05:00.440> riser<00:05:00.740> you

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
base on the bottom of the OH riser you

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.860 
base on the bottom of the OH riser you
can<00:05:01.190> see<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.430> small<00:05:01.730> hole<00:05:02.090> there<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.540> what<00:05:02.780> it

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
can see a small hole there and what it

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.390 
can see a small hole there and what it
does<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.200> it<00:05:03.320> comes<00:05:03.470> with<00:05:03.620> a<00:05:03.650> white<00:05:03.860> panel<00:05:04.160> that

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
does is it comes with a white panel that

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.580 
does is it comes with a white panel that
you<00:05:04.490> can<00:05:04.669> hide<00:05:04.970> that<00:05:05.180> with<00:05:05.419> but<00:05:06.169> in<00:05:06.260> this<00:05:06.380> case

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
you can hide that with but in this case

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.690 
you can hide that with but in this case
we're<00:05:06.860> going<00:05:07.010> to<00:05:07.130> use<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.460> special

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
we're going to use this special

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.630 
we're going to use this special
attachment<00:05:08.390> plug<00:05:09.080> this<00:05:09.260> in<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:09.770> then<00:05:10.100> put<00:05:10.490> it

attachment plug this in and then put it

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.390 
attachment plug this in and then put it
on<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:12.140> one<00:05:12.470> one-hundredth<00:05:13.130> action<00:05:13.850> base

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
on to the one one-hundredth action base

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.450 
on to the one one-hundredth action base
this<00:05:16.400> is<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.180> kind<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.810> effect<00:05:18.200> that<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:19.370> are

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
this is the kind of effect that you are

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.010 
this is the kind of effect that you are
going<00:05:19.639> to<00:05:19.729> get<00:05:22.840> looks<00:05:23.840> pretty<00:05:24.050> sharp<00:05:24.110> I'd<00:05:24.500> say

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
going to get looks pretty sharp I'd say

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:37.280 
going to get looks pretty sharp I'd say
and<00:05:27.020> undershorts

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.260 

one<00:05:37.890> last<00:05:38.100> thing<00:05:38.370> is<00:05:38.580> that<00:05:38.610> if<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:39.060> take<00:05:39.210> a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
one last thing is that if you take a

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.120 
one last thing is that if you take a
look<00:05:39.450> at<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.660> site<00:05:39.870> here<00:05:40.200> I<00:05:40.350> never<00:05:40.710> was<00:05:40.890> a<00:05:40.920> big

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
look at the site here I never was a big

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.890 
look at the site here I never was a big
fan<00:05:41.430> of<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.700> GN<00:05:42.000> shield<00:05:42.330> for<00:05:42.540> the<00:05:42.630> double-o

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
fan of the GN shield for the double-o

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.330 
fan of the GN shield for the double-o
Gundam<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.290> don't<00:05:43.620> put<00:05:43.770> it<00:05:43.860> on<00:05:43.950> very<00:05:44.100> often

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
Gundam and don't put it on very often

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.360 
Gundam and don't put it on very often
but<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.270> can<00:05:45.450> plug<00:05:45.690> this<00:05:45.960> into<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.710> side<00:05:47.040> and

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
but you can plug this into the side and

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.880 
but you can plug this into the side and
then<00:05:48.180> it'll<00:05:48.330> be<00:05:48.390> out<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.600> your<00:05:48.750> way<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.290> it

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
then it'll be out of your way and it

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.670 
then it'll be out of your way and it
makes<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:51.270> o<00:05:51.300> riser<00:05:51.660> look<00:05:52.050> a<00:05:52.200> little<00:05:52.440> more

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
makes the o riser look a little more

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.140 
makes the o riser look a little more
weaponized<00:05:53.250> than<00:05:54.030> what<00:05:54.330> otherwise<00:05:54.570> I<00:05:56.150> guess

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
weaponized than what otherwise I guess

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.390 
weaponized than what otherwise I guess
the<00:05:57.330> question<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:57.780> is<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:58.770> o<00:05:58.800> riser<00:05:59.130> worth

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
the question is is the o riser worth

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.250 
the question is is the o riser worth
buying<00:05:59.640> on<00:05:59.820> its<00:05:59.970> own<00:06:00.090> and<00:06:00.330> if<00:06:00.720> you're<00:06:00.900> a<00:06:00.930> fan<00:06:01.230> of

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
buying on its own and if you're a fan of

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.250 
buying on its own and if you're a fan of
jets<00:06:01.950> or<00:06:02.340> other<00:06:03.270> kind<00:06:03.630> of<00:06:03.720> military<00:06:04.020> vehicles

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
jets or other kind of military vehicles

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.990 
jets or other kind of military vehicles
yeah<00:06:04.740> it's<00:06:04.890> pretty<00:06:05.040> cool<00:06:05.310> it<00:06:05.670> doesn't<00:06:05.910> really

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
yeah it's pretty cool it doesn't really

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.660 
yeah it's pretty cool it doesn't really
fit<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.630> Gundam<00:06:07.020> theme<00:06:07.490> outside<00:06:08.490> of<00:06:08.610> the

fit the Gundam theme outside of the
Super<00:06:09.000> Gundam<00:06:09.270> but<00:06:09.810> the<00:06:10.410> real<00:06:10.620> reason<00:06:10.830> that

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
Super Gundam but the real reason that

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.380 
Super Gundam but the real reason that
most<00:06:11.460> people<00:06:11.610> I<00:06:11.850> think<00:06:11.880> are<00:06:12.090> gonna<00:06:12.210> buy<00:06:12.360> that

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
most people I think are gonna buy that

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.120 
most people I think are gonna buy that
is<00:06:12.750> to<00:06:12.900> combine<00:06:13.050> it<00:06:13.350> with<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:13.800> double<00:06:14.070> O

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
is to combine it with the double O

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.460 
is to combine it with the double O
Gundam<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.610> make<00:06:14.760> the<00:06:14.910> double<00:06:15.120> o<00:06:15.180> riser<00:06:15.420> so<00:06:16.230> why
