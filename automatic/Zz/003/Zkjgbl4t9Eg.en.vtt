00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
protectant already and I've got my

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170

one-inch<00:00:36.630> curling<00:00:37.080> iron<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:38.030> I'm<00:00:39.030> doing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
one-inch curling iron that I'm doing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.730 
one-inch curling iron that I'm doing
this<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.630> I've<00:00:39.870> done<00:00:39.990> this<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.380> past

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
this with I've done this in the past

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.310 
this with I've done this in the past
with<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.730> smaller<00:00:42.300> curling<00:00:42.720> iron<00:00:42.900> i<00:00:43.050> think<00:00:43.260> i

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
with a smaller curling iron i think i

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.340 
with a smaller curling iron i think i
have<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> half-inch<00:00:44.720> as<00:00:45.720> well<00:00:45.990> and<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.320> think

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
have a half-inch as well and I think

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.410 
have a half-inch as well and I think
that<00:00:46.620> actually<00:00:47.040> works<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:47.610> nicer<00:00:48.000> but<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that actually works out nicer but I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.030 
that actually works out nicer but I
didn't<00:00:48.660> have<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.990> one<00:00:49.170> handy<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> just

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
didn't have that one handy so I just

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.180 
didn't have that one handy so I just
used<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.610> inch<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:52.530> pull<00:00:53.160> out

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
used my one inch but I will pull out

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
used my one inch but I will pull out
small<00:00:53.610> sections<00:00:54.030> off<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.330> top<00:00:54.540> of<00:00:54.720> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
small sections off the top of the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.760 
small sections off the top of the
ponytail<00:00:55.080> and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:56.340> once<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.240> have<00:00:57.450> curled<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
ponytail and then once I have curled the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.460 
ponytail and then once I have curled the
sections<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.520> am<00:00:59.910> missing<00:01:00.720> them<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.110> my<00:01:01.290> hair

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.970 
again there's not an exact science to
this<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.970> are<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:46.330> wanting<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.050> cover<00:02:47.740> up

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
this you are just wanting to cover up

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.480 
this you are just wanting to cover up
that<00:02:48.790> elastic<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:50.590> hold<00:02:50.830> your<00:02:50.950> ponytail<00:02:51.340> in

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
that elastic that hold your ponytail in

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.620 
that elastic that hold your ponytail in
so<00:02:51.870> if<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.350> need<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.790> section<00:02:54.790> these<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.210> into

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
so if you need to section these out into

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.930 
so if you need to section these out into
a<00:02:55.660> few<00:02:55.960> separate<00:02:56.350> curls<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.250> got<00:02:57.430> sections

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
a few separate curls if you got sections

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.850 
a few separate curls if you got sections
that<00:02:58.120> are<00:02:58.180> maybe<00:02:58.840> thicker<00:02:59.200> than<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.620> want

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
that are maybe thicker than you want

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.950 
that are maybe thicker than you want
these<00:03:00.820> are<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.120> supposed<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.660> kind<00:03:01.900> of

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
these are just supposed to kind of

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.430 
these are just supposed to kind of
cascade<00:03:02.500> down<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.220> little<00:03:03.460> bit<00:03:03.610> on<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> sides

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
cascade down a little bit on the sides

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.270 
cascade down a little bit on the sides
almost<00:03:05.440> kind<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.650> like<00:03:05.710> a<00:03:05.800> ribbon<00:03:06.160> or

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
almost kind of like a ribbon or

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.550 
almost kind of like a ribbon or
something<00:03:06.460> of<00:03:06.760> hair<00:03:07.000> once<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.960> get<00:03:08.170> these

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
something of hair once you get these

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.370 
something of hair once you get these
girls<00:03:08.830> piled<00:03:09.250> up<00:03:09.430> on<00:03:09.520> top<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.000> ponytail

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
girls piled up on top of the ponytail

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310 
girls piled up on top of the ponytail
and<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.490> said<00:03:12.550> before<00:03:12.760> if<00:03:13.210> you're<00:03:13.960> using<00:03:14.140> a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
and like I said before if you're using a

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.250 
and like I said before if you're using a
smaller<00:03:14.560> curling<00:03:14.980> iron<00:03:16.080> you're<00:03:17.080> going<00:03:17.200> to

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
smaller curling iron you're going to

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.200 
smaller curling iron you're going to
have<00:03:17.320> a<00:03:17.410> nice<00:03:17.620> curlier<00:03:18.040> look<00:03:18.310> up<00:03:18.490> top<00:03:18.730> whereas

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
have a nice curlier look up top whereas

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.920 
have a nice curlier look up top whereas
I've<00:03:19.420> used<00:03:19.630> a<00:03:20.730> bigger<00:03:21.730> one<00:03:21.910> so<00:03:21.940> it's<00:03:22.390> not<00:03:22.600> as

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
I've used a bigger one so it's not as

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.220 
I've used a bigger one so it's not as
tightly<00:03:23.470> curled<00:03:24.360> this<00:03:25.360> hairstyle<00:03:25.630> is<00:03:25.960> one<00:03:26.110> we

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
tightly curled this hairstyle is one we

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.500 
tightly curled this hairstyle is one we
did<00:03:26.410> years<00:03:27.010> ago<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.640> as<00:03:28.000> from<00:03:28.240> our<00:03:28.360> archives

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
did years ago and as from our archives

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.900 
did years ago and as from our archives
but<00:03:28.990> I<00:03:29.050> didn't<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.709> video<00:03:30.010> tutorial<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.760> it

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
but I didn't have a video tutorial of it

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.100 
but I didn't have a video tutorial of it
so<00:03:31.120> we<00:03:31.240> thought<00:03:31.270> we'd<00:03:31.510> make<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.840> for<00:03:32.050> you

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
so we thought we'd make that for you

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.130 
so we thought we'd make that for you
today<00:03:32.880> anyway<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.150> just<00:03:34.420> basically

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
today anyway so you just basically

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.220 
today anyway so you just basically
arrange<00:03:35.740> these<00:03:35.920> how<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.160> think<00:03:36.490> they<00:03:36.640> look

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
arrange these how you think they look

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.390 
arrange these how you think they look
will<00:03:38.230> look<00:03:38.260> good<00:03:38.620> if<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:41.010> realize<00:03:42.010> that

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
will look good if you realize that

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.160 
will look good if you realize that
they're<00:03:42.970> too<00:03:43.150> thick<00:03:43.360> like<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:43.810> curl<00:03:44.080> I

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
they're too thick like in this curl I

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.790 
they're too thick like in this curl I
divided<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:44.920> in<00:03:45.160> half<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.410> then<00:03:47.410> I'm<00:03:47.560> pinning

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
divided it in half and then I'm pinning

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.590 
divided it in half and then I'm pinning
it<00:03:48.010> around<00:03:48.250> I've<00:03:48.520> got<00:03:48.670> hair<00:03:48.850> pins<00:03:49.090> as<00:03:49.270> well<00:03:49.450> as

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
it around I've got hair pins as well as

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.410 
it around I've got hair pins as well as
the<00:03:49.750> small<00:03:50.020> smaller<00:03:50.709> bobby<00:03:50.980> pins<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.550> help

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
the small smaller bobby pins to help

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.680 
the small smaller bobby pins to help
hold<00:03:52.660> these<00:03:52.920> hold<00:03:53.920> these<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:55.180> obviously

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
hold these hold these in this obviously

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.010 
hold these hold these in this obviously
probably<00:03:56.350> isn't<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.650> school<00:03:57.180> style<00:03:58.180> unless<00:03:58.630> you

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
probably isn't a school style unless you

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.190 
probably isn't a school style unless you
really<00:03:59.230> fasten<00:03:59.739> those<00:03:59.890> in<00:04:00.300> tightly<00:04:01.300> with

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
really fasten those in tightly with

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.080 
really fasten those in tightly with
bobby<00:04:02.440> pins<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.070> then<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.190> realized<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.910> wasn't

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
bobby pins and then I realized it wasn't

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.490 
bobby pins and then I realized it wasn't
going<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:06.520> be<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.209> symmetric<00:04:07.720> as<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.930> wanted<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:08.470> I

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
going to be a symmetric as I wanted so I

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.170 
going to be a symmetric as I wanted so I
section<00:04:09.010> down<00:04:09.160> another<00:04:09.370> piece<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.790> hair<00:04:09.970> here

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
section down another piece of hair here

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.390 
section down another piece of hair here
and<00:04:10.510> I'm<00:04:10.690> curling<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:11.890> basically<00:04:12.280> you're

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
and I'm curling it so basically you're

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.370 
and I'm curling it so basically you're
just<00:04:12.430> going<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.820> want<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.060> get<00:04:14.050> it<00:04:14.140> till<00:04:14.290> it

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
just going to want to get it till it

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.580 
just going to want to get it till it
looks<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.770> way<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:14.920> think<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.760> will<00:04:16.590> look

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
looks the way you think it will look

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.950 
looks the way you think it will look
pretty<00:04:17.770> and<00:04:18.359> pin<00:04:19.359> those<00:04:19.540> curls<00:04:19.870> around

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.260 

and<00:04:25.410> then<00:04:25.710> if<00:04:25.830> those<00:04:25.979> tales<00:04:26.310> aren't<00:04:26.850> laying

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
and then if those tales aren't laying

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.719 
and then if those tales aren't laying
how<00:04:27.509> you<00:04:27.569> want<00:04:27.870> or<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.860> curls<00:04:29.100> aren't<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:29.490> top

how you want or the curls aren't on top

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.559 
how you want or the curls aren't on top
just<00:04:30.090> pin<00:04:30.330> them<00:04:30.419> around<00:04:30.630> as<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:31.020> wish<00:04:32.569> touch

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
just pin them around as you wish touch

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.210 
just pin them around as you wish touch
up<00:04:33.780> those<00:04:33.930> curls<00:04:34.259> if<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:34.560> need<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.860> at<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.099> end

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
and we've left the ponytail straight

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.230 
and we've left the ponytail straight
before<00:04:38.810> but<00:04:39.810> in<00:04:39.930> this<00:04:40.050> one<00:04:40.289> we<00:04:40.560> will<00:04:41.150> curl<00:04:42.150> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
before but in this one we will curl the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.550 
before but in this one we will curl the
pony<00:04:42.449> tail<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.690> come<00:04:42.810> back<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.229> show<00:04:43.349> you<00:04:43.440> the

pony tail and come back and show you the
finished<00:04:43.680> result<00:04:44.250> but<00:04:44.580> it's<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.090> nice<00:04:45.270> contrast

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
finished result but it's a nice contrast

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.320 
finished result but it's a nice contrast
with<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.319> straight<00:04:46.620> ponytail<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.000> curls
