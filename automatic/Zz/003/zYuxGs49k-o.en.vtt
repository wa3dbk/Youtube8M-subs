 "Protein and heart disease" 

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:11.172
 We know that the quality and quantity of fat are closely linked to the risk of our development 

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:13.703
 the biggest killer, heart disease. 

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:16.663
 What about protein? 

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:17.880
 Recent Harvard Report: 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.040
 Daily protein intake and risk of coronary heart disease in middle-aged men. 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.409
 Do you think the total protein intake is 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.524
 independently of its source and independently of fat intake, 

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:29.722
 associated with a greater incidence of heart disease, 

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:30.492
 less, 

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:32.092
 or does it play any role? 

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:33.189
 The answer that scientists have reached was: 

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:34.029
 Protein intake does not matter. 

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:35.897
 Apparently the amount of protein did not matter, 

00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:39.677
 but what about their quality and source? 

00:00:39.677 --> 00:00:42.857
 There was no association between total protein intake from the diet 

00:00:42.857 --> 00:00:45.777
 and the overall risk of heart disease in this group of men. 

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:49.757
 However, higher animal protein intake may be associated with increased risk 

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:53.937
 coronary heart disease in "healthy men" 

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:57.846
 thus in men without hypertension, high cholesterol and diabetes. 

00:00:57.846 --> 00:00:59.417
 Health is therefore only in quotation marks, 

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:01.177
 because they have an increased risk of heart disease due to 

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:04.547
 consumption of animal protein. 

00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:08.619
 Scientists have also observed a significant relationship of indirect proportions 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.179
 between higher protein protein intake and the risk of fatal heart disease. 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:14.649
 So more plants meant less heart disease. 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.733
 This means that the more plant foods we eat at the expense of those animals 

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.523
 the more we will benefit your heart 

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:24.113
 even independent of fat intake. 

00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:26.291
 So the benefits of herbal diet are not just 

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:30.091
 about avoiding saturated animal fat. 

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:33.408
 Isn't protein like protein? 

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:38.542
 How does your body know if a protein comes from a plant or animal? 

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:42.200
 Proteins are made up of a chain of amino acids 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.140
 and some amino acids are more common in plants than in animals, 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.820
 especially glutamic acid. 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.920
 The one study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.960
 found that it has the potential to reduce independently 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.150
 blood pressure. 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.625
 This can contribute to that indirect proportion 

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.725
 between protein and blood pressure. 

00:02:02.725 --> 00:02:05.300
 High intake of plant foods = low pressure. 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.879
 These findings have generally strengthened the merits of the current recommendation 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.990
 consume large amounts of plant foods as 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.076
 components of comprehensive nutritional approaches to prevention and control 

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:19.305
 severe cardiovascular risk factors and epidemics 

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:25.124
 cardiovascular diseases.
