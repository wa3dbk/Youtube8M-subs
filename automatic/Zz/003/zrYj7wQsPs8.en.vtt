bunch of crazy toys as you can see here

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.749 
bunch of crazy toys as you can see here
by<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> m14<00:00:30.300> sitting<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.619> bench<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.040> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
by the m14 sitting on the bench but so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.220 
by the m14 sitting on the bench but so
anyway<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.329> really<00:00:33.450> not<00:00:33.630> nearly<00:00:34.050> as

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
anyway so it's really not nearly as

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.270 
anyway so it's really not nearly as
difficult<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.980> these<00:00:35.100> as<00:00:35.250> you

sound attenuation you're supposed to

time to get it wet with either water or

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.179 
time to get it wet with either water or
grease<00:01:06.560> grease<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.619> works<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> best

grease grease that works the best

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.859 
grease grease that works the best
because<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.490> stays<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:08.939> longer<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
because it stays in there longer of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.240 
because it stays in there longer of
course<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.229> forgot<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> grease<00:01:10.770> today<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.070> I'm

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
course I forgot the grease today so I'm

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.830 
course I forgot the grease today so I'm
going<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.490> put<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> little<00:01:11.939> water<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
going to put a little water in here and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.270 
going to put a little water in here and
the<00:01:12.900> way<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.560> doesn't<00:01:14.159> really

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the way you do it is doesn't really

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.789 
the way you do it is doesn't really
matter<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:14.640> n<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.850> pour<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.119> in

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.039 

spill<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.250> bit<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:21.960> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
spill it up a little bit and what you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
spill it up a little bit and what you
want<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> there's<00:01:22.799> all<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> different

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
want to do is there's all the different

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
want to do is there's all the different
chambers<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.119> crown<00:01:24.930> kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> roll

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
chambers in there you crown kind of roll

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.520 
chambers in there you crown kind of roll
it<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.509> empty<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> out

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.450 

so<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:34.890> we're<00:01:35.010> doing<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.220> we're<00:01:35.340> just

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
so really what we're doing is we're just

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.930 
so really what we're doing is we're just
kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> coating<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.120> inside<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:36.660> liquid

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
kind of coating the inside with liquid

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.650 
kind of coating the inside with liquid
okay<00:01:38.940> so<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:40.050> processor<00:01:40.440> is<00:01:40.470> ready<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.800> roll

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
okay so this processor is ready to roll

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.870 
okay so this processor is ready to roll
just<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.810> gun<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.710> I've<00:01:44.550> got<00:01:44.729> my

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
just the gun here it is I've got my

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.300 
just the gun here it is I've got my
Glock<00:01:45.120> 45<00:01:45.690> or<00:01:45.900> Glock<00:01:46.080> 21<00:01:46.380> all<00:01:46.740> set<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
Glock 45 or Glock 21 all set up for this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.430 
Glock 45 or Glock 21 all set up for this
essentially<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> threaded<00:01:48.180> barrel<00:01:48.380> just<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
essentially a threaded barrel just to

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.440 
essentially a threaded barrel just to
confirm<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.160> handling<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.940> firearm<00:01:51.330> so

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
confirm that the handling of firearm so

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.310 
confirm that the handling of firearm so
of<00:01:51.510> course<00:01:51.660> we're<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.080> through<00:01:52.260> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
of course we're going to go through the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.280 
of course we're going to go through the
safety<00:01:52.500> check<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.430> chamber<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.210> empty

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
safety check the chamber is empty

pretty<00:02:08.520> easy<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.820> get<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.179> these<00:02:10.040> so<00:02:11.040> we

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
pretty easy to get one of these so we

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.310 
pretty easy to get one of these so we
take<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.709> little<00:02:13.709> thread<00:02:13.920> protector<00:02:14.370> off<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
take the little thread protector off and

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.350 
take the little thread protector off and
screw<00:02:19.320> on<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.860> suppressor<00:02:20.370> now<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.150> most

shooting a 45 on auto with the can is

different<00:02:27.150> than<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.330> movies<00:02:27.660> sure<00:02:28.350> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
different than the movies sure you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.560 
different than the movies sure you
probably<00:02:29.400> aren't<00:02:29.670> surprised<00:02:30.030> by<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.330> since

probably aren't surprised by that since
the<00:02:30.660> movies<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:31.050> quite<00:02:31.470> inaccurate<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.070> all

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the movies are quite inaccurate and all

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.360 
the movies are quite inaccurate and all
it's<00:02:32.310> everything<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.250> way<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it's everything the you know the way a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.660 
it's everything the you know the way a
suppressor<00:02:35.730> works<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.269> essentially<00:02:36.720> it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
suppressor works is essentially it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
suppressor works is essentially it
without<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> suppressor<00:02:39.209> you've<00:02:39.390> got<00:02:39.570> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
without a suppressor you've got the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.060 
without a suppressor you've got the
bullet<00:02:39.959> coming<00:02:40.170> out<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> barrel<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
bullet coming out of the barrel and the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.110 
bullet coming out of the barrel and the
differential<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.670> pressure<00:02:41.880> between

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120

atmospheric pressure and the pressure

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.420 
atmospheric pressure and the pressure
behind<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.630> bullet<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:46.290> tremendous<00:02:46.530> that

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
behind the bullet is so tremendous that

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.400 
behind the bullet is so tremendous that
that<00:02:47.910> obviously<00:02:48.390> as<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.660> bullet<00:02:48.930> exits<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
that obviously as the bullet exits the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.860 
that obviously as the bullet exits the
barrel<00:02:49.530> there's<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.430> obviously<00:02:51.330> huge<00:02:51.600> noise

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
barrel there's this obviously huge noise

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.660 
barrel there's this obviously huge noise
that's<00:02:52.200> that's<00:02:52.500> due<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.100> fact<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.549> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
that's that's due to the fact of the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.300 
that's that's due to the fact of the
massively<00:02:54.680> expanding<00:02:55.680> gasses<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.100> are

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
massively expanding gasses that are

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.400 
massively expanding gasses that are
behind<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.090> bullet<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.480> course<00:02:58.230> we're<00:02:58.380> just

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
behind the bullet of course we're just

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.199 
behind the bullet of course we're just
porting<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.100> out<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.459> barrel<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.820> a

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
porting it out of the barrel do a

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.759 
porting it out of the barrel do a
suppressor<00:03:00.870> works<00:03:01.079> on<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.320> principle<00:03:01.739> that

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
suppressor works on the principle that

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.289 
suppressor works on the principle that
there's<00:03:02.400> essentially<00:03:02.700> all<00:03:02.940> these<00:03:03.090> little

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
there's essentially all these little

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.970 
there's essentially all these little
bitty<00:03:03.540> minute<00:03:03.870> mini<00:03:04.170> chambers<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.680> allow

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
bitty minute mini chambers that allow

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.039 
bitty minute mini chambers that allow
the<00:03:05.040> gas<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.400> slowly<00:03:05.970> expand<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:06.720> little<00:03:06.810> bit

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
the gas to slowly expand a little bit

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.150 
the gas to slowly expand a little bit
and<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> little<00:03:07.470> bit<00:03:07.560> more<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:07.890> little<00:03:08.070> bit

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
and a little bit more and a little bit

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.380 
and a little bit more and a little bit
more<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.370> little<00:03:08.489> bit<00:03:08.670> more<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.090> eventually

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
more a little bit more so eventually

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.270 
more a little bit more so eventually
when<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.690> comes<00:03:09.900> out<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.170> very<00:03:10.380> end<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
when it comes out the very end the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.410 
when it comes out the very end the
pressure<00:03:11.519> differential<00:03:12.390> between

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
atmospheric pressure and the pressure in

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.020 
atmospheric pressure and the pressure in
the<00:03:15.090> suppressor<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.810> lot<00:03:16.470> less<00:03:16.709> thus<00:03:17.070> making

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the suppressor is a lot less thus making

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.720 
the suppressor is a lot less thus making
the<00:03:18.209> sound<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.510> lot<00:03:18.630> lower<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.560> personally<00:03:20.549> think

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
the sound a lot lower I personally think

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.670 
the sound a lot lower I personally think
that<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.120> 45<00:03:21.810> Auto<00:03:22.049> suppressor<00:03:22.560> is

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
that a a 45 Auto suppressor is

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.720 
that a a 45 Auto suppressor is
especially<00:03:23.010> cool<00:03:23.489> because<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:24.660> 45<00:03:25.079> Auto

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
especially cool because the 45 Auto

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.130 
especially cool because the 45 Auto
cartridge<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.910> bullet<00:03:27.209> actually<00:03:27.329> exits<00:03:27.989> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
cartridge the bullet actually exits the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.039 
cartridge the bullet actually exits the
barrel<00:03:28.260> subsonically<00:03:29.420> naturally<00:03:30.420> okay<00:03:30.690> so

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
barrel subsonically naturally okay so

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:31.970 
barrel subsonically naturally okay so
you<00:03:31.110> don't<00:03:31.200> have<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.440> buy<00:03:31.560> any<00:03:31.769> special

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
you don't have to buy any special

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.910 
you don't have to buy any special
subsonic<00:03:32.790> ammunition<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.530> subsonic

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
subsonic ammunition it just is subsonic

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.190 
subsonic ammunition it just is subsonic
so<00:03:35.220> therefore<00:03:35.610> when<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.150> suppress<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.750> round

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
so therefore when you suppress the round

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.810 
so therefore when you suppress the round
there's<00:03:37.590> no<00:03:37.860> sonic<00:03:38.250> boom<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.549> all<00:03:38.610> because

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
there's no sonic boom and all because

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.430 
there's no sonic boom and all because
there<00:03:39.000> never<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.239> anyway<00:03:39.690> it's<00:03:39.930> just<00:03:40.110> as<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.230> lot

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
there never is anyway it's just as a lot

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.110 
there never is anyway it's just as a lot

sound<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.730> hear<00:04:30.030> is<00:04:30.180> actually<00:04:30.660> the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
sound that you hear is actually the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.890 
sound that you hear is actually the
slide<00:04:31.230> working<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.550> amazingly<00:04:33.450> quiet<00:04:33.690> I

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
slide working it is amazingly quiet I

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.350 
slide working it is amazingly quiet I
think<00:04:33.980> Pat's<00:04:34.980> that's<00:04:35.400> pretty<00:04:35.730> excited<00:04:36.180> Oh

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
quiet it is and I can probably the only

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.880 
quiet it is and I can probably the only
thing<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:39.750> really<00:04:39.990> have<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.230> focus<00:04:40.380> on<00:04:40.710> when

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
thing you really have to focus on when

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.530 
thing you really have to focus on when
shooting<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.190> suppress<00:04:41.550> Lisa's<00:04:41.940> press<00:04:42.210> Glock

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
shooting a suppress Lisa's press Glock

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.659 
shooting a suppress Lisa's press Glock
is<00:04:42.780> I'm<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.470> can't<00:04:43.890> limp<00:04:44.130> wristed<00:04:44.430> at<00:04:44.550> all

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
is I'm you can't limp wristed at all

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.120 
is I'm you can't limp wristed at all
because<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.590> extra<00:04:46.919> weight

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
because the the the the extra weight

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.510 
because the the the the extra weight
hanging<00:04:47.550> off<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.880> barrel<00:04:48.210> tends<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.200> kind<00:04:49.410> of

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
hanging off the barrel tends to kind of

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.580 
hanging off the barrel tends to kind of
just<00:04:50.520> slightly<00:04:50.970> adjust<00:04:51.390> mechanics<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.260> of

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
just slightly adjust mechanics of the of

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.850 
just slightly adjust mechanics of the of
the<00:04:52.860> slot<00:04:53.070> of<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:54.510> actuated<00:04:54.960> slide<00:04:55.320> so

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
the slot of the the actuated slide so

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
the slot of the the actuated slide so
you<00:04:55.950> have<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.190> be<00:04:56.310> sure<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.790> don't

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
comparison as you can tell the pressure

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.839 
comparison as you can tell the pressure
gets<00:05:24.289> a<00:05:24.380> little<00:05:24.500> warm<00:05:24.830> so<00:05:24.919> I<00:05:25.099> gotta<00:05:25.280> use<00:05:25.490> a<00:05:25.520> rag

gets a little warm so I gotta use a rag
but<00:05:26.539> I'm<00:05:26.660> going<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.810> just<00:05:27.199> throw<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.470> few<00:05:27.650> rounds

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
but I'm going to just throw a few rounds

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.010 
but I'm going to just throw a few rounds
downrange<00:05:28.280> without<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.360> suppressor<00:05:29.630> just

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020
