fifty percent or less before you filter
it<00:04:24.930> through<00:04:24.990> your<00:04:25.230> carbon<00:04:25.620> filter<00:04:25.950> otherwise

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
it through your carbon filter otherwise

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.180 
it through your carbon filter otherwise
it<00:04:26.550> will<00:04:26.640> damage<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:27.120> filter<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.830> carbon

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
it will damage the filter and the carbon

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.360 
it will damage the filter and the carbon
filter<00:04:29.370> actually<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.840> type<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.650> impurities

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370

out<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:33.600> alcohol<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:35.100> I<00:04:35.490> should<00:04:36.240> measure

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
out of the alcohol so I should measure

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.700 
out of the alcohol so I should measure
through<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.680> carry<00:04:38.040> an<00:04:38.280> oasis<00:04:38.730> empty<00:04:39.710> period

through a carry an oasis empty period

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.470 
through a carry an oasis empty period
then<00:04:41.310> carried<00:04:41.760> minutes<00:04:42.060> for<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.300> alcohol

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
then carried minutes for the alcohol

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.540 
then carried minutes for the alcohol
because<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.200> bottom<00:04:43.500> section<00:04:43.980> might<00:04:44.310> just

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
because the bottom section might just

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.060 
because the bottom section might just
drop<00:04:44.730> off<00:04:44.970> from<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.330> lid<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:46.220> just<00:04:47.220> idea<00:04:48.090> of
