as you can see it's about three hundred
and<00:01:42.020> ninety-one<00:01:42.380> kilowatts

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
and ninety-one kilowatts

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.100 
and ninety-one kilowatts
let's<00:01:44.510> go<00:01:44.720> into<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.110> analyze<00:01:45.410> screen<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.750> say

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
let's go into the analyze screen and say

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.359 
let's go into the analyze screen and say
that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that
