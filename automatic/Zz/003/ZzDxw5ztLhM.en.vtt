00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
because the current shader i'm wearing

is<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.810> o<00:00:31.840> Rose<00:00:32.169> passive<00:00:32.710> shader<00:00:33.040> which<00:00:33.160> is<00:00:33.489> a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
is the o Rose passive shader which is a

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.549 
is the o Rose passive shader which is a

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
closer look but first let's go ahead and

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.880 
closer look but first let's go ahead and
go<00:00:39.370> back<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.850> the<00:00:40.000> fault<00:00:40.329> shader<00:00:40.870> meaning<00:00:41.770> that

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
go back to the fault shader meaning that

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.880 
go back to the fault shader meaning that
there's<00:00:42.100> nothing<00:00:42.430> special<00:00:42.700> on<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:44.350> here's<00:00:44.739> how

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
there's nothing special on so here's how

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.100 
there's nothing special on so here's how
it<00:00:45.040> looks<00:00:45.309> default<00:00:46.000> no<00:00:46.450> special<00:00:46.750> shader

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
it looks default no special shader

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.979 
it looks default no special shader
whatsoever<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.550> looks<00:00:48.700> pretty<00:00:48.880> cool<00:00:49.210> if

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
whatsoever and it looks pretty cool if

surprised<00:01:51.970> not<00:01:52.119> a<00:01:52.180> lot<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.450> people<00:01:52.690> have<00:01:52.869> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
surprised not a lot of people have the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
mark so that just kind of shows how rare

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.670 
mark so that just kind of shows how rare
it<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:54.940> now<00:01:55.900> let's<00:01:56.080> go<00:01:56.229> ahead<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.410> show<00:01:56.619> you

it is now let's go ahead and show you
guys<00:01:56.800> how<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.250> looks<00:01:57.460> like<00:01:57.700> with<00:01:58.000> some<00:01:58.180> of

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
guys how this looks like with some of

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.990 
guys how this looks like with some of
the<00:01:58.360> shader<00:01:58.570> options<00:01:59.250> again<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.430> one<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.670> had

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
the shader options again the one I had

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.790 
the shader options again the one I had
equipped<00:02:01.420> first<00:02:01.810> thing<00:02:02.050> was<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.500> auras

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
equipped first thing was the auras

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.890 
equipped first thing was the auras
passage<00:02:03.280> which<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.670> random<00:02:04.000> shader<00:02:04.420> drop<00:02:04.720> as

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
passage which is a random shader drop as

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.320 
passage which is a random shader drop as
well<00:02:05.110> and<00:02:05.350> pretty<00:02:06.159> much<00:02:06.310> gives<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.670> that<00:02:06.850> gold

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
well and pretty much gives you that gold

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.270 
well and pretty much gives you that gold
look<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.110> especially<00:02:08.259> when<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:08.830> visit<00:02:09.160> the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
look to it especially when you visit the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.610 
look to it especially when you visit the
planet<00:02:09.520> once<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.090> reach<00:02:10.239> nine<00:02:10.450> wins<00:02:10.720> looks

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
planet once you reach nine wins looks

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.750 
planet once you reach nine wins looks
really<00:02:11.860> really<00:02:12.280> good<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.950> pretty<00:02:15.430> much<00:02:15.550> once

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
really really good so pretty much once

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.190 
really really good so pretty much once
you<00:02:15.880> have<00:02:16.030> all<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.330> equipped<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.840> go<00:02:16.989> hang

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
you have all this equipped you go hang

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.690 
you have all this equipped you go hang
out<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.470> tower<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.890> reef<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.280> show<00:02:18.519> up

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
out the tower of the reef and show up

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.400 
out the tower of the reef and show up
everyone<00:02:19.239> that's<00:02:19.750> pretty<00:02:19.989> much<00:02:20.110> what<00:02:20.290> i've

been doing next up we have another

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.380 
been doing next up we have another
Queens<00:02:23.830> shader<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:27.640> one's<00:02:27.850> actually<00:02:28.000> pretty

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
Queens shader this one's actually pretty

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.430 
Queens shader this one's actually pretty
cool<00:02:28.630> even<00:02:28.900> though<00:02:28.989> it's<00:02:29.110> supposed<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.350> be

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
cool even though it's supposed to be

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.930 
cool even though it's supposed to be
some<00:02:29.620> pink<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:29.980> there<00:02:30.040> which<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.550> basically

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
some pink in there which is basically

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.150 
some pink in there which is basically
right<00:02:31.300> where<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.630> chin<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.769> little<00:02:33.040> bit

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
right where the chin is and a little bit

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.560 
right where the chin is and a little bit
kind<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.430> like<00:02:33.550> where<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.820> necklace<00:02:34.209> would<00:02:34.330> be

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
kind of like where the necklace would be

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.100 
kind of like where the necklace would be
but<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.620> pretty<00:02:35.950> cool<00:02:36.160> look<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.400> it

but this is a pretty cool look to it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.690 
but this is a pretty cool look to it
it's<00:02:38.110> mostly<00:02:38.410> blocked<00:02:38.800> with<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.340> little<00:02:39.519> bit<00:02:39.640> of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it's mostly blocked with a little bit of

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.900 
it's mostly blocked with a little bit of
a<00:02:39.880> white<00:02:40.090> outline<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:42.370> kind<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.610> got<00:02:42.760> that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
a white outline you kind of got that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.640 
a white outline you kind of got that
blue<00:02:43.180> halo<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> back<00:02:43.959> there<00:02:44.200> kind<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.500> like

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
blue halo in the back there kind of like

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.870 
blue halo in the back there kind of like
what<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.190> see<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.549> movie<00:02:45.820> Tron<00:02:47.880> here's

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
what you see in the movie Tron here's

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.990 
what you see in the movie Tron here's
another<00:02:49.269> Queen<00:02:49.720> shader<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.459> this<00:02:51.610> one's<00:02:51.820> a

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
another Queen shader so this one's a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.380 
another Queen shader so this one's a
little<00:02:52.090> bit<00:02:52.299> more<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.660> pink<00:02:52.989> color<00:02:54.390> so

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
little bit more of a pink color so

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.550 
little bit more of a pink color so
depending<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.840> how<00:02:55.989> you<00:02:56.049> want<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.380> rock<00:02:56.530> it

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
depending on how you want to rock it

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.699 
depending on how you want to rock it
totally<00:02:57.190> up<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:59.019> one's<00:02:59.230> pretty<00:02:59.410> cool

so it's kind of another nice look for it
next<00:03:18.340> up<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:20.430> cryptographic<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:22.560> always

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
next up is the cryptographic I always

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.259 
next up is the cryptographic I always
mispronounce<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.220> when<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.340> first<00:03:24.579> try<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.850> say

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
mispronounce and when I first try to say

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.240 
mispronounce and when I first try to say
it<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:26.110> one<00:03:26.290> looks<00:03:26.410> pretty<00:03:26.650> cool<00:03:26.829> too<00:03:27.040> with

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it this one looks pretty cool too with

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.050 
it this one looks pretty cool too with
the<00:03:27.400> red<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.060> bronze

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
next up is glue who this one also looks

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.510 
next up is glue who this one also looks
really<00:03:38.819> good<00:03:38.970> with<00:03:39.180> it

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.670 

next<00:03:45.270> up<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.540> polar<00:03:45.870> oak<00:03:48.170> another<00:03:49.170> nice<00:03:49.410> color

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
scheme kind of has the reptile look to

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.230 
scheme kind of has the reptile look to
it<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.280> then<00:03:53.280> last<00:03:53.460> but<00:03:53.550> not<00:03:53.730> least<00:03:53.790> gold
