00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello, today we will open 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.580
 another package with aliexpress which 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.300
 is very useful and interesting 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.130
 the contents of the content concerns here such 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 here are the pieces we have a battery for 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.460
 bicycle flashlight 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.350
 four thousand 400 milliamps well by 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.930
 at least four thousand 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.550
 400 milliamps that's how much there 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.699
 that is, you can only cut 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.670
 if you open this one that's kind of hermetic 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.660
 sealed as claimed 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.700
 waterproof good protected 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 more precisely 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.059
 package and just look plant 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 battery but if the tanks are so amateurs 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.230
 either ultrafire or transforms there 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.230
 far well means what is written on them 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.090
 also unlikely to shake reality 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:51.180
 I wanted to order myself 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:01:01.219
 higher capacity battery 4,400 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:02.870
 for example a64 steel you 8 800 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.770
 transition 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.930
 package wrapped after 22 days 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.970
 Here and on when I was looking for a battery and here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.229
 such are the different capacities of the neuron 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.390
 stumbled upon this thing here such 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:27.720
 fox 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:29.579
 what is it immediately see what what am i 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860
 Immediately I see that is this thing should 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.810
 was to be with such a cover at least 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.659
 the picture was that this was a cover for 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:44.280
 in fact, the video turned out to be no 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.479
 There is a box in which you can but 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.810
 salesman dude gives well, that is shorter 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.149
 the essence of this thing is who is boxing 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.570
 which you can recruit batteries 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.579
 such as you want it is possible here 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.799
 throw 4 battery that is well, I 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.110
 I ordered the article to the battery for example 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.969
 also see what we can here 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.890
 accumulate as much battery as you 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.470
 want but sense what kind of capacity are you 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.390
 want for your bicycle headlamp and how 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.170
 you see 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.569
 I wanted to order only with this 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.030
 Here is the connector for the headlamp and the seller sent 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.520
 oches like this usb connector here we have on 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.069
 output 5 is right here for us and although 84 volts 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.450
 that is actually why bother with it 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.459
 ie ordered me here there is such a 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.200
 here is farad 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.050
 there is enough battery in it 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.730
 only almost minus 40 glow 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.959
 that is, it is very little well, I wondered 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.720
 question means need to take something 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.700
 more serious well, and bass searching Ali 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.430
 Express watched the same box and here 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.870
 There on 6 on 8 batteries then I already on 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.140
 This thing, that is, I ordered more 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.140
 panasonic 4300 batteries 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.030
 oh 3400 i.e. four things 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.620
 if i put here on me it will turn out 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.500
 actually 12 thousand mA battery 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.470
 we have enough of this headlight at least 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.000
 for hours four ladies can five given 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.910
 the fact that I can not spend much here 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.030
 really like a worm here 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.150
 thing than cool first she 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.480
 waterproof 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.350
 yes here we have gum good 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.269
 protected that is what's cool 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.070
 that you can type such a capacity that 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.840
 you need that is there in which he is a 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.160
 pharo offers as you need 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.140
 plus a universal thing what i mean i 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.850
 By the way, Kadyk is even like that 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.280
 Only with such a connector like in 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.680
 ssylochku give us two connectors that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.100
 by the way, you can use it for the headlamp 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.079
 power supply and for charging charging for example 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.400
 your smartphone tablet or any 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.150
 devices that charge through 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.310
 yuzbi 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.400
 that is, it turns out like this 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:51.079
 hybrid i.e. powerbank for headlights and 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.180
 actually supply and from for in order 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.180
 to charge various devices 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.370
 Well, this is an indicator for me unfortunately 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.070
 Now there is at least able to stand here 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.340
 by the way either two 18:50 batteries or 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.370
 4 that is, I understand that this is just 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.799
 charge indicator that we have there 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.660
 there is only one of course I did not understand 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:16.530
 why the seller did not put write it 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.500
 mary krismas 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.269
 Well, really where to stick shorter gave 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.020
 to me 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:28.410
 power adapter 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.460
 what is written by the way 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.600
 something about 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:40.430
 ipx4 order of the bowl protected 84 order of the cup 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.260
 so here is 50 about the joys of the Koran 9 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.520
 ampere 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:51.480
 drive from put 5 volts esbe maxim thousands 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.240
 2 2 2 2 amps 2000 milliamps then 2 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.950
 amps yes that's out well in general so here 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.950
 interesting stuff well really 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.020
 interesting and because here these here 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.850
 batteries tass well, it is not clear what 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.160
 it is not clear what is really there 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.750
 Indeed capacity and it is not clear how much she 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.440
 will work how much will it shine 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.780
 here here that loaded here came out 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.790
 Battery failure uploaded new other 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.200
 and everything works as if nothing is needed as 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.000
 would run search and so on well 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.590
 at least you know what you use and 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.930
 accordingly using as 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.560
 it should be like that 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.440
 interesting thing here is a link to 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.880
 the seller I put under the video from the seller 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.410
 Of course we're asking about 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.600
 cover as I understand it 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.070
 be bundled pictures at 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.050
 least he was that is to interrupt the parcel 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.400
 look there this thing happens 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:48.120
 here is such a case here and this is called 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.100
 Of course, well, I would not want to take 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.640
 because my bike is like a visby 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.070
 would be a special world 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.550
 Well, in short it will be necessary to come up with something 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.320
 something to do something to think well general 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.289
 okay upset then nothing is rude 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.960
 saying a bonus because here with two 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.479
 connectors such boxes more expensive that is 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.780
 with one he I this this came for 16 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.820
 a dollar with two was 24 25 in my here 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.460
 Well, in short, we will use it in 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.440
 household probably 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:23.580
 well, although although 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:27.780
 Well, in short there is the main thing that there are two gods 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.910
 it would be so now that such a thing 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.230
 link to the seller under the video write your 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.830
 comments what are you on this 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.980
 think that someone did not get such 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.660
 I did not use the pieces 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.860
 accordingly I will wait for the batteries 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.530
 when the battery comes and then 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.310
 probably just later make a fi video 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.620
 there is a test 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.200
 This one needs these lights 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.120
 batteries we will say so in the future 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.460
 until she knows she won't battery 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.200
 that is, we would like to consider all 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.850
 then on this I will say goodbye to all 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.100
 Many thanks for your attention. I hope that 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.750
 the video for you was interesting that also 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.430
 it brought you taking advantage of it so then 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.800
 like subscribe to my channel 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.840
 write comments what do you think 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.490
 About this thing, ask your 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.160
 questions also link to the seller will 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.090
 under the video I will say goodbye to all big 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.090
 thanks, bye
