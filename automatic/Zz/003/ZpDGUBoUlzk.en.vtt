00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
dots which we are going to be using for

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.009 
dots which we are going to be using for
launching<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.500> little<00:02:10.769> tremens<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.720> then<00:02:12.720> on

the back of it we have a little hole
which<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:16.769> can<00:02:16.950> keep<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.340> shortcut<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
which we can keep the shortcut so the

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.170 
which we can keep the shortcut so the
shark<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.370> go<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.690> there<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.180> we

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
shark can go just right in there and we

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.660 
shark can go just right in there and we
can<00:02:24.329> keep<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.959> there<00:02:27.920> now<00:02:28.920> let's<00:02:29.250> go<00:02:29.519> ahead

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
can keep it in there now let's go ahead

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:40.140 
can keep it in there now let's go ahead
and<00:02:30.049> try<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:32.250> two<00:02:32.579> trends

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.910 

now<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:41.570> have<00:02:41.600> both<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.080> them<00:02:42.380> Felton

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
now that we have both of them Felton

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.460 
now that we have both of them Felton
let's<00:02:43.280> go<00:02:43.550> ahead<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.000> choose<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.960> target<00:02:47.470> but

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
let's go ahead and choose a target but

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.230 
let's go ahead and choose a target but
before<00:02:48.950> we<00:02:49.100> do<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.250> we<00:02:49.430> have<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.850> make<00:02:50.210> sure

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
before we do that we have to make sure

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.780 
before we do that we have to make sure
that<00:02:50.780> Black<00:02:51.080> Manta<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.890> sitting<00:02:52.460> where<00:02:52.610> he's
