00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
schooner you will get it almost from the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
schooner you will get it almost from the
beginning<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> game<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.610> upgrade

beginning of the game and I will upgrade
it<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> level<00:00:42.960> 4<00:00:43.230> speed<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:44.040> mission<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it to the level 4 speed this mission you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
it to the level 4 speed this mission you
can<00:00:44.640> complete<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> level<00:00:45.780> 3<00:00:46.050> speed<00:00:46.350> but

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
can complete with the level 3 speed but

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.000 
can complete with the level 3 speed but
it<00:00:46.770> will<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.340> difficult<00:00:48.469> this<00:00:49.469> racing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it will be very difficult this racing

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.939 
it will be very difficult this racing
nation<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:51.000> already<00:00:51.300> said<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.649> first

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
nation as I already said it's the first

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.689 
nation as I already said it's the first
really<00:00:53.309> challenging<00:00:54.149> mission<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:56.370> course

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
really challenging mission of course

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
really challenging mission of course
from<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> beginning<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> reason

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
from the beginning this is the reason

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.040 
from the beginning this is the reason
nation<00:00:58.949> choose<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.670> maximum<00:00:59.879> speed<00:01:00.660> full

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
nation choose the maximum speed full

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.799 
nation choose the maximum speed full
sails<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.649> go<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.370> anyway<00:01:02.789> don't<00:01:03.090> tap<00:01:03.480> on

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
sails and go but anyway don't tap on

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.640 
sails and go but anyway don't tap on
this<00:01:04.049> sail<00:01:04.710> again<00:01:05.159> because<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:06.869> shouldn't

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
this sail again because you shouldn't

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.359 
this sail again because you shouldn't
use<00:01:08.070> boost<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.450> instead<00:01:10.140> use<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.770> perk<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
use boost but instead use this perk it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.760 
use boost but instead use this perk it
speed<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.689> counted<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.409> boost

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
speed up it's not counted as the boost

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.660 
speed up it's not counted as the boost
so<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.909> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:15.960> shape<00:01:16.670> also

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so it's a kind of like little shape also

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.630 
so it's a kind of like little shape also
as<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.509> see<00:01:18.689> Racing<00:01:19.259> Nations<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.830> better<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
as you see Racing Nations is better to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.039 
as you see Racing Nations is better to
go<00:01:20.909> with<00:01:21.650> small<00:01:22.650> shapes<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.970> schooners

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
go with small shapes like schooners

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.980 
go with small shapes like schooners
with<00:01:26.619> phospide<00:01:27.310> if<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:27.729> take<00:01:27.969> the<00:01:28.329> like<00:01:28.719> men

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
with phospide if you take the like men

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.779 
with phospide if you take the like men
of<00:01:29.020> new<00:01:29.350> water<00:01:29.590> this<00:01:29.799> mission<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.429> will<00:01:30.579> have

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
of new water this mission you will have

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.969 
of new water this mission you will have
difficulty<00:01:31.479> to<00:01:31.630> go<00:01:32.130> through<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.659> mines<00:01:34.979> there

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
difficulty to go through the mines there

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.279 
difficulty to go through the mines there
is<00:01:36.130> also<00:01:36.340> one<00:01:36.670> important<00:01:37.270> perk<00:01:37.570> for<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
is also one important perk for the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.940 
is also one important perk for the
racing<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:39.130> improve<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:39.939> ship's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
racing is to improve the ship's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.440 
racing is to improve the ship's
maneuverability<00:01:41.950> it's<00:01:42.189> really<00:01:42.640> very<00:01:42.789> helpful

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
maneuverability it's really very helpful

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.569 
maneuverability it's really very helpful
especially<00:01:43.569> during<00:01:44.319> this<00:01:44.649> heavy<00:01:45.250> wind

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
especially during this heavy wind

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.120 
especially during this heavy wind
however<00:01:46.299> I<00:01:46.569> just<00:01:46.990> replay<00:01:47.350> in<00:01:47.409> this<00:01:47.649> game<00:01:47.890> from

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
however I just replay in this game from

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.370 
however I just replay in this game from
the<00:01:48.189> beginning<00:01:48.429> am<00:01:48.969> I'm<00:01:49.209> still<00:01:49.390> low<00:01:49.810> level<00:01:50.200> so

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
the beginning am I'm still low level so

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
the beginning am I'm still low level so
I<00:01:50.409> don't<00:01:50.799> have<00:01:51.069> the<00:01:51.280> perk<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.579> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
I don't have the perk of the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.080 
I don't have the perk of the
maneuverability<00:01:53.140> so<00:01:53.619> at<00:01:53.920> least<00:01:54.250> upgrade<00:01:54.880> the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
maneuverability so at least upgrade the

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.999 
maneuverability so at least upgrade the
speed<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.649> best<00:01:57.009> level<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:58.709> use<00:01:59.709> the

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
speed to the best level and use the

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.520 
speed to the best level and use the
speed-up<00:02:00.310> perk<00:02:00.759> of<00:02:01.750> course<00:02:02.079> it<00:02:02.200> will<00:02:02.349> be

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
speed-up perk of course it will be

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.249 
speed-up perk of course it will be
necessary<00:02:02.709> several<00:02:03.520> times<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:04.390> fail<00:02:04.630> as<00:02:04.959> a
