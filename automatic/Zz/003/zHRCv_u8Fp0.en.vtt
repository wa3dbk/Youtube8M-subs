which<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> incredibly<00:00:32.189> bad<00:00:32.750> but<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> just<00:00:34.079> tend

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
which is incredibly bad but I just tend

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.040 
which is incredibly bad but I just tend
to<00:00:34.469> find<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.100> leaving<00:00:35.790> my<00:00:35.940> hair<00:00:36.210> curly<00:00:36.540> it's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
to find that leaving my hair curly it's

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.580 
to find that leaving my hair curly it's
really<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> manageable<00:00:38.370> um<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.360> don't<00:00:40.200> really

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
really a manageable um I don't really

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590 
really a manageable um I don't really
know<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.070> styles<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> put<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.329> or

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
know what styles to put it in or

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.650 
know what styles to put it in or
anything<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.800> hence<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:45.059> hair<00:00:45.390> is

increasing more circulation and

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.370 
increasing more circulation and
therefore<00:02:12.550> increasing<00:02:13.550> hair<00:02:13.940> growth<00:02:14.380> then

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
therefore increasing hair growth then

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.420 
therefore increasing hair growth then
what<00:02:15.560> you're<00:02:15.709> going<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.250> you're<00:02:16.400> going

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.170 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:02:16.580> go<00:02:16.730> upside<00:02:17.209> down<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:18.260> about<00:02:19.000> four<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.150> five

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
to go upside down for about four to five

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.410 
to go upside down for about four to five
minutes<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.959> tend<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.410> do<00:02:21.560> five<00:02:21.800> minutes<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.520> set

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
minutes I tend to do five minutes I set

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.570 
minutes I tend to do five minutes I set
myself<00:02:23.569> up<00:02:23.959> with<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.290> YouTube<00:02:24.650> video<00:02:25.010> go

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
myself up with the YouTube video go

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.210 
myself up with the YouTube video go
upside<00:02:25.910> down<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.420> watch<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.870> um<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:28.010> could

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
upside down and watch that um you could

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.040 
upside down and watch that um you could
do<00:02:28.489> your<00:02:28.640> toenails<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.360> lot<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.600> people<00:02:29.840> paint

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
do your toenails a lot of people paint

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.380 
do your toenails a lot of people paint
their<00:02:30.110> toenails<00:02:30.380> while<00:02:30.950> they're<00:02:31.190> doing<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
their toenails while they're doing the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.660 
their toenails while they're doing the
inversion<00:02:32.930> method<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:33.560> what<00:02:34.400> you're<00:02:34.550> going

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
inversion method and what you're going

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.520 
inversion method and what you're going
to<00:02:34.730> expect<00:02:35.090> from<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.540> inversion<00:02:35.959> method<00:02:36.080> is

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
to expect from the inversion method is

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.290 
to expect from the inversion method is
one<00:02:37.459> inch<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:38.150> growth<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:39.140> seven<00:02:39.890> days<00:02:40.239> um<00:02:41.239> I

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
one inch of growth in seven days um I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.920 
one inch of growth in seven days um I
have<00:02:42.250> noticed<00:02:43.250> some<00:02:43.519> growth<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.450> don't<00:02:44.780> know

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
have noticed some growth I don't know

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.340 
have noticed some growth I don't know
whether<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.370> know<00:02:46.819> just<00:02:47.300> my<00:02:47.510> hopes<00:02:47.840> or

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
whether it is you know just my hopes or

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.990 
whether it is you know just my hopes or
something<00:02:48.769> like<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.069> because<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.580> haven't

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
something like that because I haven't

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.020 
something like that because I haven't
actually<00:02:50.830> measured<00:02:51.830> or<00:02:52.100> calculated<00:02:52.580> it

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
actually measured or calculated it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.289 
actually measured or calculated it
properly<00:02:53.540> um<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.560> will<00:02:55.100> do<00:02:55.370> that

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
properly um I will do that

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.789 
properly um I will do that
the<00:02:56.860> next<00:02:57.860> time<00:02:58.299> but<00:02:59.299> I<00:02:59.330> do<00:02:59.450> feel<00:03:00.049> like<00:03:00.080> my<00:03:00.319> hair

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
the next time but I do feel like my hair

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.150 
the next time but I do feel like my hair
is<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.580> bit<00:03:02.239> longer<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:03.260> was<00:03:03.739> obviously

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
is a bit longer that was obviously

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.190 
is a bit longer that was obviously
before<00:03:04.519> I<00:03:04.549> got<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> chopped<00:03:05.180> off

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
before I got it chopped off

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.650 
before I got it chopped off
I<00:03:06.260> did<00:03:06.680> feel<00:03:06.860> my<00:03:07.010> hair<00:03:07.190> was<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.370> bit<00:03:07.519> longer<00:03:07.790> I

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
I did feel my hair was a bit longer I

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.720 
I did feel my hair was a bit longer I
will<00:03:09.200> be<00:03:09.350> carrying<00:03:09.769> on<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.100> inversion<00:03:10.400> method

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
will be carrying on the inversion method

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.970 
will be carrying on the inversion method
for<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.750> rest<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.080> year<00:03:12.260> taking<00:03:12.739> month

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
for the rest of the year taking month

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.160 
for the rest of the year taking month
breaks<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.640> between<00:03:13.700> as<00:03:14.359> I<00:03:14.510> office<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.959> don't

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
breaks in between as I office you don't

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.949 
breaks in between as I office you don't
want<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.590> damage<00:03:16.400> my<00:03:16.549> brain<00:03:16.910> function<00:03:17.510> or

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
want to damage my brain function or

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.370 
want to damage my brain function or
anything<00:03:18.200> like<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:18.590> um<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.900> yeah<00:03:21.109> I'm

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
anything like that um and yeah I'm

anything like that um and yeah I'm
actually<00:03:22.070> just<00:03:22.430> really<00:03:23.150> enjoying<00:03:23.420> doing<00:03:23.690> it

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
actually just really enjoying doing it

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.030 
actually just really enjoying doing it
doesn't<00:03:23.900> take<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.170> lot<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.470> time<00:03:24.680> out<00:03:24.829> of<00:03:24.920> my<00:03:25.010> day

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
doesn't take a lot of time out of my day

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.150 
doesn't take a lot of time out of my day
so<00:03:25.940> if<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:26.329> guys<00:03:26.690> have<00:03:26.959> any<00:03:27.170> questions<00:03:27.470> about
