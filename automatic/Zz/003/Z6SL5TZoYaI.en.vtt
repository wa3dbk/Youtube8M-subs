 hi dear friends with you alexander 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.200
 channels kondachka we are for the right iron 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.160
 and today we talk a little bit about ssd 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.620
 thomas de which I will use in 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.839
 my gaming computer means I 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.060
 acquired samsung neighbors 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.500
 this is samsung e840 series 500 gigabyte 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.109
 up why 500 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.490
 scare or 500 fungus all that I have 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.730
 correctly would stand two systems that is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.730
 first system this system here's mac 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:38.070
 here is the second system of course windows 7 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.610
 With games that's why 500 will repeat that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.440
 mandatory for ssd disk for 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 you are long work for normal 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.789
 long work needs to be left 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.789
 just reserve some place 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.800
 even places in my case example 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:01:03.410
 I have 500 gigabytes means 150 gigabytes 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.410
 i will leave under macos 250 gigabytes i 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.299
 more precisely so 200 gigabytes I can with 250 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.799
 gigabytes under windows and 50 gigabytes 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.869
 simply will not be marked 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.750
 why is this done this is done friends 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.090
 my very simple to more 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.520
 the longer it and the quality is not served here such 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.290
 nasty drive 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.180
 probably nothing supernatural there 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.920
 according to the external characteristics but no 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 characteristics of speed he really 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.079
 business in general within the highly praised thread 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.170
 ssd drives and further pick up there 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.299
 our guru leonid is my coauthor to 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.790
 channels, he'll tell you why after all 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.880
 remove from disk 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.159
 because I'm not really a super expert 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.770
 was and am probably this moment 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.960
 I will tell you honestly I will take see 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 subscribers and here waste paper is understandable 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.590
 The thing here is cool 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.940
 small but nice 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.280
 more about this wound driver from us 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.140
 I understand yes, the sauce is to play properly 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.390
 saying this ssd choosing three 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.550
 systems in more detail about the characteristics 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.110
 his tests are of course indicated and about 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.040
 Iâ€™ll tell you the choice argument 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.040
 later bye
