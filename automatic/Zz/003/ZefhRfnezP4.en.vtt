00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.320
 now I found that one no beacon is 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.079
 say it 's another video depliant 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.989
 they are watching is a gameplay in the 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.700
 xbox one open xbox anatel until then 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.070
 at the time you are recording 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.010
 not will be lighter then take 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.829
 male is the 28th lip in this effort not 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.809
 I was on the same 28 same lake rca 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.420
 I do not remember cetanp that was using such 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.739
 r sound free program here because I do not 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.500
 I had released everything I wanted yet 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.300
 for her but I even included some kills 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.880
 for those who were still getting used to 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.350
 the control that I realized something that 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.750
 was an adult also realized that the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.480
 control of the xbox zone is much worse than 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.120
 I control the ps4 I think the look 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.899
 and the precision of the ps4 control is very 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.219
 That's the biggest analog type so I'm 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.590
 had used an example is that of the 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.210
 used that is concave and the convex of hair 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.670
 My brother can not explain. 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.329
 but the xbox control looks like a field 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.340
 convex of how strange it was 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:19.840
 when you pick up a store with a little 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.819
 better but anyway is the subject of the video 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.920
 today to talk about the tech mix and 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.689
 because what is more worth using what 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.090
 it's worth getting out of here because 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.389
 as you may already know the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.159
 pib system of this back then you 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:35.819
 you can fill your gun with a test 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.840
 Mind, you can move the park. 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.819
 but I'm not seeing many 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.920
 advantages in some things here I go 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.979
 Talk about you 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.200
 every thing I think worth even 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.499
 pity in different situations and everything else 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.469
 and the first one is I'll start with the 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:56.259
 pigs pecs theoretically they are a 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:00.069
 thing to help your character 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:03.150
 to you then like for example the west 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.130
 boy is the flock jec 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.470
 it's a shock since it will help you 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.540
 survive the mexico grenade goes 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.120
 will help you take less time to 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.790
 the great ones being the practices 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.700
 another example close had to sleep 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.250
 faster after the post lamb 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.210
 that helps to catch punishment of the dead 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.640
 and so are are things that I 'm going to take 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.480
 an example that kind of gives power in the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.410
 game 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.270
 take advantage of the game itself 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.459
 but even times are things that you 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.290
 places on your weapon such as a 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.170
 red dot we can ban the best 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.240
 eckstein mega process has more ammo 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.150
 It's stock for you, it's how z is for you. 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.180
 but to dance to the court in the emirate you have 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.490
 better movement along with a 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.920
 mega flash gaze for you to carry 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.380
 faster in this code code than he 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.800
 leaves the team two things to the same 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.180
 time that theoretically one of the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.670
 other nobel 2 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.200
 so this is you can pass without being 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.750
 long cress 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.880
 I hate being always tell the agency but 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.040
 You can do this, you should not always 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.530
 three world but this small and 93 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.019
 I changed nothing but the last code only 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.260
 Do not even leave it, we're 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.150
 finalizing a lot and I think it's right for 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.310
 example how do you use extend megs 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.580
 and fast megas that had not like you 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.989
 do this in the bbb 11 thousand euros per 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.180
 example you had no way to use these 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.870
 two technicians at the same time of this size 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.360
 has 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.790
 and another great thing about this 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.150
 code is that you can fill your art 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.760
 How did I notice your service area? 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.600
 as for example is you can use a 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.780
 Optical 11 up to optical 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.400
 the album is great an optical answer 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.989
 such as red dot reflex and among others 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.799
 media 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.269
 the reflexes of a thing are among others 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.820
 things you have the option to place 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:10.340
 two more teams without using any 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.900
 is the court which is the room that is 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.810
 difficult that leaves you both the banks 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.230
 which leaves used more than one thesis where 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.020
 you can use up 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.910
 3 the wild cards technical day of thing that 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:27.820
 you could not in the black ops 242 you 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.410
 I had 27 months to put this you 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.060
 uses his meat you could put 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.730
 one more that we could not give another 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.620
 technically the meat is not even 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.490
 You can, so I'll keep mine. 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.660
 Weapon up to 6 until we have no more left 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.880
 nothing and it's at least in my seven years 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:50.260
 lately I've been putting three up 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:55.570
 Normal times and but leave in the winter 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:58.050
 technical training of four more pecs 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.180
 I think that's it 3 7 -4 per executor 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.780
 preferring to use more without class than I 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.370
 I prefer to use 4 up to times and two parks 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.900
 it's what's left over 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.030
 The bank that I see is more 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.130
 essential at least for me who likes 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.840
 to run off like crazy is fast 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.730
 hands because god why enough 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.470
 because like the one that happened in a crazy I 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.240
 I'm going to face many people who have already 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.970
 I was prepared and I'm going to have the 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.980
 to get better faster is 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.080
 I can run along with the technician I 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.900
 I really like is the pedro then there is 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.750
 practically instantaneous my taste 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:36.520
 enough to use all that is 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.500
 benefit to run to pull and good valley 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.330
 even worth the more mexico country until 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.590
 teams come a lot for their style of play 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.110
 only that code at least one 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.170
 feeling that it is a code that he 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.820
 It needs a lot that you have until times 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:53.140
 because the big sites they are very 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:56.380
 very important yours I have not seen the 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.840
 parks as the very strong pilots 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.660
 it is necessary to use it in my 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.310
 opinion the fast yields and only I go 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.860
 use writes and when to free 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.590
 because I like August three clicks 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.380
 then they want money from a park that 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.060
 for who spends a lot of bullet for those who have 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.590
 spirit too high not to need 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.050
 get pick up gun from the ground will you 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.250
 take the suit yourself manning no 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.900
 had nothing else went wrong but I think 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.340
 it's worth it to fill your gun with 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.440
 technically than burke- filled 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.889
 because you will get more advantage in the one 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:35.400
 v 1 than in type map move 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.530
 c I 'm using more flec since 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.510
 tite with mesc because I think 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.010
 tactical grenades and normal grenades 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:46.020
 also out of this game 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.340
 the stock since this is the mesc but who 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.320
 says general carmem up to because I am 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.840
 using this type of attack but I 'm 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:58.560
 liking to use the fast megas flu 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.540
 touch and extreme nesson the seven months that 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.370
 I'm using it but I hope 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.840
 I liked this video now I am 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.580
 They are going to stay here if you 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.350
 like do not leave a like left mine 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.300
 you comment on whether you are 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.740
 using enough technicians you are the 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.780
 stronger 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.360
 I will stop here worth talked to 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.729
 and it was worth remembering also that 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.180
 vote distributing open codes today 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.770
 As soon as this video comes out I think 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.780
 in half an hour after I heard that this 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.850
 video came back betting open codes 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.370
 on twitter then follow me at 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.370
 dsk in check the description links went
