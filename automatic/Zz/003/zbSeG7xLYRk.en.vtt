00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.869
 han jackie has for tablet we blog.de 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.769
 are grad on the roof of the hotel de rome 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.270
 in Berlin 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.430
 and we see here among others the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.710
 fernsehturm such a beautiful dome on 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.270
 in any case , asus has a nice location 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.369
 selected even if my construction site 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.640
 take us but have something more interesting 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.160
 is the new asus moped hd8 that is 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.410
 everything imaginable here is likely to sacrifice 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.480
 christmas still appear so it is 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.670
 a slightly larger version than the asus 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.950
 eee pad hd7 that would have been tested 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.789
 you should have tablet blog 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.760
 call de 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:47.230
 we now have an 80 inch display 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.410
 The resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.660
 in here now praises a 1.2 ghz 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.090
 mediatek processor as at the seven 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.730
 inch model but a 1 6 ghz 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.590
 quad-core processor which exactly 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.649
 it does not say it but we go away 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.600
 that 's the one of roxette's with 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.579
 There are also a gigabyte ram and 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.740
 16GB flash memory 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.600
 Let's go around the device very quickly 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.670
 around we have up here a 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.870
 front camera 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.280
 Otherwise we have nothing else up to 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.820
 the display 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.010
 We do not have anything down here either 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.550
 then here comes a seesaw for the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.740
 volume of the power button 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.290
 we have the headset on or output 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.410
 a microphone probably be here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.750
 micro usb connection on the side have 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.150
 a micro sd card slot like those 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.100
 the memory can be extended 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.020
 There is a camera on the back 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.900
 I assume that with 5 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.430
 megapixel dissolves nothing else 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.620
 except the speakers down here 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.170
 So they are just like the e moped 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.930
 hd7 mounted on it now runs 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.310
 android 4.2.2010 asus has the surface 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.860
 only minimally adjusted 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.420
 this is especially important for this quick 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.370
 settings up there we are so under 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.670
 standard android do not have it as well 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.760
 There are very different directly to the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.940
 audio settings and so on 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.530
 otherwise on the moped hd7 to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.750
 Standard has been developed are these 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.840
 mini apps with that is a bit 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.950
 limited multitasking possible 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.850
 So can a browser 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.130
 Calculator one some other apps 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.010
 open and then on the homescreen or 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.599
 use other apps 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.459
 Let's start the calculator 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.569
 the seven meters here is the same 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.370
 then for the browser 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.720
 you can push that back and forth and 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.689
 if you for example a youtube 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.030
 video looks and the ball what google 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.360
 you can already do that 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.599
 do it at the same time 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.780
 that works quite well yes that 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.790
 is the asus eee pad hd7 makes one 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.269
 good impression we still know a price 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.299
 not that with petra the 749 euro this 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.099
 hd8 I assume that it is about the 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.510
 179 180 euros in any case but under 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.000
 200 euros will cost 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.659
 Thanks a lot for tablet blog.de 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.659
