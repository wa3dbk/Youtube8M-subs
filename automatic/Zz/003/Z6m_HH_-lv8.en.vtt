improvement over windows built in tool

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.610 
improvement over windows built in tool
is<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.390> puts<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:39.870> those<00:00:40.110> processes

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
is that it puts all those processes

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
is that it puts all those processes
together<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> tree<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.120> if<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
together in a tree so if you have a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.729 
together in a tree so if you have a
program<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.230> running<00:00:43.410> multiple

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739

processes<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.640> example<00:00:45.090> chrome<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.079> see

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
processes for example chrome you can see

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.229
