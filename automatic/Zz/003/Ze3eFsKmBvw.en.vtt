00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello everyone a single walk a crappy goal what do I want to represent 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.639
 a gameboy pocket emulator for a doubled that's done 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 to be convinced from 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.949
 the xbox live redon if you do not ask how we do to launch 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.650
 a silverlight app from 5 men 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.650
 it's simple 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.189
 This is an application for the classic panorama so we have a list 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.180
 at the top of the favorite game 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.380
 good eh 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.180
 all these remedies in play owns% and the list of actions that we can 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.970
 perform a hideout you can search added a tasteless game everything is not 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.830
 a plan that is at stake not hiding 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.480
 there we can launch 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.850
 the game 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.350
 that we believe that we played cannes 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.290
 we win 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.470
 hermes we end up with ifi super mario land believe that an excellent day 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.000
 on it must attack what we see in fact is that it goes very fast 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.709
 at the screen level so 

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:05.539
 the engine as such the gameboy not necessarily very powerful is 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.069
 something I wrote years ago a girl still fit a little bit and 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.120
 then 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.680
 I do not necessarily have% 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.210
 so made evolve as soon as I knew I think it's not the case 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.190
 not very serious but what really matters here is that it's really a 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.170
 place the speed in front of which the elite and hide it 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.610
 for those who actually use a new technique 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.830
 for precisely having this speed of action and then at the same time having a 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.880
 side at saint-pascal for serge van der hoeven so the group had to 60 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.939
 frames per second 6 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.530
 in vain 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.380
 - I show you a little bit 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 in the game 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.760
 so day by day I will talk about it on fire in a future life 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 between chamakh 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.910
 today we will not go 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.970
 earlier 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.960
 an emulator so here I go I'm really live for you can 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.780
 see the brakes any more than on an emulator did not always stop 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.969
 pressing men they realize the speed 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.979
 just that 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.229
 a year ago that the speed and 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.229
 it's exactly the same as what we like 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.099
 oulala I think on Tuesday the possibilities to add it 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.640
 the two engines what he wants 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.920
 the same source 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.360
 super nanny on it 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.829
 very clearly 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.729
 so I think the big door to what is waiting for you is precisely that of 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:35.599
 tip 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.920
 and be able to select from a silverlight panorama any 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.659
 attic 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.150
 rather than going through itunes where it's going to have to be created and 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.809
 completely a 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.979
 a graphical interface 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:51.489
 so that was it% emulator gameboy pocket that by his next mother 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.389
 for a block analyze at the point fr
