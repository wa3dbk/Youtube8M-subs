00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello dear Nathalie come directly from 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.049
 training and I'm really hungry now 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.160
 and that's why I have none with me 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.679
 we thought we'll show you ours today 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.710
 Oven potatoes on turkey breast with whole 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.600
 delicious fresh tomatoes and 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.189
 tomato paste as the whole thing looks like 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.789
 you need to show it to me now 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.180
 times 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.670
 we have sweet potatoes here once 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.789
 are totally healthy and then we have 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.820
 here next to still normal potatoes and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.000
 we really have hunger 600 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.059
 gram turkey breast and here you can still see 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.030
 fresh tomatoes we take and we 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.820
 have also finely chopped tomatoes 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.180
 but for that we need really good oils 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.860
 We always have a nice one here 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.070
 olive oil for you spices we take 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.050
 but and indeed - do not salt any 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.620
 but his quality 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.989
 then you still need pepper and you 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.519
 all you need is potatoes 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.700
 well, a little bit is still in it 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.229
 rosmarie but that fresh binding 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 here's less cuts 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.670
 Go faster and have the sweet potatoes 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.080
 the peeled the normal potatoes 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.409
 not peeled you do not need 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.119
 stand 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.939
 they all come now for the first time in a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:31.140
 pot or a bowl because he still man 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:34.530
 less total oil 12 to after 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.270
 eye just now two tablespoon 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.640
 water about 1 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.820
 now the herbs are enough in size 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.890
 to stir unattractive salt is now 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.509
 coarse grained is better you 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.060
 can also do the coarse grained directly 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:01.979
 take it out no matter 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:05.850
 just a little body that covered everything 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.660
 please circulate the oven and then 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.510
 to 150 degrees only once Preheat as five 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.400
 up to a maximum of ten minutes and there you can 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.560
 even the potatoes I take 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.209
 always grow here , otherwise I have to 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.849
 yes, everything here again and again clean 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.890
 and that's how I save a lot of work 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.730
 and then I might as well have 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.900
 The potato all start over here too 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.900
 give with the 11th 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.040
 good day 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:45.489
 Just look that pieces about 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:49.049
 are the same size that you can now for 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.599
 Approximately 30 to 40 minutes at 150 occupations 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.639
 natalie shut up god we will 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.010
 marinate our meat now 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.849
 we need ours again for that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.569
 olive oil not 4000 bit evenly 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.000
 not too much on all pieces 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.889
 depending on how one tolerates the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.269
 like one's rather a bit sharper 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.269
 the other one is not 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:22.409
 that is already going well and stops 600 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:44.590
 That's why I think so, too 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:46.209
 I have to be able to talk over again though 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.359
 still a little bit could still do 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.349
 the oven 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.489
 right now we are doing the meat 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.540
 finished and then I open the stove 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.540
 level 5 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.069
 that is so middle heat and with me 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.400
 Just leave it that way for a while 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.220
 get warm when the pot is warm 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.509
 you then start your meat 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.849
 insert here 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:12.430
 Well then we start with our tomatoes 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.370
 I now have four meat tomatoes here 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.250
 nice to cut small the smaller 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.880
 the better I always find it but that 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.210
 you can decide for yourself 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.389
 that now 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.389
 13 minutes each one access 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.750
 Yes 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.160
 okay then it is very important we have 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.020
 now the relatively seared 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.440
 then you have to wait for that 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.990
 do you have to do the format so short 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.180
 wait because if you otherwise the tomatoes 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.880
 clean then your whole bude is here 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.650
 Red and investors clean and do everything 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.320
 hurt on the skin when it burns and yours 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.860
 All beautiful sports tops are all for 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.690
 the cat 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.590
 so take a short break and now you can 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.590
 make tomatoes rhyme 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.430
 Stir well next summer and 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.550
 Just steam a little further 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.080
 can also leave a bit 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.430
 Tomato paste are still water wanting 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.910
 and the heat definitely down here 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.690
 so to 1 to 2 around the distance is now 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.690
 just a little bit more 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:44.419
 that always looks good and is done 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:47.180
