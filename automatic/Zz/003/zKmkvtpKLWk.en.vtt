00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 It's been 8 years now, and today 's a player is better than I thought. 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:29.130
 That's a lot of little weak Champ Wins 100 Yard me get a lot of back space 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.850
 I do not think so. 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.780
 Sounds like 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.710
 I put some pre-harvest honey in it. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.020
 Also a mistake 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 And I have yet to yeokjeongol mistake it fell a little higher in enduring the frankly 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.839
 In order to save the mountains and the fields , 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.260
 Uh situation a player get shot if I get around such central defense to cross 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:57.360
 But I was a little weak in the bowl and I played the game with a cross-oriented approach. 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.070
 Boil strange that deoraguyo Drogba and Zlatan head anmat well that day d 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.589

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.970
 It looks like Pearl s found a shot in the shoot .

 The heart that I had at that time was about a second. 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.010
 Torres scored his goal at the end, but he was really lucky . 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.970
 Equal 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.540
 This is a personal-to-person game that seems to play a little psychological burden 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.290
 It was a little big. 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.820
