independence<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.160> that<00:00:34.579> was<00:00:34.790> really

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
independence and that was really

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.470 
independence and that was really

think<00:03:50.030> that<00:03:50.510> blind<00:03:50.989> people<00:03:51.109> would<00:03:51.980> be<00:03:52.160> doing

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
think that blind people would be doing

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.250 
think that blind people would be doing
what<00:03:52.849> we<00:03:52.940> did<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.329> 1800<00:03:53.959> it's<00:03:54.079> just

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
what we did in the 1800 it's just

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.470 
what we did in the 1800 it's just
sitting<00:03:54.739> in<00:03:54.859> a<00:03:54.890> room<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.609> know<00:03:55.640> doing<00:03:56.120> nothing

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
sitting in a room you know doing nothing

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.319 
sitting in a room you know doing nothing
which<00:03:56.660> would<00:03:57.440> be<00:03:57.560> really<00:03:57.829> sad<00:04:00.340> on<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.400> guide<00:04:02.060> dog

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
which would be really sad on a guide dog

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.080 
which would be really sad on a guide dog
when<00:04:02.690> I'm<00:04:02.840> older
