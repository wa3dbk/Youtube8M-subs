00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.290
 first of all thank the 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:12.860
 directive this chance for me this is 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.540
 very important I think this is the challenge 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.580
 more important that I have my career 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 I think we are prepared together with the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.560
 technical body to assume them and the only thing 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.020
 what we have left is to work think 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.759
 exclusively in developing a better 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.980
 game for chivas to have the 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.739
 prominence that your hobby deserves that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 is the part that occupies me the truth that 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.070
 I am very happy and very grateful with 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.050
 the directive that came at a time in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.940
 a great moment and in a moment that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.059
 I have many possibilities to be able 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.329
 make a good campaign with a squad 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.770
 that is well-formed with players 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.840
 important and that have been champions in 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.210
 other opportunities with young people who 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.980
 they come very well and with the commitment of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.860
 that are going to be incorporated into this game is 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.620
 important I know the numbers well 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.250
 I know about the problem but I trust 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 fully in that we're going to do two very 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.460
 good league tournaments and two very good 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.370
 glasses and surely the only thing that we 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.560
 occupies is to work so that the development 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.870
 of the team so that the form of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.430
 manifest among the field is in agreement 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.040
 with being closer to reach the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.250
 results I fully trust I understand your 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.660
 perspective mine is different and I think 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.880
 that we have the ability to work 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.870
 in the short we will work all 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.830
 united with penetrated in developing a 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.560
 team that is representative of the club 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.650
 of the club that he has to wear the shirt 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.150
 Chiva is not going to be for anyone going to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.790
 have to work a lot 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.820
 permanent demand on our part 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.550
 will always be and independently 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.310
 of what are the numbers that I know 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.200
 be here we look for a team totally 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 protagonist that can be paid against 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.210
 any opponent and in any court is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.930
 the best way with what your 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420
 history 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.130
 that is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.590
 precisely that the challenge that I 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.259
 spoke at the beginning 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.290
 I'm aware of that part I think that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.940
 we have the capacity to do it and 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.680
 obviously that is not only the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.290
 technical body that comes to join a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.120
 structure that is already blended and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.840
 I think we all owe it to each other 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.840
 get ahead
