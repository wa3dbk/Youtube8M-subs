00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.900
 some guys have not committed suicide 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.470
 we know if they were is though they were 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 gay but they were labeled with a finger 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.490
 pointed to how fags I remember one 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.359
 time a TV presenter 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 he phoned me but I would like to be a star 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.559
 the lady does not worry we obscure her 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.140
 I took it wrong we took it 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.730
 seriously serious doctor like me 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.899
 obscure what obscure Chinese bags thing 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.460
 100 schools of what I should 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.239
 shame on me, my son is beautiful 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.879
 person 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.850
 what is the brakes no one comes to you 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.190
 to say no I have it with you because you are gay 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.980
 I ask with themes that are lesbian because 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.560
 it's because you suck me because 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.990
 you do n't have to 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.600
 left we have reached a level 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.580
 so people may think so but not 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.870
 he says it more because he is not politically 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.210
 correct 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.620
 the fact that I was not a homosexual from 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:16.150
 one part made me very careful not to 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.480
 feels old to learn to listen and 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.380
 on the other hand, I felt that I didn't 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.700
 I could keep quiet about defending rights 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.130
 the struggle for rights is not us 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.280
 equal to the others and we must varese yes 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.550
 reiterated other notes we must have 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.720
 the same rights because we are like 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.860
 we are ultimately the problems we have 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.080
 had some problems they said 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.080
 that is, if the wing slept, sarah had 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.960
 eaten if he had done the job 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.360
 there is a strong difference between what 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.210
 the collective imagination and that that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.010
 which is the person the real person 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.110
 I talked about it in the family right away 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.580
 because I can't keep hidden 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.920
 things so I wanted to be right away 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.260
 sincere this has created problems 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.979
 however I have decided to face anyway 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.910
 my feeling to the end because 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.190
 I realized 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.580
 and in these my studies they also have me 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.580
 helped a lot 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.900
 the pain he sometimes felt because he is 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.110
 a little I didn't understand a bit of course 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.599
 family against some who has 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.599
 sentimentally engaged therefore not 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.520
 could not devote himself to me in the way 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.290
 which I wished I did 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.210
 but obviously this hurts me 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.920
 I realized that it made me feel alive 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.920
 who was what I had to do
