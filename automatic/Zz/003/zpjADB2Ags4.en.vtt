basically allows you to create an IP SW
that<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:48.840> cause<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> device<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.680> enter<00:00:49.920> DFU

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that will cause the device to enter DFU

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.910 
that will cause the device to enter DFU
mode<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.030> end<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> restore<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
mode at the end of the restore so that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.760 
mode at the end of the restore so that
you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.250> perform<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.879> jailbreak<00:00:54.840> once<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you can perform a jailbreak once the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.380 
you can perform a jailbreak once the
restore<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.190> complete<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.120> simple

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
restore is complete it's really simple

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.299 
restore is complete it's really simple
really<00:00:57.750> straightforward<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.129> works

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
really straightforward and it works

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.799 
really straightforward and it works
really<00:00:59.730> well<00:00:59.879> let<00:01:00.270> me<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.480> tell<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.690> that

special<00:01:17.490> firmware<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.970> needed<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.780> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
special firmware is needed to do this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.359 
special firmware is needed to do this
all<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.890> create<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.159> custom

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
all it's going to do is create a custom

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.580 
all it's going to do is create a custom

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.370 
firmware that allows you to enter DFU
mode<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.700> find<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.360> firmware<00:01:24.750> file<00:01:25.140> for

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
mode so let's find our firmware file for

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.990 
mode so let's find our firmware file for
our<00:01:25.409> iPod<00:01:25.830> touch<00:01:26.130> let's<00:01:26.400> go<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.580> our<00:01:26.759> firmware

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
our iPod touch let's go to our firmware

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.690 
our iPod touch let's go to our firmware
folder<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:28.560> should<00:01:28.710> choose<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> iPod

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.710 
touch to there there we go there's the
5.1.1<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.579> Apple<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.150> signing<00:01:33.600> that

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
5.1.1 we know Apple is signing that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.420 
5.1.1 we know Apple is signing that
firmware<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.259> I'll<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.470> open<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
firmware so I'll just open that and you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.179 
firmware so I'll just open that and you
can<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:35.850> creating<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.360> DFU<00:01:36.840> mode<00:01:37.040> IPSW<00:01:38.040> so

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
can see it's creating a DFU mode IPSW so

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
can see it's creating a DFU mode IPSW so
it's<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.610> normal<00:01:39.030> eye<00:01:39.150> PSW<00:01:39.750> file<00:01:39.990> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
it's just a normal eye PSW file that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.140 
it's just a normal eye PSW file that
will<00:01:40.770> place<00:01:41.009> your<00:01:41.159> device<00:01:41.280> into<00:01:41.729> DFU<00:01:42.000> mode

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
will place your device into DFU mode

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.300 
will place your device into DFU mode
once<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.810> restore<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.200> complete<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.860> it's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
once the restore is complete so it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.039 
once the restore is complete so it's
created<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> tells<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> location<00:01:45.509> it's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
created it tells you the location it's

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
created it tells you the location it's
the<00:01:46.170> same<00:01:46.350> location<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> original

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the same location that the original

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
the same location that the original
firmware<00:01:48.509> file<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> first<00:01:49.770> place

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
firmware file was in in the first place

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.190 
firmware file was in in the first place
so<00:01:50.280> let's<00:01:50.729> open<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:51.119> iTunes<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.840> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> hold
