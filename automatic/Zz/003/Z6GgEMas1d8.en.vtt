00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
of a style review because we're looking

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.650 
of a style review because we're looking
at<00:00:25.289> an<00:00:25.350> app<00:00:25.470> called<00:00:25.680> g<00:00:25.980> text<00:00:26.369> media<00:00:26.640> which<00:00:27.539> you

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
at an app called g text media which you

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.540 
at an app called g text media which you
can<00:00:27.810> see<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:27.990> there<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.560> my<00:00:28.680> home<00:00:28.859> screen<00:00:28.890> so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
can see right there on my home screen so

can see right there on my home screen so
uh<00:00:29.580> yeah<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> guess<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.779> best<00:00:30.929> way<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.260> this

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
uh yeah I guess the best way to do this

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
uh yeah I guess the best way to do this
would<00:00:31.439> be<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> show<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.160> guys<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.640> this

thing<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:34.260> worth<00:00:34.440> noting<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.920> off

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
thing is and it's worth noting right off

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.830

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
this and get straight into it so here's

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.130 
this and get straight into it so here's
the<00:01:02.039> app<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> take<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> bit<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the app and it's going to take a bit of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.509 
the app and it's going to take a bit of
explaining<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.339> cool

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
explaining but it's a really cool

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.469 
explaining but it's a really cool
concept<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.360> G<00:01:06.510> text<00:01:06.810> media<00:01:06.960> has<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.500> offer

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
concept what G text media has to offer

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.969 
concept what G text media has to offer
essentially<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.080> idea<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.560> when<00:01:10.890> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
essentially the idea is that when you

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
essentially the idea is that when you
send<00:01:11.250> text<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.299> friends<00:01:12.750> or<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
send text to your friends or to your you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.100 
send text to your friends or to your you
know<00:01:13.590> employer<00:01:13.950> employers<00:01:14.729> are<00:01:15.030> no<00:01:15.689> strangers

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
know employer employers are no strangers

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
know employer employers are no strangers
on<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.259> street<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.830> know<00:01:17.159> you're<00:01:17.610> just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
on the street you know you're just

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.950 
on the street you know you're just
sending<00:01:18.000> them<00:01:18.180> whatever<00:01:18.330> information<00:01:18.659> you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
sending them whatever information you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560 
sending them whatever information you
happen<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.439> type<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> same<00:01:21.270> time

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
happen to type in so at the same time

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.859 
happen to type in so at the same time
why<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.049> attach<00:01:22.799> say<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.909> add<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.450> text

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
why not attach say and add to your text

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
why not attach say and add to your text
and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.680> someone<00:01:25.920> happens<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.400> click<00:01:26.729> on

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
and then if someone happens to click on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.270 
and then if someone happens to click on
that<00:01:27.090> ad<00:01:27.330> then<00:01:28.020> thereby<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> should<00:01:29.130> probably

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
that ad then thereby you should probably

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.100 
that ad then thereby you should probably
get<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> commission<00:01:30.030> right<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> let

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
get a commission right and then I let

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
the way it goes and then it tracks it

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.450 
the way it goes and then it tracks it
itself<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:03.470> at<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.800> end<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:04.039> day<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.250> know

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
itself so at the end of the day you know

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.040 
itself so at the end of the day you know
there's<00:05:04.850> not<00:05:04.970> much<00:05:05.150> load<00:05:05.389> on<00:05:05.539> you<00:05:05.720> as<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.020> user

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
there's not much load on you as the user

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.980 
there's not much load on you as the user
which<00:05:06.830> is<00:05:06.979> great<00:05:07.220> because<00:05:07.460> you<00:05:07.789> know<00:05:07.910> they<00:05:08.210> it

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
which is great because you know they it

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.750 
which is great because you know they it
shouldn't<00:05:09.289> be<00:05:09.350> too<00:05:09.470> taxing<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:10.039> do<00:05:10.190> this<00:05:10.340> since

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
shouldn't be too taxing to do this since

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.640 
shouldn't be too taxing to do this since
essentially<00:05:11.510> you<00:05:11.870> know<00:05:11.960> you're<00:05:12.139> offering<00:05:12.560> a

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
service yourself so at the end of the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.659 
service yourself so at the end of the
day<00:05:14.720> gtx<00:05:15.169> media<00:05:15.530> is<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:15.680> nice<00:05:15.979> addition<00:05:16.370> to<00:05:16.580> the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
implementation is great as well except

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.120 
implementation is great as well except
for<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.840> few<00:05:20.870> minor<00:05:21.199> things<00:05:21.350> as<00:05:21.800> far<00:05:22.010> as

mostly just because I said you know

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.070 
mostly just because I said you know
central<00:05:35.000> integration<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:35.720> things<00:05:35.900> like<00:05:36.020> that

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
could be a little bit better but on the

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:39.940 
could be a little bit better but on the
Holy<00:05:38.630> know<00:05:38.870> if<00:05:39.020> that<00:05:39.169> sounds<00:05:39.500> good<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:39.770> go

Holy know if that sounds good you go

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.529 
Holy know if that sounds good you go
ahead<00:05:40.010> and<00:05:40.160> give<00:05:40.280> this<00:05:40.310> a<00:05:40.520> go<00:05:40.700> GTX<00:05:41.150> media<00:05:41.450> is

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
ahead and give this a go GTX media is

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:42.610 
ahead and give this a go GTX media is
free<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:42.020> signing<00:05:42.320> up<00:05:42.380> for<00:05:42.500> an<00:05:42.560> account

free and signing up for an account

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.440

obviously<00:05:43.220> it's<00:05:43.340> free<00:05:43.610> with<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.150> potential
