was the alarm going off when you turn
the<00:01:07.950> key<00:01:08.420> well<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.840> does<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.200> too<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the key well this one does that too and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.090 
the key well this one does that too and
let's<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.500> it'll<00:01:13.500> either<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.979> or

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
let's see if I can it'll either do it or

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.929 
let's see if I can it'll either do it or
it<00:01:14.189> won't<00:01:14.340> look<00:01:15.590> didn't<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.939> sometimes

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it won't look didn't do it sometimes

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.609 
it won't look didn't do it sometimes
when<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> unlock<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.320> starts

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
when you go to unlock it it just starts

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.340 
when you go to unlock it it just starts
honking<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> stuff<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.810> anyway<00:01:22.140> there's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
honking and stuff and anyway there's

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.520 
honking and stuff and anyway there's
something<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> door<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> little

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
something in the door here like a little

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.539 
something in the door here like a little
electrical<00:01:25.530> thing<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> sometimes<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.400> gets

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
electrical thing and sometimes it gets

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539 
electrical thing and sometimes it gets
corroded<00:01:26.780> or<00:01:27.780> wet<00:01:28.229> from<00:01:28.619> water<00:01:28.890> seeping<00:01:29.400> down

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
corroded or wet from water seeping down

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.230 
corroded or wet from water seeping down
in<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.689> 92<00:01:31.200> acura<00:01:31.650> vigor<00:01:31.939> with<00:01:32.939> two

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
in there so it's 92 acura vigor with two

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.880 
in there so it's 92 acura vigor with two
hundred<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.900> sixty<00:01:34.590> five<00:01:34.770> thousand<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.610> it

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
hundred and sixty five thousand on it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.950 
hundred and sixty five thousand on it
and<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.430> been<00:01:38.729> started<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.299> quite<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> while

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and as been started in quite a while

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
and as been started in quite a while
since<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.619> learned<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.979> head<00:01:41.130> gasket<00:01:41.640> had<00:01:41.759> gone

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
since I learned the head gasket had gone

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.199 

but<00:02:46.350> yes<00:02:46.530> in<00:02:46.770> some<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> compression<00:02:47.670> from

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
but yes in some of the compression from

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.380 
but yes in some of the compression from
the<00:02:48.390> engine<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.900> going<00:02:49.910> into<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> cooling

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
the engine is going into the cooling

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.910 
the engine is going into the cooling
system<00:02:51.840> we've<00:02:52.500> got<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.980> hole<00:02:54.920> blowing

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
system we've got the hole blowing

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.440 
system we've got the hole blowing
coolant<00:02:56.310> hose<00:02:56.459> things<00:02:56.850> going<00:02:57.270> on<00:02:59.120> so<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.300> we

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
coolant hose things going on so then we

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.550 
coolant hose things going on so then we
have<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.810> coolant<00:03:01.200> tested<00:03:01.650> for<00:03:03.560> having

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
have the coolant tested for having

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.160 
have the coolant tested for having
hydrocarbons<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.610> which<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> byproduct

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
hydrocarbons in it which is a byproduct

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.920 
hydrocarbons in it which is a byproduct
of<00:03:07.500> combustion<00:03:11.060> see<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.209> can<00:03:12.360> back<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.720> here

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
of combustion see if I can back up here

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.750 
of combustion see if I can back up here
without<00:03:13.140> hitting<00:03:13.350> anything<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:16.640> lot<00:03:17.640> of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.400 

this<00:03:23.130> thing<00:03:23.340> hasn't<00:03:23.550> even<00:03:23.760> been<00:03:23.970> driven<00:03:24.410> at

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
this thing hasn't even been driven at

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.470 
this thing hasn't even been driven at
least<00:03:25.740> a<00:03:25.920> body

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.570

just go take a little cruise around the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:55.420 
just go take a little cruise around the
block<00:03:34.819> with<00:03:35.090> her

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.089 

still<00:03:56.120> chefs<00:03:56.420> good

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.600 

Wow<00:03:59.670> it's<00:04:00.090> really<00:04:00.269> weird

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.590 

I<00:04:04.520> haven't<00:04:05.520> driven<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:05.880> thing<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.240> so<00:04:06.390> long

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
I haven't driven this thing is so long

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.940 
I haven't driven this thing is so long
it<00:04:06.840> feels<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.290> solid<00:04:07.740> sturdy

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
it feels of solid sturdy

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:26.379 
it feels of solid sturdy
forgot<00:04:10.950> how<00:04:10.980> does<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.460> feel

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.230 

it<00:04:27.080> concludes<00:04:27.499> our<00:04:27.680> little<00:04:27.830> tour<00:04:28.819> I<00:04:29.120> guess

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
it concludes our little tour I guess

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:43.580 
it concludes our little tour I guess
stick<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.360> back<00:04:32.509> under<00:04:32.900> its<00:04:33.050> little<00:04:33.490> home<00:04:34.490> here
