 flags and his opponents waving 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.190

 band of restless it was the second half 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 final of the 50 m freestyle a pure 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.070
 sprint events where competitors get 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.420
 start at hundredths

 bousquet najet in power five with to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.160
 his sides the fearsome Brazilian Caesar 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.120
 cielo the 50 m is the kind of test 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.109
 that goes so fast that none of the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.500
 swimmers does not have time to admire the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.329
 landscape 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.330
 you have to be thorough at first and if you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.290
 can say accelerate until the arrival the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.549
 first thing these books do 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.570
 even though they hit the wall it's 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.340
 turn around to look at the painting 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.890
 of display which is first which is 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.119
 eliminated bousquet already recordman of the world 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.869
 of distance is right now the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.100
 shape of the big days 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.990
 he qualified with the best 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.830
 time for the final is it going seconds 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.479
 and 21 hundredths 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.740
 it's a trick to the best account that 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.430
 I've never had a big date 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.380
 you international 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.000
 so for me it is they are 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.020
 positive conscious and before 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 for me I'm pretty much at home 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.040
 perfection frédérick bousquet sharing 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.930
 for seven years his training time 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.270
 between marseille and the united states where the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 americans call it freddy heel it to 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.780
 auburn in alabama and in may 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.680
 last he was going to run a meeting in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.330
 the city of charlotte 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.920
 all this under the eye of the huge michael 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.880
 phelps and his French fiancée 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.010
 manaudou laure 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.150
 short life is beautiful I can take 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.000
 of the decline compared to the day before at 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.229
 the event I also tell myself that I 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.630
 guess below that my life either 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.450
 on this competition is to take 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.740
 bronze medal 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.540
 tomorrow in the final 50 meters we can 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.050
 think that manaudou will be very 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.050
 close to the man
