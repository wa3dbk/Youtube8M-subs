00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
know you set the valve lash was

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.839 
know you set the valve lash was
something<00:00:30.619> or<00:00:30.679> other<00:00:30.800> about<00:00:31.099> you<00:00:31.220> run<00:00:31.429> it<00:00:31.550> in

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
something or other about you run it in

something or other about you run it in
and<00:00:32.180> then<00:00:32.270> turned<00:00:32.630> it<00:00:32.720> so<00:00:32.870> many<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.260> don't<00:00:33.739> know

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
and then turned it so many I don't know

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.689 
and then turned it so many I don't know
what<00:00:33.980> I<00:00:34.010> was<00:00:34.219> thinking<00:00:34.250> I<00:00:36.219> you<00:00:37.219> know<00:00:37.340> opened<00:00:37.640> up

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
what I was thinking I you know opened up

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.700 
what I was thinking I you know opened up
the<00:00:37.820> shop<00:00:37.850> manual<00:00:38.269> the<00:00:38.539> Ford<00:00:38.930> manual<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:39.559> it's

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
the shop manual the Ford manual and it's

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.299 
the shop manual the Ford manual and it's
like<00:00:41.140> you<00:00:42.140> know<00:00:42.230> it<00:00:42.440> made<00:00:42.590> more<00:00:42.769> sense<00:00:42.829> when<00:00:43.280> I

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
like you know it made more sense when I

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.400 
like you know it made more sense when I
read<00:00:43.519> it<00:00:43.670> anyway<00:00:44.510> so<00:00:44.570> that's<00:00:44.870> taken<00:00:45.199> care<00:00:45.230> of

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
read it anyway so that's taken care of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.279 
read it anyway so that's taken care of
they're<00:00:45.590> all<00:00:45.940> they're<00:00:46.940> all<00:00:47.120> set<00:00:50.109> think<00:00:51.109> what

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
they're all they're all set think what

they're all they're all set think what
I'm<00:00:51.379> going<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.559> focus<00:00:51.739> on<00:00:52.070> right<00:00:52.100> now<00:00:52.629> I<00:00:55.359> think

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
I'm going to focus on right now I think

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.720 
I'm going to focus on right now I think
what<00:00:56.539> we're<00:00:56.660> going<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.809> do<00:00:56.929> is<00:00:57.050> just<00:00:57.230> get<00:00:57.350> the

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
what we're going to do is just get the

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.849 
what we're going to do is just get the
intake<00:00:58.730> manifold<00:00:59.149> put<00:00:59.359> on<00:01:02.409> that's<00:01:03.409> about<00:01:03.499> it<00:01:03.829> I

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
intake manifold put on that's about it I

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.040 
intake manifold put on that's about it I
don't<00:01:04.159> know<00:01:04.280> maybe<00:01:04.699> maybe<00:01:05.360> if<00:01:05.480> I<00:01:05.570> get<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.720> wild

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
don't know maybe maybe if I get a wild

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.270 
don't know maybe maybe if I get a wild
here<00:01:06.260> we'll<00:01:06.440> play<00:01:06.650> with<00:01:06.800> that<00:01:06.860> oil<00:01:07.600> pan<00:01:10.420> but

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
here we'll play with that oil pan but

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.170 
here we'll play with that oil pan but
let's<00:01:13.280> just<00:01:13.400> take<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.580> one<00:01:13.760> step<00:01:13.790> at<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.150> time

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
let's just take it one step at a time

00:01:14.180 --> 00:04:58.760 
let's just take it one step at a time
today<00:01:14.800> let's<00:01:15.800> get<00:01:15.890> started

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:14.420 

I<00:05:11.449> think<00:05:12.449> that's<00:05:12.630> enough<00:05:12.870> for<00:05:12.900> today<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.830> got

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
I think that's enough for today I got

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.670 
I think that's enough for today I got
the<00:05:14.520> intake<00:05:14.819> manifold<00:05:15.270> in<00:05:15.620> something<00:05:16.620> to

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
the intake manifold in something to

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.390 
the intake manifold in something to
remember<00:05:16.949> I<00:05:17.430> mean<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.889> I<00:05:19.949> don't<00:05:19.979> claim<00:05:20.250> to<00:05:20.310> be

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
remember I mean and I don't claim to be

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.520 
remember I mean and I don't claim to be
an<00:05:20.550> expert<00:05:20.610> on<00:05:20.910> engine<00:05:21.660> building<00:05:21.930> I<00:05:22.050> mean<00:05:22.440> I

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
an expert on engine building I mean I

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.890 
an expert on engine building I mean I
already<00:05:22.770> made<00:05:22.919> one<00:05:23.419> goofball<00:05:24.419> thing

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
already made one goofball thing

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.559 
already made one goofball thing
one<00:05:25.500> goofball<00:05:25.919> mistake<00:05:26.280> with<00:05:26.520> talking<00:05:27.419> about

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
one goofball mistake with talking about

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.020 
one goofball mistake with talking about
how<00:05:27.660> to<00:05:27.720> set<00:05:28.110> these<00:05:28.349> things<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:28.979> when<00:05:29.849> you<00:05:29.910> go

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
how to set these things and when you go

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.790 
how to set these things and when you go
to<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.210> book<00:05:30.419> it's<00:05:30.599> come<00:05:30.800> completely

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
to the book it's come completely

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.110 
to the book it's come completely
different<00:05:32.280> but<00:05:32.460> anyways<00:05:34.550> on<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.610> lot<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.030> these

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
different but anyways on a lot of these

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.980 
different but anyways on a lot of these
gaskets<00:05:36.630> like<00:05:36.780> I<00:05:36.960> don't<00:05:37.199> know<00:05:37.259> you<00:05:37.349> I<00:05:37.800> have<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.430> I

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
gaskets like I don't know you I have I I

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.140 
gaskets like I don't know you I have I I
torque<00:05:39.990> these<00:05:40.430> you<00:05:41.430> go<00:05:41.550> through<00:05:41.789> you<00:05:41.940> torque

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
torque these you go through you torque

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.279 
torque these you go through you torque
them<00:05:42.270> again<00:05:42.509> till<00:05:42.720> you<00:05:42.750> go<00:05:42.900> through<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.139> torque

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
them again till you go through to torque

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.050 
them again till you go through to torque
them<00:05:43.380> again<00:05:43.620> because<00:05:43.830> what<00:05:43.979> happens<00:05:44.280> is<00:05:44.430> this

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
them again because what happens is this

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.499 
them again because what happens is this
gasket<00:05:45.360> continues<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.169> crush<00:05:46.470> and<00:05:47.300> it<00:05:48.300> won't

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
gasket continues to crush and it won't

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.300 
gasket continues to crush and it won't
seal<00:05:48.810> until<00:05:49.199> it's<00:05:49.349> completely<00:05:49.680> crushed<00:05:50.039> so

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
seal until it's completely crushed so

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.409 
seal until it's completely crushed so
you<00:05:50.370> just<00:05:50.550> got<00:05:50.699> to<00:05:50.729> keep<00:05:50.909> working<00:05:51.150> on<00:05:51.330> that

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
you just got to keep working on that

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.180 
you just got to keep working on that
don't<00:05:51.780> don't<00:05:51.990> don't<00:05:52.409> just<00:05:52.530> tighten<00:05:52.949> the<00:05:53.009> bolt

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
don't don't don't just tighten the bolt

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.589 
don't don't don't just tighten the bolt
and<00:05:53.370> walk<00:05:53.580> off<00:05:53.789> and<00:05:53.940> figure<00:05:54.120> it's<00:05:54.270> tightened

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
and walk off and figure it's tightened

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:00.620 
and walk off and figure it's tightened
go<00:05:55.470> back<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:55.889> check<00:05:56.069> it<00:05:57.590> next<00:05:58.590> time<00:05:59.120> I<00:06:00.120> don't

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
go back and check it next time I don't

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.749 
go back and check it next time I don't
know<00:06:01.940> one<00:06:02.940> thing<00:06:03.150> I<00:06:03.240> need<00:06:03.389> to<00:06:03.479> do<00:06:03.630> is<00:06:03.750> talk<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.020> I

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
know one thing I need to do is talk to I

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.920 
know one thing I need to do is talk to I
mean<00:06:05.759> this<00:06:05.849> is<00:06:06.000> my<00:06:06.150> wife's<00:06:06.360> car<00:06:06.479> I<00:06:06.659> need<00:06:06.870> to

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
far as color we made I think I probably

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.430 
far as color we made I think I probably
should<00:06:12.000> go<00:06:12.090> ahead<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.300> paint<00:06:12.509> get<00:06:13.080> it<00:06:13.199> prepped

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
should go ahead and paint get it prepped

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.870 
should go ahead and paint get it prepped
and<00:06:13.650> get<00:06:13.770> it<00:06:13.860> painted<00:06:13.979> for<00:06:14.370> put<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.610> timing

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
and get it painted for put the timing

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.390 
and get it painted for put the timing
cover<00:06:15.030> on<00:06:18.080> needed<00:06:19.080> aside<00:06:19.380> I<00:06:19.680> mean<00:06:20.009> she<00:06:20.159> wanted

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400

anyways I think that's it for today and

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.980 
anyways I think that's it for today and
so<00:07:08.430> what<00:07:08.550> we<00:07:08.669> do<00:07:08.789> we<00:07:08.940> got<00:07:09.089> the<00:07:09.240> intake<00:07:09.539> manifold

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
so what we do we got the intake manifold

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.020 
so what we do we got the intake manifold
on<00:07:10.169> and<00:07:10.589> the<00:07:11.099> oil<00:07:11.460> pump

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030
