out thank goodness so this one might

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.630 
out thank goodness so this one might
very<00:02:08.560> well<00:02:08.619> be<00:02:08.769> another<00:02:08.979> one<00:02:11.099> he<00:02:12.099> might<00:02:12.310> be<00:02:12.459> or

very well be another one he might be or

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.699 
very well be another one he might be or
it<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.850> be<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.970> catfish<00:02:13.359> he's<00:02:13.540> moving<00:02:13.930> like<00:02:14.500> one

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
it can be a catfish he's moving like one

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.680 
it can be a catfish he's moving like one
of<00:02:14.739> these<00:02:14.890> extra<00:02:15.760> special<00:02:16.150> fish<00:02:16.329> not<00:02:16.510> like<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
of these extra special fish not like a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.569 
of these extra special fish not like a
decoy<00:02:19.470> I've<00:02:20.470> shown<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.799> my<00:02:20.859> other<00:02:21.010> videos<00:02:21.340> how

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
decoy I've shown in my other videos how

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.280 
decoy I've shown in my other videos how
house<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.510> good<00:02:22.690> fish<00:02:22.930> move<00:02:23.109> differently

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
house the good fish move differently

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.710 
house the good fish move differently
from<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> trash<00:02:24.010> fish<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.609> this<00:02:25.480> guy<00:02:25.690> is

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
from the trash fish and this guy is

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.880 
from the trash fish and this guy is
moving<00:02:25.989> just<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:27.069> let's<00:02:27.310> see<00:02:28.890> flip

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
moving just like that so let's see flip

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.370 
moving just like that so let's see flip
it<00:02:30.069> flip<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.569> he's<00:02:31.569> pulling<00:02:31.930> an<00:02:31.989> awful<00:02:32.260> lot

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
it flip it he's pulling an awful lot

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.610 
it flip it he's pulling an awful lot
though<00:02:33.900> it'll<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:34.989> interesting<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:35.410> see<00:02:35.500> if

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
though it'll be interesting to see if

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.330 
though it'll be interesting to see if
these<00:02:35.769> sharks<00:02:36.310> pull<00:02:36.519> fast<00:02:36.819> or<00:02:37.090> slow<00:02:37.389> the<00:02:38.340> first

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
these sharks pull fast or slow the first

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.670 
these sharks pull fast or slow the first
one<00:02:39.549> pulled<00:02:39.730> fast<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.180> know<00:02:40.269> he<00:02:40.450> was<00:02:40.630> nope<00:02:41.470> it's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
one pulled fast we know he was nope it's

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.500 
one pulled fast we know he was nope it's
a<00:02:41.739> catfish<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.819> older<00:02:43.030> dealer<00:02:43.180> they<00:02:43.299> pull

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
a catfish see older dealer they pull

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
a catfish see older dealer they pull
faster<00:02:43.900> too<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:46.000> he<00:02:46.120> did<00:02:46.239> not

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.630 

okay<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.959> guy<00:02:52.170> right<00:02:52.350> here<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> lazy

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
okay this guy right here this is a lazy

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.330 
okay this guy right here this is a lazy
Joe<00:02:53.970> slow<00:02:54.360> mo<00:02:54.600> which<00:02:55.530> means<00:02:55.800> he's<00:02:55.950> more<00:02:56.190> than

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
Joe slow mo which means he's more than

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.490 
Joe slow mo which means he's more than
likely<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.819> fire<00:02:57.209> CUDA<00:02:59.930> we'll<00:03:00.930> see<00:03:01.080> though<00:03:01.260> I'll

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
likely a fire CUDA we'll see though I'll

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:23.280 
likely a fire CUDA we'll see though I'll
catch<00:03:01.680> him<00:03:01.740> out<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.069> see<00:03:02.190> what<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.340> got

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.730 

and<00:03:25.330> the<00:03:26.330> moment<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.690> anticipation<00:03:27.320> he's

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
and the moment and anticipation he's

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.480 
and the moment and anticipation he's
probably<00:03:27.860> fire<00:03:28.190> CUDA<00:03:28.520> duh<00:03:28.640> oh<00:03:29.560> no<00:03:30.560> he<00:03:31.340> moved

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
probably fire CUDA duh oh no he moved

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.220 
probably fire CUDA duh oh no he moved
see<00:03:31.790> now<00:03:31.940> they<00:03:32.060> move<00:03:32.240> differently<00:03:32.450> there's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
see now they move differently there's

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.900 
see now they move differently there's
another<00:03:33.530> basking<00:03:33.980> in<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.160> Sun<00:03:34.310> shark<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.760> he

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
another basking in the Sun shark and he

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.000 
another basking in the Sun shark and he
move<00:03:35.090> really<00:03:35.390> slow<00:03:35.660> they'll<00:03:36.410> move<00:03:36.680> really

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
move really slow they'll move really

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.760 
move really slow they'll move really
fast<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.150> tells<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.960> that<00:03:39.470> they<00:03:39.620> can

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
fast so that tells you that they can

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.540 
fast so that tells you that they can
move<00:03:39.920> in<00:03:40.160> any<00:03:40.340> type<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:40.670> way<00:03:41.620> very<00:03:42.620> interesting

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
move in any type of way very interesting

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.310 
move in any type of way very interesting
that's<00:03:43.880> good<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.120> know<00:03:44.240> during<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.200> summer

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
that's good to know during the summer

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.540 
that's good to know during the summer
months<00:03:45.440> you'll<00:03:45.709> find<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.070> fish<00:03:46.280> basket

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
months you'll find this fish basket

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.490 
months you'll find this fish basket
lazily<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.360> warm<00:03:47.600> sun<00:03:47.840> drenched<00:03:48.110> waters

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
fish to see what we get it's very also

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.680 
fish to see what we get it's very also
very<00:04:09.110> interesting<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.620> notice<00:04:09.800> that<00:04:10.690> there's

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
very interesting to notice that there's

been more good fire fish in this palm in

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.560 
been more good fire fish in this palm in
there<00:04:13.880> hit<00:04:14.090> there<00:04:14.330> has<00:04:14.540> fire<00:04:14.959> Cudas<00:04:16.570> usually

there hit there has fire Cudas usually

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.659 
there hit there has fire Cudas usually
it's<00:04:17.690> mostly<00:04:17.930> trash<00:04:18.260> fish<00:04:18.530> or<00:04:18.680> fire<00:04:18.859> Cudas<00:04:19.280> and
