pearl UV just going to grab a little
chunk<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:24.590> will<00:01:25.590> double<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.790> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
chunk of it will double this up so you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
chunk of it will double this up so you
don't<00:01:26.909> need<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:28.520> pull<00:01:29.520> out<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.700> ton<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.860> you

don't need to pull out a ton so you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.990 
don't need to pull out a ton so you
basically<00:01:32.100> want<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.079> length<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.500> about

basically want the length to be about

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.140 
basically want the length to be about
double<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:38.030> natural<00:01:39.030> you're

this<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> gold<00:02:57.240> purple<00:02:57.690> hue<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.640> a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
this is a gold purple hue it's just a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.800 
this is a gold purple hue it's just a
contrast<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.660> what<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.710> have<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
contrast to what we have with the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.770 
contrast to what we have with the
underside<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.550> imitation<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.880> just

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
underside of this imitation and just

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.410 
underside of this imitation and just
going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.960> do<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.140> same<00:03:07.170> thing<00:03:08.300> tie<00:03:09.300> in<00:03:11.300> at<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
going to do the same thing tie in at the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.640 
going to do the same thing tie in at the
halfway<00:03:12.600> point<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:14.390> then<00:03:15.390> fold<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.590> back

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
halfway point and then fold this back

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.280 
halfway point and then fold this back
over<00:03:17.370> itself<00:03:18.140> like<00:03:19.140> so<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.770> then<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:21.510> tie

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
over itself like so and then just tie

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.740 
over itself like so and then just tie
that<00:03:22.530> off<00:03:22.760> all<00:03:23.760> right<00:03:23.880> now<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.570> final

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
this time just right up here next to the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:48.650 
this time just right up here next to the
head<00:03:44.930> tie<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:45.990> into<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.290> halfway<00:03:46.470> point<00:03:47.660> then

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
head tie it into the halfway point then

00:03:48.660 --> 00:04:01.600 
head tie it into the halfway point then
that<00:03:49.020> back

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.160

and there we have that okay now the next

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.840 
and there we have that okay now the next
step<00:04:06.350> we're<00:04:06.710> just<00:04:06.860> going<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.130> build<00:04:07.580> up<00:04:07.730> a

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
step we're just going to build up a

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:19.509 
step we're just going to build up a
little<00:04:08.090> head<00:04:09.850> right<00:04:10.850> before<00:04:11.600> this<00:04:13.510> tube<00:04:18.519> and

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
little head right before this tube and

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:33.239 
little head right before this tube and
I'm<00:04:19.640> going<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.790> whip<00:04:19.910> finish

then what I'll do here is just kind of

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.429 
then what I'll do here is just kind of
gauge<00:04:36.339> the<00:04:37.179> length<00:04:37.419> that<00:04:37.629> I<00:04:37.689> want<00:04:37.929> this<00:04:38.139> and

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
gauge the length that I want this and

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.279 
gauge the length that I want this and
give<00:04:41.439> it<00:04:41.469> a<00:04:41.559> little<00:04:41.709> cut<00:04:42.069> and<00:04:42.779> a<00:04:43.779> little<00:04:44.109> bit<00:04:44.229> of

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
give it a little cut and a little bit of

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:53.550 
give it a little cut and a little bit of
a<00:04:44.439> taper
