you go this toy if it was remade it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.549 
you go this toy if it was remade it
couldn't<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.730> any<00:00:41.879> better<00:00:42.000> than<00:00:42.120> this

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.450 
this elbow doesn't stay up his waist
does<00:00:58.170> move<00:00:59.000> lalala<00:01:00.000> lalala<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.199> his<00:01:01.980> leg<00:01:02.280> goes

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
up in his knee bends and one of his main

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
up in his knee bends and one of his main
features<00:01:07.979> also<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> movie<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:09.390> chunky

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
features also in the movie that chunky

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
features also in the movie that chunky
presses<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:11.010> button<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:12.030> his<00:01:12.150> head<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:14.060> don't

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
presses a button on his head I don't

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.190 
presses a button on his head I don't
know<00:01:15.150> where<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> button<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.869> would<00:01:16.020> be

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
know where the button really would be

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
know where the button really would be
probably<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.250> probably<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> middle

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
probably in here probably at the middle

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.399 
probably in here probably at the middle
and<00:01:19.909> his<00:01:20.909> face<00:01:21.180> would<00:01:21.390> change<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:22.170> works

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
and his face would change it works

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200 
and his face would change it works
better<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.040> side<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.970> better

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
better on this side and that's a better

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
better on this side and that's a better
way<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> rotate<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> uh<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.200> can't<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
way to rotate it so uh you can't do it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.340 
way to rotate it so uh you can't do it
mainly<00:01:29.070> by<00:01:29.250> hand<00:01:29.579> though<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:31.140> would

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
mainly by hand though that would

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.740 
mainly by hand though that would
probably<00:01:31.790> almost<00:01:32.790> break<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:35.750> mechanism

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
probably almost break the mechanism

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.550 
probably almost break the mechanism
inside<00:01:37.049> well<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> do<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.560> press

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
inside well all I have to do is press

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.020 
inside well all I have to do is press
this<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> side<00:01:41.250> changing<00:01:41.880> before

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
this one on the side changing before

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.780 
this one on the side changing before
happy<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:43.590> groan<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.280> flippy<00:01:47.579> from
