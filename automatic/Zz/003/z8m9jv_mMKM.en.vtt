 it had long since stopped 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.239

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.520
 it is said that the boss take away by the 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.160
 madness would have thrown the roof under the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.870
 striking workers who were demonstrating at 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.510
 manage the time they had spent 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.580
 we still believed factory haunted by the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.009
 spectrum of fn album on concept already 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.509
 so we could say it jumps we do not know 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.700
 more how do you know who owns a 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.500
 report to the assembly is that

 maximum of care one could even say 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.409
 it also is therefore qualifies years 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.690
 was spinning how much the concept grumbled 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:33.590
 equivalent equivalent to which dead point 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:37.570
 in the night in a world and it's cool 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.570
 of his having 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.640
 the license to make music in 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.590
 life then now we're out 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.950
 just me I see more towards the studio 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.399
 also do we work weekdays 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:59.350

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.880
 same - bell is him many times 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.159
 knew each other in a context 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.929
 relatively what I told 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.000

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.349
 while barring my son are or 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.260

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.970
 professional with the bath water that 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.390
 had ten to twenty years we were recording 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.459

 bang rather favorite to that my 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.549
 character is favorite will launch the 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.549
 part 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.579
 garden is to dinner what mechanical that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.010
 were painted and I was very 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:31.980
 inspired by the life and bernard says 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:40.220

 all the shots shows a timeline 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.290
