00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.060
 audio from 04 at home 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello I am still marinelli of the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.019
 block rebels and are located here in 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.150
 the new academy in the room for dj 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.520
 workshops what I want to do today 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.330
 you the beautiful new controller 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.279
 Imagine if I have the firefox the j 44 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.999
 the wiesn send james bond style 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:39.600
 briefcases comes then a very nice 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:42.360
 compact controller it wrong and so 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.960
 the device looks like something at first 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.020
 looks striking and also sounds and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.290
 Immediately feels the maxime 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.520
 Processing everything fully with part 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.530
 screwed rented super device 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.940
 otherwise very classic layout beautiful 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.090
 mirror or symmetrically applied 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.990
 channel other channel mixer section 20 port 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.570
 functions effects and everything jobs 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.790
 concerns 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 she connects that now and also 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.940
 to show what he can do 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.960
 I also have two things left 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.020
 set more intact 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.040
 the filters on the bad ones are button 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.040
 also on 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.399
 so 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.319
 I find it best comparable 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:44.409
 personally with the control x1 here the 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:47.200
 x1 colorful z1 from native instruments we 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.329
 are a little bit smaller but still 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 otherwise a similar form factor if you 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.450
 omit the caves because that's what's heard 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.640
 has seen again with his 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.799
 suitcase nice small at native 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.069
 instruments are these bags want - 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.630
 but they are very beautiful and practical 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.409
 to raise and lower the measuring device 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.299
 protect 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.310
 pressure from one which best and so 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.849
 continue to work exactly as well 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.220
 with this one 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.170
 because the whole fits very nicely ours 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.049
 away is stackable I just will not do 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.519
 because there are no rubber feet glued to it 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.799
 in the north city on the table around 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.799
 fix everything easily 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.700
 I 've already said that I think of that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.470
 design pretty nice that way 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.329
 Of course, that's symmetrical 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.049
 at the two drinks we do not wait 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:40.150
 quite so you can but otherwise and 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:43.389
 get used to it, I would say what he ins 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.849
 eye- catching are the buttons as you like 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:50.019
 first laboratory and medical technology one knows 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:53.099
 had it all works out very solid too 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.099
 the dials here 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.090
 that's all massive and German 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.620
 value work, he must accept what I am 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.690
 quite as pleasant as you can see 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.970
 here's the mixer under cosplayer that is 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.319
 very close and very small and his team 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.419
 so is quite easy to make it to 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.000
 tell everyone the actual coesfelder 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.310
 can actually use this 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.169
 Forgot and thus actually that 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.299
 whole device for it is not thought 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.950
 So everything that somehow I know that 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.519
 me controllers and stylus or 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.760
 maybe even stretches so hip hop 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.650
 style I would say works 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.019
 on the device here better because of 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.579
 wiper is actually full sized 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.230
 while he is very very small here 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.090
 ours was also pretty good though 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.760
 you rather so slow stories with it 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.140
 makes love house and techno 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.170
 actually I would not cut back 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.850
 I try my best 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.850
 make beautiful transition to show 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.290
 that you definitely discovered it with baxter 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.290
 We start with that 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.349
 it works even where is 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.180
 In particular, it is so good 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.279
 works is a circumstance of not 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.069
 extremely remarkable find namely 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:12.710
 mapping on this field as a controller 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.930
 is somehow the culprit and more extensive than 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.360
 facebook from the original native 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.620
 I would not have instrument equipment 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.599
 but it is considered possible 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.939
 actually so first you have it 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.439
 managed on this super small layout 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.319
 a complete 4 channel control 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.199
 can grab wonderfully comfortable 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:33.169
 select by ship and headphones 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.529
 from the 61 to 3 and 2 4 switch over 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.389
 with the combination is not then 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.270
 a function not completely exhausted 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.999
 namely the tractor recognition of the 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.169
 Grid can be used halfway through functions 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.569
 do it fast and twice as fast 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.249
 without you completely shifting everything 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.740
 just double and halve 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.509
 you can do super good runs and 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.800
 was with base dubstep where I know 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.430
 140 or 70 ppm accordingly not 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.169
 not always know which 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.229
 speeds to mix close attention 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.180
 wants device is realized here 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.259
 I can always be wonderfully practical 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.389
 need and the absolute highlight is 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.699
 you can see the effect of effect 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.669
 1 to 3 and 2 to 4 switch that is 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.289
 you can really get four complete 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.459
 Effect combinations as you get from 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:21.709
 different music maybe 

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:23.360
 needs to build before and then 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:25.310
 just choose between them 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.349
 Great everything the original 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.589
 Apple does not go and they do not 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:32.709
 so easy on so few buttons 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:34.879
 are reasonably suitable to build 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:38.959
 insane plus point in my opinion 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:40.969
 even grid functions are direct here 

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:44.689
 on device I made once got why the 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:47.149
 complete madness experienced when we 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:51.219
 already when comparing prices are clear 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:54.679
 important the two are there for the moment 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:57.529
 just under 400 euros together with hulls scarce 

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:59.589
 over 400 euro then but is synonymous one 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:02.629
 current i believe or tractor tour 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:04.179
 license here and here is one 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:07.129
 Sound card installed 

00:07:04.179 --> 00:07:09.110
 Of course, it lacks logically 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:10.159
 the tractor license and it is not 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.429
 sound card in it 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:15.009
 you would have to buy extra price 

00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:17.389
 around 500 euros 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:20.719
 I justify it justifiable 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:23.180
 because of the very different value, too 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:24.619
 that in the manufactory hand of all 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.699
 screwing them together is natural 

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:30.949
 already important as I think mine 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.740
 personal conclusion is I am totally 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:34.849
 in love with the box and I would 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.469
 even if I already have so much of 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:39.589
 faithful at home I would hope 

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:41.029
 I think buy again but also the 

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:43.309
 other side if I'm completely honest 

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:44.990
 matches my style hang up here 

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:46.399
 that here I need the space I have 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.529
 in front of springer I also like to think 

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:52.729
 reiterate that everything is more 

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:54.949
 so for the engineer among the djs but 

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:56.930
 then it's perfect and it's just too 

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:58.610
 really a looker because the device 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.769
 will long be spread like 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.409
 the whole ff instruments controller 

00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:05.869
 So have a clear conclusion from me 

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:08.180
 would cut back if I did and me 

00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:10.959
 wish you this test device after me 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.949
 then get the wander home why 

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:15.519
 I wish a lot of fun with it 

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:15.519
 I had
