what<00:03:17.680> makes<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:17.950> worse<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.490> not<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:18.850> you're

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
what makes it worse is not that you're

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.940 
what makes it worse is not that you're
left<00:03:19.150> wanting<00:03:19.660> more<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.590> are<00:03:20.620> left

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950
