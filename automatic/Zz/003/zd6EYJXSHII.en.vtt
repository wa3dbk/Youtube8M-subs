00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
acrylic paints and like I've made this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.889 
acrylic paints and like I've made this
now<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:33.990> next<00:00:34.380> thing<00:00:34.650> going<00:00:35.220> to<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.970> try<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
now the next thing going to do is try to

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.400 
now the next thing going to do is try to
make<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:38.039> to<00:00:38.100> meet<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.550> handle<00:00:39.950> you<00:00:40.950> need<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
make that go to meet a handle you need a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.270 
make that go to meet a handle you need a
guard<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.649> why<00:00:43.860> about<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.579> long<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:46.070> put<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
guard and why about this long and put a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.849 
guard and why about this long and put a
loop<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.750> beads<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.500> fall

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
loop in it so that the beads don't fall

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.279 
loop in it so that the beads don't fall
off<00:00:49.940> when<00:00:50.940> you're<00:00:51.090> threading<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.109> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
off when you're threading this is what I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.930 
off when you're threading this is what I
made<00:00:53.059> that<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.289> need<00:00:55.590> a

made that you it's you just need a
halfway<00:00:56.989> halfway<00:00:58.550> just<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.329> done

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
halfway halfway just like I have done

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.020 
halfway halfway just like I have done
don't<00:01:01.230> matter<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:01.890> dude<00:01:02.219> them<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.969> just
