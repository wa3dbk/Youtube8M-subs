topic is what makes a knife a tank and
to<00:00:14.670> me<00:00:14.849> I've<00:00:15.839> broken<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.410> down<00:00:16.470> into<00:00:16.619> four

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
to me I've broken it down into four

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
to me I've broken it down into four
categories<00:00:17.490> here<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.779> when<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> think<00:00:19.380> about<00:00:19.439> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
categories here so when I think about a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.630 
categories here so when I think about a
tank<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.189> think<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.289> big<00:00:22.340> freaking<00:00:23.340> war

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
tank I think of this big freaking war

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.759 
tank I think of this big freaking war
machine<00:00:24.000> that's<00:00:24.240> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.539> able<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.990> go

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
machine that's going to be able to go

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.370 
machine that's going to be able to go
through<00:00:26.010> any<00:00:26.340> obstacle<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> destroy<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
through any obstacle and destroy the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.820 
through any obstacle and destroy the
enemy<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.949> sheer<00:00:29.519> brute<00:00:30.060> force<00:00:30.650> now<00:00:31.650> in

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
enemy with sheer brute force now in

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.720 
enemy with sheer brute force now in
terms<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.160> knives<00:00:32.540> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.899> think

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
terms of knives this is what I think

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.410 
terms of knives this is what I think
first<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:35.969> I've<00:00:36.270> brought<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:38.239> the<00:00:39.239> knives

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
first of all I've brought out the knives

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.920 
first of all I've brought out the knives
that<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:40.079> our<00:00:40.379> tank<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.719> left

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that I think our tank like on the left

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.959 
that I think our tank like on the left
here<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.649> got<00:00:43.829> your<00:00:43.950> striders<00:00:44.460> which<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
here you got your striders which have a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.959 
here you got your striders which have a
huge<00:00:45.660> reputation<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.620> being<00:00:46.800> tank<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
huge reputation of being tank like and I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.750 
huge reputation of being tank like and I
do<00:00:48.030> agree<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.950> at<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> top<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.610> got

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
do agree with that and at the top we got

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.260 
do agree with that and at the top we got
the<00:00:50.850> bench<00:00:51.059> made<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.510> fo<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> less<00:00:53.640> George<00:00:54.000> V

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the bench made a fo to the less George V

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
the bench made a fo to the less George V
ecp<00:00:55.250> hinder<00:00:56.250> XM<00:00:56.820> model<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:58.649> bokor

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.389 
ecp hinder XM model and the bokor
pipsqueak<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> first<00:01:01.469> off<00:01:01.739> let's<00:01:02.070> talk<00:01:02.250> about

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
pipsqueak so first off let's talk about

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.509 
pipsqueak so first off let's talk about
toughness<00:01:02.930> toughness<00:01:04.159> definitely<00:01:05.159> plays<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
toughness toughness definitely plays a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.870 
toughness toughness definitely plays a
role<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.229> what<00:01:07.229> category<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> knife<00:01:08.640> as

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
role in what category is is a knife as

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.390 
role in what category is is a knife as
being<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> tank<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.860> has<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.220> do

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
being a tank and I think this has to do

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.760 
being a tank and I think this has to do
a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.450> blade<00:01:13.080> steel<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.799> thickness

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
a lot with blade steel and thickness

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.260 
a lot with blade steel and thickness
blade<00:01:16.770> steel<00:01:17.070> such<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:18.290> CPM<00:01:19.290> 3v<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:21.030> saw

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
blade steel such as CPM 3v and you saw

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.660 
blade steel such as CPM 3v and you saw
that<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.630> use<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.140> blade<00:01:22.860> steel<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.369> pry<00:01:23.640> open

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that I use this blade steel to pry open

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.140 
that I use this blade steel to pry open

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.470 
don't know it depends on what you think
because<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.260> got<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.440> vcp<00:02:30.370> which<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480

because you got the vcp which is a
rather<00:02:31.660> large<00:02:31.990> knife<00:02:32.320> i<00:02:32.590> think<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.070> about

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
rather large knife i think this about

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
nine and a half inches overall and then

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.800 
nine and a half inches overall and then
you<00:02:35.890> get<00:02:36.010> something<00:02:36.280> like<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.610> bokor<00:02:37.000> pipsqueak

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.650 
some stuff with and i think that's
probably<00:03:58.980> why<00:03:59.370> this<00:03:59.430> is<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.060> armed<00:04:00.570> forces

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
probably why this is the armed forces

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.360 
probably why this is the armed forces

model benchmade one to come out with a
beefy<00:04:05.370> tank<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:06.000> knife<00:04:06.240> that<00:04:06.630> could<00:04:06.840> be

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
beefy tank like knife that could be

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.250 
beefy tank like knife that could be

keep<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.950> that's<00:04:11.910> what<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.150> think<00:04:12.240> that's

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
keep going that's what I think that's

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.099 
keep going that's what I think that's
why<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.320> think<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.740> knife<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.720> categorized<00:04:15.720> as

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
why I think this knife is categorized as

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.310 
why I think this knife is categorized as
being<00:04:16.980> tank<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:18.000> even<00:04:18.359> has<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.540> pommel<00:04:19.140> on

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
being tank like it even has a pommel on

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.470 
being tank like it even has a pommel on
the<00:04:19.500> bottom<00:04:19.890> so<00:04:20.519> if<00:04:20.640> you<00:04:20.730> see<00:04:20.970> a<00:04:21.000> knife<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.419> the

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
the bottom so if you see a knife of the

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.140 
the bottom so if you see a knife of the
pommel<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.440> means<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.280> knife<00:04:23.460> maker<00:04:23.790> is

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
pommel that means the knife maker is

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.350 
pommel that means the knife maker is
pretty<00:04:24.870> much<00:04:25.110> saying<00:04:25.770> yeah<00:04:26.640> go<00:04:26.910> take<00:04:27.180> this

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
pretty much saying yeah go take this

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.980 
pretty much saying yeah go take this
knife<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:27.630> smash<00:04:28.350> some<00:04:28.890> stuff<00:04:29.220> up<00:04:29.430> with<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.990> so

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
knife and smash some stuff up with it so

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.290 
knife and smash some stuff up with it so
that's<00:04:31.140> the<00:04:31.260> AFO<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.740> I<00:04:32.130> think<00:04:32.790> that's<00:04:32.970> tank

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
that's the AFO to I think that's tank

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.880 
that's the AFO to I think that's tank
like<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.650> then<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.890> hinder<00:04:36.440> maybe<00:04:37.440> not<00:04:37.680> this

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
like and then the hinder maybe not this

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.010 
like and then the hinder maybe not this
three-inch<00:04:38.280> model<00:04:38.760> but<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.030> X<00:04:39.180> I'm<00:04:39.419> 24<00:04:39.990> i

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
three-inch model but the X I'm 24 i

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.930 
three-inch model but the X I'm 24 i
would<00:04:40.470> definitely<00:04:40.800> categorize<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.730> as

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
would definitely categorize that as

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.840 
would definitely categorize that as
being<00:04:42.120> tank<00:04:42.540> like<00:04:42.780> it's<00:04:43.680> just<00:04:44.010> very<00:04:44.490> well

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
being tank like it's just very well

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.280 
being tank like it's just very well
built<00:04:46.430> it's<00:04:47.430> it's<00:04:47.790> not<00:04:48.300> going<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:48.630> be<00:04:48.780> the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
built it's it's not going to be the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.140 
built it's it's not going to be the
lockup<00:04:49.740> is<00:04:49.890> not<00:04:50.070> going<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.280> be<00:04:50.430> going<00:04:50.729> anywhere

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
lockup is not going to be going anywhere

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.190 
lockup is not going to be going anywhere
the<00:04:51.780> blade<00:04:52.140> is<00:04:52.470> thick<00:04:53.190> it's<00:04:53.520> nice<00:04:54.240> that<00:04:54.270> tip<00:04:54.960> is

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the blade is thick it's nice that tip is

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.140 
the blade is thick it's nice that tip is
you<00:04:55.770> know<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:56.070> gets<00:04:56.220> thicker<00:04:56.520> towards<00:04:57.000> the

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
you know it gets thicker towards the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.129 
you know it gets thicker towards the
front<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.710> also<00:04:59.040> depends<00:04:59.490> on<00:04:59.610> your

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.649 

the<00:05:02.620> blade<00:05:02.860> style<00:05:03.129> the<00:05:03.580> span<00:05:03.999> toe<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.509> the

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
the blade style the span toe and the

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.779 
the blade style the span toe and the
slicer<00:05:05.349> grind<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.889> he<00:05:06.099> comes<00:05:06.340> out<00:05:06.490> with<00:05:06.550> other

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
slicer grind and he comes out with other

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.209 
slicer grind and he comes out with other
grinds<00:05:07.150> as<00:05:07.360> well<00:05:07.569> so<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:07.870> do<00:05:07.990> think<00:05:08.379> grinds<00:05:08.740> have

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
grinds as well so I do think grinds have

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.239 
grinds as well so I do think grinds have
to<00:05:09.400> has<00:05:09.699> a<00:05:10.300> factor<00:05:11.289> in<00:05:11.529> determining<00:05:11.710> if<00:05:12.159> a

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:12.249 
to has a factor in determining if a

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:14.459 
to has a factor in determining if a
knife<00:05:12.430> is<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.639> tank<00:05:12.969> but<00:05:13.900> I<00:05:13.930> do<00:05:13.990> think<00:05:14.289> the

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469 
knife is a tank but I do think the

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.050 
knife is a tank but I do think the
Hinderer<00:05:14.860> design<00:05:16.889> cat<00:05:17.889> is<00:05:18.129> categorized<00:05:18.759> as

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
Hinderer design cat is categorized as

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.619 
Hinderer design cat is categorized as
being<00:05:19.330> tank<00:05:19.629> like<00:05:19.949> wait<00:05:21.120> you'll<00:05:22.120> see<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.330> lot<00:05:22.599> of

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
being tank like wait you'll see a lot of

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.439 
being tank like wait you'll see a lot of
dealers<00:05:23.199> talk<00:05:23.620> about<00:05:23.889> a<00:05:24.129> knife<00:05:24.639> being<00:05:24.939> a<00:05:25.120> tank

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
dealers talk about a knife being a tank

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.929 
dealers talk about a knife being a tank
because<00:05:26.050> it<00:05:26.199> weighs<00:05:26.469> a<00:05:26.499> lot<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.099> it's<00:05:27.699> true

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:27.939 
because it weighs a lot and it's true

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:31.230 
because it weighs a lot and it's true
tanks<00:05:28.659> weigh<00:05:28.900> tons<00:05:29.580> literally<00:05:30.580> tons<00:05:30.939> of

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
tanks weigh tons literally tons of

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.149 
tanks weigh tons literally tons of
weight<00:05:31.719> you<00:05:32.050> know<00:05:32.139> tanks<00:05:32.590> are<00:05:32.770> really

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
weight you know tanks are really

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.969 
weight you know tanks are really
freaking<00:05:33.490> heavy<00:05:33.639> so<00:05:34.029> would<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:34.990> categorize<00:05:35.169> a

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
freaking heavy so would you categorize a

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.010 
freaking heavy so would you categorize a
knife<00:05:36.310> is<00:05:36.550> being<00:05:36.789> a<00:05:36.849> tank<00:05:37.090> if<00:05:37.300> it<00:05:37.479> weighs<00:05:37.719> a<00:05:37.750> lot

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
knife is being a tank if it weighs a lot

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.450 
knife is being a tank if it weighs a lot
I<00:05:38.289> think<00:05:39.129> so<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.900> then<00:05:41.139> lastly<00:05:41.469> and<00:05:42.099> I<00:05:42.189> kind<00:05:42.370> of

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
I think so and then lastly and I kind of

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.059 
I think so and then lastly and I kind of
touched<00:05:42.639> up<00:05:42.879> touched<00:05:43.360> upon<00:05:43.629> this<00:05:43.949> with<00:05:44.949> the

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
touched up touched upon this with the

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.540 
touched up touched upon this with the
toughness<00:05:45.599> destructive<00:05:46.599> capabilities

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
toughness destructive capabilities

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.129 
toughness destructive capabilities
pretty<00:05:48.550> much<00:05:48.729> are<00:05:49.569> you<00:05:49.689> going<00:05:49.779> to<00:05:49.840> be<00:05:49.930> able<00:05:49.960> to

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
pretty much are you going to be able to

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.100 
pretty much are you going to be able to
take<00:05:50.319> this<00:05:50.469> knife<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:51.449> go<00:05:52.449> destroy<00:05:52.840> some

take this knife and go destroy some
stuff<00:05:53.379> with<00:05:53.560> it<00:05:53.620> and<00:05:53.919> it's<00:05:53.979> going<00:05:54.189> to<00:05:54.250> still

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
stuff with it and it's going to still

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.320 
stuff with it and it's going to still
you<00:05:55.509> know<00:05:55.599> stay<00:05:56.289> intact<00:05:56.969> it's<00:05:57.969> going<00:05:58.089> to<00:05:58.150> last

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
you know stay intact it's going to last

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.989 
you know stay intact it's going to last
a<00:05:58.539> while<00:05:58.689> because<00:05:58.990> it<00:05:59.439> is<00:05:59.589> built<00:05:59.949> it's<00:06:00.729> well

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:00.999 
a while because it is built it's well

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.019 
a while because it is built it's well
built<00:06:01.210> it's<00:06:02.050> tough<00:06:02.349> and<00:06:02.710> it's<00:06:02.770> gonna<00:06:03.610> endure

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
built it's tough and it's gonna endure

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.450 
built it's tough and it's gonna endure
