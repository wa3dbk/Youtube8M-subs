to get big arms so after that at the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.310 
to get big arms so after that at the
tricep<00:01:55.340> overhead<00:01:55.760> extension<00:01:56.330> now<00:01:56.870> I<00:01:56.900> did<00:01:57.200> this

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
tricep overhead extension now I did this

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.870 
tricep overhead extension now I did this
exercise<00:01:57.620> with<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.070> machine<00:01:58.460> I'm<00:01:58.610> telling

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
exercise with the machine I'm telling

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.910 
exercise with the machine I'm telling
you<00:01:59.000> guys<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.480> didn't<00:01:59.960> do<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.170> exercise<00:02:00.470> for<00:02:00.890> a

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
you guys I didn't do this exercise for a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.820 
you guys I didn't do this exercise for a
very<00:02:01.160> long<00:02:01.310> time

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
very long time

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.990 
very long time
and<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.220> when<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.400> started<00:02:02.700> doing<00:02:02.820> this

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and then when I started doing this

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.180 
and then when I started doing this
exercise<00:02:03.300> my<00:02:03.930> tricep<00:02:04.320> started<00:02:04.620> to<00:02:04.710> grow<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> lot

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
exercise my tricep started to grow a lot

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.100 
exercise my tricep started to grow a lot
faster<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.450> we're<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.750> superset

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
faster and then we're going to superset

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
faster and then we're going to superset
it<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.500> well<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.040> triceps<00:02:08.490> pulled<00:02:08.759> down

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
it as well but the triceps pulled down

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
it as well but the triceps pulled down
so<00:02:09.420> we're<00:02:09.540> going<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.810> 10<00:02:10.020> repetitions<00:02:10.290> of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
so we're going to do 10 repetitions of

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.920 
so we're going to do 10 repetitions of
the<00:02:10.950> tricep<00:02:11.400> overhead<00:02:11.730> extension<00:02:12.240> then<00:02:12.720> 10

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
the tricep overhead extension then 10

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.080 
the tricep overhead extension then 10
repetitions<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.800> triceps<00:02:14.220> pull<00:02:14.430> down<00:02:14.610> now

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
repetitions the triceps pull down now

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.180 
repetitions the triceps pull down now
sue<00:02:15.330> need<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.570> do<00:02:15.720> those<00:02:15.930> exercises<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.980> take
