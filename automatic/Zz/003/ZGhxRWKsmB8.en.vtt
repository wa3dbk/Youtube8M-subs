because I know impatient people are so
what<00:00:14.280> happens<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.759> got<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> bunch<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.690> dot

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
what happens is got a bunch of dot

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.529 
what happens is got a bunch of dot
coal<00:00:16.800> Coon<00:00:17.039> up<00:00:17.130> from<00:00:17.310> up<00:00:17.400> there<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.449> gets

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
coal Coon up from up there and it gets

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.000 
coal Coon up from up there and it gets
rid<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.810> whole<00:00:18.960> machine<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.410> ends<00:00:19.529> up<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
rid this whole machine and ends up in

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.420 
rid this whole machine and ends up in
this<00:00:20.130> chest<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.810> could<00:00:22.439> quickly<00:00:22.830> try

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
this chest here so you could quickly try

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.029 
this chest here so you could quickly try
and<00:00:23.580> run<00:00:23.939> through<00:00:24.240> how<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.689> works<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.830> there

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and run through how it works so up there

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
and run through how it works so up there
this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.310> chest<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> bunch<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.390> coal<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
this is chest with a bunch of coal the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.320 
this is chest with a bunch of coal the
coal<00:00:28.500> goes<00:00:28.710> down<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.160> into<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.490> masarayya

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
coal goes down here into this masarayya

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
coal goes down here into this masarayya
and<00:00:30.660> then<00:00:31.410> once<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.859> macerate<00:00:32.160> sit<00:00:32.520> into<00:00:32.610> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and then once it macerate sit into this

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.630 
and then once it macerate sit into this
dust<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.809> arranges<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.469> into<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.309> set<00:00:35.579> up

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
dust that arranges it into this set up

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.010 
dust that arranges it into this set up
here<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.000> you've<00:00:36.149> specifying<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> auto

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
here that you've specifying the auto

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.950 
here that you've specifying the auto
crafting<00:00:37.530> table<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.980> make<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> coal<00:00:38.489> ball<00:00:38.960> so

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
crafting table to make a coal ball so

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
crafting table to make a coal ball so
you<00:00:40.050> put<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> recipe<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.340> there<00:00:41.520> obviously

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you put the recipe in there obviously

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.540 
you put the recipe in there obviously
and<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.090> replicates<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.550> we've

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and it replicates it from there on we've

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.889 
and it replicates it from there on we've
got<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> bunch<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> flint<00:00:45.300> stored<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.750> there

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
got a bunch of flint stored in there

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.029 
got a bunch of flint stored in there
because<00:00:46.050> that's<00:00:46.200> what<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.469> uses<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:46.860> well

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
because that's what it uses as well

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.959 
because that's what it uses as well
and<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.140> method<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.649> takes<00:00:50.160> it

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and so for this method actually takes it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.500 
and so for this method actually takes it
takes<00:00:51.270> flint<00:00:52.079> obsidian<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> coal<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.180> think<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
takes flint obsidian and coal I think it

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.170 
takes flint obsidian and coal I think it
uses<00:00:54.840> 16<00:00:55.530> coal<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.430> total<00:00:56.760> 8<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.120> each

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
uses 16 coal I think in total 8 for each

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
uses 16 coal I think in total 8 for each
Darland<00:00:57.600> which<00:00:57.750> isn't<00:00:57.930> too<00:00:58.109> bad<00:00:58.340> so<00:00:59.340> anyway

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
Darland which isn't too bad so anyway

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.220 
Darland which isn't too bad so anyway
after<00:00:59.730> he<00:00:59.910> finishes<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.359> gets<00:01:00.629> sent<00:01:00.840> round<00:01:00.989> here

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
after he finishes a gets sent round here

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.910 
after he finishes a gets sent round here
into<00:01:02.570> this<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> compressor<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
into this which is a compressor it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.310 
into this which is a compressor it
compresses<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> coal<00:01:05.670> ball<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.930> little

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
compresses the coal ball into a little

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.100 
compresses the coal ball into a little
tiny<00:01:07.830> square<00:01:08.330> and<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.600> gets<00:01:09.750> sent

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
tiny square and then that gets sent

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.010 
tiny square and then that gets sent
through<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.330> I'll<00:01:12.330> explain<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
through here and I'll explain what this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
through here and I'll explain what this
does<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> moment<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.060> go

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
does in a moment but so it will go

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
does in a moment but so it will go
through<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.689> straight<00:01:16.320> into<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.680> Auto

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
through here straight into this Auto

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
through here straight into this Auto
crafting<00:01:17.340> table<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.270> compressed<00:01:18.960> coal

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
crafting table and the compressed coal

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.219 
crafting table and the compressed coal
ball<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> makes<00:01:21.110> surrounds<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
ball that it makes surrounds the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.499 
ball that it makes surrounds the
obsidian<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:23.850> make<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> cold

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
obsidian and that will then make a cold

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.969 
obsidian and that will then make a cold
chunk<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> again<00:01:25.320> we've<00:01:25.439> got<00:01:25.470> obsidian

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
chunk and again we've got obsidian

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.070 
chunk and again we've got obsidian
queued<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:27.270> weight<00:01:27.600> ones<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.990> in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
queued up here for weight ones that in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.590 
queued up here for weight ones that in
the<00:01:28.200> auto<00:01:28.500> crafting<00:01:28.890> table<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.060> once<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> makes

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the auto crafting table so once it makes

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
the auto crafting table so once it makes
the<00:01:30.750> cold<00:01:31.049> chunk<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.680> will<00:01:31.799> get<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.220> since

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the cold chunk it will get then since

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300 
the cold chunk it will get then since
around<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.750> here<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.350> then<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.100> would<00:01:35.189> go

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
around this here and then it would go

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.200 
around this here and then it would go
back<00:01:35.720> into<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.400> which<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> compressor

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
back into here which is the compressor

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.789 
back into here which is the compressor
again<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.630> it'll<00:01:39.750> compress<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> coal<00:01:40.470> chunk

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
again and it'll compress the coal chunk

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
again and it'll compress the coal chunk
and<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.369> will<00:01:41.460> come<00:01:41.610> back<00:01:42.420> into<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.780> diamond

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and that will come back into a diamond

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.870 
and that will come back into a diamond
so<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.189> we'll<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.460> we'll<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
so what we'll have here we'll have the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.830 
so what we'll have here we'll have the
compressed<00:01:45.420> coal<00:01:46.200> balls<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.860> we'll<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
compressed coal balls and we'll have the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.789 
compressed coal balls and we'll have the
compressed<00:01:48.840> diamond<00:01:49.259> running<00:01:49.530> through<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
compressed diamond running through the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
compressed diamond running through the
same<00:01:49.979> tube<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:51.149> why<00:01:51.329> we've<00:01:51.450> got<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
same tube so that's why we've got a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.030 
same tube so that's why we've got a
sorting<00:01:51.960> pipe<00:01:52.140> air<00:01:52.350> saying<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
sorting pipe air saying if it's a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.840 
sorting pipe air saying if it's a
diamond<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.670> access<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.720> through<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> white

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
diamond then access it through the white

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.929 
diamond then access it through the white
exit<00:01:56.850> which<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.240> where<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.469> here<00:01:58.939> so

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
exit which is where you can see here so

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.639 
exit which is where you can see here so
I<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> pretty<00:02:00.930> sort<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.380> small

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
I think it's a pretty sort of small

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.190 
I think it's a pretty sort of small
efficient<00:02:02.280> self<00:02:02.759> as<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> said<00:02:03.780> doesn't<00:02:03.990> use

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
efficient self as I said doesn't use

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.580 
efficient self as I said doesn't use
much<00:02:04.439> coal<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.890> think<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.189> 16<00:02:06.380> think<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.500> is

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
much coal I think it's 16 think it is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.740 
much coal I think it's 16 think it is
anyway<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.879> bunch<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.239> Flint<00:02:09.539> which

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
anyway and then a bunch of Flint which

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.240 
anyway and then a bunch of Flint which
is<00:02:09.899> useless<00:02:10.110> normally<00:02:10.649> anyway

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
is useless normally anyway

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740 
is useless normally anyway
a<00:02:11.280> bunch<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.700> obsidian<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.540> probably

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
a bunch of obsidian so this is probably

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.630 
a bunch of obsidian so this is probably
the<00:02:12.810> best<00:02:13.020> way<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.890> do<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:17.130> anything<00:02:17.490> I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the best way to do it so just anything I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.810 
the best way to do it so just anything I
think<00:02:17.910> off<00:02:18.000> miss<00:02:18.210> Rob

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
think off miss Rob

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.670 
think off miss Rob
how<00:02:20.820> long<00:02:21.180> from<00:02:21.810> when<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.170> start<00:02:22.380> putting<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
how long from when you start putting the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.830 
how long from when you start putting the
:<00:02:23.070> when<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.640> get<00:02:23.760> diamond<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.210> hair<00:02:24.630> long

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
: when you get diamond that hair long

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.190 
: when you get diamond that hair long
yeah<00:02:25.590> okay<00:02:26.090> obviously<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.330> depends<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.900> how

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
yeah okay obviously that depends on how

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.240 
yeah okay obviously that depends on how
many<00:02:28.260> overclockers<00:02:28.800> you've<00:02:28.920> got<00:02:29.070> in<00:02:29.160> your

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
many overclockers you've got in your

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.430 
many overclockers you've got in your
machines<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.940> stuff<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:30.660> here

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
machines and stuff like that so here

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.960 
machines and stuff like that so here
I've<00:02:31.620> got<00:02:31.830> eight<00:02:32.070> overclockers<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
I've got eight overclockers in the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.120 
I've got eight overclockers in the
macerator<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.870> getting<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.440> first<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.040> as

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
macerator and getting it first and as

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.890 
macerator and getting it first and as
possible<00:02:35.580> into<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.790> auto<00:02:35.970> crafting<00:02:36.480> table

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
possible into the auto crafting table

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.890 
possible into the auto crafting table
and<00:02:37.890> also<00:02:38.280> depends<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.540> know<00:02:39.690> whether

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and also depends on you know whether

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.410 
and also depends on you know whether
you've<00:02:40.080> got<00:02:40.230> gold<00:02:40.530> transport<00:02:40.890> pipe<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:42.150> speed

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
you've got gold transport pipe to speed

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.940 
you've got gold transport pipe to speed
the<00:02:42.540> process<00:02:42.900> along<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.350> what<00:02:43.440> kind<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.709> pipe

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the process along and what kind of pipe

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.090 
the process along and what kind of pipe
you<00:02:44.010> use<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.489> stuff<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.560> dependent<00:02:46.739> on

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
you use and stuff so it's dependent on

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.040 
you use and stuff so it's dependent on
that<00:02:47.250> really<00:02:47.459> if<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.880> if<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.360> wanted<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
that really if I if I wanted to the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.260 
that really if I if I wanted to the
chest<00:02:49.350> up<00:02:49.530> there<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:51.000> know<00:02:51.150> that's

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
chest up there that's you know that's

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.000 
chest up there that's you know that's
providing<00:02:51.810> all<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.050> coal<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.590> could<00:02:52.860> easily

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
providing all the coal I could easily

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.220 
providing all the coal I could easily
just<00:02:53.340> put<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> load<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.300> gold<00:02:54.420> pipe<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:54.959> to

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
just put a load of gold pipe in there to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.990 
just put a load of gold pipe in there to
you<00:02:55.620> know<00:02:55.739> zoom<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.160> through<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:57.890> these

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
you know zoom it through to these

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.940 
you know zoom it through to these
hoppers<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.390> master<00:03:00.870> right<00:03:00.989> sir<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:01.230> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
hoppers and the master right sir but the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.080 
hoppers and the master right sir but the
cyclist<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.489> just<00:03:02.670> thought<00:03:02.760> I'd<00:03:02.880> leave<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
cyclist I just thought I'd leave it

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.550 
cyclist I just thought I'd leave it
going<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.540> we've<00:03:03.630> got<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> chunk<00:03:03.989> load<00:03:04.200> ago<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
going and we've got a chunk load ago and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.260 
going and we've got a chunk load ago and
so<00:03:04.680> when<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.890> log<00:03:05.070> off<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.459> continues<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.090> make

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
so when you log off it continues to make

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.800 
so when you log off it continues to make
these<00:03:06.600> items<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.060> mean<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.360> only<00:03:09.480> thing<00:03:09.690> you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
these items so I mean the only thing you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.110 
these items so I mean the only thing you
might<00:03:09.870> want<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.290> do<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.650> get<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.520> bit<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.060> a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
might want to do is get a bit of a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.760 
might want to do is get a bit of a
better<00:03:12.270> setup<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.750> terms<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> hopper<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
better setup in terms of the hopper and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.530 
better setup in terms of the hopper and
how<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> items<00:03:14.610> are<00:03:14.700> stored<00:03:14.850> what<00:03:15.420> I'd

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
how the items are stored what I'd

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.509 
how the items are stored what I'd
probably<00:03:15.780> do<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.200> I'd<00:03:16.410> create<00:03:16.769> separate<00:03:17.220> to

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
probably do is I'd create separate to

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.949 
probably do is I'd create separate to
macerate<00:03:17.880> errs<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.450> there<00:03:18.600> wasn't<00:03:18.870> so

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
macerate errs if there wasn't so

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.330 
macerate errs if there wasn't so
expensive<00:03:19.170> after<00:03:19.650> they've<00:03:19.799> been<00:03:19.890> changed<00:03:20.250> in

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
expensive after they've been changed in

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.810 
expensive after they've been changed in
grey<00:03:20.519> Tech<00:03:21.140> so<00:03:22.140> I'd<00:03:22.440> create<00:03:22.709> CMOS<00:03:23.040> writers<00:03:23.489> and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
grey Tech so I'd create CMOS writers and

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.970 
grey Tech so I'd create CMOS writers and
and<00:03:24.269> sort<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.750> split<00:03:24.959> them<00:03:25.049> fifty-fifty<00:03:25.709> from

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
and sort of split them fifty-fifty from

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.320 
and sort of split them fifty-fifty from
there<00:03:26.160> because<00:03:26.400> he<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.640> easy<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.090> get<00:03:27.239> them

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
there because he is easy to get them

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.600 
there because he is easy to get them
overflowed<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.049> what<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:28.830> could<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
overflowed and what you could do is you

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.979 
overflowed and what you could do is you
could<00:03:29.730> make<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> transpose<00:03:30.570> though<00:03:30.810> that's

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
could make a transpose though that's

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.990 
could make a transpose though that's
clicked<00:03:31.290> connected<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.010> timer<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.880> if

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
clicked connected to a timer so if

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.280 
clicked connected to a timer so if
anything<00:03:33.209> does<00:03:33.330> overflow<00:03:33.930> when<00:03:34.080> you're<00:03:34.200> off

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
anything does overflow when you're off

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.930 
anything does overflow when you're off
the<00:03:34.380> server<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.860> will<00:03:34.950> suck<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.670> put<00:03:35.850> it

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
the server it will suck it up and put it

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.180 
the server it will suck it up and put it
into<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.180> chest<00:03:36.530> that's<00:03:37.530> probably<00:03:38.010> another

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
into a chest that's probably another

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.710 
into a chest that's probably another
video<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.549> itself<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.060> we're<00:03:39.209> ready<00:03:39.390> go<00:03:39.510> into

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
video in itself so we're ready go into

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.680 
video in itself so we're ready go into
that<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.140> I<00:03:40.519> think<00:03:41.519> that's<00:03:41.700> pretty<00:03:41.880> pretty

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that but I think that's pretty pretty

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.390 
that but I think that's pretty pretty
much<00:03:42.840> everything<00:03:43.200> obviously<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.980> need<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
much everything obviously you need the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.819 
much everything obviously you need the
redstone<00:03:45.000> engines<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.570> suck<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.989> items<00:03:46.650> out

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
redstone engines to suck the items out

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.030 
redstone engines to suck the items out
of<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.489> auto<00:03:47.610> crafting<00:03:48.120> tables<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.620> mass

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
of the auto crafting tables and the mass

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.130 
of the auto crafting tables and the mass
rioters<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.489> stuff<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.450> pretty<00:03:51.780> much<00:03:51.840> it's

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
rioters and stuff but pretty much it's

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.780 
rioters and stuff but pretty much it's
so<00:03:52.410> it's<00:03:52.860> pretty<00:03:53.100> simple<00:03:53.400> really<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.730> if

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
so it's pretty simple really and if

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.220 
so it's pretty simple really and if
you've<00:03:53.940> got<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> lot<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.299> coal<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.720> spare<00:03:54.989> then

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
you've got a lot of coal to spare then

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.350 
you've got a lot of coal to spare then
you<00:03:56.190> know<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.400> definitely<00:03:56.790> definitely

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
you know it's definitely definitely

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.550 
you know it's definitely definitely
worth<00:03:57.630> doing<00:03:57.959> I<00:03:58.519> think<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.880> that<00:03:59.940> everything

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
worth doing I think is that everything

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.170 
worth doing I think is that everything
yeah<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.799> seems<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.220> make<00:04:02.340> sense<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.820> so<00:04:03.090> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
yeah that seems to make sense so so the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.180 
yeah that seems to make sense so so the
only<00:04:03.360> ingredients<00:04:03.810> are<00:04:03.900> coal<00:04:04.110> obsidian<00:04:04.950> and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
only ingredients are coal obsidian and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.970 
only ingredients are coal obsidian and
slid<00:04:05.370> yeah<00:04:05.850> call<00:04:06.180> obsidian<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.930> Flint<00:04:07.260> and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
slid yeah call obsidian and Flint and

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.710 
slid yeah call obsidian and Flint and
then<00:04:08.160> obviously<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.670> can<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:09.360> can<00:04:09.480> make<00:04:09.600> it

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
then obviously you can you can make it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.720 
then obviously you can you can make it
as<00:04:09.810> simple<00:04:10.650> or<00:04:10.890> as<00:04:10.980> complicated<00:04:11.280> as<00:04:11.579> you<00:04:11.610> want

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
as simple or as complicated as you want

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.060 
as simple or as complicated as you want
for<00:04:12.150> this<00:04:12.239> just<00:04:12.810> kept<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.140> comparative<00:04:13.680> pre

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
for this just kept it comparative pre

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.789 
for this just kept it comparative pre
minimal<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.060> had<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.420> going<00:04:15.570> through<00:04:15.810> you

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
minimal and a had it going through you

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.420 
minimal and a had it going through you
could<00:04:17.010> presumably<00:04:17.579> have<00:04:17.940> your<00:04:18.239> quarry<00:04:18.720> or

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
could presumably have your quarry or

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.760 
could presumably have your quarry or
your<00:04:20.430> turtle<00:04:20.880> drop<00:04:21.060> off<00:04:21.299> drop<00:04:22.080> in<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.440> Flint

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
your turtle drop off drop in the Flint

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.510 
your turtle drop off drop in the Flint
and<00:04:22.950> obsidian<00:04:23.130> straight<00:04:23.640> into<00:04:23.970> these

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
and obsidian straight into these

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.219 
and obsidian straight into these
as<00:04:24.729> couldn't<00:04:25.210> yes<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.479> wouldn't<00:04:26.020> have<00:04:26.110> to

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
as couldn't yes so you wouldn't have to

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.900 
as couldn't yes so you wouldn't have to
do<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.710> manually<00:04:27.069> yeah<00:04:27.310> definitely<00:04:27.789> I<00:04:27.819> mean

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
do the manually yeah definitely I mean

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.610 
do the manually yeah definitely I mean
you<00:04:28.150> could<00:04:28.270> have<00:04:28.449> depended<00:04:29.110> on<00:04:29.169> what<00:04:29.319> setup

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
you could have depended on what setup

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.960 
you could have depended on what setup
you've<00:04:29.740> got<00:04:29.919> for<00:04:30.190> example<00:04:30.220> mean<00:04:30.699> I've<00:04:30.789> got<00:04:30.940> a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
you've got for example mean I've got a

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.029 
you've got for example mean I've got a
bunch<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.449> morning<00:04:31.810> turtles<00:04:32.289> so<00:04:32.860> luckily

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
bunch of morning turtles so luckily

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.320 
bunch of morning turtles so luckily
enough<00:04:33.280> I've<00:04:33.400> got<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.550> bunch<00:04:33.759> of<00:04:33.849> obsidian<00:04:34.120> from

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
enough I've got a bunch of obsidian from

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.029 
enough I've got a bunch of obsidian from
that<00:04:34.599> price<00:04:35.340> school<00:04:36.340> did<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.330> yeah<00:04:37.960> yes<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.919> mean

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
that price school did it yeah yes I mean

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.740 
that price school did it yeah yes I mean
you<00:04:39.280> can<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.789> can<00:04:39.909> as<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.120> side<00:04:40.389> you<00:04:40.539> can<00:04:40.629> make

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
you can you can as a side you can make

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.300 
you can you can as a side you can make
it<00:04:40.870> as<00:04:40.960> complex<00:04:41.560> or<00:04:41.740> as<00:04:41.830> simple<00:04:41.949> as<00:04:42.190> you<00:04:42.280> want

hook up downstairs or frame right
problem<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.289> could<00:04:48.069> connect<00:04:48.940> up<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.270> delivery

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
problem I could connect up the delivery

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.320 
problem I could connect up the delivery
point<00:04:50.379> that<00:04:51.280> we<00:04:51.370> talked<00:04:51.789> about<00:04:51.879> in<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.150> past

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
point that we talked about in a past

automatically everything that's coal

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.490 
automatically everything that's coal
could<00:04:57.970> get<00:04:58.150> delivered<00:04:58.659> here<00:04:58.690> automatically
