ability to create room separation lines
this<00:02:26.650> lets<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.069> close<00:02:27.310> off<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.579> room<00:02:27.849> boundary

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
this lets you close off a room boundary

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.699 
this lets you close off a room boundary
when<00:02:28.540> there's<00:02:28.719> not<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> wall<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.349> do<00:02:29.500> so

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
when there's not a wall to do so

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.039 
when there's not a wall to do so
automatically<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.629> launch<00:02:31.629> the<00:02:31.870> room

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
automatically I launch the room

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.289 
automatically I launch the room
separation<00:02:32.680> line<00:02:32.859> tool<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.340> simply<00:02:33.969> trace

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
separation line tool and simply trace

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.209 
separation line tool and simply trace
around<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.750> edge<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.170> balcony<00:02:35.349> using<00:02:36.099> the

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
around the edge of the balcony using the

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:43.620 
around the edge of the balcony using the
line<00:02:36.400> tool

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.710 

you

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.480 

once<00:02:50.720> I've<00:02:50.900> created<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.500> separation<00:02:52.100> line<00:02:52.280> a

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
once I've created the separation line a

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.070 
once I've created the separation line a
press<00:02:52.880> escape<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.390> exit<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:53.960> tool

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.290 

now<00:02:57.830> when<00:02:58.010> i<00:02:58.040> launched<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.520> room<00:02:58.700> tool<00:02:58.910> again

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
now when i launched the room tool again

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.540 
now when i launched the room tool again
you<00:02:59.840> can<00:03:00.020> see<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.470> only<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.920> balcony<00:03:01.370> area
