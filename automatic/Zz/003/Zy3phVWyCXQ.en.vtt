00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.529
 all the studies that can be seen at 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.880
 right to left for the remuneration of 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.560
 the breeder is taken into account 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.060
 which is not always the case of 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.280
 anyway it can not do a 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.079
 average at 30 years at 3,134 price paid from 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.489
 anyway it will hardly satisfy 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.329
 no breeder in any case not in mayenne 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.290
 if there are others who are more 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.940
 performers elsewhere that they us the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.210
 say and who explains to us how to 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.100
 do if the only if the only door that 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.949
 we propose the calyx this data 6% 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.730
 even 10% 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.650
 because until then they have always 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.790
 given from 0 to 2 and here we say we will 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.960
 give volumes even if it's not 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.670
 overpaid they will still say yes 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.309
 because that's really what's at stake 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.440
 of today and by the golem and the price 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.650
 paid correctly this summer we want 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.409
 try to extinguish the mobilization 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.290
 union as clear as that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.340
 the initiative of the Brittany departments 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.470
 country of loire normandy 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.250
 it was agreed to organize for 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.600
 try to disrupt lactalis so we 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.790
 fell in agreement brittany country of 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.310
 loire normandie sas and very honestly 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.780
 very well passed and a little hi 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.369
 especially to those who 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.009
 touch that have mobilized strongly 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.300
 the sleeve and adorns it but also when 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.350
 even make a quarter coming from the hour and 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.840
 of eure and loir where there is still 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.760
 between 70 and 150 breeders out 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.620
 department very honestly it was 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.300
 also an important sign towards 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.220
 lactalis groups that could 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.840
 mobilize on their side and so must 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.580
 know how to say it when because when 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.720
 not happen and coordinated we know we 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.040
 to say that when it works well 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.950
 must also know how to say it say you have 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.420
 all received mail from lactalis 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.090
 who discouraged some of them 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.500
 come here we must recognize him 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.780
 because it is extremely well written 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.780
 we have the impression that they give you 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.920
 by mount and wonder it's prices 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.920
 which are 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.360
 the canton when we do not follow it very 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.180
 near and prices that are interesting 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.040
 there are volumes extraordinary things 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.910
 since for three years we had not 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.390
 the right to make volume at 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.640
 lactalis 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.290
 there you realize there is 1 6% 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.099
 guarantee it's something 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.110
 extraordinary 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.970
 it does not make you want to go out 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.980
 really important solidarity that we 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.360
 either the lactalis producer or not so 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.550
 to mobilize 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.080
 it's very important that we can 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.970
 continue to work in open 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.450
 organization and structure and to play 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.680
 collective 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.180
 so that's something too 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.250
 exceed what goes beyond thinking of 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.560
 lactalis producers who also played 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.180
 for the producers of his home or 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.140
 private sector is also at the level of 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.030
 hulls of cooperatives 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.230
 we shake important if we go there 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.000
 the profession we really want always 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.040
 to have the hand at the level of the senior 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.299
 levels of negotiations at 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.739
 volume management of Tamils ​​is 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.970
 also be there for really 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.470
 to be around the table regularly 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.819
 to talk about the price of the liter of 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.360
 milk we really need to fight 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.360
 against this blow 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.840
 communal apartments in our area 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.950
 alain is that our breeders live and 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.150
 that they have morale and who sees 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.770
 always the end of the tunnel whatever 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.650
 their production is even worse 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.540
 for pork or even poultry 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.190
 recently since we have also denounced the 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.569
 son contracts tells me that he wrote to 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.620
 mediator to make proposals 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.390
 alternatives 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.890
 after I said if it's the mail that 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.550
 you sent the breeders Saturday his 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.560
 convinces nobody 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.970
 the breeders was losing interest and 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.900
 it was not that the hundred thousand 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.430
 nine hundred and fifty thousand or their 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.810
 standards cells that went off that's 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.760
 also people who had entities 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.900
 more important are fed up and who 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.209
 believe more in the job as it 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.739
 is who today it is proposed by 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.150
 our agribusinesses as much 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.519
 private than cooperative so today 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.230
 there is a real malaise it's a 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.459
 trust with their company and the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.840
 loneliness and company if 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.100
 look at the last 15 years less 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.040
 that a judge like that by day 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.410
 of today I would say that trust 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.090
 is broken so all that I said I 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.870
 said it moaned when everyone had 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.980
 trust in your companies 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.140
 now it's over 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.700
 you promised so much you have 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.160
 always forgive the addicts of the year 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.299
 last so even social gave them back 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.620
 that's when you criticize the 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.390
 cooperatives have to know how to say it because 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.100
 that we knew how to criticize them when sodial was 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.540
 stung 5 euros now now the 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.579
 5 euros you kept them of the year 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.350
 last it is you who have to pay the 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.930
 cheaper is sure the breeder ethics 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.669
 etc have necessarily pro ff and sisters there 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.320
 is well written that it is lactalis 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.760
 brittany pays de loire to pay the 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.130
 cheaper over the last twelve months 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.169
 so I think you can not 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.350
 to say that you have not enjoy the 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.350
 system
