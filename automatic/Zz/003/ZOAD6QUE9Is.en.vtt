I thought there's no point in showing
you<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:26.400> lackluster<00:00:26.670> effort<00:00:27.150> training

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you a really lackluster effort training

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.000 
you a really lackluster effort training
because<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.140> found<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> really<00:00:28.529> difficult<00:00:28.740> today

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
because I found a really difficult today

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.980 
because I found a really difficult today
and<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.310> anyone<00:00:29.609> else<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.880> struggling<00:00:30.689> at

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
and then if anyone else is struggling at

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.749 
and then if anyone else is struggling at
the<00:00:31.019> moment<00:00:31.170> all<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> methods<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.309> got<00:00:32.640> me

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the moment all the methods that got me

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.720 
the moment all the methods that got me
to<00:00:33.000> twelve<00:00:33.719> thousand<00:00:34.260> coins<00:00:34.410> haven't<00:00:35.370> really

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
to twelve thousand coins haven't really

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.940 
to twelve thousand coins haven't really
been<00:00:35.850> working<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.570> don't<00:00:36.840> understand<00:00:37.380> what

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950

been working and I don't understand what
has<00:00:38.129> changed<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.790> thought<00:00:38.910> I'd<00:00:39.059> mix<00:00:39.570> things

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
has changed so I thought I'd mix things

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.569 
has changed so I thought I'd mix things
up<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.079> little<00:00:40.200> bit<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.559> show<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> my<00:00:41.100> starting

found important when I was playing the

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.360 
found important when I was playing the
beta<00:03:40.879> in<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.209> demo<00:03:41.540> was<00:03:42.019> passing<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.799> really

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
beta in the demo was passing is really

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.250 
beta in the demo was passing is really
really<00:03:43.669> critical<00:03:43.819> so<00:03:44.150> everyone's<00:03:44.569> team<00:03:44.810> has

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
really critical so everyone's team has

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.710 
really critical so everyone's team has
pretty<00:03:45.680> decent<00:03:46.250> passing<00:03:46.790> from<00:03:47.299> like<00:03:47.540> the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
pretty decent passing from like the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.140 
pretty decent passing from like the
midfield<00:03:48.199> up<00:03:48.409> and<00:03:48.680> I'm<00:03:48.859> hoping<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.669> is

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
midfield up and I'm hoping that is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.030 
midfield up and I'm hoping that is
really<00:03:50.479> gonna<00:03:50.599> help<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.930> team<00:03:51.139> out<00:03:51.319> in<00:03:51.530> terms
