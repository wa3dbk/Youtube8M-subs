the two wires they provide you with are

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.450 
the two wires they provide you with are
a<00:01:11.330> lot<00:01:11.750> shorter<00:01:12.049> than<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.590> Apple<00:01:13.070> standard

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
a lot shorter than the Apple standard

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.090 
a lot shorter than the Apple standard
ones<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.479> output<00:01:14.960> one<00:01:15.170> is<00:01:15.380> for<00:01:15.619> charging<00:01:15.979> the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
ones the output one is for charging the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.609 
ones the output one is for charging the
device<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.390> input<00:01:17.780> one<00:01:17.960> for<00:01:18.229> charging

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
device and the input one for charging

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.620 
device and the input one for charging
the<00:01:18.710> battery<00:01:19.009> itself<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.789> bad<00:01:20.000> thing<00:01:20.270> I<00:01:20.450> found

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
the battery itself the bad thing I found

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.599 
the battery itself the bad thing I found
out<00:01:20.869> about<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.530> wires<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:22.219> since<00:01:22.460> they

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
out about the wires is that since they

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.599 
out about the wires is that since they
are<00:01:22.670> shorter<00:01:23.180> they<00:01:23.869> can<00:01:24.020> break<00:01:24.320> or<00:01:24.649> rip<00:01:25.070> easier

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
are shorter they can break or rip easier

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.609 
are shorter they can break or rip easier
since<00:01:26.119> sometimes<00:01:26.600> you'll<00:01:26.780> find<00:01:27.079> your<00:01:27.259> battery

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
since sometimes you'll find your battery

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.289 
since sometimes you'll find your battery
hanging<00:01:28.100> out<00:01:28.250> from<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.640> wall<00:01:28.820> plug<00:01:29.060> because

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
hanging out from the wall plug because

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.599 
hanging out from the wall plug because
the<00:01:29.689> charger<00:01:30.530> is<00:01:30.619> not<00:01:30.649> long<00:01:31.009> enough<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:31.429> will

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
the charger is not long enough this will

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.910 
the charger is not long enough this will
give<00:01:31.969> attention<00:01:32.359> to<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.899> wire<00:01:33.079> and<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.799> can

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
give attention to the wire and it can

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.740 
give attention to the wire and it can
eventually<00:01:34.159> break<00:01:34.609> and<00:01:34.850> as<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.179> can<00:01:35.329> see<00:01:35.509> here

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
eventually break and as you can see here

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.719 
eventually break and as you can see here
this<00:01:35.929> is<00:01:36.109> exactly<00:01:36.289> the<00:01:36.710> problem<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.159> I

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
this is exactly the problem that I

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.300 
this is exactly the problem that I
actually<00:01:38.359> got<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.109> cable<00:01:39.530> doesn't<00:01:39.740> work<00:01:40.070> now

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
actually got the cable doesn't work now

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.789 
actually got the cable doesn't work now
but<00:01:40.999> it's<00:01:41.299> not<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.479> problem<00:01:41.840> because<00:01:42.170> the

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
but it's not a problem because the

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.249 
but it's not a problem because the
charger<00:01:43.490> also<00:01:43.700> works<00:01:44.060> with<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.659> Apple

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
charger also works with the Apple

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.109 
charger also works with the Apple
standard<00:01:45.679> wire<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.310> don't<00:01:46.609> need<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.909> worry

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
standard wire so you don't need to worry

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.209 
standard wire so you don't need to worry
about<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.539> just<00:01:48.109> MOBAs<00:01:48.469> gum<00:01:48.799> cloths<00:01:49.070> can

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
about that just MOBAs gum cloths can

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.980 
about that just MOBAs gum cloths can
charge<00:01:49.609> your<00:01:49.789> iPhone<00:01:50.119> up<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:50.450> three<00:01:50.780> times

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
charge your iPhone up to three times

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.830 
charge your iPhone up to three times
which<00:01:51.619> is<00:01:51.770> quite<00:01:52.070> inaccurate<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:52.969> iPhone

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
which is quite inaccurate and the iPhone

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.749 
which is quite inaccurate and the iPhone
model<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.289> also<00:01:54.439> not<00:01:54.770> mentioned<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:55.460> that

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
model is also not mentioned so that

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.789 
model is also not mentioned so that
theoretically<00:01:56.450> means<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.319> could<00:01:57.499> charge

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
theoretically means that it could charge

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.980 
theoretically means that it could charge
the<00:01:58.039> eye<00:01:58.069> of<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.579> first<00:01:58.850> generation<00:01:59.630> iPhone

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
the eye of the first generation iPhone

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.929 
the eye of the first generation iPhone
up<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:00.439> three<00:02:00.679> times<00:02:00.920> for<00:02:01.159> example<00:02:01.579> but<00:02:01.759> not

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
up to three times for example but not

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.730 
up to three times for example but not
the<00:02:02.090> iPhone<00:02:02.420> 4s<00:02:02.659> however<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:03.590> something

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
the iPhone 4s however it's something

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.469 
the iPhone 4s however it's something
that<00:02:04.159> actually<00:02:04.369> managed<00:02:04.969> to<00:02:04.999> charge<00:02:05.270> my

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
that actually managed to charge my

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.529 
that actually managed to charge my
iPhone<00:02:05.929> 4s<00:02:06.170> two<00:02:07.039> times<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:08.119> was<00:02:08.300> actually

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
iPhone 4s two times and I was actually

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.320 
iPhone 4s two times and I was actually
using<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.710> too<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.100> exciti<00:02:10.460> bad<00:02:10.670> results<00:02:11.150> at

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
using it too so exciti bad results at

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.590 
using it too so exciti bad results at
all<00:02:12.280> so<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.310> guess<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.670> company<00:02:14.030> didn't<00:02:14.360> lie

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
all so I guess the company didn't lie

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.260 
all so I guess the company didn't lie
about<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.050> backup<00:02:15.860> batteries<00:02:16.340> battery<00:02:17.000> life

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
about the backup batteries battery life

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.210 
about the backup batteries battery life
but<00:02:17.810> charging<00:02:18.260> an<00:02:18.350> iPad<00:02:18.710> with<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.190> a

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
but charging an iPad with that is a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.460 
but charging an iPad with that is a
different<00:02:19.700> story<00:02:19.970> because<00:02:20.180> iPads<00:02:20.989> batteries

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
different story because iPads batteries

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.800 
different story because iPads batteries
are<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.920> lot<00:02:22.250> faster<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.390> would<00:02:23.540> like<00:02:23.690> to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
are a lot faster if you would like to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.460 
are a lot faster if you would like to
have<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.019> more

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
have a more

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.350 
have a more
capacity<00:02:24.950> bagging<00:02:25.340> battery<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:26.060> he<00:02:26.180> should

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
capacity bagging battery then he should

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.530 
capacity bagging battery then he should
check<00:02:26.570> out<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.050> gum<00:02:27.740> max<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.580> their<00:02:29.090> website

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
useful if you have for example a long

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.730 
useful if you have for example a long
journey<00:02:47.060> or<00:02:47.570> you're<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.140> happy<00:02:48.410> with

product that you have to charge with the
USB<00:02:53.270> cable<00:02:53.390> I'm<00:02:54.110> giving<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.770> 9<00:02:55.160> out<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.370> 10

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
USB cable I'm giving this a 9 out of 10

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.370 
USB cable I'm giving this a 9 out of 10
just<00:02:55.880> because<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.450> wires<00:02:56.690> could<00:02:57.110> break

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
just because the wires could break

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.650 
just because the wires could break
easier<00:02:57.830> because<00:02:58.520> they're<00:02:58.910> short<00:02:59.270> but<00:02:59.570> that's

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
easier because they're short but that's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.449 
easier because they're short but that's
not<00:02:59.959> really<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.290> problem<00:03:00.380> as<00:03:00.920> we<00:03:01.130> have<00:03:01.280> seen

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
not really a problem as we have seen
