00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:58.390 

0a<00:00:49.930> 0a<00:00:50.470> kanaka

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.790 

we<00:00:58.640> have<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> motherboard<00:00:59.330> here<00:00:59.720> one<00:01:00.680> of

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
we have the motherboard here one of

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.770 
we have the motherboard here one of
those<00:01:00.950> guy

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
those guy

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.899 
those guy
you<00:01:03.140> pickin<00:01:04.840> HDMI<00:01:05.840> USB<00:01:06.290> network<00:01:07.630> audio<00:01:09.909> to

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
you pickin HDMI USB network audio to

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.999 
you pickin HDMI USB network audio to
video<00:01:11.090> outputs<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.049> I<00:01:12.110> can<00:01:12.290> have<00:01:12.409> two<00:01:12.619> screens

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
video outputs so I can have two screens

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.010 
video outputs so I can have two screens
hooked<00:01:13.340> up<00:01:13.490> just<00:01:14.150> from<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.509> board<00:01:14.750> no

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
hooked up just from the board no

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.359 
hooked up just from the board no
external<00:01:16.150> video<00:01:17.150> cards<00:01:17.770> also<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.950> older

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
external video cards also the older

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.430 
external video cards also the older
style<00:01:19.670> ps2<00:01:20.450> ports<00:01:20.810> there's<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:21.050> lot<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.229> those

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
style ps2 ports there's a lot of those

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.830 
style ps2 ports there's a lot of those
keyboards<00:01:21.979> proton<00:01:22.399> so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.719 

fully<00:01:26.380> supports<00:01:26.829> two<00:01:27.009> channels<00:01:27.460> or<00:01:27.549> at<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
fully supports two channels or at the

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:37.290 
fully supports two channels or at the
memory<00:01:28.500> let's<00:01:29.500> ok<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.939> also<00:01:34.119> have

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:46.390 

AMD<00:01:38.080> processor<00:01:38.860> here<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:43.330> fascinating

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400

what you're going to want to do get a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.610 
what you're going to want to do get a
more<00:01:51.230> stable<00:01:51.500> surface<00:01:51.860> than<00:01:52.220> what<00:01:52.400> I<00:01:52.430> have

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
look on the edges of the processor they

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.340 
look on the edges of the processor they
have<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> little<00:02:02.790> tiny<00:02:03.230> you<00:02:04.230> say<00:02:04.410> that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
look and match up the pattern pattern on

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.680 
look and match up the pattern pattern on
the<00:02:49.250> board<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.959> can<00:02:51.140> see<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.440> whole<00:02:51.650> white

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the board you can see the whole white

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.360 
the board you can see the whole white
knocked<00:02:53.690> out<00:02:53.900> spots<00:02:55.540> then<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.630> got<00:02:56.810> your

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
you can see those sides where hook up to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.130 
you can see those sides where hook up to
the<00:03:13.680> side<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.760> board

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:41.440 

right<00:03:22.140> under<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.799> board<00:03:24.859> say<00:03:25.859> that

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.440
