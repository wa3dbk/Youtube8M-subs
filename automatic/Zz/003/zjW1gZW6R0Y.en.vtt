00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.950
 Here not only doctors can force us 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.080
 be treated for what we do not have 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.680
 serious attitude horoscope hurts 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.809
 psyche 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.370
 and therefore the fate of the American 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.769
 scientists warn infatuation 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.030
 astrology leads to intense 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.800
 behavior and depression and bad 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.020
 predictions become excuses for 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.310
 psychology fans figured out 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.020
 horoscopes are constantly in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.730
 waiting for bad events in the end 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.109
 there is instability in making 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.210
 making and this is really 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.189
 can cause many life 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.399
 failures so get carried away is better not 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.370
 astrology and the country our universe is still 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.790
 can we please and still surprise and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.380
 surprise 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.149
 scientists are discovering new and new 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.010
 miracles about them and talk to the main 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.460
 journal editor science in focus not 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.840
 speak Bykovsky medicaid 1 5 2 but then 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.870
 that our katka is not the only one 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 the universe is already all know where he is 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.510
 discovers new worlds astronomer here 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.100
 recently discovered the largest 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.410
 spiral galaxy and then 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.730
 rectangular than they are so original 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.300
 is it worth us about them so seriously 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.579
 think in space rarely meet 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.799
 squares and stuff the right figure with 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.110
 right angles one these two galaxies 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.540
 more precisely this is a former galaxy 2 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 colliding their speeds slightly 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.560
 crumpled and this is a rare case for such 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:20.880
 it would happen to our galaxy 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:22.170
 look for sure to happen just 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.850
 neighboring galaxy 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.070
 moving towards each other and in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.590
 eventually cross but it will be 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.880
 still not very soon total how much 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.609
 I donâ€™t remember the letter 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.619
 Trouble to worry about 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.630
 how do we study space in general ? 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.360
 super instrumentation times we can drop in 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.280
 on there are tens of light years of millions 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.890
 light years ahead and I ventured even 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.560
 billions yes used to study it once 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.630
 simple optical telescopes but they are not 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.850
 omnipotent and after some amount 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.829
 light years just stop catching 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.939
 There is plenty of light for this 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:59.530
 devices with their help you can build 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.299
 distance steps using complex 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.810
 calculations and familiar to the country from us 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.119
 located 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.950
 for example the very eyes which now 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.340
 we hold the brightest image then us 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.170
 scientists say that's over 100 million 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.510
 light years we saw the planet on 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.730
 which is the water that's when 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.170
 statement is done how much objectivity 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.079
 in such and such everything is really up to 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.880
 errors from flying well views 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.739
 this kind is 100% because 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.230
 hydrogen at any distance gives one 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.239
 look at the same spectrum 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.190
 such information is relatively close 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.530
 two billion light years from earth 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.299
 found the source of tusa some incredible 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.920
 by force a little farther away the same quasar 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.950
 which produces a pair that is water 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.510
 what do you say the beauty of the current is all 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.569
 practically in the universe and for extremely 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.280
 least stars 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.069
 galaxies every large objects so 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.439
 or else radiates they radiates in general 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.099
 them too this electricity in different 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.959
 forms 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.780
 it's just a very big source of sound 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.519
 as for the giant bazaar which 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.650
 found right on the border actually 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.969
 the universe of this giant is 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.280
 the device it does not produce water 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.959
 of course because under it most likely 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.569
 leder condra who turns everything up 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.579
 what is necessary to stretch and life 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.590
 actually my water is no decent 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.620
 kind of creepy is generally only on earth 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.389
 Now our most curious viewers 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.099
 sure to ask a question if you 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.189
 pronounce on the edge of the universe and there for 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.010
 extremely that for such a figurative 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.409
 terms we don't know exactly how it works 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.120
 just that is, they say the void is still 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.650
 here it is generally for me some 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.560
 amazing black both horns a 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.199
 principle more or less and but there are voids 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.000
 yes you know how you are not a piece of steel 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.560
 and inside the bloodstream like this 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.109
 distributed what turned out to be inside 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.260
 emptiness so everything happened to the universe 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.870
 delivery time has passed the era of ionization and 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.400
 and began to pull away for pieces of divorce 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.290
 galaxies group of galaxies 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.599
 and between them is a big void 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.400
 some kind of giant power ordinary 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.700
 substances can she all filled with dark 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.489
 a substance that we can not 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.190
 dilute well here with satisfied tackles 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.290
 questions and grew corrected by answering and 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.180
 accordingly now especially 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.680
 the eve of the New Year holidays in 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.569
 the press will appear huge 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.000
 the amount of all sorts of sensations is wrong 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.830
 I understand how a person can figure out what 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.600
 really corresponds to the truth that 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.549
 it is embellished by the rank of it in fact 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.500
 if people are seriously interested 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.270
 island issues in general science then 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.780
 better chinese time specialized 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.410
 editions 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.080
 it is popular science is beautiful 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.330
 just read what they saw on 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.650
 hubble telescope shot burning eyes out 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.870
 wait for us burning base 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.610
 people in this league well, that the flight of roofs 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.990
 scary let's just for a second now 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.580
 just a plus side talk about this 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.740
 interesting phenomenon he called pro and 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.020
 further this tendency of man to recognize 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.560
 among the multitude of reference 5 interest in 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.639
 the face is actually likely 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.710
 single spiral galaxy which 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.130
 gravitational lens through which 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.050
 passed light talked decide ideology 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.430
 no thank you big board we spoke to 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.780
 chief editor of science magazine in 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.110
 I will look for a focus on his bank by the way 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.110
 by saying
