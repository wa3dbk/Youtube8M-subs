let's<00:05:00.459> see<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:00.669> can<00:05:00.789> we<00:05:00.849> do<00:05:00.969> this<00:05:01.059> to<00:05:01.179> go<00:05:01.330> I

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
let's see you can we do this to go I

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.279 
let's see you can we do this to go I
guess<00:05:01.959> so<00:05:02.759> it<00:05:03.759> is<00:05:03.879> another<00:05:04.119> one<00:05:04.270> that's<00:05:04.479> for

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
guess so it is another one that's for

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.769 
guess so it is another one that's for
