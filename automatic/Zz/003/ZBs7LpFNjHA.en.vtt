00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
and I think this maybe will solve some

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.320 
and I think this maybe will solve some
people's<00:02:13.870> problems<00:02:14.400> obviously<00:02:15.400> there's<00:02:16.180> no

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.270 
changed when it's running on a battery
power<00:02:55.360> source<00:02:55.720> rather<00:02:56.110> than<00:02:56.590> plugged<00:02:57.070> into

the electrical outlet and I've been
using<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.739> for<00:02:59.890> about<00:03:00.010> eight<00:03:00.220> hours<00:03:00.250> and

using this for about eight hours and
it's<00:03:01.300> still<00:03:01.720> running<00:03:01.900> strong<00:03:02.670> okay<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.000> know

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
it's still running strong okay so I know

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:12.930 
it's still running strong okay so I know
what<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.600> read<00:03:05.530> all<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.890> specs<00:03:06.220> there<00:03:11.940> but

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
for about maybe seven or eight hours now

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.479 
for about maybe seven or eight hours now
you<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.700> check<00:03:19.000> how<00:03:19.180> much<00:03:19.329> power<00:03:19.630> there<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.140> I

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
you can check how much power there is I

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.750 
you can check how much power there is I
push<00:03:21.489> this<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:22.780> only<00:03:22.989> down<00:03:23.290> one<00:03:23.549> it's<00:03:24.549> down

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
push this it's only down one it's down

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.850 
push this it's only down one it's down
to<00:03:24.910> three<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.660> let's<00:03:26.230> say<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.500> went<00:03:26.680> eight

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
to three so let's say it went eight

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.830 
to three so let's say it went eight
hours<00:03:27.310> well<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.910> don't<00:03:28.209> know<00:03:28.299> I'm<00:03:28.480> going<00:03:28.720> to

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
hours well I don't know I'm going to

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.449 
hours well I don't know I'm going to
leave<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.079> in<00:03:29.200> plugged<00:03:29.620> into<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.370> I'll

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
leave it in plugged into this and I'll

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.150 
leave it in plugged into this and I'll
report<00:03:30.790> back<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.360> how<00:03:31.690> long<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.680> unit
