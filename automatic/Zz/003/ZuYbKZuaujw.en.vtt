slow<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> mean<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.719> ultimate<00:01:33.780> thing<00:01:34.170> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
slow I mean the ultimate thing is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.590 
slow I mean the ultimate thing is
testing<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> would<00:01:35.399> set<00:01:35.549> up<00:01:35.609> an<00:01:35.789> ad<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.210> would

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
testing so I would set up an ad I would

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
testing so I would set up an ad I would
