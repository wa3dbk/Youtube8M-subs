something different with the footage
it's<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.159> guess<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.150> like

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it's just I guess it's a way of like

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940

trailer without getting into kind of
trouble<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.560> guess<00:01:22.770> that's<00:01:22.979> why<00:01:23.070> they<00:01:23.189> did<00:01:23.340> it

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
trouble I guess that's why they did it

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.570

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
in the film and I remember showing that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.960 
in the film and I remember showing that
to<00:02:22.349> Simon<00:02:22.739> Pegg<00:02:22.950> over<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.640> over<00:02:23.849> again

to Simon Pegg over and over again

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.699

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
because not only was the machete murder

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.059

quite<00:02:26.400> awesome<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.380> had<00:02:28.560> an<00:02:28.650> amazing

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069

quite awesome but it had an amazing
piano<00:02:29.459> sting<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.540> went<00:02:30.599> wrong

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
