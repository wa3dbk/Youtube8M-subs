00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
that when they touch the motor knows

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.759 
that when they touch the motor knows
it's<00:00:31.730> hit<00:00:31.849> something<00:00:32.440> it's<00:00:33.440> got<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.620> little

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
it's hit something it's got a little

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.780 
it's hit something it's got a little
control<00:00:34.190> system<00:00:34.610> a<00:00:36.220> really<00:00:37.220> little<00:00:37.489> control

timers some relays stuff like that and
that's<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.320> basic<00:00:45.680> mower<00:00:45.970> that<00:00:47.350> just

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
that's the basic mower that just

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.729 
that's the basic mower that just
responds<00:00:48.920> to<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.220> bumpers<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.449> flaps

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
responds to the bumpers and the flaps

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.850 
responds to the bumpers and the flaps
but<00:00:52.210> it's<00:00:53.210> also<00:00:53.449> got<00:00:53.809> I<00:00:54.140> don't<00:00:54.559> know<00:00:54.650> if<00:00:54.769> you

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
but it's also got I don't know if you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.590 
but it's also got I don't know if you
can<00:00:55.010> see<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:57.549> some<00:00:58.549> coils<00:00:58.820> down<00:00:59.119> here<00:00:59.420> that

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
can see it some coils down here that

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.609 
can see it some coils down here that
listen<00:00:59.900> to<00:01:00.019> my<00:01:00.199> electronic<00:01:00.650> dog<00:01:01.070> fence<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:03.500> a

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619 
listen to my electronic dog fence and a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.670 
listen to my electronic dog fence and a
circuit<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:03.979> got<00:01:04.129> off<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.369> internet<00:01:04.699> that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
circuit I got off the internet that

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.830 
circuit I got off the internet that
reads<00:01:06.680> those<00:01:06.890> guys<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.549> treats<00:01:08.330> them<00:01:08.540> just

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
reads those guys and treats them just

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.660 
reads those guys and treats them just
like<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:09.320> bumpers<00:01:09.620> or<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.890> flap<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:10.310> whenever

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
like the bumpers or the flap so whenever

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
like the bumpers or the flap so whenever
it<00:01:10.760> hits<00:01:10.850> something<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.300> goes<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.600> other

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
it hits something it goes in the other

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.930 
it hits something it goes in the other
direction<00:01:12.340> until<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.400> hits<00:01:13.640> something<00:01:13.820> and

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
direction until it hits something and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.190 
direction until it hits something and
then<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.180> goes<00:01:14.270> in<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.450> other<00:01:14.570> direction<00:01:15.460> so

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
then it goes in the other direction so

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.860 
then it goes in the other direction so
let<00:01:18.200> me<00:01:18.320> turn<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.590> over<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.030> take<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.630> look<00:01:20.780> at

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
let me turn it over and take a look at

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.560 
let me turn it over and take a look at
the<00:01:20.990> cutters

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.690 

it's<00:01:27.140> three<00:01:27.380> motors<00:01:27.800> with<00:01:28.040> little<00:01:28.280> plastic

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
it's three motors with little plastic

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.720 
it's three motors with little plastic
wheels<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.510> them<00:01:30.190> little<00:01:31.190> razor<00:01:31.370> blades

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
wheels on them little razor blades

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.920 
wheels on them little razor blades
attached<00:01:32.150> to<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.510> wheels<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:34.570> that's<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:35.810> for

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
attached to the wheels and that's it for

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.060 
attached to the wheels and that's it for
the<00:01:36.050> cutting<00:01:36.460> now<00:01:37.460> you<00:01:37.520> can<00:01:37.700> see<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:39.040> what<00:01:40.040> I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
the cutting now you can see the what I

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.770 
the cutting now you can see the what I
salvaged<00:01:40.580> from<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.790> Barbra<00:01:41.120> Jeep<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:41.450> motors

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
salvaged from the Barbra Jeep the motors

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.250 
salvaged from the Barbra Jeep the motors
and<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.080> wheels<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.680> the<00:01:42.770> chassis<00:01:47.080> it's<00:01:48.080> got

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
and the wheels and the chassis it's got

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.550 
and the wheels and the chassis it's got
an<00:01:48.440> independent<00:01:49.130> suspension<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.290> doesn't

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
an independent suspension so it doesn't

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.050 
an independent suspension so it doesn't
get<00:01:51.620> hung<00:01:51.800> up<00:01:51.920> too<00:01:52.100> much<00:01:52.250> I'm<00:01:52.670> going<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:52.940> show

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
get hung up too much I'm going to show

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.170 
get hung up too much I'm going to show
you<00:01:53.120> how<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.360> works<00:01:53.540> I<00:01:54.880> don't<00:01:55.880> know<00:01:56.030> if<00:01:56.120> you

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
you how that works I don't know if you

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.050 
you how that works I don't know if you
can<00:01:56.240> see<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:57.400> anyway<00:01:58.400> without<00:01:58.520> this<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.970> gets

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
can see it anyway without this it gets

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.310 
can see it anyway without this it gets
stuck<00:01:59.300> all<00:01:59.480> the<00:01:59.570> time<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.760> that's<00:02:02.630> that's<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
stuck all the time so that's that's the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.190 
stuck all the time so that's that's the
mower<00:02:03.470> let<00:02:03.710> me<00:02:03.800> plug<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.430> in<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.640> turn<00:02:04.730> it<00:02:04.790> on

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
mower let me plug it in and turn it on

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.420 
mower let me plug it in and turn it on
and<00:02:06.200> one<00:02:06.380> more<00:02:06.560> thing<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.800> didn't<00:02:07.040> show<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.190> the

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
and one more thing I didn't show you the

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.900 
and one more thing I didn't show you the
steering<00:02:09.010> steering<00:02:10.010> is<00:02:10.100> mostly<00:02:10.369> random<00:02:10.790> it's

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
steering steering is mostly random it's

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.820 
steering steering is mostly random it's
not<00:02:11.030> controlled<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:12.080> there<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.530> little

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
not controlled but there is this little

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.700 
not controlled but there is this little
scrubber<00:02:13.160> here<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.390> when<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.840> mower<00:02:15.590> is

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
scrubber here so that when the mower is

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.890 
scrubber here so that when the mower is
going<00:02:15.770> forwards<00:02:16.460> tries<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.420> turn<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.750> wheel

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
going forwards tries to turn the wheel

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.240 
going forwards tries to turn the wheel
to<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.110> right<00:02:18.170> when<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.890> motors<00:02:19.130> going

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
to the right when the motors going

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.500 
to the right when the motors going
backwards<00:02:19.700> tries<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.030> turn<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.270> wood<00:02:20.360> or<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
backwards tries to turn the wood or the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.270 
backwards tries to turn the wood or the
left<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.590> doesn't<00:02:21.800> go<00:02:21.860> back<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.130> forth

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
left so it doesn't go back and forth

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.220 
left so it doesn't go back and forth
over<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.520> same<00:02:22.700> path<00:02:22.910> all<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.120> time<00:02:23.330> all

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
over the same path all the time all

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:56.050 
over the same path all the time all
right<00:02:24.320> let<00:02:24.530> me<00:02:24.590> turn<00:02:24.740> it<00:02:24.890> on

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:04:36.879 

you

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:05:15.060 

you

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.430 

Oh<00:05:17.100> runs<00:05:18.100> like<00:05:18.220> this<00:05:18.400> for<00:05:18.610> about<00:05:18.790> an<00:05:18.910> hour

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
Oh runs like this for about an hour

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.590 
Oh runs like this for about an hour
maybe<00:05:20.440> hour<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:20.830> a<00:05:20.860> half<00:05:21.090> gets<00:05:22.090> most<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.510> the

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
maybe hour and a half gets most of the

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.980 
maybe hour and a half gets most of the
grass<00:05:22.810> in<00:05:23.050> this<00:05:23.200> yard<00:05:27.180> but<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.390> know<00:05:28.510> leaves<00:05:28.840> a

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
grass in this yard but you know leaves a

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.440 
grass in this yard but you know leaves a
little<00:05:29.080> bit<00:05:29.230> on<00:05:29.980> trade-off<00:05:30.430> that<00:05:30.610> eventually

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
little bit on trade-off that eventually

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.930 
little bit on trade-off that eventually
it<00:05:31.690> gets<00:05:31.780> it<00:05:31.930> all<00:05:32.100> this<00:05:33.100> yard<00:05:33.340> hasn't<00:05:33.610> been<00:05:33.730> cut

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
it gets it all this yard hasn't been cut

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.580 
it gets it all this yard hasn't been cut
by<00:05:34.060> anything<00:05:34.300> else<00:05:34.570> for<00:05:34.750> about<00:05:34.960> a<00:05:34.990> year<00:05:35.350> so<00:05:35.560> you

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
by anything else for about a year so you

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.620 
by anything else for about a year so you
can<00:05:35.890> see<00:05:36.040> eventually<00:05:36.460> gets<00:05:36.640> it<00:05:36.760> off<00:05:36.880> but<00:05:37.510> it

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
can see eventually gets it off but it

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.000 
can see eventually gets it off but it
doesn't<00:05:37.840> get<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.020> edges<00:05:38.350> at<00:05:38.500> all<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.620> got<00:05:38.830> to<00:05:38.950> do

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
doesn't get the edges at all I got to do

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.460 
doesn't get the edges at all I got to do
that<00:05:39.040> with<00:05:39.280> a<00:05:39.340> law
