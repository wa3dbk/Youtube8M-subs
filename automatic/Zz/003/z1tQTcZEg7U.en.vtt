00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
entire circuit three times at the end of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.990 
entire circuit three times at the end of
each<00:01:01.020> circuit<00:01:01.559> you're<00:01:01.920> only<00:01:02.250> resting<00:01:02.609> 15

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
each circuit you're only resting 15

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.460 
each circuit you're only resting 15
seconds<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.420> you're<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.750> right<00:01:03.989> back<00:01:04.199> into

seconds and you're going right back into

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
seconds and you're going right back into
the<00:01:04.680> circuit<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.430> entire<00:01:05.909> workout<00:01:06.390> should

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the circuit this entire workout should

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.289 
the circuit this entire workout should
take<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.049> around<00:01:07.250> 15<00:01:08.250> minutes<00:01:08.460> which<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
take you around 15 minutes which is

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.850 
take you around 15 minutes which is
great<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.200> in<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> gym<00:01:10.650> and

the weight of the ball that you're going

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.770 
the weight of the ball that you're going
to<00:01:19.159> use<00:01:19.280> for<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:19.579> exercise<00:01:20.030> really<00:01:20.390> depends

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
to use for this exercise really depends

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.690 
to use for this exercise really depends
on<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.960> person<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:21.560> tend<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:22.250> like<00:01:22.430> to<00:01:22.610> go

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
on the person I tend to like to go

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.609 
on the person I tend to like to go
lighter<00:01:23.060> because<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:23.689> are<00:01:23.869> going<00:01:24.200> for<00:01:24.380> 30

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
lighter because we are going for 30

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.840 
lighter because we are going for 30
seconds<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.159> I<00:01:25.219> want<00:01:25.460> you<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.579> be<00:01:25.729> as

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
seconds and I want you to be as

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.929 
seconds and I want you to be as
explosive<00:01:26.600> as<00:01:26.750> possible<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.310> heavier<00:01:28.700> ball

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
explosive as possible so a heavier ball

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.760 
explosive as possible so a heavier ball
may<00:01:29.420> fatigue<00:01:29.810> you<00:01:29.990> within<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.320> first<00:01:30.350> 10

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
may fatigue you within the first 10

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.620 
may fatigue you within the first 10
seconds<00:01:31.189> but<00:01:31.369> that's<00:01:31.759> kind<00:01:32.030> of<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.179> personal

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
seconds but that's kind of a personal

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.899 
seconds but that's kind of a personal
preference<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:34.130> probably<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.759> most

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
preference so probably the most

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.130 
preference so probably the most
important<00:01:35.360> thing<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.479> you<00:01:35.659> need<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.840> focus

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
important thing that you need to focus

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.020

the exercise you want to be performing

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.800 
the exercise you want to be performing
this<00:01:57.110> exercise<00:01:57.170> at<00:01:58.039> 100%<00:01:58.610> but<00:01:59.360> when<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.569> bring

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
this exercise at 100% but when you bring

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.600 
this exercise at 100% but when you bring
the<00:01:59.929> ball<00:02:00.079> overhead<00:02:00.590> that's<00:02:00.950> when<00:02:01.220> you<00:02:01.340> really

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
the ball overhead that's when you really

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.039 
the ball overhead that's when you really
want<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:01.849> focus<00:02:02.000> on<00:02:02.270> tightening<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.840> core

want to focus on tightening the core

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.479 
want to focus on tightening the core
because<00:02:03.289> that's<00:02:03.470> going<00:02:03.679> to<00:02:03.770> actually<00:02:04.280> allow

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:04.489 
because that's going to actually allow

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.370 
because that's going to actually allow
you<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.819> ability<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.239> slam<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.810> ball<00:02:05.959> on<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.209 

the<00:02:12.780> next<00:02:12.989> exercise<00:02:13.439> that<00:02:13.469> we're<00:02:13.799> doing<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.189> a

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
the next exercise that we're doing is a

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.160 
the next exercise that we're doing is a
medicine<00:02:14.819> ball<00:02:14.939> throw<00:02:15.269> with<00:02:15.480> push-up<00:02:15.930> so

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
medicine ball throw with push-up so

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.809 
medicine ball throw with push-up so
probably<00:02:16.859> the<00:02:16.980> first<00:02:17.159> thing<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.640> need

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.729 
probably the first thing that you need
to<00:02:17.879> figure<00:02:18.420> out<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.900> spacing<00:02:19.469> between

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
to figure out is spacing between

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.470 
to figure out is spacing between
yourself<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.640> wall<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.209> test<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.959> out
