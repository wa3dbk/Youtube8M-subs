00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.210 
two minutes you would lift it and turn
it<00:01:55.180> one<00:01:55.510> quarter<00:01:55.930> turn<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.500> leave<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.070> on<00:01:57.160> for

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
it one quarter turn and leave it on for

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.730 
it one quarter turn and leave it on for
the<00:01:57.490> other<00:01:57.700> two<00:01:57.970> minutes<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.410> gives<00:01:59.590> you

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
the other two minutes and that gives you

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.130 
the other two minutes and that gives you
that<00:01:59.920> nice<00:02:00.160> grill<00:02:00.730> marks<00:02:00.760> in<00:02:01.420> your<00:02:01.450> stay<00:02:01.810> and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
that nice grill marks in your stay and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.930 
that nice grill marks in your stay and
then<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.830> would<00:02:02.950> turn<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.250> over<00:02:03.370> and<00:02:03.520> repeat

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
then you would turn it over and repeat

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.410 
then you would turn it over and repeat
that<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.540> then<00:02:05.350> most<00:02:06.220> girls<00:02:06.430> have<00:02:06.910> two<00:02:07.180> sets

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
that and then most girls have two sets

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.030 
that and then most girls have two sets
of<00:02:07.570> burners<00:02:07.990> you're<00:02:08.170> going<00:02:08.290> to<00:02:08.350> turn<00:02:08.530> one<00:02:08.770> side
