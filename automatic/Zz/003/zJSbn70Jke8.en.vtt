00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.450
 At the 2011 International Robot Exhibition 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.040
 Ranked # 1 in industrial robots worldwide 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.510
 Yaskawa Electric is developing 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.559
 Next-generation service robot "SmartPal VII" 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.410
 Remote control with motion capture 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.009
 Demonstration has been released 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.900
 This time I was far away (Fukuoka) 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.600
 Mother's house robot 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.909
 Tokyo operators (children) operate the robot 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.300
 Talk with your mother and clean up the room 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.000
 In settings such as 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.970
 We are demonstrating 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.600
 This demo is falling in the room 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.900
 The robot picks up the stuffed toy 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.710
 In the content to put in the box 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.130
 For the operation of the robot hand 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.220
 I use Kinect 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.620
 This time is similar to human 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.710
 Because it is a robot 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.720
 There are many degrees of freedom 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.970
 Such robots 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.310
 People can easily with freedom 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.270
 In the technology of operating 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.880
 The joints of the hand (robot) just by moving the hand 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.220
 Then hip joint 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.310
 The robot itself thinks about all such joints 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.170
 Such as working optimally 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.009
 It has become a technology 

00:01:14.589 --> 00:01:18.439
 This model is the previous generation announced in 2007 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.740
 Review all parts from "SmartPal V" 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.289
 Significant reduction in size and weight has been achieved 

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.119
 Pan and tilt is possible on the head 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.400
 Stereo camera and infrared sensor 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.100
 The moving part is equipped with a gyro sensor 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.670
 While strengthening the environmental recognition function 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.300
 I am improving the accuracy of the autonomous movement 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.799
 That's why the thickness of the robot's arm 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.069
 We are smaller and lighter 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.290
 Moreover, I put a flexible skin around it. 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.930
 There is a touch sensor under it 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.530
 More safety has been improved 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.170
 So far the target is 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.429
 I can not narrow down 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.659
 Assist people who work with people 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.889
 Or support the person on the side of the person 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.920
 We aim at such a robot 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.750
 Anyway from industrial robots 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.900
 Market for these service applications 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.550
 At the time of expanding 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.509
 Make such robots easy and safe 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.799
 The technology to operate is from now on 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.500
 I think that it will be effective
