00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hello I've got myself a ensoniq EPS

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.289 
hello I've got myself a ensoniq EPS
sampler<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.220> original<00:00:05.370> EPS<00:00:06.060> which

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
sampler this is the original EPS which

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.919 
sampler this is the original EPS which
is<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.529> 13<00:00:07.529> bit<00:00:07.799> sampler<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:08.849> bit<00:00:09.120> grainy<00:00:09.480> but

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
is a 13 bit sampler it's bit grainy but

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.330 
is a 13 bit sampler it's bit grainy but
a<00:00:10.200> life<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.710> like<00:00:10.889> that

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
a life it like that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to buy a MIDI keyboard controller for my

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.090 
to buy a MIDI keyboard controller for my
arm<00:00:16.520> modular<00:00:17.520> synthesizer<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.840> found<00:00:19.740> that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
arm modular synthesizer but found that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.910 
arm modular synthesizer but found that
just<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> wee<00:00:21.210> bit<00:00:21.420> more<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.769> this

just for a wee bit more I can get this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.880 
just for a wee bit more I can get this
some<00:00:23.310> sampler<00:00:24.090> instead<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.769> of

obviously<00:02:22.470> being<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.740> sampler<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
obviously being a sampler this is a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.640 
obviously being a sampler this is a
reason<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.210> got<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.570> because<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.080> know<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.500> can

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
reason I got it because you know you can

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.590 
reason I got it because you know you can
obviously<00:02:25.890> sample<00:02:26.520> anything<00:02:27.300> until<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
obviously sample anything until it

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.370 
obviously sample anything until it
transposes<00:02:28.230> over<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.530> entire<00:02:28.770> keyboard<00:02:29.340> and
