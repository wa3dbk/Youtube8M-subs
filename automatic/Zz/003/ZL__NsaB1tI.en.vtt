00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.460
 and before starting the video I want to thank 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:09.070
 Subscribers group VKontakte which and 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.070
 suggested the idea of ​​creating this cycle 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.590
 Hi there, you're on the blitz fan channel 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.910
 by you i am semzay 1 and it starts today 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.130
 new video loop 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.650
 learn to ripen in which I will 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.470
 talk about all the details of the game 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.230
 starting from simple truths and ending 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.230
 tricks and tricks and today we 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.210
 start with the control settings Well 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.960
 look first at the total i will tell 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.640
 settings that I set myself and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.260
 perhaps if you are playing with a device 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.660
 the smaller screen they are not 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.880
 fit but again explain the reason 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.010
 of your choice but for the beginning the location 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.290
 Well of course the right outfit again 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.190
 right handed tent of course joystick 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.960
 static tried the joystick and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.590
 cut as written here but like that 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.019
 That did not fit avtopotsel pretty 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.030
 important control and i have it 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.280
 left only in arcade mode will explain 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.200
 why at the beginner level it goes without saying 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.060
 aiming is not particularly necessary and 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.250
 avtopritsel even in sniper mode 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.260
 In principle, he can arrange us however 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.869
 in the future there are already cars 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.510
 more armored and accounted for 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.090
 vytselivat then in avtopritsel 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.950
 sniper mode will not suit us but 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.570
 Push notifications, we probably do not disassemble 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.580
 there will be a second firing button 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.100
 of course I turned it on and advise everyone 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.470
 do it a very handy thing and 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.250
 allows you to shoot not only right 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.720
 thumb 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.299
 but also the left viewing area is curious 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.150
 The thing however yagi not use and 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.640
 because turned off although in many moments 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.530
 she can help out so you don't twist 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.220
 tower in order to turn back 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.450
 and just turned the camera minimap 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.430
 sure to all ku 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.409
 of course now what about 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.810
 sensitivity camera sensitivity 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.899
 worth it let's count 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.789
 time two three 4 5 by 5 explain why 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.939
 aiming high level opponents 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.209
 quite difficult and sensitivity more 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:19.079
 high extremely difficult this 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.010
 the process therefore put on 5 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.989
 sensitivity to leave by 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.629
 the standard volume of the game will not 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.389
 now about the layout itself 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.430
 as you see all the items i left in 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.769
 standard layout only 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.650
 increased joystick here you are free 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.989
 choose exactly the way you want and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.029
 what place for the screen diagonal in 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.489
 In many ways, of course, defining 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:44.799
 separate mentioning and setting 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.049
 controllers before official support 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.260
 there are no controllers at the moment however 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.760
 it is possible to connect them and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.969
 consider we controller steelseries 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.359
 stratus which actually connects 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:00.699
 to ios based devices forgive ipads 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.469
 and all sorts of phone and it connects 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:05.319
 via bluetooth it can not 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:08.319
 connect the wires consider it 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.989
 managing the main cross in this 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.329
 the game is useless further left stick it 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.379
 the movement of the frame itself is responsible for 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.750
 review button and x and y are all sorts 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.280
 consumables respectively lower average 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.390
 top and also would it be recharge but 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.980
 it's worth noting that it's a recharge 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.300
 only works if we have cassettes on and 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.470
 loading l1 and r1 buttons too 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.590
 of dubious utility because 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.370
 what functions do not respond l2 sniper 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.230
 the r2 sight is responsible for shooting yes to 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.910
 Sorry at the moment to configure 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.920
 management does not appear otherwise 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.170
 possible but the developers promised 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.630
 support for gamepads and all kinds 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.430
 control also on the android device 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.239
 you can connect almost any 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.700
 controllers 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.760
 however, they are also fine tuned. 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.230
 impossible to manage we figured out a 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.080
 the next video we will look at 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.780
 complete set of tank and so outfit and 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.190
 ammunition and equipment and of course 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.989
 not to miss this release not
