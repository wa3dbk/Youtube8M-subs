all<00:03:22.620> right<00:03:22.860> let's<00:03:23.100> roll<00:03:23.340> now<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:23.730> our<00:03:23.850> turn

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
all right let's roll now it's our turn

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.380 
all right let's roll now it's our turn
our<00:03:24.360> first<00:03:24.600> test<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> parking<00:03:25.980> test<00:03:26.820> backing

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
our first test is a parking test backing

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.290 
our first test is a parking test backing
up<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.660> see<00:03:27.840> whether<00:03:28.800> or<00:03:28.920> not<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.300> backup

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
up to see whether or not the backup

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.510 
up to see whether or not the backup
camera<00:03:30.510> give<00:03:30.810> us<00:03:30.930> any<00:03:31.230> alerts<00:03:31.710> because<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.250> lot

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
camera give us any alerts because a lot

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.130 
camera give us any alerts because a lot
of<00:03:32.550> the<00:03:32.670> vehicles<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.150> sensors<00:03:33.690> or<00:03:33.930> radar

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
of the vehicles have sensors or radar

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.160 
of the vehicles have sensors or radar
sensors<00:03:34.740> around<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.490> bumpers<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.180> let<00:03:37.080> us

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
sensors around the bumpers to let us

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.930 
sensors around the bumpers to let us
know<00:03:37.380> if<00:03:37.590> there's<00:03:37.770> danger<00:03:38.040> or<00:03:38.490> an<00:03:38.550> obstruction

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
know if there's danger or an obstruction

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.550 
know if there's danger or an obstruction
and<00:03:39.210> we've<00:03:39.330> got<00:03:39.510> some<00:03:39.690> cones<00:03:39.960> on<00:03:40.170> either<00:03:40.290> side

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
and we've got some cones on either side

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.610 
and we've got some cones on either side
of<00:03:40.590> us<00:03:40.800> plus<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.550> blow-up<00:03:41.880> dinosaur<00:03:42.690> as<00:03:42.930> our

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
of us plus a blow-up dinosaur as our

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.170 
of us plus a blow-up dinosaur as our
final<00:03:44.070> backup<00:03:44.520> so<00:03:44.640> we<00:03:44.730> don't<00:03:44.880> want<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.060> hit

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
final backup so we don't want to hit

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.150 
final backup so we don't want to hit
that<00:03:45.210> that's<00:03:45.990> get<00:03:46.140> in<00:03:46.230> position<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.770> see<00:03:47.040> how

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
that that's get in position and see how

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:59.660 
that that's get in position and see how
it<00:03:47.280> does<00:03:54.680> put<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.740> in<00:03:55.830> reverse<00:03:58.460> actually<00:03:59.460> shows

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
it does put it in reverse actually shows

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.780 
it does put it in reverse actually shows
a<00:04:00.030> car<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:01.140> our<00:04:01.170> left<00:04:02.360> that's<00:04:03.360> good<00:04:03.600> all<00:04:04.470> right

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
a car to our left that's good all right

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.210 
a car to our left that's good all right
lane<00:04:05.790> lines<00:04:06.620> directing<00:04:07.620> us<00:04:07.740> back<00:04:08.010> where<00:04:08.190> we

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
lane lines directing us back where we

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:16.509 
lane lines directing us back where we
should<00:04:08.460> be<00:04:13.610> there<00:04:14.610> we<00:04:14.700> go

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
should be there we go

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.030 
should be there we go
okay<00:04:17.519> so<00:04:18.209> now<00:04:18.390> that's<00:04:18.780> how<00:04:19.140> close<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.650> shows<00:04:19.859> us

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
okay so now that's how close it shows us

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.250 
okay so now that's how close it shows us
