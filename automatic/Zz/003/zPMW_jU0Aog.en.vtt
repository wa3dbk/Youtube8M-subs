00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
range shot you can see was a good

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.560 
range shot you can see was a good
accurate<00:00:45.420> shot<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> soils<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:48.300> great

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570

accuracy<00:00:48.930> accuracy<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> main<00:00:50.039> thing<00:00:50.340> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
accuracy accuracy is the main thing I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
accuracy accuracy is the main thing I
think<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:51.000> when<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.270> say<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.750> saw<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.590> just

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
think of when I say I saw I was just

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.340 
think of when I say I saw I was just
sooo<00:00:52.920> full<00:00:53.570> ninety<00:00:54.570> percent<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
sooo full ninety percent of them you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.970 
sooo full ninety percent of them you
need<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.949> don't<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
need to that I don't like are the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
need to that I don't like are the
aek-971<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.399> find<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.270> gun<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> week<00:01:00.780> whole

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
aek-971 I find that gun the week whole

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.930 
aek-971 I find that gun the week whole
just<00:01:01.230> isn't<00:01:01.469> nice<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.010> kicks<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.640> side<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
just isn't nice it kicks up go side to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
just isn't nice it kicks up go side to
side<00:01:03.059> everywhere<00:01:03.769> I'm<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> fan<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.430> it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
side everywhere I'm just not a fan of it

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.230 
side everywhere I'm just not a fan of it
but<00:01:05.880> then<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> famous<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.990> still<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.400> long

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
but then the famous is still a very long

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.230 
but then the famous is still a very long
and<00:01:09.659> public<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.159> close<00:01:11.520> range<00:01:11.790> weapon

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and public so they close range weapon

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.350 
and public so they close range weapon
but<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.560> good<00:01:14.250> enough<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.030> very

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
but it's good enough so that it's very

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.109 
but it's good enough so that it's very
powerful<00:01:15.840> words<00:01:16.350> way<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> good<00:01:16.860> accurate<00:01:17.119> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
powerful words way a good accurate so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.179 
powerful words way a good accurate so
you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.270> using<00:01:18.540> domination<00:01:19.049> or<00:01:19.229> even<00:01:19.860> in

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.700 

permanent<00:01:23.189> operation<00:01:24.060> Locker<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.470> works

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
permanent operation Locker so it works

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
permanent operation Locker so it works
to<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> world<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.939> good<00:01:27.090> weapon<00:01:27.540> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
to the world is really good weapon I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.950 
to the world is really good weapon I
enjoy<00:01:28.140> using<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.390> first<00:01:30.390> life<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.869> like

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
before when they have accuracy like the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.490
