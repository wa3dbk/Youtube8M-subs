 and aluminum foil and also some 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.740
 sticks to put to hold looks 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 it is very simple 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.470
 in a bowl you are going to mix the carrot 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.670

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:40.170

 two aluminum foil boxes 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.730
 that is bigger than the matambre 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.180
 Now let's spice it up with a little bit of 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.570
 oil and spread and kill with the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.630
 fat in contact with milk paper 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.750
 aluminum not inwards but towards 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.200
 outside 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.490
 now we go to the armed in the middle of the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.460
 matambre in the middle of the matambre you go to 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.550
 provide 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.630
 the filling like this first puts five 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.890
 ham offers on this four 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.920
 sheets of cheese 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.819
 then the vegetables 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.670
 again cheese and finally feta 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.569
 Ham 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.300
 league makes the matambre as if closing its 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.950
 book because you used only the 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.930
 half for the filling and the other was 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.400
 without anything then you fold it 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.780
 in book form and you're going to sew for 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.090
 join the edges unite the entire edge is 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.859
 they can use a butt, but it gave me 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.709
 safety the thread and the safest needle 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:15.200
 you close the aluminum foil well so that 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.280
 do not escape the vapors vapors if 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.680
 this 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.980
 will help preserve aromas and pierre 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.170
 Nizar meat 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.840
 you are going to heat of course well the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.780
 grill that should be about 25 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.810
 centimeters of the embers when you see that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:42.420
 the embers so white and you cook the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:46.680
 matambre 40 minutes on each side 40 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.080
 minutes of each side then retire the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.370
 paper 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:58.860
 lower the grill about 15 centimeters and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:01.980
 you're going to love both sides of this 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.900
 It's going to take about 5 to 10 minutes to calculate 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.860
 It's on the side 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.500
 if the grill is not adjustable increases 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.420
 the temperature adding more fat 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.230
 removing and putting is understood and so 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:23.389
 remove the grill from the grill 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.819
 let's rest 10 minutes 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.360
 we took away all the part that we have 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:33.020
 known that is the thread and the chopsticks and 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:38.389

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.850
 table 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.860
