you actually want to travel over to the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
you actually want to travel over to the
rocket<00:00:31.590> yard<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.610> follow<00:00:32.759> my<00:00:33.000> directions

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390

over<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> rocket<00:00:34.469> yard<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.920> once<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.760> get

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
over to the rocket yard and once you get

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.350 
over to the rocket yard and once you get
in<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.360> area<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.260> actually<00:00:37.530> want<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.910> one

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
in this area you actually want to do one

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.110 
in this area you actually want to do one
rotation<00:00:39.960> because<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:41.340> soon<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> enter

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
rotation because as soon as you enter

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.529 
rotation because as soon as you enter
the<00:00:42.149> rocket<00:00:42.629> yard<00:00:42.870> nothing<00:00:43.290> really<00:00:43.680> spawns<00:00:44.070> on

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
the rocket yard nothing really spawns on

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.619 
the rocket yard nothing really spawns on
but<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> keep<00:00:46.910> anything<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
but you want to keep anything like a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.010 
but you want to keep anything like a
chest<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.920> natural<00:00:50.460> material<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:51.270> close<00:00:51.750> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
chest or a natural material as close to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.979 
chest or a natural material as close to
the<00:00:52.140> edge<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> area<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.399> possible<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.780> in

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the edge of the area as possible so in

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
the edge of the area as possible so in
this<00:00:55.110> instance<00:00:55.170> obviously<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.250> soon<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.550> you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
this instance obviously as soon as you

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
this instance obviously as soon as you
enter<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.940> rocket<00:00:57.420> yard<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:58.980> these

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
enter the rocket yard in one of these

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.700 
enter the rocket yard in one of these
three<00:00:59.489> locations<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.989> want<00:01:01.350> there<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
three locations here you want there to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939 
three locations here you want there to
be<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.460> sort<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.910> chest<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.420> material<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
be some sort of a chest or material so

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.490 
be some sort of a chest or material so
if<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.700> isn't<00:01:06.119> obviously<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.260> many

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
if there isn't obviously do as many

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.850 
if there isn't obviously do as many
rotations<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.150> until<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:10.049> chest

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
rotations as you have to until a chest

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.429 
rotations as you have to until a chest
or<00:01:11.130> natural<00:01:11.640> material<00:01:12.180> spawns<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> area

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
or natural material spawns in the area

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.830 
or natural material spawns in the area
now<00:01:14.070> once<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> spawns<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> area<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.630> want

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
now once it spawns in the area you want

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.210 
now once it spawns in the area you want
to<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.140> ahead<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.560> grab<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.159> then

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to go ahead and grab it and then

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.179 
to go ahead and grab it and then
immediately<00:01:17.670> leave<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.750> area<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.860> turn

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
immediately leave the area and then turn

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.580 
immediately leave the area and then turn
back<00:01:20.430> around<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.240> come<00:01:21.479> into<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.049> area<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
back around and come into the area and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.760 
back around and come into the area and
that<00:01:23.009> material<00:01:23.670> should<00:01:23.909> stay<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:24.689> now<00:01:25.290> for

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that material should stay there now for

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340 
that material should stay there now for
me<00:01:25.860> personally<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> did<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.390> um<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
me personally when I did it with um the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
me personally when I did it with um the
chest<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.070> spawned<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.490> top<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> shed<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
chest it's spawned on top of the shed I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
chest it's spawned on top of the shed I
think<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> worked<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.770> about<00:01:31.979> six<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.549> seven

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
think it worked for about six or seven

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.870 
think it worked for about six or seven
tries<00:01:33.540> maybe<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.290> little<00:01:34.500> bit<00:01:34.710> more<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
tries maybe a little bit more than that

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.740 
tries maybe a little bit more than that
but<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.990> vanished<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.479> honestly<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
but then it vanished so honestly this

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.499 
but then it vanished so honestly this
will<00:01:39.990> work<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.439> any<00:01:40.470> map<00:01:41.210> anywhere<00:01:42.210> it'll

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
will work with any map anywhere it'll

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.690 
will work with any map anywhere it'll
work<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.110> know<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.470> helium<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.130> any<00:01:44.280> area

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
work you know for helium in any area

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.630 
work you know for helium in any area
it'll<00:01:44.970> work<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.600> relic<00:01:46.409> iron<00:01:46.829> spear<00:01:47.310> blooms

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it'll work for relic iron spear blooms

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.539 
it'll work for relic iron spear blooms
it'll<00:01:48.420> work<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.229> um<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:50.100> couple<00:01:50.369> of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it'll work for all that um a couple of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
it'll work for all that um a couple of
things<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.820> want<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.090> note<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.780> there's<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
things I want to note is if there's a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.679 
things I want to note is if there's a
person<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.100> area<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.939> will<00:01:54.149> fuck<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> up

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
person in the area that will fuck it up

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.639 
person in the area that will fuck it up
um<00:01:55.520> but<00:01:56.520> honestly<00:01:57.000> besides<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.049> you're<00:01:58.380> good

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
um but honestly besides that you're good

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.959 
um but honestly besides that you're good
to<00:01:58.770> go<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.600> would<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
to go I would like to think of this as a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.969 
to go I would like to think of this as a
farming<00:02:02.969> strategy<00:02:03.469> because<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.710> you're<00:02:04.860> going

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
farming strategy because if you're going

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.570 
farming strategy because if you're going
to<00:02:05.040> come<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.520> area<00:02:05.729> anyway<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> farm<00:02:07.580> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
to come to this area anyway to farm you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.999 
to come to this area anyway to farm you
know

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
know

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.850 
know
spin<00:02:09.340> metal<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.019> you<00:02:11.019> see<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.560> there's<00:02:11.769> a

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
spin metal and you see that there's a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.089 
spin metal and you see that there's a
chest<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.610> shed<00:02:13.150> or<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.599> that<00:02:13.629> vicinity

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
chest on the shed or in that vicinity

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.789 
chest on the shed or in that vicinity
then<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:15.340> have<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> guaranteed<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.900> know<00:02:17.049> six

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
then you have a guaranteed you know six

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.670 
then you have a guaranteed you know six
to<00:02:18.010> ten<00:02:18.250> chest<00:02:18.670> immediately<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.810> then<00:02:20.409> you

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to ten chest immediately and then you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.860 
to ten chest immediately and then you
can<00:02:20.829> continue<00:02:21.159> your<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.879> know<00:02:21.970> your<00:02:22.000> rotation

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
can continue your you know your rotation

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.170 
can continue your you know your rotation
again<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.439> the<00:02:24.189> same<00:02:24.430> method<00:02:24.819> can<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.060> applied

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
again and the same method can be applied

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.979 
again and the same method can be applied
for<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.900> moon<00:02:26.140> or<00:02:26.470> anywhere<00:02:27.159> else<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:28.209> would

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
for the moon or anywhere else so I would

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.780 
for the moon or anywhere else so I would
just<00:02:29.170> suggest<00:02:29.319> if<00:02:29.769> you're<00:02:29.860> gonna<00:02:29.980> go<00:02:30.250> farming

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
just suggest if you're gonna go farming

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.880 
just suggest if you're gonna go farming
for<00:02:30.970> any<00:02:31.150> type<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.420> natural<00:02:31.959> material<00:02:32.470> do<00:02:32.769> it

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
for any type of natural material do it

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.369 
for any type of natural material do it
in<00:02:33.010> an<00:02:33.129> area<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.549> not<00:02:34.299> a<00:02:34.510> lot<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.750> people<00:02:34.900> are

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
in an area that not a lot of people are

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.649 
in an area that not a lot of people are
so<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.159> you<00:02:36.340> could<00:02:36.609> possibly<00:02:36.970> do<00:02:37.629> this

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
so that you could possibly do this

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.020 
so that you could possibly do this
strategy<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:39.040> there<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.340> go<00:02:39.370> guys<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.909> hope
