00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
yeah I mean I think we'll probably be

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.950 
yeah I mean I think we'll probably be
like<00:01:48.400> on<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.820> seven<00:01:49.270> or<00:01:49.360> eight<00:01:49.660> with

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
like on a seven or eight with

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.360 
like on a seven or eight with
communication<00:01:50.620> so<00:01:50.830> yeah<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.610> seven<00:01:52.210> yeah

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
communication so yeah so a seven yeah

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.530 
communication so yeah so a seven yeah
now<00:01:54.370> what<00:01:54.520> would<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.670> take<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.030> get<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.330> nine

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
now what would it take to get to a nine

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.210 
now what would it take to get to a nine
you<00:01:56.380> think<00:01:56.700> well<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.770> kinda

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
you think well that one is kinda

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.430 
you think well that one is kinda
difficult<00:02:00.400> because<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:01.360> mean<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.930> reason<00:02:02.230> I

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
difficult because I mean the reason I

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.860 
difficult because I mean the reason I
seriously<00:02:03.250> where<00:02:03.850> Joseph<00:02:04.120> thinks<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.750> we

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
seriously where Joseph thinks that we

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.050 
seriously where Joseph thinks that we
are<00:02:04.900> because<00:02:05.460> he's<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.610> one<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.760> would<00:02:06.970> be

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
are because he's the one that would be

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.270 
are because he's the one that would be
holding<00:02:07.300> things<00:02:07.690> back<00:02:07.930> for<00:02:08.410> my<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.980> it's<00:02:11.980> hard

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
holding things back for my so it's hard

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.270 
holding things back for my so it's hard
to<00:02:12.340> know<00:02:12.460> one<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.910> more<00:02:13.030> easily<00:02:13.440> if<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:15.010> he

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
to know one of the more easily if is he

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.300 
to know one of the more easily if is he
telling<00:02:15.520> us<00:02:15.700> everything<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.650> tell<00:02:17.830> some

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
telling us everything you tell some

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.940 
telling us everything you tell some
other<00:02:18.580> flipping<00:02:19.210> spa<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.290> talk<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.470> little

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
last time I think we all agree that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.900 
last time I think we all agree that
around<00:02:28.239> five<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.900> so

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
around five and so

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.700 
around five and so
time<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.810> say<00:02:30.990> seven<00:02:32.240> okay<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.560> what<00:02:34.560> would<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
time you say seven okay so what would it

00:02:34.710 --> 00:03:22.910 
time you say seven okay so what would it
take<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.950> get<00:02:35.160> oh<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:20.370> don't<00:03:20.630> mind<00:03:21.630> like<00:03:22.470> heaven

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
take to get oh I don't mind like heaven

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920 
take to get oh I don't mind like heaven
before<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.000> think<00:03:24.330> that<00:03:24.480> there's<00:03:24.660> certain

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
before but I think that there's certain

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.950 
before but I think that there's certain
information<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.560> hotel<00:03:26.660> does<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.810> make

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
information is hotel does that make

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.320 
information is hotel does that make
sense<00:03:27.990> you<00:03:28.590> know<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.370> was<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.940> worst<00:03:30.180> case

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
sense you know it was the worst case

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.420 
sense you know it was the worst case
scenario<00:03:30.780> which<00:03:30.960> means<00:03:31.140> actually<00:03:31.500> one<00:03:31.710> yeah

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
scenario which means actually one yeah

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.650 
scenario which means actually one yeah
look<00:03:32.580> at<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.880> made<00:03:33.270> us<00:03:33.390> feel<00:03:33.600> really

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
look at that made us feel really

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.960 
look at that made us feel really
betrayed<00:03:33.990> but<00:03:34.860> sometimes<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.580> we<00:03:35.760> feel<00:03:35.940> like

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
betrayed but sometimes that we feel like

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.820 
betrayed but sometimes that we feel like
we<00:03:36.090> can't<00:03:36.390> penetrate<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.230> surface

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.690 

brightness<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.910> team<00:03:45.180> as<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.570> family

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
brightness is a as a team as a family

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.580 
brightness is a as a team as a family
family<00:03:47.700> communication<00:03:48.480> more<00:03:48.959> such<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> gesture

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
family communication more such a gesture

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.750 
family communication more such a gesture

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
is Joseph Tommy tree so when Joseph says

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.800 
is Joseph Tommy tree so when Joseph says
he's<00:03:53.910> been<00:03:54.120> serving<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:56.010> wonder<00:03:56.640> Joseph<00:03:57.630> is

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
I feel like he did really well on that

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.450 
I feel like he did really well on that
test<00:06:24.130> because<00:06:24.550> he<00:06:24.849> promised<00:06:25.270> Jenna<00:06:25.979> know<00:06:26.979> he

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
test because he promised Jenna know he

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.490 
test because he promised Jenna know he
would<00:06:27.639> give<00:06:27.849> him<00:06:28.180> you<00:06:28.810> know<00:06:28.930> what<00:06:29.289> he<00:06:29.349> does

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
would give him you know what he does
