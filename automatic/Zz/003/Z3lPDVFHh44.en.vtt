00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that's where the DS gonna be so I'm

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:52.850 
that's where the DS gonna be so I'm
gonna<00:01:27.620> just<00:01:28.620> scribe<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.790> these

this will be a brace for him against the
whores<00:02:36.200> I'll<00:02:37.200> make<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.680> more<00:02:37.950> clear<00:02:38.010> as<00:02:38.610> I

yes I'm going to take my fingers dip it
in<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.010> solution<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.210> water<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:12.130> keeps<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
in the solution of water this keeps the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.350 
in the solution of water this keeps the
putty<00:03:13.210> from<00:03:13.480> sticking<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.930> my<00:03:14.050> fingers

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.320 

I<00:03:18.550> just<00:03:19.690> basically<00:03:20.690> need<00:03:20.990> it<00:03:21.170> until<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:22.210> mix<00:03:23.210> it

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
I just basically need it until it mix it

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
until it turns a nice metal gray we

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.390 
until it turns a nice metal gray we
supply<00:03:29.210> the<00:03:29.330> water

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.650 

ok

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
I don't want to do the whole length of

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.560 
I don't want to do the whole length of
the<00:04:03.190> tubing<00:04:03.970> only<00:04:04.330> because<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:06.420> want<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.480> be

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
the tubing only because I want to be

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.860 
the tubing only because I want to be
able<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.780> have<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.290> armature<00:04:09.040> flexible<00:04:09.870> so

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
able to have the armature flexible so

stuff like that now i'm going to put
some<00:04:16.989> right<00:04:17.410> down<00:04:17.680> here<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:20.590> sort<00:04:21.130> of<00:04:22.860> anchor

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
some right down here to sort of anchor

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:35.510 
some right down here to sort of anchor
those<00:04:24.460> hips<00:04:26.070> together

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.180 

yeah<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:36.760> I<00:04:36.820> don't<00:04:37.000> want<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.860> over<00:04:38.860> do<00:04:38.980> that

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
either because I may want to change the

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.360 
either because I may want to change the
angle<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.710> his<00:04:41.830> hips<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.600> just<00:04:43.840> want<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.370> it's

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
angle of his hips so I just want to it's

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.780 
angle of his hips so I just want to it's
basically<00:04:45.790> seal<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.420> two<00:04:46.600> halves<00:04:46.870> together

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.880 

all<00:04:51.790> right<00:04:51.940> all<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.900> Texas<00:04:53.290> it<00:04:53.440> for<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.680> few

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
all right all the Texas it for a few

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.030 
all right all the Texas it for a few
minutes<00:04:54.660> set<00:04:55.660> up<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:56.110> put<00:04:56.800> something

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
minutes set up I put something

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.830 
minutes set up I put something
underneath<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.580> it<00:04:57.640> doesn't<00:04:57.840> touch

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
underneath it so it doesn't touch

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.990 
underneath it so it doesn't touch
anything<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.470> I'll<00:05:00.250> come<00:05:00.520> back<00:05:00.550> in<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.970> couple

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
anything and I'll come back in a couple

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.420 
anything and I'll come back in a couple
of<00:05:01.270> minutes<00:05:01.390> and<00:05:01.750> this<00:05:01.870> would<00:05:02.020> be<00:05:02.050> hard<00:05:02.430> hard

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
of minutes and this would be hard hard

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.010 
of minutes and this would be hard hard
enough<00:05:03.670> to<00:05:06.120> copper<00:05:07.120> tubing<00:05:07.450> only<00:05:07.690> because

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
enough to copper tubing only because

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.560 
enough to copper tubing only because
it's<00:05:08.230> easier<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:09.910> know<00:05:10.000> if<00:05:10.150> I<00:05:10.270> want<00:05:10.510> to

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
it's easier to you know if I want to

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.140 
it's easier to you know if I want to
change<00:05:10.630> the<00:05:11.460> angle<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.490> the<00:05:12.550> arms<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.000> stuff

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
change the angle of the arms and stuff

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.440 
change the angle of the arms and stuff
