 Trinity Perez the curator and this this 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.760
 it was in our talk 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:24.210
 Bacobampo is a community that belongs 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.029
 to the municipality of etchojoa and this is a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.400
 police station and therefore the lord 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 commissar is the first authority of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.140
 this place 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.460
 Trinity had tremendous Perez Mendoza 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.290
 a this commissioner who is dedicated to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.800
 Here is what a curator does 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.390
 then to give public services to give 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.940
 everything that is called attention to the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.399
 citizenship for example if they want a 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 bombay consent removes him copies 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.629
 for low resources and what is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.440
 offers here we all are for 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.440
 serve them us the community yes sir 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.539
 here the curator here is the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.600
 responsible for everything that happens as 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.270
 controls the drunkards who never 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.310
 there is nowhere a problem of 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.080
 that in the face of that we have here we 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.000
 we have a commander here we have a 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.940
 public safety and they are the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.400
 who are responsible for following up are 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.170
 the borrachitos 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.110
 and what it is that demands the most 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.180
 citizenship here they approach you at 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.210
 commissar that we are missing this in the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.450
 Alhambra lamp sublime with the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.230
 garbage collection and wake 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.760
 watered streets in hills and all those 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.010
 services have truth and if the 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.680
 we have all grace gave zero then as 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.650
 everywhere a focus is fused and it's 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.230
 precisely the citizenship 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.090
 the one in charge of reporting it because 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.740
 you do not have inspectors for that 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.660
 nor any municipality have it from 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.360
 then then they report and you do 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.979
 the report to the municipal presidency to 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.840
 this eye so I do it I do it at 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.550
 report to public works and works 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.350
 public demand for the material I 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.770
 I have an electric here I put the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.800
 we will install as the Lord appointed 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.930
 a commissar by the west by voting 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.490
 can this for like this for the people to 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.100
 the people assigned to me is the 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.410
 responsibility I judge and meat 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.020
 that does not hear has many people have 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.660
 many people in his favor people who believe in 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.040
 you yes fat god that if I am have 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.510
 the president also by our hand 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.520
 is that we have done a lot 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.920
 and now we are very well estimated how much 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.270
 powerful gave you is a good manager 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.680
 before the municipal presidency yes 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.720
 why because he is a friend of us 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.420
 president we are and we all have there 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.440
 we have all the directors 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.630
 they are the friends of us 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.210
 it is very good for that independently 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.270
 of those requests what are the 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.580
 most common problems here in this 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.190
 comisarÃ­a the most common are those of 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.230
 those lenses that you have to feed help 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.600
 this drain that drain lag 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.070
 all public services and services are 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.380
 those that we speak demand that we have 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.150
 we strong here but we're going through 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.720
 step by step we will leave with because the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.580
 president is really looking forward 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.600
 the president and you as a representative 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.960
 of cigars from the hand of the Lord 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.810
 and then right now by priority right now 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.060
 public services very well but you 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.910
 if he were the one who decided in this 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.670
 moment what priority would that 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.380
 problem to public lighting 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.970
 lighting like this because we see the colonies 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.760
 that are lagging behind because the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.220
 heat to that I would give me more follow-up 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.570
 the commissioner has some salary if a 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.069
 biweekly salary of three thousand pesos 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.040
 we have 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.420
 in 3000 pesos because it is not a great salary 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.170
 nor to live without relief but 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.170
 well, decorously 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:04:01.780
 this for the payment of this 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.420
 the commissioner what a pleasure it was to meet him 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.859

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.230
