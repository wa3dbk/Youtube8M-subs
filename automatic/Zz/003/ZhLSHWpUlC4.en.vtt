00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.669
 do not 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.349
 good friends we meet here in the 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.730
 Itri 2014 in the area of ​​the jaguar that 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.650
 Everyone who knows videogames knows 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.200
 that the web link is one of the companies 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.259
 that more machines have prepared for 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.590
 hardcore gamers and calls us the 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.290
 attention and we came to see the alpha the alpha 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.690
 which is the windows-based console that 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.100
 they have the friends of the hell in web there 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.890
 something interesting with this console and it's 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.660
 that was going to be a console based 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.670
 in linux but this we are going to ask 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.160
 now a lingual virgin that is with 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.800
 we are very well 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.400
 a question this the alpha was going to be a 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.440
 console that was going to be a system with sun 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.940
 the ie9 made the decision then of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.550
 move the console do one based on 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.100
 windows on which that decision is based and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.020
 what benefits it brings and what difference 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.620
 and what it looks like for him back to the 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.900
 console good the console one of the 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.390
 most important futures is basically 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.670
 to be able to use it with steam true 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.440
 then one of the features that 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.240
 has is that at the moment that you 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.520
 launch the console or when you the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.310
 You are going to throw all the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.710
 applications in this inbox big picture 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.260
 that means that the games that you 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.320
 you are going to be the games 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.080
 as satires in steam east and in 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.940
 any time then you will be able to 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.619
 use the same library then 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.560
 really what we want is 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.350
 a console for video games that is 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 basically what we are launching for 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.960
 the question the alpha is a version of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.660
 windows is based alpha alpha 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 good as I said to you really is 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.170
 designed for him is steam box picks big 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.150
 picture if when you have the windows 8.1 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.610
 of background but really your objective 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.510
 main is to throw everything from the steam 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.670
 box bits 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.410
 when the console is based on windows 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.640
 8.1 John and return the console in terms 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.380
 we are going to depend on the lingua to make 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.270
 a release as such or just download 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.070
 let's pick up the steam big updates 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.500
 picture on the console lemon 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.860
 basically the updates goes down to 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.220
 automatically pass true this you do not 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.730
 you have to access in the windows part 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.190
 as such because really the interest of 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.170
 the console is the steam big function 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.630
 picture true that that gives you the 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.610
 availability to use more than 5000 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.200
 games that is the bookstore that there is of 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.730
 games that already has steam 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.250
 until one of the benefits of that 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.480
 be in windows is that we are going to have more 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.310
 available games of what there is 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.810
 available for linux because we're going to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.340
 have the entire videogame library 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.560
 that are available for windows in 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.959
 steam that is much wider than what 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.730
 there are for linux but if they were waiting 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.560
 use the console to put the office and the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.530
 rest of the things know that it is not a 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.720
 console for video games is not for you 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.760
 As shove start program 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.349
 productivity found in your home like this 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.480
 they will never be able to access the part 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.400
 of windows are not going to be able to do team 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.319
 caring grades or anything from the part of 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.690
 windows everything is going to run automatically and 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.670
 is a video game console then in 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.049
 about controls that we are going to have 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.640
 available to use with the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.489
 console which are compatible with the 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.170
 basically currently would be 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.060
 the xbox controls as I said 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.720
 previously that would be the former ex 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.720
 command and the xbox 360 so if you have a 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.099
 xbox 360 control in your house and you have 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.930
 the adapted one afterwards he will be able to 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.019
 use the console will come with a 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.519
 xbox tour control and wireless in 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.900
 which is going to bring the console if it's going to 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.760
 use the one from the xbox one because he knows he has 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.680
 than to use the cable as you would use it 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.480
 as for any other game of wii 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.000
 Well, they already saw all the information 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.239
 reference that they could give us reference 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.760
 to the alpha console that is what I was going to 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.620
 be the spirit know all the gossip 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.810
 completion of windows the other one still 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.879
 is pending have configurations of 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.909
 ib3 to start is the one that will launch 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.450
 at the beginning and 3 4 gb ram 500 gb 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.639
 HDD 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.959
 this is the one that will come out in November 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.870
 initially they will say it 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.030
 configurations other than 5 and 7 and others 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.590
 but for that we are going to be pending to 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.000
 the website of the web lyon and the friends of 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.919
 hellin web so that allows us the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 information as it is coming out now 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.650
 something interesting that we saw in the console 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.960
 the game of timeline 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.690
 this game is not going to come out even for the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.850
 2015 around here we have it and we will be able to 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.740
 play it and this is the kind of game that 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.650
 they will be able to play in the bookstore 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.280
 of windows that there are for the console like 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.840
 such 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.850
 this is the console box as such 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.479
 they are fixed in a simple console 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.210
 aesthetically it 's nothing wow as it is 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.940
 simple is practical has ports 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.770
 above and has a pass true and mike in the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.970
 back this one so if they have a 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.160
 plus display in the can chain 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.390
 and using the grass they can 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.520
 enjoy your bluray player as such 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.560
 so we're going to be very aware of 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.720
 the console let's see how it moves 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.720
 this to see if the zombies do not kill me 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.620
 let's see if I can talk to you a little and 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.150
 kill zombies at once 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.419
 let's hope the movie does not last three 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.419
 years 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.409
 As you can see they are moving very 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.020
 all right 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:29.629
 the graphics look spectacular 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.720
 those who have played dailan as they can 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:35.370
 recognize souls like the sun 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.120
 and we will look for the time 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.120
 they are going to kill me 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.860
 of damn 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.730
 damn inverted controls 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:01.580
 I'm talking to him and they killed me so 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.319
 I can not do two things at once 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.849
 so nothing this was all from the area 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.500
 del en huelva more also pending 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.789
 the alpha console and we continue to enjoy 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.789
 of liter and 2014
