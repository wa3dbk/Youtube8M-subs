going to come complete and that's going

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.660 
going to come complete and that's going
to<00:01:42.829> be<00:01:42.950> disappointing

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.310 

all<00:01:49.540> right<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.790> this<00:01:52.030> baby<00:01:52.330> here's<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.990> trap

hopefully it comes complete cuz it

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.420 
hopefully it comes complete cuz it
doesn't<00:02:02.350> seem<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:02.680> it's<00:02:02.860> gonna<00:02:02.979> come<00:02:03.250> with
