we're now running at about 8000 rpm if

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.929 
we're now running at about 8000 rpm if
you<00:01:39.939> open<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.930> valve<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:43.200> turn<00:01:44.200> off<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.649> pump

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
you open the valve and turn off the pump

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.499 
you open the valve and turn off the pump
the<00:01:45.939> rotor<00:01:46.240> will<00:01:46.509> spin<00:01:46.869> until<00:01:47.259> it<00:01:47.439> spins<00:01:47.799> down

the rotor will spin until it spins down
at<00:01:49.509> that<00:01:49.780> point<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.380> take<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.829> cover<00:01:51.070> off

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
at that point you take the cover off

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.210 
at that point you take the cover off
take<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.570> rotor<00:01:52.810> out<00:01:52.930> open<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.680> rotor<00:01:53.920> and

take the rotor out open the rotor and

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.940 
take the rotor out open the rotor and
inside<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.909> rotor<00:01:55.149> will<00:01:55.479> be<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:56.470> solid
