 and a network of comfortable fitness halls brits 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.990
 today we will talk about this 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.900
 unique exercise 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.539
 which we have in the post-Soviet 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.530
 space few do but beloved 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.050
 many sailors in the west exercise 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.690
 who is she called who is in english 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.500
 very difficult is called simplify say about 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.280
 old u have on triceps with dumbbells and 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.630
 so exercise is miraculous just 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.670
 comprehensively works out triceps 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.300
 is basic no isolated 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.129
 ore does not compare with it breaks say 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.210
 so triceps at all angles 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.239
 engages all its anatomical 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.119
 functions let's say everyone knows that 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.160
 the anatomical function of the triceps is 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.140
 extend the arm but few know what else 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:20.750
 raise upwards elbow and goes down 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.670
 let's say this movement here also in 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.920
 this movement are one of 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.530
 anatomical functions 30 what is of course 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.039
 and the masses are followed by other muscles but here it is 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.229
 movement perform exactly the triceps a little 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.330
 who knows about it and few of him 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.860
 working through this angle so here it is 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.899
 exercise loads it very well 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.789
 This incarnation in this exercise is necessary 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.830
 use a lot of weight myself working 35 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.130
 I take 40 kilograms in this exercise 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:57.380
 but today I will be showing it to you 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.910
 dozens and so so my task is not 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.540
 show about how strong I am 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.600
 I can about how to do it correctly 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.600
 exercise 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 we lie down 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.940
 and hold the dumbbells neutral grip over 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.970
 breast by the way we lie on the bench so 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.230
 way to get your head a little 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.390
 hung very little palms hold 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.670
 over or neutral palm hold 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.240
 arranged to each other and shield 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.360
 are reduced 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.170
 and legs are well rested sex this is the first 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.580
 motion phase 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:40.080
 second phase take a good breath and 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:44.070
 we lower the palms are approximately on 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.140
 the line where your chest ends 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.490
 bend arm to about 90 angle 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.300
 degrees or so the second phase inhale 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:58.540
 and omit the 3 phases of this movement not 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.500
 changing the angle of the elbow allot 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.970
 dumbbells to shoulders 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.970
 like this 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.000
 that is, pay in this way 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.670
 note that in the act 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.140
 need to keep as elbows as necessary 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.050
 keep it that way so they look 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.360
 forward not to part them as it is 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.480
 do many 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.740
 that is, like this, the more they will be 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.230
 directed forward the better 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:37.120
 The 4 phases of this movement are cast. 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:39.730
 here's the key in the initial position of phase 2 then 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.760
 there is from here from the shoulders we bring in 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.710
 an act 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.340
 the fifth phase of the movement we survive could 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:04:02.040
 dumbbells up and then the whole cycle 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:04:02.040
 we repeat first 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.570
