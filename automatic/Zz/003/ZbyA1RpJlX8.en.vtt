00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:07.020
 today yesterday we try to solve this cool itc sales expression 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.249
 brand names 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:09.399
 finished 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.889
 periodic magazines mixed and simple periodicals 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.519
 comments distinguishes simple periodicals mixed magazines 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:24.300
 simple periodic to the period that begins immediately after pouring 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.400
 poor periodical 1 I have more digits 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.649
 determining period before 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.720
 of the period 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.130
 to perform expressions and we must first make the appropriate ones 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.399
 transformations 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:38.560
 then 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.120
 for example 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.180
 0, 5 becomes 5 tenths 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.310
 + a me am anna te zac divided 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.650
 9 quarters - how to do this transformation 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.650
 then numerator is written of numerous in the room, 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.639
 and subtracts 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:01.050
 all the preceding part 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.820
 the period therefore 18 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.220
 in the denominator we put as many as 9 the periodic figures 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.340
 then one 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.620
 and as many hells as there are recife of the ancient and I do not 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.540
 if they had been more I would have added +9 or more zeros 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.680
 wines then crosses plan 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.460
 then woo unopiu this is a simple periodical and therefore it is written 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.030
 you're in the numerator - it's feminine 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.410
 because before the first 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.110
 penis 0 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.060
 u9 in the denominator 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.950
 we can write penis 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.960
 27 tenths 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.579
 therefore we operate the appropriate simplifications 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.850
 we therefore get that 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.740
 More than half do two means two minds means a whole 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.840
 that caresses always makes one 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.340
 divided 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.780
 9 quarters - 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.930
 165 90 esimi 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.789
 divided 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.279
 then 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.259
 one more 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:17.929
 if the grandparents 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.289
 what does it mean 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.849
 two-thirds 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.849
 r27 tenths 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.839
 so stay 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.319
 1 divided simplify 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.189
 for three we throw 55 thirtieths 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.800
 we divide by 5 11 itself 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.729
 hence the common denominator thirty cv 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.989
 is divided 4 trapper 9 27 - 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.589
 you say if you are 2 for 11 22 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.759
 divided 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:02.059
 1 + 2 third common denominator for 3 + 2 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.659
 for 27 that me 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.079
 so stay 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.429
 we are already writing for 12 

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.429
 here on TV because 27 22 ago 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.579
 5 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.759
 division 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:26.369
 5 third was second which means 25 noemi 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.639
 r27 of the cimini 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.639
 so no simplified rabbit in tiscali 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.179
 25 rabbits d siii 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.150
 so it remains 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
 one for 12 fifths and 12 fifths 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.459
 the ark 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.609
 2 fifteenths because we sleep overturn the clutch 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.659
 breast simplify the two PCs with 15 for three 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.919
 on 5 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.919
 result will be comotto 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:00.599
 25 estimates 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.269
 which is a fraction 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.049
 because you can give a finished decimal number 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:11.589
 because denominator as you can see we have 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.299
 a 25 exactly surrounded by second 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.310
 and we know that those situations that have the denominator 2 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.590
 5 and their multiples give only decimal fractions 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.300
 senses I ask to transform this fraction into a finite decimal number 15 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.610
 should 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.120
 multiply 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.850
 you numerator denominator for 4 because in this way the fraction is obtained 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.029
 equivalent 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:43.110
 32 cents becomes automatically 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.699
 0, 32 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.490
 to the next
