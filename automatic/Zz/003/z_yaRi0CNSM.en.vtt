00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
see they're not terribly big they're all

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.299 
see they're not terribly big they're all
ABS<00:00:38.070> plastic<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.079> they<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.590> set<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.040> two

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
ABS plastic and they can be set in two

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.030 
ABS plastic and they can be set in two
different<00:00:41.550> configurations<00:00:42.320> one<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.590> straight

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
different configurations one is straight

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.459 
different configurations one is straight
up<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> down<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.030> other<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.660> kind<00:00:46.379> of

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
up and down and the other is kind of

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.920 
up and down and the other is kind of
weird<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.370> comes<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.210> little

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
weird because it comes with a little

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
weird because it comes with a little
plastic<00:00:49.200> bag<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.149> got

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
plastic bag as you see here and it's got

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.069 
plastic bag as you see here and it's got
these<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:52.010> plastic<00:00:53.010> wedges<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
these little plastic wedges in there and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.650 
these little plastic wedges in there and
I<00:00:55.829> believe<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> little

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
I believe we can see that a little

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.729 
I believe we can see that a little
better<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.399> over<00:00:59.699> here<00:01:00.620> pull<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
side and as you can see there are little

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.870 
side and as you can see there are little
plastic<00:01:06.900> wedge<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.290> sort<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.560> sits<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
plastic wedge it sort of sits into the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.789 
plastic wedge it sort of sits into the
screw<00:01:09.299> holes<00:01:09.830> in<00:01:10.830> setting<00:01:12.320> onto<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> speaker

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
screw holes in setting onto the speaker

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.140 
screw holes in setting onto the speaker
here<00:01:14.010> how<00:01:14.340> many<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.060> can

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
expect them to be terribly great but

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.410 
expect them to be terribly great but
they've<00:01:50.520> got<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> lot<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.909> things<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.329> for

hot at all and on the back you see they

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.220 
hot at all and on the back you see they
have<00:02:05.460> multiple<00:02:05.820> inputs<00:02:06.439> we've<00:02:07.439> got<00:02:08.690> two<00:02:09.890> XLR

have multiple inputs we've got two XLR
and<00:02:12.349> a<00:02:12.530> unbalanced<00:02:13.519> line<00:02:14.150> input<00:02:14.510> there

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and a unbalanced line input there

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.649 
and a unbalanced line input there
there's<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.950> line<00:02:16.129> output<00:02:16.459> as<00:02:16.849> well<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.390> it's

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
there's a line output as well and it's

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.240 
there's a line output as well and it's
got<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.840> little<00:02:17.989> contouring<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:18.980> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
got a little contouring going on and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.640 
got a little contouring going on and
it's<00:02:19.370> got<00:02:19.519> our<00:02:19.549> on<00:02:19.760> board<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.060> trouble<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.420> base

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
it's got our on board in trouble in base

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.589 
it's got our on board in trouble in base
so<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.680> suppose<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.640> marketed<00:02:23.239> towards

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
so I suppose it's just marketed towards

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.410 
so I suppose it's just marketed towards
the<00:02:23.810> really<00:02:24.260> cheap<00:02:24.950> DJ<00:02:25.489> market<00:02:25.940> where<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.180> can

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
the really cheap DJ market where you can

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.380 
the really cheap DJ market where you can
pretty<00:02:27.170> much<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.409> have<00:02:27.500> our<00:02:27.590> onboard<00:02:27.739> mixer<00:02:28.519> but

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
pretty much I have our onboard mixer but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.110 
pretty much I have our onboard mixer but
as<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:30.769> quick<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.160> dirty<00:02:31.220> monitor<00:02:31.790> they're<00:02:31.970> not

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
as a quick and dirty monitor they're not

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.210 
as a quick and dirty monitor they're not
bad<00:02:32.650> try<00:02:33.650> them<00:02:33.739> out<00:02:33.830> they<00:02:33.920> are<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.069> little

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
bad try them out they are a little

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.119 
bad try them out they are a little
lacking<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.790> base<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.930> again<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.980> have

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
lacking in the base but again you have

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.979 
lacking in the base but again you have
some<00:02:37.280> onboard<00:02:37.459> EQ<00:02:38.180> options<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:38.629> that's<00:02:38.810> kind

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
some onboard EQ options so that's kind

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.390 
some onboard EQ options so that's kind
of<00:02:39.019> nice<00:02:39.140> there<00:02:39.410> too

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
of nice there too

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.940 
of nice there too
wait<00:02:40.970> there<00:02:41.360> they<00:02:41.599> weigh<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.900> at<00:02:41.989> about<00:02:42.349> 30

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
wait there they weigh in at about 30

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.020 
wait there they weigh in at about 30
pounds<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:45.099> this<00:02:46.099> one<00:02:46.280> back<00:02:46.459> around<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:46.940> we
