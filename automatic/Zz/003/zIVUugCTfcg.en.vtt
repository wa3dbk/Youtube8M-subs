00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
it's cooled so you're going to want to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.980 
it's cooled so you're going to want to
measure<00:00:14.280> out<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:14.790> much<00:00:14.969> dye<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.389> actually

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
need there are different amounts on the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.179 
need there are different amounts on the
sheet<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.350> they<00:00:19.590> give<00:00:19.770> you

sheet that they give you
I<00:00:20.220> used<00:00:20.760> eight<00:00:21.150> tablespoons<00:00:21.689> because<00:00:22.170> my<00:00:22.320> hair

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
I used eight tablespoons because my hair

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
I used eight tablespoons because my hair
is<00:00:22.590> pretty<00:00:22.710> long<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.010> thick<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:24.210> you're<00:00:24.300> just

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
is pretty long and thick so you're just

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.000 
is pretty long and thick so you're just
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> want<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.019> into<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.529> clear

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
going to want to put that into a clear

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
container or something that's nonmetal

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.139 
container or something that's nonmetal
like<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> wooden<00:00:29.400> bowl<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> glass<00:00:31.050> bowl<00:00:31.410> and

like a wooden bowl or a glass bowl and

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.280 
like a wooden bowl or a glass bowl and
then<00:00:33.149> we're<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> slowly<00:00:33.870> start

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
then we're just going to slowly start

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.799 
then we're just going to slowly start
mixing<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:35.010> our<00:00:35.309> cooled<00:00:35.700> teas<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.600> you're<00:00:36.750> just

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
mixing in our cooled teas so you're just

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020 
mixing in our cooled teas so you're just
going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.020> pour<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.440> mix<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.040> keep<00:00:38.610> pouring

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
going to pour it in mix it keep pouring

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420 
going to pour it in mix it keep pouring
it<00:00:39.180> mixing<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.160> too

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it mixing it you don't want it to be too

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.840 
it mixing it you don't want it to be too
runny

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
runny

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
runny
you<00:00:42.090> want<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> be<00:00:42.540> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.899> thick<00:00:43.340> because

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you want it to be kind of thick because

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.619 
you want it to be kind of thick because
you're<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> need<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> leave<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.390> on

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you're going to need to leave this on

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.940 
you're going to need to leave this on
your<00:00:45.660> head<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> while<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.649> don't<00:00:46.829> want

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
your head for a while so you don't want

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
your head for a while so you don't want
it<00:00:47.039> dripping<00:00:47.370> down<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.700> face<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.780> anything

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it dripping down your face or anything

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.049 
it dripping down your face or anything
like<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.610> about<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
like that so this is about the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
like that so this is about the
consistency<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.840> you're<00:00:55.079> going<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
consistency that you're going to want it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
consistency that you're going to want it
to<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.890> pretty<00:00:56.160> thick<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to be it's pretty thick more like a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.640 
to be it's pretty thick more like a
lotion<00:00:57.270> type<00:00:57.840> consistency

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.470 

so<00:01:04.650> after<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> dyes<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.730> time<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.180> sit

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
so after the dyes have time to sit

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.300 
so after the dyes have time to sit
you're<00:01:06.780> ready<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.080> color<00:01:07.260> your<00:01:07.590> hair<00:01:07.620> just

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.680 
wrap it in like saran wrap or a plastic
bag<00:02:10.430> because<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.730> heat<00:02:11.910> from<00:02:12.060> your<00:02:12.180> body<00:02:12.240> is
