00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that's in the sampler I think and what

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.249 
that's in the sampler I think and what
we<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.250> focused<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.020> were

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
we really focused on in the when we were

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
we really focused on in the when we were
thinking<00:01:49.680> about<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.520> instructional<00:01:51.060> design

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
thinking about the instructional design

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.389 
thinking about the instructional design
of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> program<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.229> how<00:01:52.770> those<00:01:52.979> student

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
of the program was how those student

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.340 
of the program was how those student
activity<00:01:53.850> book<00:01:54.000> pages<00:01:54.509> should<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.140> designed

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
activity book pages should be designed

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.539 
activity book pages should be designed
to<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.619> achieve<00:01:58.740> what<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.219> wanted<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
to really achieve what we wanted to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.120 
to really achieve what we wanted to
achieve<00:01:59.670> with<00:02:00.030> them<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> several

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
achieve with them so the several

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.289 
achieve with them so the several
features<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.729> point<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.270> here

the<00:02:05.880> first<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.509> emphasis<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:07.200> visual

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the first is the emphasis on visual

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.160 
the first is the emphasis on visual
learning<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.700> every<00:02:09.030> student<00:02:09.509> activity<00:02:10.050> book

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
learning so every student activity book

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.809 
learning so every student activity book
page<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> visual<00:02:11.280> learning<00:02:11.459> bridge

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
page this is the visual learning bridge

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.059 
page this is the visual learning bridge
where<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> concept<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.260> explained<00:02:13.770> at<00:02:13.980> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
where the concept is explained at the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.330

the<00:02:14.489> page<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.180> that's<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.140> still<00:02:16.500> version<00:02:17.040> of

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
the page and that's a still version of

the page and that's a still version of
the<00:02:17.489> animation<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.780> visual<00:02:19.110> learning

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
the animation the visual learning

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.949 
the animation the visual learning
animation<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.129> provide<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.670> iwb<00:02:21.390> DVD

animation that we provide on the iwb DVD

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.380 
animation that we provide on the iwb DVD
so<00:02:23.180> I'll<00:02:24.180> show<00:02:24.390> only<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:26.250> your<00:02:26.849> f1<00:02:27.239> to

so I'll show only have a if your f1 to

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.850 
so I'll show only have a if your f1 to
show<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:28.019> we<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.170> them<00:02:28.440> right<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.769> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
show you that we have them right to the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
still version that the children have

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.000 
still version that the children have
with<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.720> important<00:02:34.110> concept<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.739> they<00:02:34.830> can

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
with the important concept that they can

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.740 
with the important concept that they can
keep<00:02:35.310> referring<00:02:35.640> back<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:36.209> at<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> top<00:02:36.599> of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
keep referring back to at the top of

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.979 
keep referring back to at the top of
their<00:02:36.900> pages<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.000> does<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.569> emphasis

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
their pages so that does that emphasis

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.740 
their pages so that does that emphasis
on<00:02:40.110> visual<00:02:40.230> learning<00:02:41.150> also<00:02:42.150> there's<00:02:42.450> not<00:02:42.569> that

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
on visual learning also there's not that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.289 
on visual learning also there's not that
many<00:02:42.900> questions<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.709> page<00:02:44.000> unlike<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> lot

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.550 
be done we try to keep that quite
spacious<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.510> there's<00:02:57.720> plenty<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:58.049> room<00:02:58.260> for

working out children can write wherever
they<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:02.400> we're<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:03.420> focus<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.900> on

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
they like and we're the focus is on

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.930 
they like and we're the focus is on
application<00:03:04.769> rather<00:03:04.950> than<00:03:05.220> practice<00:03:05.640> so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
application rather than practice so

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.119 
application rather than practice so
there's<00:03:06.239> they're<00:03:07.049> viewed<00:03:07.379> an<00:03:07.500> animation

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
there's they're viewed an animation

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.119 
there's they're viewed an animation
they've<00:03:09.120> then<00:03:09.750> had<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> discussion<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.950> their

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
they've then had a discussion in their

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.009 
they've then had a discussion in their
class<00:03:11.400> about<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.000> they've<00:03:12.239> possibly<00:03:12.750> played

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
class about it they've possibly played

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.110 
class about it they've possibly played
played<00:03:13.709> some<00:03:13.950> games<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.489> worked<00:03:14.910> with<00:03:15.060> some

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
played some games and worked with some

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.569 
played some games and worked with some
concrete<00:03:15.450> materials<00:03:16.170> talked<00:03:16.920> about<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.370> and

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
concrete materials talked about it and

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.949 
concrete materials talked about it and
then<00:03:17.700> they've<00:03:17.819> gone<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.150> their<00:03:18.269> books<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.660> 10

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
then they've gone to their books for 10

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.470 
then they've gone to their books for 10
or<00:03:19.079> 15<00:03:19.410> minutes<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.920> actually<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:21.090> have<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> go

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
or 15 minutes to actually they have a go

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.599 
or 15 minutes to actually they have a go
with<00:03:21.840> actually<00:03:22.380> doing<00:03:22.859> some<00:03:23.100> work<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.459> that

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
with actually doing some work in that

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.330 
with actually doing some work in that
area<00:03:24.200> that's<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:25.500> how<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.739> see<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.130> working

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
area that's that's how we see it working

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.770 
area that's that's how we see it working
so<00:03:26.670> we're<00:03:26.819> not<00:03:26.910> giving<00:03:27.389> them<00:03:27.510> we're<00:03:27.660> not

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
so we're not giving them we're not

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.059 
so we're not giving them we're not

the<00:03:55.260> teachers<00:03:55.650> as<00:03:55.799> well<00:03:55.829> as<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.190> students<00:03:56.669> so

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
the teachers as well as the students so

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.490 
the teachers as well as the students so
within<00:03:57.329> every<00:03:57.599> teacher<00:03:57.840> booklet

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
within every teacher booklet

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.409 
within every teacher booklet
we've<00:03:58.950> got<00:03:59.130> maths<00:03:59.340> background<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.030> teachers

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
we've got maths background for teachers

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.330 
we've got maths background for teachers
predictably<00:04:01.139> we<00:04:01.380> start<00:04:01.620> off<00:04:01.709> with<00:04:01.829> Australian

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340

much<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.240> focus<00:04:48.540> on<00:04:48.690> maths<00:04:48.900> language<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:50.130> you

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
much to focus on maths language so you

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.490 
much to focus on maths language so you
can<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.670> think<00:04:51.210> when<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.690> time<00:04:51.720> comes<00:04:52.200> and

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
can I think when the time comes and

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.380 
can I think when the time comes and
you're<00:04:52.590> planning<00:04:53.190> for<00:04:53.370> implementation<00:04:54.210> of

you're planning for implementation of
the<00:04:54.510> curriculum<00:04:54.870> you'll<00:04:55.020> have<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.260> tick<00:04:55.440> off

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
the curriculum you'll have to tick off

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.660 
the curriculum you'll have to tick off
that<00:04:55.800> you've<00:04:55.920> addressed<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.370> general

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
that you've addressed the general

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.450 
that you've addressed the general
capabilities<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.800> by<00:04:58.800> using<00:04:59.160> something<00:04:59.370> like

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
capabilities and by using something like

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.340 
capabilities and by using something like
envision<00:05:00.030> we've<00:05:00.210> got<00:05:00.390> vocab<00:05:00.780> lists<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.200> math

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
envision we've got vocab lists and math

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.380 
envision we've got vocab lists and math
a<00:05:01.380> big<00:05:01.650> focus<00:05:02.010> on<00:05:02.130> math<00:05:02.280> language<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.240> it's

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
a big focus on math language and so it's

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.930 
a big focus on math language and so it's
all<00:05:03.540> there<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:04.370> pedagogical<00:05:05.370> year<00:05:05.820> each

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
all there a pedagogical year each

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.640 
all there a pedagogical year each
classroom<00:05:06.270> is<00:05:06.660> one<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:06.930> which<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.200> range<00:05:07.440> of
