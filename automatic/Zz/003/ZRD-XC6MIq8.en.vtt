exhaust<00:00:04.350> intake<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.879> we're<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.180> to

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
exhaust intake and we're going to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.150 
exhaust intake and we're going to
measure<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:07.319> millimeters<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:10.950> check

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
measure the millimeters so we check

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.390 
measure the millimeters so we check
valve<00:00:11.429> clearances<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> valves

valve clearances on the valves

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:24.170 
valve clearances on the valves
there's<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.610> intake<00:00:16.580> one<00:00:17.580> two<00:00:18.439> three<00:00:21.619> and<00:00:23.180> it

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
there's the intake one two three and it

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.160 
there's the intake one two three and it
one<00:00:24.930> two<00:00:26.119> this<00:00:27.119> thing<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.510> need<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.990> turn

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
one two this thing we need to do is turn

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.580 
one two this thing we need to do is turn
the<00:00:28.320> engine<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> top<00:00:28.920> dead<00:00:29.160> center

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
the engine to top dead center

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.940 
the engine to top dead center
no<00:00:31.590> center<00:00:31.920> screw<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.430> remove<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.770> this<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
no center screw you remove that this is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.920 
no center screw you remove that this is
the<00:00:35.070> timing<00:00:35.340> mark<00:00:35.670> screw<00:00:36.059> cover<00:00:36.829> thanks<00:00:38.930> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the timing mark screw cover thanks the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.240 
the timing mark screw cover thanks the
big<00:00:40.079> screw<00:00:40.350> down<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.070> turn

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
big screw down here is what you turn

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.770 
big screw down here is what you turn
okay<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.120> close<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.570> get

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
okay there that's as close as I can get

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.840 
okay there that's as close as I can get
for<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.289> turn<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> motor<00:00:47.010> by<00:00:47.219> hand<00:00:47.520> we'll

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
for to turn the motor by hand we'll

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.490 
for to turn the motor by hand we'll
remove<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> compression<00:00:48.539> by<00:00:48.930> taking<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
remove the compression by taking the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.939 
remove the compression by taking the
spark<00:00:49.770> plug<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:56.809> until<00:00:57.809> both<00:00:58.020> lobes<00:00:58.379> line<00:00:58.739> up

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
spark plug out until both lobes line up

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.429 
spark plug out until both lobes line up
with<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.399> motor<00:00:59.609> go<00:00:59.910> ahead

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:10.410 

easy<00:01:05.540> there<00:01:06.540> comes<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.350> dot

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.100 

just<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.290> touch<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.939> is<00:01:13.180> do<00:01:13.360> you<00:01:13.450> have<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.750> mark

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
just a touch now is do you have the mark

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.850 
just a touch now is do you have the mark
there<00:01:14.320> yeah<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.430> top<00:01:15.580> dead<00:01:15.790> center<00:01:16.740> there's<00:01:17.740> a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
there yeah the top dead center there's a

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.340 
there yeah the top dead center there's a
timing<00:01:18.130> mark<00:01:18.490> there's<00:01:19.390> three<00:01:19.780> of<00:01:19.810> them

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
timing mark there's three of them

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.800 
timing mark there's three of them
the<00:01:21.130> big<00:01:21.369> one<00:01:21.549> goes<00:01:21.759> by<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.030> center<00:01:22.479> one<00:01:22.630> goes

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
the big one goes by the center one goes

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.840 
the big one goes by the center one goes
by<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.350> one<00:01:23.500> on<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.740> right<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.189> just<00:01:24.460> even

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
by and the one on the right is just even

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.789 
by and the one on the right is just even
in<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.360> hole<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.570> see<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.080> mark<00:01:26.350> on<00:01:26.590> the

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
in the hole you see the mark on the

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.749 
in the hole you see the mark on the
golden<00:01:27.930> metal<00:01:28.930> rim<00:01:29.289> catches<00:01:30.100> up<00:01:30.310> with<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
golden metal rim catches up with the

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.980 
golden metal rim catches up with the
mark<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:32.020> timing<00:01:32.409> mark<00:01:32.619> pretty<00:01:33.009> close<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.720> we

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
mark the timing mark pretty close so we

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.830 
mark the timing mark pretty close so we
are<00:01:35.080> at<00:01:35.170> top<00:01:35.380> dead<00:01:35.619> center<00:01:36.039> because<00:01:36.840> because

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
are at top dead center because because

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.059 
are at top dead center because because
the<00:01:38.049> dot<00:01:38.289> lines<00:01:39.220> up<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:39.880> side<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:44.069> the

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
the dot lines up on this side and the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.669 
the dot lines up on this side and the
dot<00:01:45.250> lines<00:01:45.580> up<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.490> this<00:01:49.149> side<00:01:49.679> with
