00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the others first thing on this lens to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.420 
the others first thing on this lens to
know<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.270> can<00:00:45.420> see<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:46.410> got<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> big<00:00:46.950> old<00:00:47.160> bull

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430

this<00:00:47.670> piece<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> glass<00:00:48.149> okay<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> front<00:00:49.590> so

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
this piece of glass okay on the front so

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.279 
this piece of glass okay on the front so
it's<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> 77<00:00:50.910> millimeter<00:00:51.239> aperture<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
it's a 77 millimeter aperture on the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.400 
it's a 77 millimeter aperture on the
front<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> lens<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.170> most<00:00:55.170> people

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
front of the lens but the most people

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
front of the lens but the most people
think<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.610> can't<00:00:56.879> buy

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
think with this is that you can't buy

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.270 
think with this is that you can't buy
filters<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.899> protect<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> okay<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.160> why

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
filters to protect it okay so that's why

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.740 
filters to protect it okay so that's why
it's<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.430> really<00:01:00.270> important<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it's really really important that you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.429 
it's really really important that you
keep<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.649> lens<00:01:01.829> cap<00:01:02.100> safe<00:01:02.870> right<00:01:03.870> well<00:01:04.140> what

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
keep the lens cap safe right well what

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.760 
keep the lens cap safe right well what
we're<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.769> talking<00:01:05.070> about<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.610> filters<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
we're just talking about the filters you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.080 
we're just talking about the filters you
can't<00:01:07.770> put<00:01:07.860> normal<00:01:08.100> filter<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.760> there<00:01:08.909> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
can't put normal filter on but there is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.050 
can't put normal filter on but there is
of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.840> moment<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.890> filter<00:01:11.340> system<00:01:11.850> by

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
of the moment one filter system by

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.109 
of the moment one filter system by
coming<00:01:12.450> called<00:01:12.630> leaf<00:01:12.960> filters<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.700> users

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
coming called leaf filters really users

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.600 
coming called leaf filters really users
of<00:01:15.240> Google<00:01:15.320> lis<00:01:16.320> filters<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> system

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
of Google lis filters they do a system

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890 
of Google lis filters they do a system
that<00:01:17.759> goes<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.540> comes<00:01:18.780> right

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
that goes on and it kind of comes right

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
that goes on and it kind of comes right
at<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> top<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> back<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.430> can't

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
at the top of the back then you can't

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.200 
at the top of the back then you can't
slide<00:01:20.939> large<00:01:21.240> filters<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.810> front<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.700> think

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
slide large filters in front but I think

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.450 
slide large filters in front but I think
it's<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.360> 150<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.530> 200<00:01:25.890> pounds<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it's about 150 to 200 pounds for the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
it's about 150 to 200 pounds for the
system<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.990> something<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
system so you know it's something to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
system so you know it's something to
bear<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.409> mind<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> look

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
bear in mind but you do have to look

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.630 
bear in mind but you do have to look
after<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> front<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.570> lens<00:01:31.640> also

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
after the front of this lens also

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.359 
after the front of this lens also
pointed<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:34.040> zooming<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
pointed out when you are zooming in and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.219 
pointed out when you are zooming in and
out<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.600> unlike<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> lot<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
out you can see that unlike a lot of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.649 
out you can see that unlike a lot of
other<00:01:37.380> Nikon<00:01:37.799> lens<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.520> front<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
other Nikon lens is the front of the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.219 
other Nikon lens is the front of the
elements<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> lens<00:01:40.470> does<00:01:41.210> move<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
elements of the lens does move and it

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.490 
elements of the lens does move and it
just<00:01:43.380> stick<00:01:43.560> out<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.740> their<00:01:44.100> zone

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
just stick out of their zone

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.470 
just stick out of their zone
want<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.950> watch<00:01:45.100> it's<00:01:45.850> got<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.060> nice<00:01:46.180> gold

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
want to watch it's got the nice gold

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.180 
want to watch it's got the nice gold
ring<00:01:46.690> around<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.260> windows<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.680> carry<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.950> pro

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
ring around so windows you carry a pro

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.480 
ring around so windows you carry a pro
lens<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.870> big<00:01:50.590> goal<00:01:50.770> then<00:01:50.950> for<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.280> nano

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
lens and big goal then for the nano

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.190 
lens and big goal then for the nano
crystal<00:01:51.940> codes<00:01:52.150> on<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.540> front<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.960> try<00:01:53.140> to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
crystal codes on the front to try to
