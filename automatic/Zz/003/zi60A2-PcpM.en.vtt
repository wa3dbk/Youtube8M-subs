00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.320
[theme music]

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.320
[fizz, sip]

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.040
Aahhh!

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.800
Everybody knows SimCity.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.080
SimCity was great, SimCity is great,
SimCity will always be great.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.260
And one of the best parts of the game

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560
was not only being able to build a great city,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.660
it was being able to destroy everything just as easily

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.980
as you'd created it, if not much easier.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380
Have you ever wanted to maybe
get a little bit more involved,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.960
say down to street level and destroy that city?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180
Seriously, I mean when you look at your metropolis,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.700
doesn't it just make you want to strap rocket
launchers on a Volkswagen Bug hovercraft

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.700
and blow it up to cheesy rock music?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.360
Heh, well, um...

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.280
Uh, well, that's too bad because

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.640
enter Streets of SimCity,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.220
the game that fulfilled the longing nobody had.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.160
Apparently with Streets, you get
"mayhem in your metropolis."

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.260
"Your city to cruise through or bruise through."

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.320
What in the world? Why did Maxis make this?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.140
They were known for open-ended
toy-like games like SimCity,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.800
SimAnt, SimTower.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.140
But then Streets comes along out of nowhere

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.140
with machine guns and oil slicks.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.780
So let's go back in time just a little bit.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.920
In 1996, Maxis was in a very shaky position.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.160
They had just released SimCity 2000
a couple of years before

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.300
and had hit their peak,
but things soon got stale.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.920
The suits that had a stake in the company
pressured management for profits,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.700
management pressured designers
into making new games,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.660
and as part of this push, the company
was split into several specialty areas.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.460
One was just plain old Maxis,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.000
where new traditional games like
SimCity 3000 were to be made.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.020
The next was Maxis Kids,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.300
which made edutainment games for kids like SimTunes.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.280
And the next was Maxis Sports,
which was going to make...

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.400
sports games, I guess.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.020
This was the very short-lived branch of
Maxis that produced Streets of SimCity

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.020
and Streets of SimCity only.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.580
It's the only game to come out of the Sports line.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.780
You may be asking,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.140
Is blowing stuff up with cars a sport?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.080
Well, this was the later half of the 1990s.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.500
Vehicular combat

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.800
may as well have been the national pastime,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.860
as far as game companies were concerned.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.660
SimCopter was released not too long before Streets

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.220
and introduced the first Maxis 3D engine

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.700
where you could fly around cities

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.420
made in SimCity 2000.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.280
It wasn't a horrible game,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.940
but it was rushed due to management's
push for multiple games that year.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.660
And it suffered because of it.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.820
The result was ugly,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.820
and not the slickest product to
come from Maxis, to be sure.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.800
Streets of SimCity went ahead
and took that same game engine

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.840
and tweaked it a bit to make a driving game.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.520
Streets starts you off with
one of the best installers ever,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.120
which really sets the tone of the game.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.160
[funky music]

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.340
The whole thing is set up like a
group of 1970s TV show episodes,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.480
where the career is putting you through four of them

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.480
with no real clear overall goal in mind,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.800
other than to earn money to go to the next episode.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.920
These include destroying cars,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.940
delivering packages, outrunning cops

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.480
and traditional circuit races.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.680
Each part of the game has some
of that classic Maxis humor,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.500
which really helps things out quite a bit,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.820
since none of the races are particularly interesting.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.380
The humor also bleeds over
into the in-car radio stations,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.140
similar to what GTA III did years later.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.400
It's got spoof commercials, esoteric DJs

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.780
and lots of music,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.480
some of which is extremely memorable

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.780
and was actually used in later games like The Sims.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.040
[rock song plays]

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.700
And if you get bored of the radio
stations, you can make your own.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.820
It even shows you how to do this
in the game's extensive manual.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.720
Like, really, this manual is big.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.960
For no reason. It's a really simple game.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.880
This is easily the best parts of Streets:

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.200
the customization.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200
You have five cars to choose from

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.320
and each of them can use custom paint jobs and parts,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.460
and can be saved to your garage in the Car Factory.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680
Player's Choice is a simple practice mode.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800
SOULFUL VOICE:
Practice mode...

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.420
LGR:
Here you can choose any SimCity 2000
map that come with the game

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.120
or one that you've made yourself.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.580
It also comes with the SimCity 2000
Urban Renewal Kit program for making tracks,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.120
and a race editor to add things like checkpoints.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.460
And now to the gameplay itself.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.240
It really comes down to an
open-world combat racing game

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.020
where you can drive anywhere within the city limits.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.220
If you get damaged or need supplies,

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.600
you can pull up to a gas station to fill up.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.800
Depending on your car's abilities,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.040
you can shoot down buildings, shoot other cars,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.840
fly over mountains and generally act like a maniac.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.160
It's actually pretty darn fun
if you're just messing around,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.220
but in the career, it's just a PAIN!

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.160
The driving model is horrific,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.080
with your car spinning all
around without it ever really feeling

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.940
like you have a real handle on the car.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.500
The opponents are completely
braindead, spastic and overall useless.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.700
Weapons aren't easy to use,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.680
since there's no way to aim,
other than aiming your car,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.020
and the horrible handling just makes that worse.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.780
On top of this, the game is absolutely
chock-full of bugs and glitches.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.040
Sometimes you'll appear on top of a building,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.560
your opponents will go flying
through the air for no reason,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.440
the road will launch you in the air.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.520
The game is also very prone
to crashing the entire system.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.260
If you have a Voodoo card,
you can run the game in 3dfx Glide mode.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.160
Which is better than software mode,
but the game still looks like crap.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.660
And it runs really choppily,
no matter which hardware you use

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.320
and what kind of processor you have.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.960
But when you forget about all of that,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.140
the game is an absolute blast.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.700
There's nothing quite like being able to fly around

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.200
like in "Back to the Future" in a city YOU built

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.060
then blow it all to pieces.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.720
When you're just going crazy and
exploring your cities, listening to music,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.060
and generally not caring about the goals,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.100
the game really is like nothing else.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.380
I have many fond memories of this
game from when I was younger.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.440
I still don't know why I like it.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.020
It's horrible, really.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.200
But this is a shining example of
a game that's so bad, it is good.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.600
It's nothing close to other games, like Interstate '76,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.320
which it is clearly ripping off.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.200
But it's lots of fun in its own light,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.960
no matter how bad the graphics are,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.360
how bad the cars handle,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.460
and how many times it just bugs out on you.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.940
The atmosphere is also pretty depressing and desolate,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.940
especially with the music off. I like that.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.460
There are only a couple of pedestrians
and cows wandering around,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.980
so it feels kind of like a post-
apocalyptic nightmare landscape

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.500
and it even gets better

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.100
if you play some ambient music in the background.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.960
Shooting cows...

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.480
Streets of SimCity was a commercial and critical failure.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.640
It is NOT a good racing game by any means.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.880
But if you don't think about
it as such, and instead just...

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.660
don't let yourself think AT ALL,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.980
it's stupid fun.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.960
You can find it pretty easily
and very cheaply nowadays,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.180
and it's a must-have for Maxis collectors,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.640
if only because it's the last game Maxis made

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.420
before they were taken over by EA.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.420
Streets of SimCity is just awful.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.740
And that is why I wholeheartedly recommend it.
