that will receive foil stamping first

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.510 
that will receive foil stamping first
we'll<00:00:14.190> start<00:00:14.340> by<00:00:14.880> opening<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:16.109> new<00:00:16.520> document

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
we'll start by opening a new document

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.620 
we'll start by opening a new document
the<00:00:18.330> size<00:00:18.539> will<00:00:18.750> be<00:00:18.779> 3.5<00:00:19.320> by<00:00:19.800> 2

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:38.869 

let's<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.350> fit<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> window<00:00:25.950> here

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.130 

and<00:00:39.570> let's<00:00:39.840> go<00:00:40.050> ahead<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.490 

the<00:00:45.320> window

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.740 

okay<00:00:51.400> now<00:00:51.580> that<00:00:51.640> we<00:00:51.790> have<00:00:51.970> our<00:00:52.000> art<00:00:52.270> board<00:00:52.450> set

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
okay now that we have our art board set

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.650 
okay now that we have our art board set
in<00:00:53.260> place<00:00:53.610> I'll<00:00:54.610> go<00:00:54.880> ahead<00:00:54.970> and<00:00:55.180> add<00:00:55.360> a

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
in place I'll go ahead and add a

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.930 
in place I'll go ahead and add a
background<00:00:56.560> and<00:00:57.130> in<00:00:57.400> this<00:00:57.490> case<00:00:57.700> it's<00:00:57.880> just

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
background and in this case it's just

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.970 
background and in this case it's just
going<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.240> be<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.390> black<00:00:58.720> background<00:00:59.050> okay

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
going to be a black background okay

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.030 
going to be a black background okay
the<00:01:00.490> size<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.120> going<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.270> be<00:01:01.980> 3.75

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
the size of it is going to be 3.75

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.380 
the size of it is going to be 3.75
that's<00:01:03.580> that<00:01:03.940> extra<00:01:04.780> 2.5<00:01:05.320> is<00:01:05.440> for<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.650> bleed

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that's that extra 2.5 is for the bleed

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.760 
that's that extra 2.5 is for the bleed
2.25<00:01:07.390> if<00:01:07.870> you<00:01:07.990> don't<00:01:08.140> know<00:01:08.200> what<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.350> bleed<00:01:08.590> is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
2.25 if you don't know what a bleed is

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.310 
2.25 if you don't know what a bleed is
the<00:01:08.950> bleed<00:01:09.160> is<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.840> outside<00:01:10.840> area<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.200> the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
the bleed is the outside area of the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.410 
the bleed is the outside area of the
card<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.710> gets<00:01:11.830> trimmed<00:01:12.220> away<00:01:12.430> when<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.300> gets

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
card that gets trimmed away when it gets

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.270 
card that gets trimmed away when it gets
cut<00:01:13.660> down<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:15.400> of<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.850> parent<00:01:16.390> sheet<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:18.220> you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
cut down off of the parent sheet as you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.080 
cut down off of the parent sheet as you
can<00:01:18.430> see<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.390> inside<00:01:19.840> here<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:21.280> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
can see the inside here that is the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.170 
can see the inside here that is the
actual<00:01:22.420> size<00:01:22.660> of<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.810> card<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.380> outside<00:01:23.830> is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
actual size of the card the outside is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.390 
actual size of the card the outside is
the<00:01:25.180> bleed<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:25.869> gets<00:01:25.990> trimmed<00:01:26.290> away<00:01:26.440> so<00:01:27.040> then

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
the bleed that gets trimmed away so then

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.070 
the bleed that gets trimmed away so then
change<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:27.790> all<00:01:27.880> black<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:30.210> here's<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.330> quick

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
change it all black and here's a quick

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.290 
change it all black and here's a quick
lesson<00:01:32.320> on<00:01:32.560> changing<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.220> rich<00:01:33.550> black<00:01:33.850> okay

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
that goes on top you don't have to make

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.129 
that goes on top you don't have to make
the<00:03:45.000> color<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.449> foil<00:03:47.230> anything<00:03:47.889> it
