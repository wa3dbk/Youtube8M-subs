one<00:00:05.600> thing<00:00:05.840> to<00:00:05.960> remember<00:00:06.290> is<00:00:06.710> that<00:00:07.430> when

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
one thing to remember is that when

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.760 
one thing to remember is that when
you're<00:00:09.260> doing<00:00:09.410> this<00:00:10.360> if<00:00:11.360> possible<00:00:12.110> you<00:00:12.560> might

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770 
you're doing this if possible you might

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.840 
you're doing this if possible you might
want<00:00:13.010> to<00:00:13.160> keep<00:00:13.450> this<00:00:14.710> side<00:00:15.710> away<00:00:16.220> from<00:00:16.430> the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
want to keep this side away from the

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.810 
want to keep this side away from the
predominant<00:00:17.689> angle<00:00:18.230> from<00:00:18.920> which<00:00:19.130> people<00:00:19.580> will

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
predominant angle from which people will

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.420 
predominant angle from which people will
look<00:00:20.060> at<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.540> dormer<00:00:20.930> in<00:00:21.110> the<00:00:21.200> valleys<00:00:21.619> so

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
look at the dormer in the valleys so

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.550 
look at the dormer in the valleys so
that<00:00:22.610> way<00:00:22.790> you<00:00:22.849> don't<00:00:23.000> see<00:00:23.360> any<00:00:23.570> seams<00:00:23.930> on<00:00:24.230> this

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
that way you don't see any seams on this

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.010 
that way you don't see any seams on this
side<00:00:24.860> the<00:00:25.640> sealant<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:26.300> seams<00:00:26.570> are<00:00:26.840> on

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
side the sealant and the seams are on

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.339 
side the sealant and the seams are on
the<00:00:27.919> side<00:00:28.160> away<00:00:28.869> predominantly<00:00:29.869> away<00:00:30.140> from

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
the side away predominantly away from

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.650 
the side away predominantly away from
view<00:00:30.680> after<00:00:31.520> we've<00:00:31.910> done<00:00:31.939> this<00:00:32.239> initial

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
view after we've done this initial

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.750 
view after we've done this initial
installation<00:00:33.260> then<00:00:33.920> of<00:00:34.070> course<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:34.520> come

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
installation then of course you come

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.290 
installation then of course you come
back<00:00:34.970> with<00:00:35.270> nail<00:00:35.570> clips<00:00:36.579> one<00:00:37.579> foot<00:00:37.850> on<00:00:38.000> center

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
back with nail clips one foot on center

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.990 
back with nail clips one foot on center
and<00:00:38.710> I<00:00:39.710> would<00:00:39.859> suggest<00:00:40.039> putting<00:00:40.460> them

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
and I would suggest putting them

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.130 
and I would suggest putting them
directly<00:00:41.600> opposite<00:00:42.199> each<00:00:42.320> other<00:00:42.620> on<00:00:43.280> both

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
directly opposite each other on both

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.970 
directly opposite each other on both
sides<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:45.769> valley<00:00:45.890> pans<00:00:46.429> again<00:00:47.179> don't

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
sides of the valley pans again don't

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.779 
sides of the valley pans again don't
apart<00:00:48.980> from<00:00:49.129> what<00:00:49.309> we've<00:00:49.429> done<00:00:49.579> up<00:00:49.760> here

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
apart from what we've done up here

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.819 
apart from what we've done up here
you're<00:00:50.269> not<00:00:50.390> even<00:00:50.719> going<00:00:50.929> to<00:00:50.989> penetrate<00:00:51.379> these

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
you're not even going to penetrate these

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.520 
you're not even going to penetrate these
outer<00:00:52.160> pans<00:00:52.640> with<00:00:53.510> nails<00:00:53.839> you're<00:00:54.230> simply

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
outer pans with nails you're simply

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.700 
outer pans with nails you're simply
going<00:00:54.679> to<00:00:54.769> use<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:55.519> nail<00:00:55.699> clips<00:00:56.530> oK<00:00:57.530> we've

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
going to use the nail clips oK we've

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.919 
going to use the nail clips oK we've
come<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.039> the<00:00:58.129> point<00:00:58.280> where<00:00:58.579> our<00:00:58.609> top<00:00:59.539> course

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
come to the point where our top course

valley the next course we're going to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.170 
valley the next course we're going to
bring<00:01:11.690> over<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.620> valley<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.370> lock<00:01:13.640> into<00:01:13.940> this

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
bring over the valley and lock into this

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.200 
bring over the valley and lock into this
ham<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.930> do<00:01:15.560> want<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.010> notice<00:01:16.340> again<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:17.030> we

ham I do want to notice again that we
basically<00:01:17.480> have<00:01:18.020> brought<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.620> valley<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.310> the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
basically have brought the valley to the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.960 
basically have brought the valley to the
edge<00:01:20.600> of<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.670> drip<00:01:22.670> edge<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:25.670> will

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
edge of the drip edge and this will

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.550 
edge of the drip edge and this will
completely<00:01:26.360> dump<00:01:26.720> out<00:01:26.900> on<00:01:27.110> top<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.470> the

shingles now I've got some fascia here

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.600 
shingles now I've got some fascia here
on<00:01:31.730> the<00:01:32.240> on<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:34.240> eve<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:36.170> dormer<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.520> I

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
on the on the eve of the dormer and I

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.090 
on the on the eve of the dormer and I
want<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.880> I've<00:01:38.180> made<00:01:38.510> a<00:01:38.540> piece<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.560> go<00:01:39.950> up

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
want to I've made a piece to go up

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.860 
want to I've made a piece to go up
underneath<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:41.180> want<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.660> notice

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
underneath this and I want you to notice

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.440 
underneath this and I want you to notice
that<00:01:42.020> I've<00:01:42.380> turned<00:01:43.310> back<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.610> quarter<00:01:44.210> of<00:01:44.330> an

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
that I've turned back a quarter of an

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.950 
that I've turned back a quarter of an
inch<00:01:44.540> or<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:44.780> just<00:01:45.260> as<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.500> rain<00:01:46.280> stop<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:47.000> measure

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
inch or so just as a rain stop I measure

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.280 
inch or so just as a rain stop I measure
the<00:01:48.290> distance<00:01:48.710> from<00:01:48.890> my<00:01:49.100> top<00:01:49.430> lock<00:01:49.870> up<00:01:50.870> under

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
the distance from my top lock up under

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.650 
the distance from my top lock up under
here<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.800> see<00:01:51.980> how<00:01:52.250> how<00:01:52.970> long<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:55.970> exposure

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
here to see how how long this exposure

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.520 
here to see how how long this exposure
needs<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.290> be<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:58.640> course<00:01:58.880> I've<00:01:59.150> cut<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.600> at

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
needs to be and of course I've cut it at

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:14.010 
needs to be and of course I've cut it at
the<00:02:00.710> appropriate<00:02:01.750> width<00:02:02.750> too<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.830> go<00:02:04.010> up<00:02:04.160> under

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.050 

this<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.860> gonna<00:02:15.010> take<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> little<00:02:15.640> bit<00:02:15.850> of

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
this is gonna take a little bit of

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.210 
this is gonna take a little bit of
finesse<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:18.250> get<00:02:18.460> into<00:02:19.000> place<00:02:20.040> looks<00:02:21.040> like

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
finesse to get into place looks like

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.660 
finesse to get into place looks like
it's<00:02:21.400> going<00:02:21.670> okay<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.740> got<00:02:23.740> in<00:02:23.920> place<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.640> that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
it's going okay I got in place and that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.990 
it's going okay I got in place and that
at<00:02:25.570> this<00:02:25.750> point<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:27.370> still<00:02:27.640> get<00:02:27.850> up

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
at this point I can still get up

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.850 
at this point I can still get up
underneath<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.820> able<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.860> attach

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
underneath this to be able to attach

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.270 
underneath this to be able to attach
this<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.490> deck<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:35.080> may<00:02:35.650> need<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.040> use<00:02:36.070> a

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
this to the deck I may need to use a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the point where it comes out and goes

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
the point where it comes out and goes
over<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.620> hem<00:03:44.830> on<00:03:45.070> the<00:03:45.400> valley<00:03:45.640> pan<00:03:46.980> slide<00:03:47.980> it
