 we all know that the chicken salad 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.719
 Cesar is an absolute favorite of ours 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.940
 true to take the rhythm of yours that I 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.500
 I know I know that you like it a lot and like 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.260
 I know that you like it a lot we have decided that 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.119
 let's let's improve it a little bit more 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.310
 and in addition to making it easier for 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.990
 you so that you can prepare it in 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.900
 any time to devote any 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.320
 moment based on the sauce that is the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.239
 essence of this salad and that you take us 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.489
 will explain the tricks so that what 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.590
 do better faster and richer as 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.180
 always because the sauce is not going to 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.620
 use raw egg 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.660
 which will allow us to have a 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.550
 sauce made in the fridge and it's going to 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.320
 last for at least a week and list 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.700
 to use it and then the only thing 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.690
 we would need to have all the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.270
 tripping 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.810
 from here and on top of our ale nipples 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.980

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.579

 two tablespoons of lemon juice 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.520

 English or perrins sauce 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.520
 two teaspoons of garlic powder or one 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.380
 chopped fresh 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.950
 a teaspoon of sweet mustard 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.380
 two teaspoons of sugar a pinch of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.869
 salt a pinch of black pepper and then 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.829
 to accompany the cheese salad 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.670
 Grated parmesan 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.369
 the chicken made biloba barbecue the 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.380
 fried bread the raw ones and of course the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.200
 star of the salad that is the 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.939
 well that is well washed romaine lettuce 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.880
 well lara says that spirit so 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.670
 cool is then one of the one of the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.729
 important steps of this salad is the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.519
 good sauce that is special the essence 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.880
 what is special about this one of this 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.670
 recipe then let's take a bowl so 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.980
 we just have to mix, so this is 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.319
 It is very easy and as we said before 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.200
 mayonnaise because this is not going to 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.480
 allow in that demanding industrial we 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.700
 will allow to keep the sauce in the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.940
 fridge without any problem 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.760
 for more time clear a week 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.690
 a sour cream that is going to give that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.470
 special touch that dot the cheese 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.470
 grated parmesan 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.790
 olive oil 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.260
 the lemon juice 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:00.030
 the anchovy pasta that we have made 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.030
 it's just chopping the anchovies 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.040
 the perrins sauce or English sauce 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.990
 special 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.610
 we have the garlic powder that we have said 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.830
 also that can be exchanged for a garlic 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.150
 fresh well minced that and taste 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.150
 the sweet mustard 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.000
 for sweet cup the sugar that goes to 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.480
 counteract the flavors a little 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.420
 strong the pinch of salt do not echéis much 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:36.840
 because as we have already added the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:40.110
 The nape of the neck are well anchored 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.690
 ground black pepper then now with 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.460
 some rods what we are going to do is 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.730
 mix it 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.510
 the wrist exercise 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.180
 and see what texture the salsita has 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.110
 and we are going to use it right now 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.930
 just like that but if we do it a day before 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.549
 It would also be luxury if 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.870
 because it gets cold if you let it rest 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.450
 it is better in the fridge 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.890
 picks up more clear flavor then 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.300
 We, as I told you, are going to 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.580
 look for it we will use it now 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.829
 and the big difference with other sauces 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.629
 Caesar is that we are going to place 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.939
 the ingredients separately without 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:24.400
 mix with the with the salad with the 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:27.159
 sauce that because if not then with the step 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.680
 of time the lettuce every quarter 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.810
 stay him I grew almost and I 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.539
 I prefer so much better much better then 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.129
 here we are going to do it with our hands 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:41.740
 to cut lettuce the lettuce that is 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:43.930
 Roman with his hands, it's basically 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.030
 because if we do it with 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.740
 knife let's say it gets more withered 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.900
 the sheet as it degrades more and that is 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.569
 at a glance two chefs split it 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.719
 sister lettuce I do not know and look where 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.030
 you always learn important things 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:02.710
 provoked into irregular and regular pieces 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.840
 and regular and also natural 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.069
 clear with simple knife and is that it has 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.940
 a point like machine 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.310
 and that always lettuce well lavadita like 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.800
 we have it now yes then I think that 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.330
 it can be worth 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.539
 well then, now that he's wearing this 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.930
 Caesar salad chicken chicken 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.750
 that we have done it in the gray breast of 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.780
 chicken even that we can macerate a 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.120
 little with oregano with some spice 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.979
 special that already to taste so much that acs and 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.670
 of this basically is to add the chicken 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.220
 Wherever it falls 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.810
 and I'm comfortable I think that already with that 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.220
 it can be worth 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.220
 the cons 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.290
 escapes me 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.770
 is that they do not want to be eaten and we are going to 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:03.270
 add the salsita and this already also a 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.729
 little to taste we are going to add well 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:10.370
 bandages because as you go 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.470
 the salad is taken by the diner 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.960
 is going to be taking a little bit of 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.010
 all clear 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.240
 and in addition it was very nice it appears a 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.449
 picture makes 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.580
 then we can also put a little 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.530
 of this sauce in a gravy boat just in 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.210
 someone likes the sauce hey then we 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.400
 we take a little more to taste 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.400
 consumer and they were dictated and finally 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:42.450
 and ready and we here our 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.740
 Caesar chicken salad and you see the 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.410
 salad that we have made for all 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:48.030
 you who have done tomás and that I hope 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.650
 that you enjoy it because it really is worth 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.690
 the penalty is ideal for the times 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:55.770
 hot and cold ones too now 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.780
 but and above all more healthy food and 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:02.690
 with its proteins its vitamins a 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.690
