for<00:00:51.000> reps<00:00:51.360> okay<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> could<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.710> very

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
for reps okay now I could do it very

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
for reps okay now I could do it very
easily<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.699> was<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> couple<00:00:54.120> months<00:00:54.390> ago<00:00:54.539> I

precession and you need to strengthen

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
precession and you need to strengthen
those<00:01:23.850> exercises<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> point<00:01:25.080> where

those exercises to the point where

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.039 
those exercises to the point where
eventually<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:26.610> time<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.450> become<00:01:27.720> strong

at vertical and horizontal poles that's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.340 
at vertical and horizontal poles that's
all<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> takes

315 that little range there and once

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.270 
315 that little range there and once
you're<00:01:42.960> doing<00:01:43.110> weighted<00:01:43.380> pull-ups<00:01:43.590> would<00:01:44.009> say

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
you're doing weighted pull-ups would say

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.730 
you're doing weighted pull-ups would say
50<00:01:45.000> pounds<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.540> least<00:01:45.570> you're<00:01:46.320> gonna<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.710> a

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
50 pounds at least you're gonna have a

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.469 
50 pounds at least you're gonna have a
pretty<00:01:47.040> good<00:01:47.310> back<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.880> point<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
pretty good back at that point and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
pretty good back at that point and
that's<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> simplicity<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> best

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that's the simplicity of it and the best

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.859 
that's the simplicity of it and the best
part<00:01:50.549> about<00:01:50.579> back<00:01:50.909> training<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
part about back training of that is that

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
part about back training of that is that
it's<00:01:52.049> really<00:01:52.439> easy<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:53.009> maintain<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.670> not

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
it's really easy to maintain it's not

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.179 
it's really easy to maintain it's not
difficult<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.509> build<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.869> back<00:01:55.020> back<00:01:55.500> unless

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
difficult to build it back back unless

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.709 
difficult to build it back back unless
you<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:56.850> bad<00:01:57.000> genetics<00:01:57.570> like

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you have really bad genetics like

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.929 
you have really bad genetics like
highlight<00:01:58.290> insertions<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.549> joke<00:01:59.790> to

highlight insertions it's a joke to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.910 
highlight insertions it's a joke to
build<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.390> my<00:02:00.570> opinion<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.560> easiest

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
build in my opinion it's the easiest

body<00:02:02.369> part<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.880> develop<00:02:03.270> okay<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:04.229> maybe

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
body part to develop okay now maybe

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.959 
body part to develop okay now maybe
because<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> have<00:02:05.250> good<00:02:05.399> genetics<00:02:05.850> or

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
because I have good genetics or

recommend like I'm always talking about
my<00:02:29.940> videos<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.810> can<00:02:30.960> ask<00:02:31.110> as<00:02:31.350> strong<00:02:31.680> and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
my videos you can ask as strong and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.800 
my videos you can ask as strong and
multiple<00:02:32.400> variations<00:02:32.730> okay<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.480> you're<00:02:33.720> gonna

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
multiple variations okay so you're gonna

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.300 
multiple variations okay so you're gonna
have<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.960> do<00:02:34.110> similar<00:02:34.530> movements<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.100> say<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
have to do similar movements to say a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.780 
have to do similar movements to say a
dumbbell<00:02:35.820> go<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.510> unilateral<00:02:37.020> machine<00:02:37.920> row

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790

or<00:02:39.030> cable<00:02:39.990> row<00:02:40.260> something<00:02:40.890> like<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.160> I

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
or cable row something like that I

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.520 
or cable row something like that I
mimics<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.820> movement<00:02:42.180> pattern<00:02:42.540> or<00:02:42.900> dumbbell

chin-ups<00:02:57.240> wide<00:02:57.600> pull-ups<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.920> mean<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.700> like

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
chin-ups wide pull-ups I mean this like

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.120 
chin-ups wide pull-ups I mean this like
I<00:03:00.240> said<00:03:00.450> million<00:03:01.290> things<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.560> do<00:03:01.770> just<00:03:02.010> get

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
I said million things to do just get

and<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.440> upper<00:03:13.590> back<00:03:13.740> thickness<00:03:14.160> not<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.520> much

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
and the upper back thickness not so much

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.960 
and the upper back thickness not so much
the<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.720> track<00:03:15.960> that's<00:03:16.230> for<00:03:16.500> another<00:03:16.560> video

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.450
