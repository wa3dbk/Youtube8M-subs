intelligent homes have and will become a
big<00:00:08.580> part<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.000> our<00:00:09.150> lives

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
big part in our lives

big part in our lives
doors<00:00:10.170> lock<00:00:10.440> automatically<00:00:11.070> shutters<00:00:11.639> closed

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
doors lock automatically shutters closed

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.490 
doors lock automatically shutters closed
without<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.480> having<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.840> touch<00:00:13.139> any<00:00:13.410> buttons

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
without you having to touch any buttons

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.580 
without you having to touch any buttons
and<00:00:13.950> lights<00:00:14.490> turn<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:14.940> all<00:00:15.240> by<00:00:15.480> themselves<00:00:15.719> so

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
and lights turn on all by themselves so

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.470 
and lights turn on all by themselves so
I<00:00:16.619> thought<00:00:16.949> why<00:00:17.279> not<00:00:17.310> integrate<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.180> idea

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
I thought why not integrate this idea

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.349 
I thought why not integrate this idea
into<00:00:18.750> Minecraft<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.880> here<00:00:21.210> are

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
into Minecraft so what we have here are

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.019 
into Minecraft so what we have here are
a<00:00:21.390> couple<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.900> lights<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.410> couple<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.460> doors<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
a couple of lights a couple of doors and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.570 
a couple of lights a couple of doors and
a<00:00:24.449> window<00:00:24.810> right<00:00:25.019> there<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.130> does<00:00:26.340> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
a window right there and what it does is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.700 
a window right there and what it does is
it's<00:00:27.029> trigger<00:00:27.300> by<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.720> daylight<00:00:28.349> sensor

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it's trigger by this daylight sensor

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.620 
it's trigger by this daylight sensor
right<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.220> which<00:00:29.640> i<00:00:29.910> think<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> pretty

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
right here which i think is a pretty

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.310 
right here which i think is a pretty
cool<00:00:31.640> not<00:00:32.640> invention<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.329> wouldn't<00:00:33.660> say<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:33.870> but

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
cool not invention I wouldn't say so but

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.819 
cool not invention I wouldn't say so but
it's<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.649> cool<00:00:35.190> concept<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.829> yea

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it's a cool concept that you can yea

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.340 
it's a cool concept that you can yea
just<00:00:38.070> rely<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.719> make<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.140> house

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350

take a look from this angle and we can

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
take a look from this angle and we can
see<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> shutter<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.530> action<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
your house so let's go into a little bit

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
your house so let's go into a little bit
of<00:01:26.729> detail<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.619> use

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
of detail about this all we have to use

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.620 
of detail about this all we have to use
is<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> daylight<00:01:29.549> sensor<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.509> of

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
is a daylight sensor and a bit of

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.050 
is a daylight sensor and a bit of
redstone<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.950> know<00:01:32.130> how<00:01:32.579> daylight

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
redstone and you know how daylight

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.600 
redstone and you know how daylight
sensors<00:01:33.479> work<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.680> them<00:01:34.860> just

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
sensors work if not you can them just

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.730 
sensors work if not you can them just
try<00:01:35.790> them<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.119> by<00:01:36.299> yourself<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:37.049> lay<00:01:37.500> down<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
try them out by yourself just lay down a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.490 
try them out by yourself just lay down a
track<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.369> redstone<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.350> then

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
track of redstone like this and then

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.280 
track of redstone like this and then
you'll<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.970> more<00:01:42.210> daylight<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.049> will

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
you'll see the more daylight there will

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.859 
you'll see the more daylight there will
be<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.340> most<00:01:44.549> will<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.000> when<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.570> noon

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
be and the most will be when it's noon

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
be and the most will be when it's noon
so<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> Sun<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.250> highest<00:01:47.460> point

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
so when the Sun is at the highest point

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.840 
so when the Sun is at the highest point
then<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.020> signal<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.009> strongest<00:01:50.310> if

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
then the signal will be the strongest if

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.810 
then the signal will be the strongest if
it's<00:01:51.270> nighttime<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.350> full<00:01:52.820> nighttime

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it's nighttime and it's full nighttime

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.929 
it's nighttime and it's full nighttime
like<00:01:54.060> when<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.479> um<00:01:55.130> up<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> moon

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
like when it's um up there when the moon

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.289 
like when it's um up there when the moon
is<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.210> there<00:01:57.390> it'll<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.590> lowest<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.729> you

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
is up there it'll be the lowest so you

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.440 
is up there it'll be the lowest so you
can<00:02:00.479> use<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.049> principle<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.450> say<00:02:05.210> when<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
can use this principle to say when the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.859 
can use this principle to say when the
redstone<00:02:06.899> signal<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.459> underneath<00:02:08.459> here<00:02:08.869> then

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
redstone signal is underneath here then

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.280 
redstone signal is underneath here then
it<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.080> gonna<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:10.890> too<00:02:11.400> dark<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.150> then<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:13.050> want

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
it is gonna be too dark and then we want

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.820 
it is gonna be too dark and then we want
the<00:02:13.410> lights

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the lights

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.430 
the lights
turn<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.790> let's<00:02:15.000> place<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.630> repeater<00:02:15.930> or

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
turn it on so let's place a repeater or

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.340 
turn it on so let's place a repeater or
a<00:02:16.530> block<00:02:17.310> let's<00:02:18.090> say<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.540> place<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> block<00:02:19.110> right

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
a block let's say we place a block right

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.150 
a block let's say we place a block right
here<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:20.490> place<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.330> redstone<00:02:21.810> torch

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
here and then place a redstone torch

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.070 
here and then place a redstone torch
right<00:02:23.160> there<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.610> that'll<00:02:24.330> tell<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:25.050> example

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
right there and that'll tell for example

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.590 
right there and that'll tell for example
our<00:02:25.560> lights<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.160> turn<00:02:26.520> off<00:02:26.820> right<00:02:27.390> now

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
our lights to turn off right now

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.720 
our lights to turn off right now
Wednesday<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.770> know<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.340> redstone

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
Wednesday and you know the redstone

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.880 
Wednesday and you know the redstone
signal<00:02:29.880> will<00:02:30.300> go<00:02:30.450> stronger<00:02:30.930> or<00:02:31.290> will<00:02:31.650> get

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
signal will go stronger or will get

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.460 
signal will go stronger or will get
stronger<00:02:32.310> when<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.850> Sun<00:02:33.060> goes<00:02:33.300> up<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
stronger when the Sun goes up and the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.280 
stronger when the Sun goes up and the
redstone<00:02:34.890> signal<00:02:35.070> yeah<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.910> gradually

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.940 

increases<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.500> then<00:02:40.950> it'll<00:02:41.250> only<00:02:42.680> yeah<00:02:43.680> not

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
increases and then it'll only yeah not

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.190 
increases and then it'll only yeah not
trigger<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.700> torch<00:02:44.970> Seoul<00:02:45.270> will<00:02:45.510> say<00:02:45.750> off<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
trigger the torch Seoul will say off and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.140 
trigger the torch Seoul will say off and
the<00:02:46.290> light<00:02:46.440> will<00:02:46.680> also<00:02:47.010> stay<00:02:47.220> off<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.970> then

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
the light will also stay off but then

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.150 
the light will also stay off but then
when<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:48.600> turning<00:02:49.080> night<00:02:49.410> time<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
when it's turning night time the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.940 
when it's turning night time the
redstone<00:02:50.580> signal<00:02:50.760> will<00:02:51.120> decrease<00:02:51.930> it'll<00:02:52.530> get

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
redstone signal will decrease it'll get

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.910 
redstone signal will decrease it'll get
weaker<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.730> thus<00:02:54.390> trigger<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.410> torch<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
weaker and thus trigger this torch and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.670 
weaker and thus trigger this torch and
that<00:02:56.850> will<00:02:57.150> turn<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.750> lamp<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.170> that's<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
that will turn on the lamp and that's a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.580 
that will turn on the lamp and that's a
simple<00:02:59.480> simple<00:03:00.480> principle<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:00.990> we're<00:03:01.380> using

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
simple simple principle that we're using

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.800 
simple simple principle that we're using
for<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.130> its<00:03:02.550> piston<00:03:03.000> right<00:03:03.209> here<00:03:03.420> which<00:03:03.660> is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
for this its piston right here which is

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.410 
for this its piston right here which is
supposing<00:03:04.200> pushing<00:03:04.800> up<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.070> blind<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.550> also

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
supposing pushing up the blind and also

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.270 
supposing pushing up the blind and also
the<00:03:06.570> doors<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.290> lights<00:03:07.500> outside<00:03:07.740> there

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the doors and the lights outside there

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.040 
the doors and the lights outside there
and<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:08.790> think<00:03:08.880> that's<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.420> pretty<00:03:09.540> cool<00:03:09.810> concept

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
and I think that's a pretty cool concept

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.800 
and I think that's a pretty cool concept
that<00:03:10.500> will<00:03:10.740> make<00:03:10.980> your<00:03:11.610> friends<00:03:12.060> impress<00:03:12.450> even

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that will make your friends impress even

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.140 
that will make your friends impress even
if<00:03:12.990> they're<00:03:13.290> um<00:03:13.530> or<00:03:14.040> especially<00:03:14.550> when<00:03:15.000> they're

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
if they're um or especially when they're

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.350 
if they're um or especially when they're
new<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.750> game<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.080> they<00:03:16.530> see<00:03:16.770> this

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
new to the game and they see this

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.880 
new to the game and they see this
door<00:03:18.360> closing<00:03:18.959> when<00:03:19.140> it's<00:03:19.290> nighttime<00:03:19.650> whoo

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
door closing when it's nighttime whoo
