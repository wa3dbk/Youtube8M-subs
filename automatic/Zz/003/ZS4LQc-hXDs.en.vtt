 aboard the ship of the dead yesterday you can 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.670
 always find two people 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.770
 there are those who create what sleeps 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.060
 of course imprisoned not those and 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.340
 those who carry chains to the north 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.990

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.130
 for giving an early false raise 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.590
