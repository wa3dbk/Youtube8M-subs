00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
newest handheld console from Nintendo

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.900 
newest handheld console from Nintendo
it's<00:00:18.539> mostly<00:00:19.230> geared<00:00:19.560> towards<00:00:20.130> younger<00:00:20.520> kids

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's mostly geared towards younger kids

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.990 
it's mostly geared towards younger kids
of<00:00:21.210> six<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.779> seven<00:00:22.170> because<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.550> doesn't<00:00:23.880> have

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
of six and seven because it doesn't have

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.320 
of six and seven because it doesn't have
3d<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> name<00:00:25.230> would<00:00:25.380> suggest<00:00:25.590> because<00:00:26.550> it's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
3d as a name would suggest because it's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.960 
3d as a name would suggest because it's
a<00:00:27.390> 2d<00:00:27.660> s<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.830> won't<00:00:28.980> screw<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.340> your<00:00:29.580> eyes<00:00:29.640> if

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
a 2d s so it won't screw up your eyes if

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840 
a 2d s so it won't screw up your eyes if
you're<00:00:30.150> young<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.510> developing<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.669> it<00:00:32.669> also

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
you're young and developing and it also

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.420 
you're young and developing and it also
does<00:00:33.360> not<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.110> hinge<00:00:34.350> design<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:35.100> sleep

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
does not have the hinge design to sleep

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.260 
does not have the hinge design to sleep
so<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.899> gonna<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.140> harder<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.649> sit<00:00:38.460> down<00:00:38.940> on

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
so it's gonna be harder to sit down on

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.040 
so it's gonna be harder to sit down on
and<00:00:39.510> break

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
and break

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
and break
however<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.800> screens<00:00:41.219> will<00:00:41.760> need<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.059> be

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
however the screens will need to be

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.510 
however the screens will need to be
protected<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.930> they<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.260> exposed<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
protected as they are exposed so I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.470 
protected as they are exposed so I
recommend<00:00:44.910> getting<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:45.719> $15<00:00:46.500> bags

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
recommend getting one of these $15 bags

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.560 
recommend getting one of these $15 bags
now<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.620> also<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.520> good<00:00:51.000> entry<00:00:51.270> level

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
now this is a also very good entry level

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.750 
now this is a also very good entry level
system<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:53.570> $120<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.170> $40<00:00:56.160> less<00:00:56.430> than

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
system as is $120 which is $40 less than

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
system as is $120 which is $40 less than
the<00:00:57.030> 3ds<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.770> $70<00:00:59.640> less<00:00:59.910> than<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.719> 3ds

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the 3ds and about $70 less than the 3ds

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
the 3ds and about $70 less than the 3ds
XL<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.570> when<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.530> two<00:01:05.280> DS<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.180> get

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
XL so when you get the two DS you get

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.710 
XL so when you get the two DS you get
