00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.910
 hello dear family imac spectators 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.730
 fabian here with a test too much 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.460
 as2 the original fieldrunners appeared 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.830
 2008 in the app store and was one of the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.720
 biggest hits of his time many 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.060
 Observer of still young iphone 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.150
 market names apple mobile phone first time 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.040
 properly as a game console was the lay before 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.590
 everything about the good presentation of the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.320
 titels and the fact that much to it 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.989
 us the touchscreen optimally exploited 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.239
 amazingly, it has now been four long 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.550
 It took years for the developers to arrive 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.159
 successors on their legs 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.409
 but the waiting time has come 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.409
 well worth it so much was already betrayed 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.600
 as2 is just like that 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.940
 predecessor a classic tower defense 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.710
 The title is basically 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.990
 to a simplified variant of 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.360
 strategy titles such as command and conquer 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.520
 or starcraft you placed on one 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.770
 map defense towers around the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.219
 rushing enemy waves towards it 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.159
 prevent 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.890
 reach your base depending on the map 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.659
 there are different amounts of waves and 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.049
 it also differs like many 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.600
 opponents of your base may get too close 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.759
 on some cards you have 20 chances 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.710
 on other cards only three are allowed 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.689
 reach the enemy camp 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.539
 one of the biggest strengths of 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.560
 fieldrunners 2 is the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.329
 Diversity for the developers 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.070
 have the mission very different 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.590
 you just have to design one 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.159
 you have to stick to a certain time 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.350
 20 waves can hold up to 60 waves 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.289
 also visually very different 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.359
 cards on some cards you and have 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.299
 That's a difference to many tower 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.520
 Defense titles influence the way 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.649
 the enemy thin lines indicate you 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.619
 which possibilities of the opponents to 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.270
 can run on open space maps can 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.700
 now storm your defense 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.760
 ideally so place that 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.890
 Walks of 5 on a way together 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.470
 melt and so the opponents by one 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.790
 Narrow alley need some of yours 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.430
 flanked 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.090
 so you can optimally under the opponents 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.090
 take a shot 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.460
 as usual with tower defense titles 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.680
 you receive money for defeated enemies 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.230
 this money could be in new towers or 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.830
 the upgrade of your previous towers 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.890
 stick 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.010
 each tone can be divided into three stages 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.810
 gear up 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.510
 At the beginning of the game you are only 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.070
 simple cannons towers available yet 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.770
 after a short time you have access 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.810
 on sticky towers which is a sticky one 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.180
 mass fire on opponents and this 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.940
 slow down or you have access to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.950
 flamethrowers rockets towers laser towers 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.830
 and many more towers in the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.620
 gameplay always come on 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.240
 because you only have a limited number 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.460
 so-called tower slots are available 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.950
 you will be facing each mission 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.840
 you have to decide which towers you need 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.150
 wanted to take along at the beginning of the game 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.640
 is not that crucial yet 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.290
 the further you progress the more important 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.120
 will that tournament with the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.740
 mission takes 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.750
 Overall, the game offers over 20 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.700
 different towers what a tower 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.170
 defense play a nice game 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.170
 stately number is 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.660
 la 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.730
 Fieldrunners 2 offers a pretty 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.830
 made graphic in the comic style therefore 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.410
 comes the opposing units as well 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.780
 your towers are well designed and also the ones 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.820
 cards make a great visual appearance 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.780
 impression and also the sound can 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.550
 to convince 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.920
 it does work on the small screen though 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.170
 sometimes a little small but you can 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.840
 gesture into the screen with two fingers 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:28.020
 happen to zoom in and out and 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.710
 The title is very good overall 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.870
 control 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.150
 pity is that you between the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.440
 missions to ordinary 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.960
 has waived interim sequences because 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.710
 except a few text messages 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.320
 do not expect anything here 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.240
 Unfortunately, here you have a bit of atmosphere 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.310
 Giving away problems has the game 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.710
 occasionally even during the mission 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.440
 because these sometimes work something in the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.140
 length drawn 30 to 60 minutes per 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.960
 You should already plan for a mission 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.450
 this is depending on the tower defense game of 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.730
 not uncommon but something 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.920
 more dynamism and drama during the 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.770
 Mission would be quite good for the game 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.660
 especially since you are often just waiting for it 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.600
 that your money accumulates 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.470
 or finally the last waves of enemies 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.470
 are over 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.380
 my conclusion fieldrunners 2 does not offer 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.900
 really new ideas for that 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.270
 tower defense genre but that does too 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.150
 nothing at all because the game is despite 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.240
 weaken one of the best tower defense 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.290
 games for ios because you have the mission 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.450
 can tighten something 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.970
 and yes, there is no multiplayer 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.550
 and so far no ipad version 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.240
 you can expect a game here 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.440
 a great graphic of a great 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.700
 user interface and with one 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.400
 easy control 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.760
 In addition, the scope of play is very large 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.980
 There are many units and a lot 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.170
 varied missions fell the 2 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.870
 should in my opinion in no 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.580
 tower defense collection missing and 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.210
 That's why I forgive five out of five 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.090
 possible stars fieldrunners 2 is for 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.050
 two euro 39 for ipod touch and iphone 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.720
 available 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.240
 I am always looking forward to your opinion 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:31.110
 and that's why I say goodbye to you 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.110
 for the next test before fabian
