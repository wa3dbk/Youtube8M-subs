00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
usually do it by like technique and

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.849 
usually do it by like technique and
color<00:04:15.220> intensity<00:04:15.819> okay<00:04:16.470> now<00:04:17.470> that<00:04:17.650> was<00:04:17.739> it

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
color intensity okay now that was it

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:28.490 
color intensity okay now that was it
right<00:04:17.979> there<00:04:18.039> okay<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:24.570> I'm<00:04:25.570> kind<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.810> nervous
