00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hey guys so in this video I will be

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.820 
hey guys so in this video I will be
playing<00:00:03.060> grand<00:00:03.389> theft<00:00:03.480> auto<00:00:03.780> san<00:00:04.140> andres<00:00:04.470> on

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
playing grand theft auto san andres on

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.889 
playing grand theft auto san andres on
pretty<00:00:05.670> much<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.029> lowest<00:00:06.359> settings<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:06.870> my

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
pretty much the lowest settings on my

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.830 
pretty much the lowest settings on my
nexus<00:00:07.470> 4<00:00:07.890> so<00:00:08.429> first<00:00:08.820> we<00:00:09.030> had<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.240> go<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
nexus 4 so first we had to go to the

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.709 
nexus 4 so first we had to go to the
game<00:00:10.230> options<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.280> set<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.179> frame<00:00:12.450> limiter

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
game options and set the frame limiter

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.640 
game options and set the frame limiter
to<00:00:13.230> off<00:00:13.469> which<00:00:14.099> i<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.639> already<00:00:15.020> done<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.379> next

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
to off which i have already done so next

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.310 
to off which i have already done so next
we<00:00:16.859> go<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.279> display<00:00:17.820> setup<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.480> as<00:00:19.140> you

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
we go to the display setup and as you

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.810 
we go to the display setup and as you
can<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.470> i<00:00:19.590> could<00:00:19.859> pretty<00:00:20.070> much<00:00:20.160> turn<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
can see i could pretty much turn the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359 
can see i could pretty much turn the
graphics<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.320> way<00:00:22.439> down<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.100> lowest

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
graphics all the way down to the lowest

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.420 
graphics all the way down to the lowest
possible<00:00:24.560> settings<00:00:25.560> except<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
possible settings except for the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.189 
possible settings except for the
resolution<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.119> draw<00:00:27.300> distance<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.019> i

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
resolution and draw distance which i

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.669 
resolution and draw distance which i
left<00:00:28.529> at<00:00:28.859> about<00:00:29.189> ten<00:00:29.970> percent<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.990> yeah<00:00:31.439> let's

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
left at about ten percent so yeah let's

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.160 
left at about ten percent so yeah let's
go<00:00:32.099> back<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> game<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.059> run<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> little<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
go back to the game and run a little to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
go back to the game and run a little to
see<00:00:34.410> how<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> performance<00:00:35.010> looks<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:38.600> let's

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
see how the performance looks like let's

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.160 
see how the performance looks like let's
run<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.110> circles<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.989> obviously<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
run in circles so obviously the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.330 
run in circles so obviously the
performance<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.950> pretty<00:00:44.610> smooth<00:00:45.500> hope<00:00:46.500> ever<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
performance is pretty smooth hope ever I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.750 
performance is pretty smooth hope ever I
find<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> strange<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> frames<00:00:50.610> per

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
find it strange that the frames per

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.950 
find it strange that the frames per
second<00:00:51.120> never<00:00:51.329> goes<00:00:52.160> above<00:00:53.160> 30<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.780> like

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
second never goes above 30 it's like

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.099 
second never goes above 30 it's like
it's<00:00:55.170> capped<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.649> 30<00:00:56.129> frames<00:00:56.370> per<00:00:56.610> second

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
it's capped at 30 frames per second

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.580 
it's capped at 30 frames per second
which<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.260> find<00:00:58.440> hard<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.920> believe<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.489> I

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
which I find hard to believe because I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
which I find hard to believe because I
already<00:01:01.590> set<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.250> frame<00:01:02.489> limiter<00:01:02.699> off<00:01:03.090> I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
already set the frame limiter off I

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.320 
already set the frame limiter off I
wonderful<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.820> would<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:07.430> with<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.760> setting

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
wonderful it would be with that setting

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.960 
wonderful it would be with that setting
enabled<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.710> yeah<00:01:10.860> let's<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> car<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
enabled so yeah let's go get a car and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.620 
enabled so yeah let's go get a car and
drive<00:01:12.540> around<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.549> if<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.119> performance

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
drive around to see if the performance

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:31.330 
drive around to see if the performance
changes<00:01:23.330> hello<00:01:24.330> buttons<00:01:28.189> so<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
changes hello buttons so it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.240 
changes hello buttons so it
the<00:01:32.000> second<00:01:32.359> it<00:01:32.570> was<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:32.960> 20<00:01:33.950> frames<00:01:34.159> per<00:01:34.460> second

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
the second it was a 20 frames per second

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.999 
the second it was a 20 frames per second
but<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.340> average<00:01:37.549> I<00:01:37.909> would<00:01:38.060> say<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.649> 30<00:01:39.649> frames

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
but the average I would say is 30 frames

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.730 
but the average I would say is 30 frames
per<00:01:40.130> second<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:44.229> mean<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:45.380> pretty<00:01:45.530> constant

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
per second I mean it's pretty constant

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.039 
per second I mean it's pretty constant
but<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.100> graphics<00:01:49.310> obviously<00:01:50.090> are<00:01:50.299> really

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
but the graphics obviously are really

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.550 
but the graphics obviously are really
bad<00:01:52.030> obviously<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.509> have<00:01:53.719> set<00:01:54.020> them<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.350> the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
bad obviously we have set them to the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.849 
bad obviously we have set them to the
lowest<00:01:54.740> possible<00:01:55.119> settings<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:58.780> mean<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.899> would

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
lowest possible settings I mean I would

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.100 
lowest possible settings I mean I would
not<00:02:01.039> want<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.549> play<00:02:01.700> such<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.689> good<00:02:02.990> game<00:02:04.750> use<00:02:05.750> on

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
not want to play such a good game use on

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.449 
not want to play such a good game use on
this<00:02:06.970> goal<00:02:07.970> settings<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:10.220> they<00:02:10.340> obviously

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
this goal settings but they obviously

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.210 
this goal settings but they obviously
you<00:02:10.940> see<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:11.720> points<00:02:12.099> about<00:02:13.099> the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
you see you get points about the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.699 
you see you get points about the
performance<00:02:13.549> on<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.030> Nexus<00:02:14.540> 4<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.079> the

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
performance on the Nexus 4 and the

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.640 
performance on the Nexus 4 and the
lowest<00:02:15.860> settings<00:02:16.400> it's<00:02:16.700> very<00:02:17.180> playable<00:02:17.660> for

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
lowest settings it's very playable for

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.970 
lowest settings it's very playable for
the<00:02:18.950> graphics<00:02:19.370> are<00:02:19.519> awful
