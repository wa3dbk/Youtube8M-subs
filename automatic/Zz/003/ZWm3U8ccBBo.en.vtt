00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.840
 Hi, I'm Pamela , I want cupcakes in 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.580
 collaboration with lunar maria and josh 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.530
 dotcom in the recipe video of this 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.510
 I'm going to show you how to make a week 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.360
 pavlova with pistachio and fruit canal 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.100
 of the forest the pavlova is a dessert with 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.110
 a crunchy meringue base on the outside 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.699
 and tender on the inside that next to 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.880
 pistachio and the fruits make a 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.369
 delicious combination 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.220
 for the meringue and we need sugar 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.220
 cornstarch egg whites and white vinegar 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.690
 the first step is to put the whites in the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.670
 blender and with the balloon we beat 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.309
 average speed for 5 minutes or 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.989
 until they begin to fade this 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.000
 will help the egg whites stabilize 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.589
 since this way we will get them to form 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.300
 tiny bubbles in our 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.089
 merengue what will make it more 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.159
 resistant if we beat the speed 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.780
 maximum will take less time but 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.769
 we will have a fragile meringue and we will 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.769
 will go down more easily 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.450
 when the egg whites have vanished 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.980
 little we add half the sugar and 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.659
 we raise the speed of the blender and 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.700
 we mix at full power 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.399
 we leave it beating while we mix 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.020
 the cornstarch with the rest of the sugar this 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.670
 step is very important because if 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.259
 we add the cornstarch directly into the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.619
 blender can create lumps in the 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.619
 Meringue 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.550
 after a couple of minutes the meringue 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.530
 already form soft peaks 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.660
 so it's time to add the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.170
 rest of the sugar with the cornstarch and 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.170
 white vinegar 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.610
 we'll let it beat for two more minutes 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.360
 so that the sugar is integrated 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.360
 completely 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.580
 after this time we will have a meringue 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.590
 bright and consistent 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.720
 with the help of a 20 cm mold 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.909
 diameter on baking paper we draw 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.219
 a circle 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.249
 we turn the paper over and start to 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.079
 Put all the meringue is essential 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.270
 the merengue is securely mounted as 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.130
 now with the spatula we will give shape and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.310
 If you are not firm enough, do not 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.959
 we can get the shape we seek 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.899
 little by little we are modeling the meringue 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.789
 to adjust it to the market circle in the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.170
 center we will leave a gap to put the 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.120
 filling our pavlova 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.190
 to give a nice design to merengue 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.670
 we are gently caressing the outside 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.670
 with a spatula 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.830
 Once ready we take it to the oven 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.830
 preheated to 100 degrees 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.390
 when the baking time is over 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.069
 we turn off the oven and leave the meringue 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.080
 inside until it gets completely cold 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.600
 when it's totally cold and 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.910
 we can get the meringue out of the oven 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.890
 It is completely dry do not worry 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.040
 through the cracks this tells us that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.290
 grown in the oven and dried 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.650
 carefully we take it off the paper of 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.720
 oven 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.829
 how can we see the basis of our 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.890
 merengue also has an aspect 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.420
 perfect white we move it to the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.940
 dish or final stand while 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.300
 we make a profit 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.250
 for the desire of pistachio we need 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.310
 white chocolate pistachio pure pasta 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.290
 cream and green coloring 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.670
 we put the chocolate in a bowl and 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.440
 we take the cream to the microwave 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.270
 when the cream starts to boil 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.620
 We take out the microwave and add the 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.810
 chocolate 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.670
 we let it rest a minute so that the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.370
 chocolate will soften with the heat and 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.379
 then stir with some rods 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.519
 you will see that we will quickly obtain 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.519
 a homogeneous cream 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.849
 now uses of the pure paste of 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.849
 pistachio brand with cher 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.650
 we mix until everything is well 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.650
 integrated 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.530
 so that you won it in one more color 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.930
 Intense to use the dye in paste 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.520
 lemon-lime from the brand sugar plate with 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.850
 a toothpick we put a little bit of the 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.850
 mixture 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.300
 and stir again until you get a 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.300
 uniform color 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.230
 Once ready we cover the skin with 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.730
 film paper this means that the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.469
 surface of the ear che should be 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.630
 always in contact with the film paper 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.970
 this will prevent the part from drying out 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.190
 top of our cream 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.900
 once covered let rest the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.420
 gain in the fridge for 5 hours 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.490
 As minimum 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.500
 after this time the profit will be 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.020
 cold so it will be perfect for 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.120
 mount it easily 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.300
 we beat it at high speed for 2 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.300
 minutes 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.840
 when it is ready we will get a cream 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.790
 firm and with an incredible flavor 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.500
 pistachio 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.720
 to put the filling on the pavlova 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.750
 I will use the 1m brand nozzle 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.980
 Wilton is the one of the open star 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.930
 fill a sleeve with the desire to 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.930
 pistachio and we can start decorating 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.159
 I will make some roses with the sleeve and layer 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.960
 of the little holes with little stars 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:06.789
 win but you can do the ways that 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.789
 more you like it or that you find it easier 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.250
 once we put all the desire of 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.710
 pistachio we will finish the decoration with 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.100
 the fruits in this case I got 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.500
 strawberries blueberries raspberries blackberries and 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.060
 currants are fruits that combine very 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.880
 well with the pistachio cream and the 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.040
 meringue sweetness this is the most 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.880
 simple so we put some strawberries for 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.290
 here 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.290
 some blueberries over there 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.710
 and we also scatter the currants by 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.710
 over 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.939
 we place the berries 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.939
 and also the heads 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.000
 we put over some of 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.300
 the fruits that have been hidden 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.010
 and we arrange them as we like 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.420
 when we finish decorating it we 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.850
 We take to keep it cold in the 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.410
 fridge until the time I serve it 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.090
 love pavlova because it's a dessert 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.700
 super light what makes it perfect 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.590
 for summer days it is also served 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.630
 cool and decorated with fruits 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.460
 it is irresistible you can also do 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.860
 other combinations of desire and fruit 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.440
 that as you like the technique is the 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.780
