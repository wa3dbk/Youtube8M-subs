00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.990 
work that's left on your skin I really
like<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.889> think<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.250> definitely<00:03:23.459> more<00:03:23.970> of

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
like it I think it is definitely more of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.569 
like it I think it is definitely more of
a<00:03:24.480> spring/summer<00:03:25.109> scent<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.190> would<00:03:26.370> say

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
a spring/summer scent and I would say

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.670 
a spring/summer scent and I would say
it's<00:03:26.760> more<00:03:26.819> of<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.120> daytime<00:03:27.480> scent<00:03:28.139> than<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.500> is

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
it's more of a daytime scent than it is

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.569 
it's more of a daytime scent than it is
a<00:03:28.889> nighttime<00:03:29.190> scent<00:03:30.919> it's<00:03:31.919> definitely<00:03:32.400> sweet

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
a nighttime scent it's definitely sweet

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.250 
a nighttime scent it's definitely sweet
but<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:32.910> wouldn't<00:03:33.209> necessarily<00:03:33.450> call<00:03:34.049> it's

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
but I wouldn't necessarily call it's

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.670 
but I wouldn't necessarily call it's
candy<00:03:34.919> sweet<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.519> does<00:03:35.940> have<00:03:36.239> those<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.870> guess

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
candy sweet it does have those I guess

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.220 
candy sweet it does have those I guess
woody<00:03:38.069> floral<00:03:38.760> undertones<00:03:39.419> that<00:03:39.629> I<00:03:39.930> guess

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
woody floral undertones that I guess

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.530 
woody floral undertones that I guess
calms<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.829> sweetness<00:03:41.310> down<00:03:41.579> if<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.180> makes

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
calms the sweetness down if that makes

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.390 
calms the sweetness down if that makes
sense<00:03:42.750> at<00:03:42.870> all<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.989> hope<00:03:43.230> I'm<00:03:43.410> making<00:03:43.440> sense<00:03:44.069> but

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
sense at all I hope I'm making sense but

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.729 
sense at all I hope I'm making sense but
I<00:03:44.989> think<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.079> could<00:03:46.199> almost<00:03:46.349> call<00:03:46.530> it

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
I think you could almost call it

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.860 
I think you could almost call it
slightly<00:03:47.010> more<00:03:47.190> grown-up<00:03:47.730> than<00:03:48.239> some<00:03:48.629> of<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
slightly more grown-up than some of the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.449 
slightly more grown-up than some of the
other<00:03:49.019> perfumes<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.560> they<00:03:49.680> like<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.919> DKNY

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
other perfumes that they like the DKNY

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.150 
other perfumes that they like the DKNY
be<00:03:50.609> Delicious<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.139> don't<00:03:52.799> think<00:03:53.040> it's

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
be Delicious and that I don't think it's

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.250 
be Delicious and that I don't think it's
necessarily<00:03:53.609> for<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> really<00:03:54.540> young<00:03:54.720> person<00:03:55.199> I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
necessarily for a really young person I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.009 
necessarily for a really young person I
think<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.769> more<00:03:56.129> targeted<00:03:56.879> at<00:03:57.389> people<00:03:57.419> sort

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
think it is more targeted at people sort

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.689 
think it is more targeted at people sort
of<00:03:58.049> in<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.349> early<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.709> late<00:03:58.859> 20s<00:03:59.400> but<00:03:59.579> then

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
of in the early to late 20s but then

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.949 
of in the early to late 20s but then
it's<00:03:59.819> definitely<00:03:59.970> something<00:04:00.389> that<00:04:00.480> could<00:04:00.629> be

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
it's definitely something that could be

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.129 
it's definitely something that could be
worn<00:04:01.199> by<00:04:01.730> someone<00:04:02.730> that's<00:04:03.030> older<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.750> think<00:04:03.810> it

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
worn by someone that's older I think it

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.780 
worn by someone that's older I think it
is<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> scent<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.799> lot<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.190> people<00:04:05.639> would

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
is a scent that a lot of people would

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.759 
is a scent that a lot of people would
like<00:04:06.000> also<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.629> really<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.079> this<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.590> have

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
like this better than the original Daisy

like this better than the original Daisy
that's<00:04:27.219> just<00:04:27.520> my<00:04:27.669> opinion

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
that's just my opinion

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.999 
that's just my opinion
I've<00:04:28.330> been<00:04:28.780> reading<00:04:29.020> reviews<00:04:29.289> online<00:04:29.650> and

I've been reading reviews online and

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.469 
I've been reading reviews online and
some<00:04:30.159> people<00:04:30.490> say<00:04:30.669> they<00:04:30.699> prefer<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.389> original

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
some people say they prefer the original

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.809 
some people say they prefer the original
Daisy<00:04:32.020> others<00:04:32.530> so<00:04:32.979> they<00:04:33.189> really<00:04:33.430> like<00:04:33.610> this

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
one I am definitely in the liking this

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.649 
one I am definitely in the liking this
one<00:04:36.069> camp<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.460> still<00:04:36.729> like<00:04:36.909> the<00:04:37.060> original<00:04:37.449> Daisy

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
one camp I still like the original Daisy

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.899 
one camp I still like the original Daisy
perfume<00:04:38.169> but<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.710> think<00:04:38.949> I<00:04:39.039> like<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.460> one<00:04:39.669> just

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
perfume but I think I like this one just

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.369 
perfume but I think I like this one just
that<00:04:40.030> little<00:04:40.240> bit<00:04:40.419> more<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:40.900> think<00:04:41.050> it's

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
that little bit more I think it's

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.260 
that little bit more I think it's
because<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.889> more<00:04:42.129> fruity<00:04:42.580> and<00:04:42.699> I<00:04:42.789> tend<00:04:43.180> to

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
because it is more fruity and I tend to

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.409 
because it is more fruity and I tend to
swim<00:04:43.930> towards<00:04:44.110> more<00:04:44.740> fruity<00:04:45.370> sense<00:04:45.819> so

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
swim towards more fruity sense so

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.689 
swim towards more fruity sense so
overall<00:04:46.719> I<00:04:46.870> do<00:04:47.050> recommend<00:04:47.620> this<00:04:47.949> perfume<00:04:48.340> for

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
overall I do recommend this perfume for

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.580 
overall I do recommend this perfume for
a<00:04:48.729> lot<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.060> people<00:04:49.389> it<00:04:49.569> is<00:04:49.599> I<00:04:49.810> say<00:04:50.169> this<00:04:50.319> a<00:04:50.379> lot

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
a lot of people it is I say this a lot

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.950 
a lot of people it is I say this a lot
about<00:04:50.800> perfumes<00:04:51.370> but<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:52.210> is<00:04:52.389> one<00:04:52.569> of<00:04:52.659> those<00:04:52.750> I

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
about perfumes but it is one of those I

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.420 
about perfumes but it is one of those I
think<00:04:53.289> you<00:04:53.560> would<00:04:53.680> call<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:53.979> a<00:04:54.069> universal
