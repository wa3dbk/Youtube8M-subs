intended to aid the Dreamcast and gaming
community<00:00:12.089> so<00:00:12.540> here<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.559> Nyko<00:00:14.039> dream

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
community so here is the Nyko dream

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
community so here is the Nyko dream
master<00:00:15.509> third<00:00:15.870> party<00:00:16.260> Dreamcast<00:00:16.770> controller

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
master third party Dreamcast controller

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.370 
master third party Dreamcast controller
you<00:00:17.970> know<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.300> dream<00:00:18.510> master<00:00:18.960> because

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
you know it's the dream master because

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.180 
you know it's the dream master because
it<00:00:19.530> says<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.610> right<00:00:20.640> there<00:00:21.770> this<00:00:22.770> is<00:00:22.830> similar

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:23.190 
it says so right there this is similar

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.250 
it says so right there this is similar
to<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.880> other<00:00:24.120> third-party<00:00:24.570> controller<00:00:25.050> by

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
to the other third-party controller by

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.220 
to the other third-party controller by
Mad<00:00:25.470> Catz<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.100> reviewed<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:27.480> has<00:00:27.870> two

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
Mad Catz that I reviewed it has two

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.760 
Mad Catz that I reviewed it has two
extra<00:00:28.530> buttons<00:00:28.860> also<00:00:29.370> Z<00:00:29.940> and<00:00:30.180> C<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:31.230> allow

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
extra buttons also Z and C that allow

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.950 
extra buttons also Z and C that allow
you<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.070> basically<00:00:32.610> program<00:00:33.480> button

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
you to basically program button

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.529 
you to basically program button
combinations<00:00:34.649> into<00:00:34.859> them<00:00:35.010> such<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> B

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
combinations into them such as a and B

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.479 
combinations into them such as a and B
at<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.749> same<00:00:36.929> time<00:00:37.260> might<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.920> able<00:00:38.339> to<00:00:38.399> be

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
at the same time might be able to be

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.579 
at the same time might be able to be
programmed<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> C<00:00:39.269> so<00:00:40.019> that<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.409> game

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
programmed in the C so that if in a game

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.319 
programmed in the C so that if in a game
this<00:00:41.219> were<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.640> something<00:00:41.789> you<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.269> now

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
this were to do something you can now

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
this were to do something you can now
just<00:00:42.539> do<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.960> button<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.190> do

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
just do it with one button or you can do

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.759 
just do it with one button or you can do
more<00:00:44.460> complex<00:00:44.850> maneuvers<00:00:45.469> the<00:00:46.469> controller

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
more complex maneuvers the controller

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.610 
more complex maneuvers the controller
itself<00:00:46.949> is<00:00:47.510> decent<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.749> has<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.819> little<00:00:51.620> wire

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
itself is decent it has the little wire

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
itself is decent it has the little wire
catcher<00:00:53.159> thing<00:00:53.640> I'm<00:00:53.940> suddenly<00:00:54.269> spacing<00:00:54.749> on

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
catcher thing I'm suddenly spacing on

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.049 
catcher thing I'm suddenly spacing on
the<00:00:54.870> word<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.289> whatever<00:00:55.499> you<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:55.979> it<00:00:56.100> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the word but whatever you get it it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
the word but whatever you get it it
didn't<00:00:57.359> put<00:00:57.479> it<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.809> though<00:00:57.960> unlike<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
didn't put it up here though unlike the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.219 
didn't put it up here though unlike the
traditional<00:00:59.339> Dreamcast<00:01:00.059> controller<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
traditional Dreamcast controller the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.620 
traditional Dreamcast controller the
d-pad<00:01:01.589> was<00:01:02.370> kind<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> stiff<00:01:02.909> and<00:01:03.179> not<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.659> good

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
d-pad was kind of stiff and not so good

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.840 
d-pad was kind of stiff and not so good
this<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.200> joysticks<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.490> stiff<00:01:08.700> as

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this the the joysticks a little stiff as

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.240 
this the the joysticks a little stiff as
well<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.719> start<00:01:09.990> button<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> kind<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.680> unique

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
well the start button is kind of unique

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.370 
well the start button is kind of unique
and<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.850> sharp<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.780> mean<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.140> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and it's a little sharp I mean like I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.319 
and it's a little sharp I mean like I
get<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.070> feeling<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.729> misfired

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
get the feeling like if you misfired

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:16.850 
get the feeling like if you misfired
while<00:01:15.689> playing<00:01:15.899> you<00:01:16.200> could<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.469> kind<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
while playing you could actually kind of

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.850 
while playing you could actually kind of
hurt<00:01:17.039> your<00:01:17.219> finger<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:22.320> overall

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
hurt your finger on this the it overall

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 
hurt your finger on this the it overall
it<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.009> feels<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:23.610> cheap<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> feel

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it just feels very cheap like I feel

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
it just feels very cheap like I feel
like<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.860> could<00:01:26.039> break<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.430> very<00:01:26.729> easily<00:01:26.969> and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
like I could break this very easily and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
like I could break this very easily and
it's<00:01:28.079> obviously<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.250> well<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.850> least<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.060> far

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
it's obviously in well at least as far

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.639 
it's obviously in well at least as far
as<00:01:30.210> I'm<00:01:30.359> concerned<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:30.840> very

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
as I'm concerned it's not very

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.990 
as I'm concerned it's not very
good-looking<00:01:32.210> but<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.750> says<00:01:33.899> Nyko<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.969> yeah<00:01:35.969> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
good-looking but it says Nyko so yeah I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.660 
good-looking but it says Nyko so yeah I
guess<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.240> that's<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.020> very<00:01:37.109> good<00:01:37.289> either

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
guess that's that's not very good either

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.300 
guess that's that's not very good either
here<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.930> compared<00:01:40.469> to<00:01:40.740> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
here is it this is it compared to this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.050 
here is it this is it compared to this
horrible<00:01:42.119> monstrosity<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.289> a<00:01:43.350> controller

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
horrible monstrosity of a controller

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.419 
horrible monstrosity of a controller
between<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> two<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.439> but

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
between the two I would go with this but

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.830 
between the two I would go with this but
that's<00:01:47.789> not<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.329> saying<00:01:48.539> much<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
that's not really saying much of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.139 
that's not really saying much of
anything<00:01:48.929> because<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.409> would<00:01:49.530> always<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:50.310> with

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
anything because I would always go with

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.169 
anything because I would always go with
this<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.799> way<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.429> play<00:01:53.700> Dreamcast

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
this this is the way to play Dreamcast

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.249 
this this is the way to play Dreamcast
games<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.590> all<00:01:55.740> compared<00:01:56.100> together

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
games that's them all compared together

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.880 
games that's them all compared together
still<00:01:58.259> don't<00:01:58.560> ever<00:01:58.799> buy<00:01:59.039> that<00:01:59.310> oh<00:02:00.799> one<00:02:01.799> other

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
still don't ever buy that oh one other
