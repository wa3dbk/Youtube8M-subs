it stands for but I'm pretty sure it

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.680 
it stands for but I'm pretty sure it
stands<00:05:42.130> for<00:05:42.220> something<00:05:42.340> but<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:43.419> first<00:05:43.630> thing

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690

stands for something but the first thing
I'm<00:05:43.780> gonna<00:05:43.870> do<00:05:44.050> is<00:05:44.080> I'm<00:05:44.289> gonna<00:05:44.380> line<00:05:44.680> my<00:05:44.830> lips

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
because obviously using darker colors is

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.860 
because obviously using darker colors is
a<00:05:47.380> little<00:05:47.710> more<00:05:47.860> tricky<00:05:48.100> and<00:05:48.430> you<00:05:48.550> could

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
a little more tricky and you could

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.410 
a little more tricky and you could
messy<00:05:49.290> really<00:05:49.530> quick<00:05:49.920> so<00:05:50.550> yeah<00:05:50.970> I'm<00:05:51.060> gonna<00:05:51.210> go
