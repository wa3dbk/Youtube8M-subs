00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.340
 Y 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.099
 welcome to the homex martyr course and 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.410
 name is jaime who uses the name 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.710
 metro mex and in this lesson 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.289
 we will learn to create the crystal effect or 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.449
 also called glass not surely 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.820
 you have wanted to elaborate a project 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.949
 a job that has that kind of 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.530
 crystal and so they can understand a lot 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.930
 better here I have an example here we have 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.050
 an example of a chess game that 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.970
 I did several years ago 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.339
 for example here we are observing 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.469
 all the chess pieces with this 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.840
 crystal effect not and if you guys 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.870
 apply properly the lights are going to 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.760
 get much better this is an idea and 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.339
 for it to be able to achieve this effect 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.350
 let's do it with an example I do not think 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.269
 who can understand I'm going to create a 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.729
 flat always almost in most of the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.340
 examples a plan was drawn up so that 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.950
 the image can be observed much better 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.409
 so that it is on a base and is 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.800
 better not then to this plane I'm going to 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.450
 put the white color example I'll 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.750
 create a teapot 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.079
 get it was a clip art and I'm going 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.110
 to do the effect and quickly we 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.929
 let's go to the material editor I'll 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.079
 grab a slot and this slot I'm going to 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.729
 apply here in these values ​​in the 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:41.020
 speculate level for example I'm going to 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.579
 put the value of 72 I write 72 in the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.950
 shine inclusions 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:50.490
 I'll be able to see it 76 ready what I do 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.729
 next is I'm going to where it says 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.170
 maps and within max we will go to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.720
 refraction where the son here option 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.490
 maps and I'm looking for the refraction option 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.369
 within the fraction what I'm going to give you 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.250
 click is huge and within this we are going to 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.860
 choose what is the king option after this 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.140
 would be the formula to create the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.620
 glass effect or mirror notes king trace 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.720
 I'll click on ok ready then what 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.880
 I do then just going to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.840
 serve in taste wall and it would be 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.780
 applying would not be applying this 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.580
 this material to the teapot the signs and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.340
 I tell him to show me in the view by 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.430
 then at the time of rendering not 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.160
 we would be clearly observing this 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.709
 effect not that it would be the crystal or the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.200
 of glass will not then stand out 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.080
 much better depending on the lights that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.739
 we can accommodate him in 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.379
 different angles and that would agree 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.239
 in our opinion not also in the 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.819
 shadows we know that we can apply the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.420
 lights and activate the room are the shadows 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:01.240
 no then this is the the most 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.760
 simple to be able to create that this guy 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.220
 in effect then I hope to have them 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.200
 helped and if not accompanying me in this 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.570
 lesson is that there are many more things 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.570
 learn thank you for acquiring this course
