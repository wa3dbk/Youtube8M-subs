00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
right now so yeah but still I mean

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.419 
right now so yeah but still I mean
I<00:02:05.869> mean<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.140> anything<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.890> internet<00:02:08.280> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I mean if anything the internet is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.900 
I mean if anything the internet is
usually<00:02:08.879> very<00:02:09.410> strong<00:02:10.410> against<00:02:11.039> things<00:02:11.519> that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
usually very strong against things that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.440 
usually very strong against things that
suck<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:13.400> figure<00:02:14.400> it'd<00:02:14.489> be<00:02:14.640> something<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.180> bit

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
suck I figure it'd be something is a bit

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.740 
suck I figure it'd be something is a bit
more<00:02:16.580> standard<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.700> quality<00:02:17.879> i<00:02:18.269> guess<00:02:18.569> i<00:02:18.690> don't

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
more standard of quality i guess i don't

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.900 
more standard of quality i guess i don't
know<00:02:18.959> i<00:02:19.200> still<00:02:19.410> want<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.739> let<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.099> give<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.370> its

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
know i still want to let it give it its

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.300 
know i still want to let it give it its
chance<00:02:22.010> so<00:02:23.010> even<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.299> not<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:25.010> pretty<00:02:26.010> by

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
chance so even if it's not as pretty by
