all like the way came in package you can

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.160 
all like the way came in package you can
space<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.310> out<00:02:34.519> totally<00:02:35.180> up<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.780> like

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
space it out totally up to you I like

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.460 
space it out totally up to you I like
mine<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.379> little<00:02:36.530> space<00:02:36.950> down<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:38.379> once<00:02:39.379> you

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
mine a little space down so once you

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.660 
mine a little space down so once you
kind<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.709> get<00:02:39.829> an<00:02:39.980> idea<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:40.280> where<00:02:40.519> you're

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
kind of get an idea of where you're

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.670 
kind of get an idea of where you're
going<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.849> go<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.329> always<00:02:42.200> start<00:02:42.470> with<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
going to go I always start with the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.940 
going to go I always start with the
centerpiece<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.599> take<00:02:44.599> that<00:02:44.810> remove<00:02:45.500> just<00:02:45.769> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
centerpiece I take that remove just the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.699 
centerpiece I take that remove just the
back<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:49.879> start<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.659> always<00:02:51.139> also<00:02:51.560> go

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
back and I start there I always also go

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.619 
back and I start there I always also go
about<00:02:51.920> an<00:02:52.099> inch<00:02:52.280> up<00:02:52.489> from<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.849> fin<00:02:53.150> or<00:02:53.389> from

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
about an inch up from that fin or from

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.839 
about an inch up from that fin or from
the<00:02:53.780> beasts<00:02:54.319> plug<00:02:54.620> just<00:02:55.189> so<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.459> have<00:02:55.639> some

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
the beasts plug just so you have some

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:07.150 
the beasts plug just so you have some
wiggle<00:02:56.030> room<00:02:56.150> with<00:02:56.420> that

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.190 

the<00:03:07.670> whole<00:03:07.850> time<00:03:08.060> I'm<00:03:08.270> using<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.690> stringer<00:03:09.080> as

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
the whole time I'm using the stringer as

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.680 
the whole time I'm using the stringer as
my<00:03:09.380> centerline<00:03:09.740> and<00:03:10.100> I'm<00:03:10.910> constantly<00:03:11.420> going

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
my centerline and I'm constantly going

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.890 
my centerline and I'm constantly going
back<00:03:11.960> to<00:03:12.140> check<00:03:12.380> because<00:03:12.860> once<00:03:13.220> it's<00:03:13.400> down

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
back to check because once it's down

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.740 
back to check because once it's down
pretty<00:03:14.900> much<00:03:15.140> down<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:17.120> as<00:03:17.270> long<00:03:17.420> as<00:03:17.600> that

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
pretty much down so as long as that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.450 
pretty much down so as long as that
center<00:03:18.080> piece<00:03:18.290> goes<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.710> straight<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.130> you

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
center piece goes on straight and you

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.130 
center piece goes on straight and you
can<00:03:19.610> work<00:03:19.760> off<00:03:19.940> of<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.240> you're<00:03:20.840> going<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.020> be

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
can work off of that you're going to be

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.960 
can work off of that you're going to be
good

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.369 

and<00:03:28.970> then<00:03:29.150> be<00:03:29.330> sure<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.510> press<00:03:29.810> down<00:03:29.870> really

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
and then be sure to press down really

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.770 
and then be sure to press down really
hard<00:03:30.620> after<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.250> put<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.640> on<00:03:31.730> making<00:03:32.599> sure

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
hard after you put it on making sure

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.660 
hard after you put it on making sure
that<00:03:33.049> everywhere<00:03:33.379> as<00:03:33.769> glue<00:03:34.010> on<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.310> bottom<00:03:34.459> of

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
that everywhere as glue on the bottom of

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:43.390 
that everywhere as glue on the bottom of
the<00:03:34.760> pad<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.150> connected<00:03:41.620> okay<00:03:42.620> now<00:03:42.890> i<00:03:42.920> just<00:03:43.280> use

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the pad is connected okay now i just use

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.550 
the pad is connected okay now i just use
that<00:03:43.580> exact<00:03:43.879> same<00:03:44.030> technique<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.750> finish

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
that exact same technique and finish

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.309 
that exact same technique and finish
applying<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.129> traction<00:03:46.549> pad<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.110> that's<00:03:48.110> it

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
applying the traction pad and that's it

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.110 
applying the traction pad and that's it
that's<00:03:48.680> how<00:03:48.830> you<00:03:48.920> put<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> traction<00:03:49.640> pad<00:03:49.910> on<00:03:50.090> a

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
that's how you put a traction pad on a

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.900 
that's how you put a traction pad on a
board<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.450> already<00:03:50.780> has
