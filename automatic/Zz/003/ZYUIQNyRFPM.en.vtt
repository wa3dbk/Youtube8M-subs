bug and someone else tries to join that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.010 
bug and someone else tries to join that
server<00:01:58.439> they<00:01:58.770> will<00:01:59.040> get<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.549> same<00:01:59.759> bug<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
server they will get the same bug the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.520 
server they will get the same bug the
only<00:02:01.710> fix<00:02:02.159> there<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.420> server<00:02:03.659> admins<00:02:04.259> is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
only fix there is for server admins is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.960 
only fix there is for server admins is
to<00:02:05.310> restart<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> whole<00:02:06.390> server<00:02:07.429> that<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.459> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
to restart the whole server that is of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.830 
to restart the whole server that is of
course<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.450> big<00:02:09.629> problem<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:11.640> hope<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.180> kind
