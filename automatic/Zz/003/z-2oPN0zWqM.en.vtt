00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 in this video we will look at the procedure 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.810
 restore your system to her this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 function can solve almost any 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.430
 software problem to implement 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.560
 this operation will need a tool 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 recovery that you can create 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.840
 own or purchase at 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.610
 the service center we talk about in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.710
 what are the common cases worth 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.110
 use this function and what it is 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.000
 useful to figure out how to save your 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.770
 data if the state of the computer is not 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.719
 allows you to do this in the ordinary 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.620
 mode for example if the computer is infected 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.780
 virus, finally, we will analyze it in stages 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.780
 recovery process from a to z 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.410
 system restore this feature 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.450
 created by sony to 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.700
 at any moment you could again 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.460
 reinstall windows drive and all 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.590
 settings return to state 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.420
 similar factory recovery helps 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.120
 software failures which 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.670
 expressed in long boot slow 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.710
 or unstable computer also 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.750
 recovery will come to the rescue case 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.120
 driver problems when suddenly 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.490
 start to work poorly some of 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.930
 basic computer functions in most 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.690
 cases such problems arise 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.940
 due to viruses customization 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.930
 system or installation of additional 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.479
 programs or drivers nothing 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.340
 irreparable in this we will deal with 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.500
 How to return the system to the factory 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.600
 state should be understood that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.700
 reinstalling the system will destroy everything 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.979
 accumulated data so before her 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.080
 We recommend that you follow the steps 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.080
 described in the next section 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.350
 This instruction is relevant for windows 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.930
 8 but by analogy you can do it. 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.179
 and on the seventh version for starters us 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.440
 need external media and on it 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.390
 we will save the data 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.920
 it could be beaten or flash drive 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.080
 external hard drive 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.180
 remember that the carrier must possess 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.270
 ample free space 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.950
 to fit the data you need 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.910
 by preparing the carrier to connect it to 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.640
 usb port 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.450
 be sure to connect to the mains 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.610
 move to saving data on 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.950
 computer off press key 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.280
 assist your launch special 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.840
 here you need to select the service menu 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.519
 system repair and maintenance 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.350
 if your computer is not worth 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.630
 factory operating system 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.700
 or you manually deleted the partition 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.430
 hard drive recovery then you 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.440
 Need an item to boot from the carrier it 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.540
 available if you plugged in a tool 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.200
 restore the creation of which is described 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.610
 in separate sony support materials 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.600
 the next step is the selection of the keyboard layout 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.650
 we choose Russian on the next screen 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.690
 we need the diagnostic button in the fifth step 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.130
 will become a recovery click and 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.500
 service then confirm target 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.690
 the operating system that is the one that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.880
 will be replaced with the factory set in 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.709
 windows in this example is the eighth 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.709
 Microsoft OS version 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.420
 however, if you have another system 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.060
 the name accordingly will also be 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.019
 be different yours starts the rescue mode 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.180
 you need to wait a little step 6 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.950
 in the menu that opens, press the button 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.100
 service step 7 choose the save button 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.350
 data and so we reached the key 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.660
 point at this stage you must select 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.090
 what data do you want to save by choosing 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.190
 easy salvation you will carry everything 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.720
 computer content to external 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.670
 carrier you just need to follow 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.980
 instructions pop-up on the screen 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.510
 choosing a custom rescue you 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.850
 be able to select specific information 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.670
 which needs to be pulled let's 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.780
 analyze manual mode first 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.810
 you need to select the drive on which 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.950
 target folders are located further there are two 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.720
 options can be selected automatically 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.389
 selection of data saved mode in which 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.120
 computer will transfer files from standard 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.700
 user folders my documents are my 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.470
 drawings and so on including the desktop 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.820
 here you just need to follow 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.669
 instructions if you want 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.160
 choose the data you need yourself 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.680
 need a second item click on 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.300
 the corresponding button and wait while woyo 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.220
 collect system data 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.710
 it may take a long time 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.780
 after data collection 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.880
 the next window will open where you 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.210
 you can tick the necessary folders 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.710
 folders my documents my drawings others 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.530
 standard user files 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.570
 including the desktop already marked this 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.030
 the users folder at the bottom of the program window 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.970
 indicates the number of selected files and 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.850
 their volume we mark the necessary folders and we press 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:07.490
 Next, select the media on which you want 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:09.830
 record and click further on 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.200
 folder will be created in the external disk 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.479
 woyo will put all the valuable data 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.360
 you can change its name in this 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.490
 window then it's time to start saving after 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.500
 pressing the corresponding program buttons 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.419
 will screen progress and 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.639
 approximately and the remaining time is not 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.950
 unplug your computer 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.229
 do not disconnect the carrier from the connector 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.360
 when it finishes you can choose 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.150
 another drive for salvation and repeat 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.889
 previous steps either complete salvation 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.990
 data and go to the actual 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.090
 system recovery you can also 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.220
 exit the service menu and turn off 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.220
 computer postponing recovery for later 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.490
 when the necessary data is saved from 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.610
 computer, you can start recovery 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.680
 systems 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.080
 if you approached this section of the video 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.360
 having done the steps from the previous part and you 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.220
 you are in the service menu enough for you 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.290
 press the start wizard button 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.940
 recover if you are interrupted and 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.000
 service utilities came out too 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.010
 follow steps 1 through 6 of the previous one 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.010
 section of this video do not forget 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.570
 connect the computer to the mains 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.610
 control system will offer to save 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.919
 data but if you followed the instructions 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.700
 from the previous section, this step can be 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.400
 skip 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.310
 now your utility will cure her 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.530
 recovery and of course the time of which 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.870
 it may take up to a few hours of rest 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.000
 ready in the process a few computer 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.350
 once restarted then you can 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.419
 copy to your computer 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.210
 previously saved data but before that 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.210
 we recommend checking them with antivirus
