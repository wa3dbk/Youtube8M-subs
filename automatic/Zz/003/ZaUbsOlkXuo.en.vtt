golems<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.600> compound<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.530> problem

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
golems in I just compound the problem

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.270 
golems in I just compound the problem
letting<00:01:14.520> every<00:01:15.150> single<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> seven<00:01:16.770> golems

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
poly and right on top of each other and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.919 
poly and right on top of each other and
they<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> move<00:01:20.429> in<00:01:20.700> deeply<00:01:21.630> into

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
they are going to move in deeply into

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.630 
they are going to move in deeply into
this<00:01:22.049> space<00:01:22.289> after<00:01:22.679> those<00:01:22.979> defensive

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
this space after those defensive

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
this space after those defensive
structures<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.210> what<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.719> will<00:01:24.929> do<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
structures and what that will do is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.490 
structures and what that will do is
leave<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.250> heroes<00:01:26.820> behind<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.200> heroes

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
leave the heroes behind as the heroes

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.410 
leave the heroes behind as the heroes
work<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.890> those<00:01:29.039> high<00:01:29.340> hit<00:01:29.640> points<00:01:29.670> structures

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
being vaporized and now to make matters

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.010 
being vaporized and now to make matters
worse<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.819> heroes<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.329> split<00:01:45.719> up<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
worse the heroes have split up and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.440 
worse the heroes have split up and
watched<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.560> Queen<00:01:46.859> as<00:01:47.130> she<00:01:47.700> moves<00:01:47.969> off<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
watched the Queen as she moves off to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.999 
watched the Queen as she moves off to
the<00:01:48.569> left<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.990> jump<00:01:49.289> spell<00:01:49.499> right<00:01:49.740> behind

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the left that jump spell right behind

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.059 
the left that jump spell right behind
her<00:01:50.219> is<00:01:50.399> still<00:01:51.179> active<00:01:51.780> yet<00:01:51.960> she<00:01:52.200> goes<00:01:52.439> after

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
her is still active yet she goes after

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.399 
her is still active yet she goes after
the<00:01:53.219> wall<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.850> guess<00:01:54.359> she's<00:01:54.569> not<00:01:54.780> smart<00:01:55.229> enough

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the wall I guess she's not smart enough

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.169 
the wall I guess she's not smart enough
to<00:01:55.619> realize<00:01:55.799> she<00:01:56.130> could<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.399> taken<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.880> jump

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
to realize she could have taken to jump

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.999 
to realize she could have taken to jump
