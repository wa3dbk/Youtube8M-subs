00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
using just a normal butter that I'll

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
different if you were using organic or

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.750 
different if you were using organic or
biodynamic<00:00:29.470> butter<00:00:30.470> because<00:00:31.130> it<00:00:31.310> does<00:00:31.490> look<00:00:31.730> a

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
biodynamic butter because it does look a

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.160 
biodynamic butter because it does look a
little<00:00:31.939> bit<00:00:32.059> different<00:00:32.510> because<00:00:32.660> of<00:00:32.989> the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
little bit different because of the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.920 
little bit different because of the
butter<00:00:33.470> milk<00:00:33.680> content<00:00:34.400> of<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.670> butter<00:00:34.900> so<00:00:35.900> I

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
butter milk content of the butter so I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.100 
butter milk content of the butter so I
sit<00:00:36.739> back<00:00:36.920> relax<00:00:37.190> enjoy<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.330> I<00:00:38.420> encourage<00:00:38.900> you

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
than buying it in a can at the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.000 
than buying it in a can at the
supermarket

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
supermarket

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.990 
supermarket
so<00:00:49.250> enjoy

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400 

so<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.120> start<00:00:57.390> by<00:00:57.450> chopping<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.900> butter<00:00:58.170> up

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so we start by chopping the butter up

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.160 
so we start by chopping the butter up
which<00:00:58.940> speeds<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.150> process<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> melting

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
which speeds up the process of melting

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.210 
which speeds up the process of melting
it<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.530> moderate<00:01:01.980> heat<00:01:06.860> when<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.890> butters

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it on a moderate heat when the butters

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.060 
it on a moderate heat when the butters
melted<00:01:08.570> it's<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.690> good<00:01:09.840> idea<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.230> give<00:01:10.800> it<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> bit

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
melted it's a good idea to give it a bit

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
melted it's a good idea to give it a bit
of<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.280> stir<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:12.000> keep<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> heat<00:01:13.110> even

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
of a stir to keep the heat even

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.960 
of a stir to keep the heat even
throughout<00:01:13.860> otherwise<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.700> get<00:01:14.820> little

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
throughout otherwise you can get little

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.500 
throughout otherwise you can get little
explosions<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.260> butter<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.940> she's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> nice

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
explosions of butter and she's a nice

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.219 
explosions of butter and she's a nice
and<00:01:19.140> messy<00:01:22.760> once<00:01:23.760> it's<00:01:24.000> boiling<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.930> will<00:01:25.110> look

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and messy once it's boiling it will look

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
and messy once it's boiling it will look
a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.440> like<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.450> we

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
a little like this and this is when we

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.600 
a little like this and this is when we
turn<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> heat<00:01:28.200> down<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.800> low<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.460> can

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
turn the heat down to as low as it can

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.080 
turn the heat down to as low as it can
go

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
go

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.820 
go
whether<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> gas<00:01:30.960> stove<00:01:31.229> er<00:01:31.380> an<00:01:31.470> electric

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
whether it's a gas stove er an electric

whether it's a gas stove er an electric
stove<00:01:32.300> if<00:01:33.300> you<00:01:33.390> can't<00:01:33.600> turn<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.990> down<00:01:34.020> very<00:01:34.259> low

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
stove if you can't turn it down very low

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.330 
stove if you can't turn it down very low
you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.920> pop<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:36.050> frypan<00:01:37.050> as<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
you can pop it on the a frypan as a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.910 
you can pop it on the a frypan as a
buffer<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:39.060> heat<00:01:39.270> buffer<00:01:39.660> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.740> want

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
buffer a heat buffer if you like we want

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.710 
buffer a heat buffer if you like we want
it<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.220> low<00:01:43.970> but<00:01:44.970> still<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.570> it's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
it really low but still so that it's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.080 
it really low but still so that it's
boiling<00:01:46.080> away<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.190> first<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.940> that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
boiling away now the first thing that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.030 
boiling away now the first thing that
will<00:01:48.210> happen<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.930> butter<00:01:49.110> milk<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.619> milk

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
will happen is the butter milk and milk

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.359 
will happen is the butter milk and milk
solids<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.729> water<00:01:50.790> wroth<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:52.070> quite<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> thick

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
solids and water wroth up quite a thick

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
solids and water wroth up quite a thick
froth<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.570> will<00:01:54.690> be<00:01:54.810> even<00:01:55.170> thicker<00:01:55.500> if

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
froth this will be even thicker if

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
froth this will be even thicker if
you're<00:01:55.860> using<00:01:56.479> biodynamic<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.660> organic

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you're using biodynamic or organic

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.510 
you're using biodynamic or organic
butter<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:59.009> more<00:01:59.190> buttermilk

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
butter because it's got more buttermilk

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.210 
butter because it's got more buttermilk
in<00:01:59.820> it<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:01.170> froth<00:02:01.380> will<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.650> quite<00:02:01.950> thick

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
in it so the froth will be quite thick

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.410 
in it so the froth will be quite thick
in<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:02.549> situation<00:02:04.670> but<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.820> soon<00:02:06.030> settles

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
in that situation but it soon settles

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
in that situation but it soon settles
down<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.840> starts<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.959> look<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.140> this

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
down and starts to look like this

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.960 
down and starts to look like this
instead<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:12.799> find<00:02:13.799> with<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.190> organic<00:02:14.640> butter

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
instead I find with the organic butter

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.910 
instead I find with the organic butter
the<00:02:15.720> froth<00:02:15.959> tends<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> little<00:02:16.709> bit

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the froth tends to be a little bit

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.370 
the froth tends to be a little bit
whiter<00:02:17.220> as<00:02:17.580> well<00:02:17.820> not<00:02:18.269> quite<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.690> yellow

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.590 

so<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.160> next<00:02:25.340> stage<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.670> see<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.330> froth

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
so the next stage you see the froth

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.000 
so the next stage you see the froth
starts<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.140> separate<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.680> little<00:02:27.950> bit<00:02:28.930> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
starts to separate a little bit and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.800 
starts to separate a little bit and
crystallize<00:02:31.010> but<00:02:31.790> underneath<00:02:32.120> when<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.570> move

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
crystallize but underneath when you move

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.490 
crystallize but underneath when you move
it<00:02:32.990> there's<00:02:33.170> like<00:02:33.380> these<00:02:33.590> bulbous<00:02:34.520> clouds<00:02:35.000> of

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
it there's like these bulbous clouds of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.640 
it there's like these bulbous clouds of
milk<00:02:36.500> solids<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.180> buttermilk<00:02:38.380> still<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:39.530> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
milk solids and buttermilk still in the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:49.420 
milk solids and buttermilk still in the
butter<00:02:39.830> oil<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.210> keep<00:02:41.510> cooking<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.190> keep

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
butter oil so you keep cooking and keep

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.240 
butter oil so you keep cooking and keep
cooking<00:02:50.500> starting<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.590> get<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.740> little<00:02:51.950> bit<00:02:52.160> of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
cooking starting to get a little bit of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.730 
cooking starting to get a little bit of
a<00:02:52.340> crust<00:02:52.580> on<00:02:52.790> top<00:02:52.850> here<00:02:53.300> but<00:02:54.260> again<00:02:54.560> when<00:02:54.710> you

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
a crust on top here but again when you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.450 
a crust on top here but again when you
move<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.310> one<00:02:55.490> side<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.210> still<00:02:57.020> see<00:02:57.460> the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
move it to one side you still see the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.080 
move it to one side you still see the
clouds<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:59.180> buttermilk<00:03:00.110> underneath<00:03:00.710> so<00:03:01.100> we

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
clouds of buttermilk underneath so we

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:12.070 
clouds of buttermilk underneath so we
keep<00:03:02.300> cooking<00:03:09.550> now<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.670> next<00:03:10.970> stage<00:03:11.180> these

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
keep cooking now the next stage these

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.760 
keep cooking now the next stage these
clouds<00:03:12.500> will<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:14.420> separated<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.170> sunk<00:03:15.500> to

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
clouds will have separated and sunk to

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.850 
clouds will have separated and sunk to
the<00:03:15.800> bottom<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.340> pan<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:18.410> that's<00:03:18.560> just

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
the bottom of the pan and that's just

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.170 
the bottom of the pan and that's just
the<00:03:18.950> milk<00:03:19.160> solids<00:03:19.370> sinking<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.060> bottom

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
the milk solids sinking to the bottom

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.880 
the milk solids sinking to the bottom
and<00:03:21.850> when<00:03:22.850> these<00:03:23.060> turn<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.510> little<00:03:24.020> bit<00:03:24.530> bruges

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
and when these turn a little bit bruges

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.610 
and when these turn a little bit bruges
a<00:03:24.920> little<00:03:25.490> bit<00:03:25.610> brown<00:03:25.880> this<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:27.140> when<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.500> guy

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
a little bit brown this is when the guy

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.500 
a little bit brown this is when the guy
is<00:03:27.830> ready<00:03:28.100> at<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.790> same<00:03:28.820> time<00:03:29.240> you're<00:03:29.420> getting

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
is ready at the same time you're getting

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.350 
is ready at the same time you're getting
sort<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:29.870> bigger<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:31.040> last<00:03:31.310> throes<00:03:31.910> of<00:03:31.940> air

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
sort of bigger the last throes of air

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.110 
sort of bigger the last throes of air
bubbles<00:03:32.750> from<00:03:32.930> being<00:03:33.260> removed<00:03:33.410> from<00:03:33.740> the<00:03:33.830> game

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
bubbles from being removed from the game

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.400 
bubbles from being removed from the game
but<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.240> best<00:03:35.390> way<00:03:35.570> to<00:03:35.630> test<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.080> is<00:03:36.200> with<00:03:36.380> a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
but the best way to test it is with a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.730 
but the best way to test it is with a
spoon<00:03:37.570> scraping<00:03:38.570> those<00:03:38.840> milk<00:03:39.110> solids<00:03:39.320> off<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
spoon scraping those milk solids off the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.870 
spoon scraping those milk solids off the
bottom<00:03:40.070> having<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.730> look<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:42.670> if<00:03:43.670> they're<00:03:43.850> a

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
bottom having a look and if they're a

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.840 
bottom having a look and if they're a
little<00:03:44.150> bit<00:03:44.240> Brown<00:03:44.480> like<00:03:44.750> they<00:03:44.870> are<00:03:45.020> here<00:03:45.850> then

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
little bit Brown like they are here then

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.640 
little bit Brown like they are here then
we're<00:03:47.450> pretty<00:03:47.630> much<00:03:47.810> ready<00:03:48.020> to<00:03:48.140> roll

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
we're pretty much ready to roll

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.760 
we're pretty much ready to roll
so<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.280> left<00:03:49.490> it<00:03:49.670> maybe<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.090> minute<00:03:50.750> more<00:03:50.960> then

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
so I left it maybe a minute more then

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.470 
so I left it maybe a minute more then
I've<00:03:51.890> got<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.070> big<00:03:52.310> spoon<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.120> testing

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
I've got a big spoon and just testing

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.900 
I've got a big spoon and just testing
the<00:03:53.570> oil<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.140> that's<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:54.890> beautiful<00:03:55.460> golden

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
the oil and that's a beautiful golden

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.880 
the oil and that's a beautiful golden
color<00:03:56.170> starting<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.290> smell<00:03:57.530> more<00:03:57.710> like

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
color starting to smell more like

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.340 
color starting to smell more like
popcorn<00:03:58.160> than<00:03:58.640> butter<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.270> time<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:03.020> turn

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
popcorn than butter so it's time to turn

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.130 
popcorn than butter so it's time to turn
it<00:04:03.500> off<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:04.150> strain<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.330> out<00:04:05.480> if<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:05.840> leave<00:04:06.020> it

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
it off and strain it out if you leave it

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.560 
it off and strain it out if you leave it
on<00:04:06.200> much<00:04:06.440> longer<00:04:06.740> those<00:04:07.730> milk<00:04:08.000> solids<00:04:08.210> might

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
on much longer those milk solids might

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.660 
on much longer those milk solids might
burn<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:09.710> might<00:04:09.860> burn<00:04:10.070> your<00:04:10.220> game<00:04:10.430> which

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
burn and you might burn your game which

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.060 
burn and you might burn your game which
you<00:04:10.790> don't<00:04:10.970> want<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.210> do<00:04:11.530> if<00:04:12.530> you've<00:04:12.710> ended<00:04:12.980> a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
you don't want to do if you've ended a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.740 
you don't want to do if you've ended a
little<00:04:13.190> bit<00:04:13.430> it's<00:04:13.580> not<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.790> big<00:04:13.970> deal<00:04:14.150> but<00:04:14.450> you

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
little bit it's not a big deal but you

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.510 
little bit it's not a big deal but you
don't<00:04:15.380> want<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.890> burn<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.250> too<00:04:16.430> much<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:18.520> we

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
don't want it to burn it too much so we

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.729 
don't want it to burn it too much so we
strain<00:04:19.850> it<00:04:19.880> out<00:04:20.120> with<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.390> glass<00:04:20.720> jar<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.470> nice

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
strain it out with a glass jar a nice

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.910 
strain it out with a glass jar a nice
thick<00:04:22.100> glass<00:04:22.520> jar<00:04:22.880> with<00:04:23.270> some<00:04:24.050> muslin<00:04:24.530> on<00:04:24.680> top

you<00:04:46.220> can<00:04:46.340> get<00:04:46.460> condensation<00:04:46.880> forming<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.810> the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
you can get condensation forming in the

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.110 
you can get condensation forming in the
jar<00:04:48.140> which<00:04:48.830> can<00:04:49.040> lead<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.490> guy<00:04:49.640> going<00:04:49.880> off

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
jar which can lead to the guy going off

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.940 
jar which can lead to the guy going off
but<00:04:50.480> if<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.780> let<00:04:50.930> it<00:04:50.960> cool<00:04:51.170> down<00:04:51.350> first<00:04:51.680> then

don't need to put it in the fridge it's

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.030 
don't need to put it in the fridge it's

like other oils it won't spoil out of
the<00:04:58.130> fridge<00:05:00.520> we'll<00:05:01.520> have<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.640> look<00:05:01.790> at<00:05:01.910> the

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
the fridge we'll have a look at the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.640 
the fridge we'll have a look at the
bottom<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.360> pan<00:05:02.600> this<00:05:03.110> is<00:05:03.260> what<00:05:03.380> it<00:05:03.470> looks

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
bottom of the pan this is what it looks

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.870 
bottom of the pan this is what it looks
like<00:05:04.150> see<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.270> Bruges<00:05:05.510> milk<00:05:06.410> solids<00:05:06.700> so<00:05:07.700> that

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
like see the Bruges milk solids so that

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.510 
like see the Bruges milk solids so that
was<00:05:08.000> definitely<00:05:08.150> ready<00:05:08.600> to<00:05:08.720> roll<00:05:08.900> and<00:05:09.520> these

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
was definitely ready to roll and these

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.680 
was definitely ready to roll and these
are<00:05:10.670> the<00:05:10.730> milk<00:05:10.940> solids<00:05:11.120> that<00:05:11.360> we've<00:05:11.510> just

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
are the milk solids that we've just

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.890 
are the milk solids that we've just
separated<00:05:12.230> out<00:05:12.380> from<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:13.010> butter<00:05:13.430> oil<00:05:13.900> so

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
separated out from the butter oil so

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.680 
separated out from the butter oil so
this<00:05:15.050> is<00:05:15.200> kind<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.530> like<00:05:15.680> condensed<00:05:16.220> milk<00:05:16.690> so

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
this is kind of like condensed milk so

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.150 
this is kind of like condensed milk so
you<00:05:17.750> can<00:05:17.990> either<00:05:18.110> I'll<00:05:18.470> give<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.740> to<00:05:18.770> my<00:05:18.860> dogs

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
but you can actually mix up with jaggery

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.620 
but you can actually mix up with jaggery
and<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.590> turns<00:05:22.220> into<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.640> quite<00:05:23.090> a<00:05:23.120> yummy<00:05:23.330> fudge

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
at the bottom and then sort of crystals

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.180 
at the bottom and then sort of crystals
of<00:05:49.490> ghee<00:05:49.870> depending<00:05:50.870> how<00:05:51.350> cold<00:05:51.650> a<00:05:51.740> climate<00:05:52.100> you
