00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.960
 how is the health of the same day 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:06.879
 today we are nicole and I doing the 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.160
 Intro of this video because you already know 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.900
 you who do not leave me do not leave me to 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.400
 record them does not let me talk does not let me 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.230
 nothing I prefer to have here so that 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.830
 I shout today I bring you a look 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.929
 this as an alternative for this 14 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.490
 February and they had asked me to make them 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.400
 looks with these tickets that are 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.070
 causing so much controversy between 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.320
 youtubers that if they like that they do not 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.359
 they like that they do not like how they work 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.530
 that they do not like how they look 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:38.170
 I am using the 02 road room and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.830
 this is this palette that is in shades 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.590
 purple 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.600
 I love me I'll make a 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.210
 approach for you to see more or 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.690
 less how was this clear look that is 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.670
 in zimmer tones and me I would 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.380
 I would put during the day and I will wear it at night 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.920
 because there would be no problem in 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.570
 as to the time in which you will use it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.060
 I have to say yes they are creamy and yes 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.430
 you are eyelid 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.440
 as I will tell you as a fatty eyelid 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.960
 maybe they will not last but I 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.550
 I put a prebase of shadows on them 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.740
 that is super economical costs you a 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.750
 dollar and apply the shadows and the truth 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.550
 is that I have about two hours since 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.000
 I recorded the video they came to see me I'm 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.550
 recording in shorts and then I bring 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.220
 the shadows equal, that is , they have not 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.620
 I run not have done anything to me 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.590
 love the brightness that they have I love 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.020
 this I love is that merkel that you are 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.300
 shadows have is to everyone's taste 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.040
 a girl told me this surprised me 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.630
 tell him that you like shadows and 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.460
 they see that this the other then the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.800
 truth is that I like it I do not have to 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.410
 what to tell them, nor do I have to 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.119
 tell them that I do not like them yes I love them 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.560
 then I'm going to leave you with the video 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.170
 hope you like 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.840
 I send many kisses if I do not make a 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.600

 video goes down and let's start girls 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.670
 The first thing I'm going to apply is a 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.160
 first for the face this is his and I 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.780
 I love how it works too 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.780
 I will be applying this corrector 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.440
 for the face and also with this same 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.610
 outside looking because it's a is a 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.560
 very clear corrector then I like 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.870
 that illuminates me at the same time I'm going to 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.940
 be applying the corrector or rather 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.680
 in the maybelline makeup base 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.540
 I use it as a proofreader 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.950
 I 'm going to be around my face 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.140
 putting for example in three parts of 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.730
 my face where I want to outline and 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.319
 later we will be blurring 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.319
 together with the face 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.260
 and this is how I do it if 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.379
 I do not play background music in this video 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.480
 it's because I did not find any but it 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.700
 I will be narrating them and I will also 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.040
 to be applying my foundation on 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.819
 this occasion I used the one to fit clear 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.709
 also the fables and I love me 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.379
 love how this copper base works 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.230
 it's super good and lasts a lot last for 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.329
 a lot of time now I will be 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.819
 applying my powder in beach tone 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:22.489
 milan and I also like it a lot because 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.489
 It covers very well but it is not that heavy 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.440
 the following outline and I'll be 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.660
 using this that is the solan de milan 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.780
 and it's got a little bit of shine but I 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.220
 like it because it does not make you so so 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.650
 shining my face then I like 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.210
 a lot I will be applying the blush 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:48.060
 new from milan and it is 08 h brow if it is 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.820
 a super nice natural pink tone 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.770
 love and to illuminate I will be 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.020
 using this water wire illuminator 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.910
 I love the brush that I am 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.220
 using to illuminate this 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.470
 but techniques 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.040
 now I will be doing my eyebrows and 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.170
 I will be using a brush 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.210
 this from hostel sense and the shadow that 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.600
 I'm using in coffee is water from 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.600
 new 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.260
 this is my favorite is my shadow 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.390
 favorite for 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.390
 do my eyebrows I love 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.460
 now I'm going to make an approach to 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.930
 that you can see how it is 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.860
 be applying the shadows that I am 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.039
 applying this base of shadows on him 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.800
 and the shadows that I will be using 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.479
 They are 02 and I commented milÃ¡n 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.430
 what are causing a lot 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.870
 controversy because they are very beautiful and 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.509
 many are saying that they do not work 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.310
 but see that I the best way 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.400
 I found myself using these shadows in 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.259
 cream and with glitter is with your fingers 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.479
 they apply super well and the color that 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.129
 it has to be on the eyelid first 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.620
 apply the lightest rose I'm 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.350
 now applying a tone like lilac that 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.630
 bring the palette 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.660
 and now I'm going to mix the two colors 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.520
 darker that is the purple and that I do not know 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.180
 what to tell them is the one above 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.250
 but I'm mixing them and this and some 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.460
 time I'm blurring with my fingers and 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.890
 shaping and I love I love it and 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.960
 excuse the noise of nicole is here and 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.780
 you know that she always comes out in my 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.610
 videos I'm sorry as I tell you I'm going 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.350
 applying and at the same time very blurring and 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.460
 I'm taking it to the shipping basin 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:42.200
 as to give a bit of depth and 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.200
 this is how it is gradually becoming 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.860
 now I will be applying the shadow 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:53.960
 vanilla de visu in the arch of the eyebrow 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.879
 I wanted to apply a matte shadow so that 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.429
 do not look so exaggerated then of 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.969
 wealth I'm using the pencil now 

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:04.339
