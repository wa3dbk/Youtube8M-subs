that's<00:01:16.159> what<00:01:16.250> get<00:01:16.430> involved<00:01:16.970> but<00:01:17.270> there<00:01:17.990> was

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
that's what get involved but there was

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.719

also<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.320> lot<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.560> pressure<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:19.130> mean<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.700> think

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729

the industrial automaton logo on the

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.960 
the industrial automaton logo on the
back<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:43.010> won't<00:01:43.460> know<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.760> if<00:01:43.850> you're

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
back and you won't know that if you're

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.370 
back and you won't know that if you're
kind<00:01:44.120> of<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.240> casual<00:01:44.540> fan<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:44.990> for<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.200> core

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
kind of a casual fan but for the core

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.899 
kind of a casual fan but for the core
fan<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.650> like<00:01:45.800> yes<00:01:46.010> you<00:01:46.520> know<00:01:46.580> they<00:01:46.700> got<00:01:46.820> that

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
fan you like yes you know they got that

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.100 
fan you like yes you know they got that
in<00:01:47.060> there<00:01:47.180> I<00:01:47.360> think<00:01:47.720> there's<00:01:47.900> something

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
in there I think there's something

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.380 
in there I think there's something
really<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.890> was<00:01:49.250> done<00:01:49.520> special<00:01:49.820> with<00:01:50.180> this

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
really that was done special with this

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.050 
really that was done special with this
and<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.680> kind<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.979> side<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.610> hard<00:01:52.820> core

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
and it's kind of side to the hard core

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.000 
and it's kind of side to the hard core
audience<00:01:53.420> as<00:01:53.659> well<00:01:53.690> as<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.409> we<00:01:54.620> didn't<00:01:54.800> want<00:01:54.920> to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
audience as well as is we didn't want to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.219 
audience as well as is we didn't want to
plaster<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.460> with<00:01:55.610> Star<00:01:55.909> Wars<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.690> think<00:01:57.110> we

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
plaster it with Star Wars and I think we

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.200 
plaster it with Star Wars and I think we
did<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:57.440> one<00:01:57.800> spot<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.460> say<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:58.970> Star

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
did that one spot to say this is Star

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.700 
did that one spot to say this is Star
Wars<00:01:59.450> but<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.140> won't<00:02:00.290> see<00:02:00.440> Star<00:02:00.680> Wars

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
Wars but you won't see Star Wars

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.430 
Wars but you won't see Star Wars
branding<00:02:01.310> all<00:02:01.520> over<00:02:02.090> this<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.140> person

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
branding all over this this so a person

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.649

controller<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.239> then<00:02:26.840> as<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:26.989> get<00:02:27.170> closer

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
controller and then as you get closer

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.589 
controller and then as you get closer
you<00:02:27.620> start<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.069> see<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.280> wires<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.450> have

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
you start to see the wires and you have

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.630 
you start to see the wires and you have
that<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:29.900> oh<00:02:30.019> no<00:02:30.260> way<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.769> kind<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.310> this

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
that like oh no way is this kind of this

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.930 
that like oh no way is this kind of this
reminds<00:02:32.030> me<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:33.129> Threepio<00:02:34.129> and<00:02:34.400> then

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
reminds me of the Threepio and then

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.699 
reminds me of the Threepio and then
across<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.360> room<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.660> see<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.319> art<00:02:36.530> too
