did listen to rob when he explained it
to<00:02:38.490> me<00:02:38.700> but<00:02:38.880> I've<00:02:39.000> forgotten<00:02:39.330> I'm<00:02:40.110> not<00:02:40.290> really

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
to me but I've forgotten I'm not really

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.290 
to me but I've forgotten I'm not really
much<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.890> bass<00:02:41.100> technically<00:02:41.730> I'm<00:02:41.970> afraid<00:02:42.270> I

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
much of a bass technically I'm afraid I

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.680 
much of a bass technically I'm afraid I
just<00:02:42.450> play<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.840> thing<00:02:43.490> but<00:02:44.490> switching<00:02:44.850> out<00:02:45.390> at

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
just play the thing but switching out at

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.620 
just play the thing but switching out at
this<00:02:45.870> position<00:02:46.440> allows<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> justa

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
this position allows you to have a justa

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.040 
this position allows you to have a justa
Baluch<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.970> mid-range<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:53.930> hopefully<00:02:54.930> at

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
Baluch on the mid-range so hopefully at

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.750 
Baluch on the mid-range so hopefully at
some<00:02:55.080> point<00:02:55.260> I'll<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.890> video<00:02:56.100> showing<00:02:56.550> how

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
