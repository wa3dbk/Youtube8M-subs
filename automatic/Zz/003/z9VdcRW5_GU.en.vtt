00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:08.849
 after seeing the wonderful comment that 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.700
 FIFA neighbor without it cool I decided 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.099
 make a video pre 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.520
 having familiarized with the two smoke which were 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.670
 provided to us playstation store 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.470
 it's fifa 15 and a quarter to fifteen 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 accordingly, I am comparing 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.099
 I'll tell you what I think is better 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.660
 simulator patterns coming in out of genes 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.980
 football became alive but it became alive 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.129
 only hve 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.530
 I do not want to offend the fans of weight 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.960
 I myself have played without it in 2004 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.450
 2005 when the fifa was monotonous 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.199
 there was no boring crap 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.780
 no variation yes now everything 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.480
 create the most unique moments here 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.550
 How many matches have I played? 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.489
 I never managed to get 50 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.830
 identical heads, everything happens very 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:14.280
 differently this is probably the power of the engine and 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.330
 they and I really took myself by the balls and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.189
 did a cool football simulator 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.850
 talk about the things that create 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.150
 football atmosphere in the game but many 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.490
 of course missing all these moments is 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.540
 video clips football players on the field 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:39.829
 replays so that's 15 very powerful 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.159
 animated gameplay atmosphere 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.890
 with these rollers it all comes to 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.430
 In order for a ballist to lift another 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.980
 football player which ball 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.770
 he can grab the shirt on the other 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.380
 he will be cut off in a collision 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.980
 tackle they will conflict either there 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.680
 clap each other on the shoulder very 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:10.100
 a lot of things going on too 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.620
 background this offers us without at the beginning 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.630
 match we do not even show the way out 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.730
 football players 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.550
 I don't understand why they did it 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.450
 but apparently either of this because smoke 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.860
 either you got scored okay 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.530
 it is important for a few but we would not be 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.100
 nice to see I can once again 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.650
 look at how traced 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.570
 ballist and stuff easier 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.760
 [music] 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.940
 moments when the ball flies over the bar 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.470
 hits the crossbar 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.020
 after that we are not shown how 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.350
 football player annoyed that he is there 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.330
 It is experiencing easier and easier nuts vice versa 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.730
 this share so much attention that you 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.510
 feel their blow so much 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.100
 as far as 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.890
 the front was dangerous let's talk about 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.060
 hemiplegia I do not want to mention 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.769
 fans without but still gameplay oops so 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.230
 FIFA itself is very very diverse 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.340
 smoothly and a lot of new movements 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.260
 recorded touch ball handling that's all 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.080
 very cool that's really for 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.860
 compared with 14 and fifa and she took a step 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:29.890
 very good and without it nothing 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.560
 different from previous games in its series 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.829
 but do not think I'm not saying that without it 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.110
 bad football you can play it 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.829
 can also create moments but if 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.720
 compare 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.860
 fify 15 and what approach to football she has 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:51.140
 without playing 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.760
 he did the atmosphere he didn't do that 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.140
 what did fifa do I mean not 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.950
 diversified himself 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.709
 we still have 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.819
 several blanks of celebration heads 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:07.120
 which are basically very few i don't 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.400
 all look the same in 2005 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.120
 year I saw Fifi 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:18.880
 I see a lot of new is not why she 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:23.430
 like more so i really hope 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.960
 that weight fans will not write angry 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.690
 comments say that all I do 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.360
 I say this shit I just want them 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.220
 also played fifa and just compared 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.710
 because I'm for everyone to play 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:43.060
 was good so don't be angry 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:48.180
 fans without, but I think that fifa after all 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.850
 better at least deme it better 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.190
 Well, at the end of my story I want 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.000
 show you what the fucking kind 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.979
 replays done after the match fifi 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.400
 have a nice view choose a good one 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.400
 football 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:06:24.339
