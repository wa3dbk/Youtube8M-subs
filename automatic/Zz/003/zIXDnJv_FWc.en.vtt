00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello good morning to all we are a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.670
 edge of vismara 47 sorry for the 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.010
 glasses but the sun is really strong 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.420
 we can not without a star when we 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.190
 alessandro vismara the designer e 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.599
 owner of the alessandro yard this 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.490
 boat in the fast tub that has 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 already had a nice feedback what you can 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.270
 to tell 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.070
 first of all that it is very fast but also 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 very very comfortable this boat is a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.359
 particular object in speaking well 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.689
 because it is a joint project between 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.310
 vismara and baltic yacht and therefore puts 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.940
 together design and technologies 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.180
 constructive and the approach to making 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.180
 very usable objects of vismara with the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.370
 history of vismara with baltic us and 25 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 years we work with baltic for all 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.170
 big boats so we created 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.450
 this boat that goes to give one 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.090
 outlet to a market that cannot 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.699
 afford the big baltic and therefore 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.829
 this boat combines technology 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.070
 constructive entirely made of fiber 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.289
 carbon in comfort we will see later in 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.690
 of interior solutions very much 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.280
 innovative and spacious to what 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.530
 very important in recent times 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.720
 great usability the boat born for one 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.270
 couple who has two children so 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.450
 certainly a boat that must allow 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 to navigate to people in two on their own 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.670
 with the children, however, also a boat with one 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.490
 very related feature was why 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.229
 the shipowner is a sports fan 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.960
 so it's a limousine 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.579
 in fact a ferrari covered with a limousine e 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.259
 heard we saw the interior 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.200
 the other day and I 'm really one 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.659
 he is stunned by such clean interiors 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.159
 and details what is the thing that is you 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.950
 liked more when designing 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.350
 interior meanwhile collaborate with 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.509
 the shipowner who 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.250
 certainly has been busy for 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.610
 work with us in something 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.650
 new 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.049
 then above all because finally after 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.930
 so many years we say fatigue aside 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.909
 ours to make very bright boats 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.920
 therefore with the use of materials 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.100
 modern so no wood 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.080
 we used leather we used gods 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.600
 painted panels we used gods 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.520
 colors above tone and we were able to 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.489
 make a very warm environment though 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.709
 bright very modern logically use 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.080
 of structural windows gave the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.290
 possibility of having so much light inside and 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.780
 then a very symmetrical geometry that 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.300
 lets you feel the boat yours 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.640
 right with the same left and this then 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.069
 gives you a sense of greater space is 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.989
 also a use of spaces and 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.870
 much more boat structures 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.000
 optimized and we conclude the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.000
 presentation of vismara 47 by 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.280
 interiors with a very nice peculiarity 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.739
 the master cabin shower 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.250
 see transparent for happiness 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.250
 of the owner is entered and closes 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.010
 here I must say that a shower like this 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.480
 we had never seen it before 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.829
 particular and to the vismara 47 all vi 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.670
 we say goodbye see you on board the 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.670
 next boat hello
