six f-stop lens with the one point four
teleconverter<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> remember<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
teleconverter you have to remember that

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.330 
teleconverter you have to remember that
if<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.140> extend<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:32.520> 400<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:34.049> puts<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.680> f/8

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
if you extend to 400 that puts it at f/8

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.620 
if you extend to 400 that puts it at f/8
so<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> relatively<00:01:37.759> big<00:01:38.759> adjustment<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
