notes<00:00:27.570> Little<00:00:27.930> Caesars<00:00:28.380> use<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> 9<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:29.820> 13<00:00:30.090> inch

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
notes Little Caesars use a 9 by 13 inch

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.950 
notes Little Caesars use a 9 by 13 inch
pan<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.050> bacon<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.669> thickness<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.840> we

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
pan and bacon about this thickness so we

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.870 
pan and bacon about this thickness so we
ended<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.230> wrapping<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> size<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.219> bacon<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
ended up wrapping the size of bacon and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
ended up wrapping the size of bacon and
it<00:00:36.090> didn't<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.540> matter<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.380> like

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it didn't really matter because it like

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
it didn't really matter because it like
fell<00:00:37.980> down<00:00:38.219> anyway<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> lot<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.180> trial<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
fell down anyway but a lot of trial and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330 
fell down anyway but a lot of trial and
error<00:00:39.840> went<00:00:40.170> into<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.860> stay<00:00:41.129> with

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
error went into this so just stay with

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.310 
error went into this so just stay with
me<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.730> we're<00:00:42.390> gonna<00:00:42.450> help<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.840> out

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.020 

so<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> reason<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:46.860> pre<00:00:47.160> baked<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> bacon<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so the reason we pre baked the bacon is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.400 
so the reason we pre baked the bacon is
because<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.570> much<00:00:48.719> longer<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.230> cook

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
because it will take much longer to cook

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.799 
because it will take much longer to cook
than<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.739> dough<00:00:50.039> it'll<00:00:50.670> also<00:00:50.789> extract<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.570> ton

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
than the dough it'll also extract a ton

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
than the dough it'll also extract a ton
of<00:00:51.840> grease<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.680> double<00:00:53.010> soaked<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.460> so

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
of grease that the double soaked up so

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000 
of grease that the double soaked up so
you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.120> save<00:00:54.510> money<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.870> buying<00:00:55.199> oil<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you can save money on buying oil and you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.619 
you can save money on buying oil and you
can<00:00:56.160> put<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> money<00:00:56.940> away<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.270> your

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
can put that money away for your

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
can put that money away for your
doctor's<00:00:57.960> visit<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.739> we're<00:00:58.890> simply<00:00:59.129> talking

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
doctor's visit so we're simply talking

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.400 
doctor's visit so we're simply talking
the<00:00:59.789> dough<00:01:00.000> into<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.539> bacon<00:01:00.899> around<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the dough into the bacon around the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.560 
the dough into the bacon around the
edges<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.010> folding<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> over<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> dough

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
edges and folding it over so the dough

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.730 
edges and folding it over so the dough
can<00:01:03.780> rise<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> bacon<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> reason<00:01:07.650> we

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
can rise into the bacon so the reason we

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.289 
can rise into the bacon so the reason we
pre<00:01:07.979> bake<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> dough<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.210> will

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
pre bake the dough is because it will

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
pre bake the dough is because it will
take<00:01:09.420> much<00:01:09.570> longer<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.990> cook<00:01:10.170> than<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.560> cheese

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
take much longer to cook than the cheese

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.039 
take much longer to cook than the cheese
and<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.909> had<00:01:12.000> some<00:01:12.210> random<00:01:12.540> cooked<00:01:12.810> bacon

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and we had some random cooked bacon

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.830 
and we had some random cooked bacon
lying<00:01:13.500> around<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> figured

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
lying around so I figured

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.690 
lying around so I figured
bam-bam-bam-bam<00:01:15.869> secret<00:01:16.799> hidden<00:01:17.100> goodness

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
bam-bam-bam-bam secret hidden goodness

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.580 
bam-bam-bam-bam secret hidden goodness
and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.479> poured<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> thin<00:01:19.020> layer<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.229> sauce

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and then we poured a thin layer of sauce

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
and then we poured a thin layer of sauce
not<00:01:20.130> too<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:20.759> it'll<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.180> watery<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
not too much or it'll get watery and we

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
not too much or it'll get watery and we
spread<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.280> edge<00:01:23.460> now

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
spread it all the way to the edge now

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.270 
spread it all the way to the edge now
pour<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.570> about<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> half<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.439> gallon<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.920> cheese

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
pour on about a half a gallon of cheese

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
pour on about a half a gallon of cheese
or<00:01:26.700> more<00:01:27.270> depending<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.900> your<00:01:28.080> life

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
or more depending on your life

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.920 
or more depending on your life
expectancy<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.000> go<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.600> bake

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
expectancy and here we go in for bake

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.140 
expectancy and here we go in for bake
number<00:01:31.259> three

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
number three

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.270 
number three
so<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> reason<00:01:34.080> we<00:01:34.170> pre-baked<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> cheese<00:01:35.010> is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
so the reason we pre-baked the cheese is

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.740 
so the reason we pre-baked the cheese is
because<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:35.700> take<00:01:35.850> much<00:01:36.060> longer<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:36.570> cook

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
because it will take much longer to cook

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
because it will take much longer to cook
than<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.110> pepperoni<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.070> since<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.460> went

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
than the pepperoni and since we went

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.130 
than the pepperoni and since we went
through<00:01:38.760> so<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:38.970> trial<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.330> error<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.870> ended

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
through so much trial and error we ended

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.110 
through so much trial and error we ended
up<00:01:40.230> running<00:01:40.440> out<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> pepperoni<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.730> that

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
up running out of pepperoni and that

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.460 
up running out of pepperoni and that
kind<00:01:42.300> of<00:01:42.360> sucks<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:42.930> after<00:01:43.260> all<00:01:43.350> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
kind of sucks because after all that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.800 
kind of sucks because after all that
hard<00:01:43.680> work<00:01:43.800> we<00:01:44.190> got<00:01:44.310> shafted<00:01:44.730> by<00:01:45.090> lack<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
hard work we got shafted by lack of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.500 
hard work we got shafted by lack of
pepperoni<00:01:47.480> and<00:01:49.700> finally<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:50.970> three<00:01:51.300> more

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
pepperoni and finally for three more

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.020
