00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
anyway and maybe this is because I'm

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.160 
anyway and maybe this is because I'm
surrounded<00:01:53.759> by<00:01:53.790> protein<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> daily<00:01:54.630> basis

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
surrounded by protein on a daily basis

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.709 
surrounded by protein on a daily basis
it<00:01:56.070> gave<00:01:56.310> me<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.549> idea<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> company<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
it gave me this idea that the company is

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.569 
it gave me this idea that the company is
honest<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.320> another<00:01:58.979> thing<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.399> really

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
honest and another thing that I really

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.999 
honest and another thing that I really
liked<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> protein<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.799> it's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
liked and it's on the protein and it's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.249 
liked and it's on the protein and it's
on<00:02:02.159> every<00:02:02.549> other<00:02:02.670> rival<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.149> product<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.750> when

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.139

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
names for obvious reasons so I really

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.970 
names for obvious reasons so I really
like<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.200> kind<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.380> gave<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:32.860> that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
like that it kind of gave you that

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
like that it kind of gave you that
personal<00:02:33.400> feel<00:02:33.610> right<00:02:33.819> off<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> hob<00:02:36.000> now

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
personal feel right off of the hob now

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.759 
personal feel right off of the hob now
all<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.360> aside<00:02:37.510> let's<00:02:38.110> get<00:02:38.260> down<00:02:38.380> right<00:02:38.620> into

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
all that aside let's get down right into

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.339 
all that aside let's get down right into
the<00:02:38.830> protein<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.819> has<00:02:40.480> seven<00:02:40.810> different<00:02:41.019> types

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the protein it has seven different types

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.509 
the protein it has seven different types
of<00:02:41.440> proteins<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.069> it's<00:02:42.220> kind<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
of proteins so it's kind of like a

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.330 
of proteins so it's kind of like a
protein<00:02:42.940> matrix<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:44.260> has<00:02:44.440> two<00:02:44.890> forms<00:02:45.130> of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
protein matrix it has two forms of

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.520 
protein matrix it has two forms of

quick absorbing proteins and they're

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.340

beneficial<00:03:09.430> my<00:03:09.849> way<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.150> looking<00:03:10.450> at<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.599> is

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
beneficial my way of looking at it is

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.930 
beneficial my way of looking at it is
that<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.410> know<00:03:11.530> muscle<00:03:12.280> tissue<00:03:12.459> isn't<00:03:12.700> like<00:03:12.910> a

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
that you know muscle tissue isn't like a

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.000 
that you know muscle tissue isn't like a
light<00:03:13.180> switch<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.900> doesn't<00:03:14.319> repair<00:03:14.650> like<00:03:14.890> an

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
light switch it doesn't repair like an

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.500 
light switch it doesn't repair like an
on-and-off<00:03:15.280> function<00:03:15.880> it's<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.150> gradual

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
on-and-off function it's a gradual

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.630 
on-and-off function it's a gradual
process<00:03:16.599> so<00:03:17.590> why<00:03:17.739> would<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:17.950> want<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.190> protein

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
process so why would you want a protein

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.220 
process so why would you want a protein
you<00:03:19.209> know<00:03:19.329> like<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> lot<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.900> other<00:03:20.019> ones

there's no sugar or artificial
sweeteners<00:06:51.099> in<00:06:51.129> this<00:06:51.340> product<00:06:51.819> it<00:06:52.000> uses

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
sweeteners in this product it uses

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.629 
sweeteners in this product it uses
stevia<00:06:52.810> Stevie's<00:06:53.680> a<00:06:53.710> plant<00:06:54.039> extract<00:06:54.520> that

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
stevia Stevie's a plant extract that

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.399 
stevia Stevie's a plant extract that
stimulates<00:06:55.150> the<00:06:55.240> sweet<00:06:55.449> receptors<00:06:55.599> just<00:06:56.259> like

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.409 
stimulates the sweet receptors just like

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:58.800 
stimulates the sweet receptors just like
sugar<00:06:57.250> does<00:06:57.490> except<00:06:57.940> it<00:06:58.030> doesn't<00:06:58.180> get<00:06:58.360> stored

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:58.810 
sugar does except it doesn't get stored

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.779 
sugar does except it doesn't get stored
so<00:06:59.080> it's<00:06:59.169> not<00:06:59.259> going<00:06:59.349> to<00:06:59.440> make<00:06:59.500> you<00:06:59.560> fat<00:07:00.009> it<00:07:00.430> has

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:00.789 
so it's not going to make you fat it has

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:02.930 
so it's not going to make you fat it has
no<00:07:01.000> role<00:07:01.270> on<00:07:01.449> your<00:07:01.569> insulin<00:07:01.960> levels<00:07:01.990> either

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
no role on your insulin levels either

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.360 
no role on your insulin levels either
and<00:07:04.500> I<00:07:05.500> guess<00:07:05.680> I'm<00:07:05.770> going<00:07:05.919> to<00:07:05.979> kind<00:07:06.129> of<00:07:06.159> end

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
and I guess I'm going to kind of end

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.430 
and I guess I'm going to kind of end
with<00:07:06.610> one<00:07:06.819> little<00:07:07.210> complaint<00:07:07.659> it<00:07:08.080> is

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.700 
all-natural with the exception of a
little<00:07:10.300> bit<00:07:10.389> of<00:07:10.479> flavoring<00:07:11.110> it<00:07:11.259> is<00:07:11.409> partially

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
little bit of flavoring it is partially

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.529 
little bit of flavoring it is partially
flavored<00:07:12.280> with<00:07:12.400> artificial<00:07:12.789> flavors<00:07:13.300> and<00:07:13.509> I

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539 
flavored with artificial flavors and I

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.749 
flavored with artificial flavors and I
don't<00:07:13.720> like<00:07:13.930> that<00:07:14.340> there<00:07:15.340> are<00:07:15.520> other

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 
don't like that there are other

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:16.980 
don't like that there are other
companies<00:07:15.940> out<00:07:16.300> there<00:07:16.389> that<00:07:16.569> have<00:07:16.750> managed<00:07:16.960> to

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
companies out there that have managed to

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.080 
companies out there that have managed to
make<00:07:17.169> a<00:07:17.199> protein<00:07:17.590> shake<00:07:17.830> that<00:07:18.729> is<00:07:18.849> one<00:07:19.000> hundred

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
make a protein shake that is one hundred

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.969 
make a protein shake that is one hundred
percent<00:07:19.270> naturally<00:07:19.840> flavored<00:07:20.080> so<00:07:20.680> I<00:07:20.710> really

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:20.979 
percent naturally flavored so I really

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:21.990 
percent naturally flavored so I really
don't<00:07:21.039> think<00:07:21.159> that<00:07:21.340> there's<00:07:21.430> an<00:07:21.580> excuse<00:07:21.909> to

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
don't think that there's an excuse to

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.550 
don't think that there's an excuse to
kind<00:07:22.180> of<00:07:22.210> put<00:07:22.449> artificial<00:07:22.840> flavors<00:07:23.319> in<00:07:23.500> a

product that's already been touched on
by<00:07:25.659> another<00:07:25.870> one<00:07:26.020> of<00:07:26.110> the<00:07:26.169> brand<00:07:26.380> ambassadors

by another one of the brand ambassadors

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:28.950 
by another one of the brand ambassadors
I'm<00:07:27.009> not<00:07:27.099> going<00:07:27.220> to<00:07:27.280> go<00:07:27.340> any<00:07:27.520> further<00:07:27.960> aside

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
I'm not going to go any further aside

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.629 
I'm not going to go any further aside
from<00:07:29.110> that<00:07:29.199> and<00:07:29.620> the<00:07:30.069> flavor<00:07:30.310> of<00:07:30.400> the<00:07:30.460> white

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 
from that and the flavor of the white

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.550 
from that and the flavor of the white
chocolate<00:07:30.849> and<00:07:31.240> vanilla<00:07:31.270> I<00:07:31.690> really<00:07:32.199> like<00:07:32.409> the
