00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everyone and welcome to my 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.919
 channel today video will be for those who do not 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.030
 knows how to draw but really wants beautiful 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.480
 nail art 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.670
 one word stamping will show you my 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 new record from the rope and several 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.779
 designs with her and also show you lacquers 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.539
 which can also be used for 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.240
 stemping on this plate 20 large 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.910
 drawings and all interesting enough on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.179
 I already applied nails base color and to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.790
 locate tea glace of such lavender 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.690
 lilac shade put on the plate 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.940
 dark blue rope steamping 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.730
 scraper at an angle of about 45 degrees 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.920
 take off the excess and then take a stamp 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.039
 rolling motion 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.079
 drawing on the nail plate all on 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.149
 really very simple on the second 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 My little pink nail polish 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.100
 I decided to try white as well 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.320
 more gentle option with the same design 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.600
 all that got on the skin around the nail 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.769
 Easy to remove with nail polish remover 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.360
 or a cotton swab or brush 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.360
 I recommend you do not rush the application 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.970
 topcoat so how wet 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.640
 drawing can be smudged even if you 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 special coating for the stamping well 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.439
 Here is such a first option and he to me 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
 really like it now show you 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.470
 how to make such an option with black 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.650
 dots 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.020
 on a gentle gradient my nails are covered 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.970
 all the same varnish as in the beginning and to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 make a gradation of color i will use 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.369
 sponge for applying tonal basis 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.750
 apply any two shades of varnish on the sponge 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.180
 a little overlap 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 and light tangential movements do 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.240
 smooth transition well that's gradient ready 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.490
 I choose a pattern with dots of different 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.280
 magnitude and apply black lacquer for 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.340
 I carry out a stamping in the same way 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.350
 drawing on nail lacquers konad enough 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.820
 so quickly set to work 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.479
 I need a quick beauty 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.909
 like even more than 1 and go 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.810
 Further in the third option I leave that 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.000
 same gradient from purple to pink and 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.879
 I decorate it with stars for this I use 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.849
 silver lacquer rope turned out more 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.650
 gentle options but also enough 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.300
 nice and of course tell you 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.730
 about varnishes which are also possible 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.040
 use for stemping this 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.900
 mirror lacquers with foil effect from 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.080
 kaleidoscope el corazon 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.360
 There are 14 shades in this series and they are all very 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.610
 beautiful in this photo very well 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.220
 it is clear that even small fine details 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.739
 The pictures are very well imprinted with 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.959
 these varnishes well what a new record from 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.459
 I liked the races I will continue 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.830
