 wholesale company your competent 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.919
 partner for camera and studio make up 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.730
 They want to go on a journey 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.130
 A tripod needs to be around for example 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.619
 to photograph Hong Kong at night or 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.380
 have the sunrise at grand canyon 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.080
 we are exactly right for you 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 our big tm 250 tripod tripod has 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.290
 a pack size of less than 40 cm is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.090
 not heavy, but still stable 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.640
 we have an adjustable one here 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.910
 thigh stop 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.530
 so you can sometimes close to the ground 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.590
 pictures marco shots to make 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.180
 example and this practical little 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.020
 Tripod can be with you 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.320
 extended also comfortable at eye level 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.320
 bring 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:20.780
 that is practically enough for this small one 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:24.770
 easy to put on screws and already 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.630
 our tripod is stable 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 the center column is double extendable 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.520
 we have a practical one up here 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.470
 Quick lock the counterpart 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.340
 this is located here on the camera 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.200
 thus eliminates the annoying fumble and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.479
 look for the tripod thread 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.210
 darkness for example the camera 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.550
 directly the plate is just here 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.100
 pushed on and with this screw 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.190
 stuck here and see her 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.380
 despite the small park house we can 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.619
 our tripod comfortable at eye level 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.619
 bring 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.970
 we also have a backup here if 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 you have the camps for the 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.720
 Quick release plate not tight enough 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.900
 should have tightened 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.910
 the camera can not be accidentally disconnected 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.070
 Above all , tripod is one 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.260
 fuse it when you press the button 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:25.019
 you can free the camera from the head 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.620
 But our tripods also have our circles 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.530
 another special feature here and you 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.959
 so that his is a hook on us 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.730
 can secure a camera bag is 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.080
 at the same time to complain of 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.340
 tripod if it is in it but if 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.500
 we now remove this skin from the center column 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.950
 remove 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:55.070
 We can take out the center column 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:58.230
 a leg of our wise tripod 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.120
 unscrew this with the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.770
 Moss rubber as cold protection 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:11.340
 this tripod legs will be with the 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:21.180
 connected by means of column and already have 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:26.640
 we have a very stable monopod and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.440
 Again, as you can see with the 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:37.670
 camera 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:41.610
 beautiful at eye level so work 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.030
 Do not give up traveling without giving up 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.230
 to get sharp long-term exposures 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.750
 or 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.640
 when shooting with tripod 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:56.520
 as much depth of field as possible 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.770
 example of our dtm 1250 travel tripod 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.470
 should always be there 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.080
 Thank you for your attention 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.030
