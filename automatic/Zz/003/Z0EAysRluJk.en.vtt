actually how to play okay see the
numbers<00:01:41.750> all<00:01:42.750> over<00:01:42.780> risk<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.439> opened<00:01:43.770> up

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
numbers all over risk that we opened up

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.010 
numbers all over risk that we opened up
okay

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
okay

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.660 
okay
the<00:01:46.020> number<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.530> means<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.009> each<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the number one means that each one of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.429 
the number one means that each one of
those<00:01:47.850> squares<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.450> touching<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:48.990> least<00:01:49.170> one

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
those squares is touching at least one

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.969 
those squares is touching at least one
mine<00:01:50.630> now<00:01:51.630> one<00:01:51.869> individual<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.680> touching

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
mine now one individual that's touching

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.889 
mine now one individual that's touching
one<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:53.759> there<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> mine<00:01:54.420> right<00:01:54.659> here

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
one like if there was a mine right here

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
one like if there was a mine right here
where<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> cursor<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.759> three<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
where the cursor is then all three of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.700 
where the cursor is then all three of
these<00:01:57.509> would<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.780> touching<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.229> one<00:01:58.469> mine

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
these would be touching that one mine

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.590 
these would be touching that one mine
because<00:01:58.979> corners<00:01:59.430> count<00:01:59.670> 2<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.149> 2<00:02:00.180> means

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
because corners count 2 and 2 means

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
because corners count 2 and 2 means
that's<00:02:00.750> touching<00:02:01.020> two<00:02:01.350> mines<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that's touching two mines it's just a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.219 
that's touching two mines it's just a
big<00:02:02.460> puzzle<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.570> okay<00:02:03.810> let's<00:02:04.020> start

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
big puzzle you know okay let's start

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.929 
big puzzle you know okay let's start
here's<00:02:04.469> what<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.680> should<00:02:04.860> start<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.189> see

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
here's what you should start with see

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.089 
here's what you should start with see
how<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.479> all<00:02:06.960> isolated<00:02:07.680> except<00:02:07.920> for

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
how this one is all isolated except for

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.249 
how this one is all isolated except for
one<00:02:08.340> corner<00:02:08.879> well<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> has<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.929> touching

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
one corner well it has to be touching

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.080 
one corner well it has to be touching
one<00:02:10.530> mine<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:10.979> means<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.550> one<00:02:11.790> has

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
one mine so that means that this one has

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.240 
one mine so that means that this one has
to<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.450> mine<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.959> don't

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
to be mine so you don't

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.650 
to be mine so you don't
click<00:02:13.460> on<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.820> want<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.060> right-click<00:02:14.270> on

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
click on that you want to right-click on

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.550 
click on that you want to right-click on
it<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.990> put<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.620> flag<00:02:15.890> down<00:02:17.230> okay<00:02:18.230> that's<00:02:18.380> one

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
it and put a flag down okay that's one

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.100 
it and put a flag down okay that's one
but<00:02:18.800> then<00:02:18.920> since<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.820> one<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.180> obviously

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
but then since this one is obviously

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.660 
but then since this one is obviously
touching<00:02:21.530> one<00:02:21.710> mine<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.430> one's

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
touching one mine and this one's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.980 
touching one mine and this one's
touching<00:02:22.910> one<00:02:23.180> mine<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:23.600> one's<00:02:23.810> touching

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
touching one mine this one's touching

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.780 
touching one mine this one's touching
one<00:02:24.230> mine<00:02:24.410> since<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.830> one<00:02:24.980> has<00:02:25.190> team<00:02:25.460> in<00:02:25.580> mind

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
one mine since that one has team in mind

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.420 
one mine since that one has team in mind
I<00:02:25.970> mean<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.810> one<00:02:27.050> cannot<00:02:27.350> possibly<00:02:28.070> be<00:02:28.310> in

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
I mean so this one cannot possibly be in

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.940 
I mean so this one cannot possibly be in
mind<00:02:28.700> because<00:02:29.150> it's<00:02:29.840> already<00:02:30.110> touching<00:02:30.740> one

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
mind because it's already touching one

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.710 
mind because it's already touching one
mine<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.850> cannot<00:02:32.060> be<00:02:32.240> touching<00:02:32.540> another

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
mine and it cannot be touching another

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.810 
mine and it cannot be touching another
one<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.110> we<00:02:33.200> can<00:02:33.320> successfully<00:02:33.709> left-click<00:02:34.700> on

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
one so we can successfully left-click on

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.290 
one so we can successfully left-click on
that<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:36.070> would<00:02:37.070> someone<00:02:37.340> -<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.970> means<00:02:38.150> that

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
that one would someone - that means that

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.660 
that one would someone - that means that
since<00:02:38.990> this<00:02:39.230> one<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.680> touching<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.459> mine

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
since this one is touching a mine

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.100 
since this one is touching a mine
already<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.510> means<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.840> cannot

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
already that means that I cannot

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.320 
already that means that I cannot
postures<00:02:42.860> can't<00:02:43.130> possibly<00:02:43.610> be<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> mine<00:02:44.120> either

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
postures can't possibly be a mine either

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.320 
postures can't possibly be a mine either
so<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.200> one's<00:02:45.590> safe<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.220> then<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.150> this

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
so that one's safe and then so is this

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.860 
so that one's safe and then so is this
one<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.140> one<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:49.040> one<00:02:49.630> now<00:02:50.630> look

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
one and this one and this one now look

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.900 
one and this one and this one now look
at<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.140> see<00:02:51.560> how<00:02:51.770> this<00:02:51.950> is<00:02:52.130> number<00:02:52.459> two<00:02:52.670> and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
at this see how this is number two and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.400 
at this see how this is number two and
it's<00:02:53.030> touching<00:02:53.239> one<00:02:53.570> mine<00:02:53.840> but<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.260> only

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
it's touching one mine but it's only

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.290 
it's touching one mine but it's only
touching<00:02:54.830> one<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.100> their<00:02:55.220> square<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:56.150> means

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
touching one of their square that means

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.449 
touching one of their square that means
this<00:02:56.540> one<00:02:56.780> has<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.320> be<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.530> mind<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.040> we<00:02:58.160> can<00:02:58.190> put

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
this one has to be in mind so we can put

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.840 
this one has to be in mind so we can put
a<00:02:58.489> flag<00:02:58.730> there<00:02:58.970> too<00:02:59.209> and<00:03:00.250> then<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.370> one<00:03:01.640> this

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
a flag there too and then this one this

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.120 
a flag there too and then this one this
too<00:03:02.450> right<00:03:02.690> here<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.200> touching<00:03:03.709> -<00:03:03.890> mine's

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
too right here is touching - mine's

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.710 
too right here is touching - mine's
already<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.880> means<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.209> none<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.630> these

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
already so that means that none of these

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.820 
already so that means that none of these
can<00:03:06.020> be<00:03:06.080> mines

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
can be mines

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.890 
can be mines
we'll<00:03:07.430> look<00:03:07.670> we<00:03:07.850> got<00:03:07.970> another<00:03:08.239> big<00:03:08.480> opening

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
we'll look we got another big opening

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.590 
we'll look we got another big opening
okay<00:03:09.890> see<00:03:09.950> here's<00:03:10.580> another<00:03:10.640> number<00:03:11.120> one<00:03:11.450> on

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
okay see here's another number one on

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.870 
okay see here's another number one on
the<00:03:11.690> corner<00:03:12.080> is<00:03:12.590> we<00:03:12.800> can<00:03:12.950> flag<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:13.459> because

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
the corner is we can flag that because

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.420 
the corner is we can flag that because
that<00:03:14.090> has<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.720> mine<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.260> then<00:03:16.250> that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
that has to be a mine and then that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.830 
that has to be a mine and then that
means<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:16.880> can't<00:03:17.209> be<00:03:17.360> mine<00:03:17.600> neither

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
means that this can't be mine neither

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.400 
means that this can't be mine neither

another one there and this cavity of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.970 
another one there and this cavity of
mine<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:26.299> can't<00:03:26.600> be<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.810> mine<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.769> now<00:03:27.890> we

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
mine and this can't be a mine and now we

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.100 
mine and this can't be a mine and now we
got<00:03:28.280> ah

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
got ah

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.240 
got ah
now<00:03:30.110> eventually<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.560> might<00:03:30.769> have<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.010> get<00:03:31.130> to

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
now eventually you might have to get to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.039

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
guessing which kind of saw experts what

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.440 
guessing which kind of saw experts what
then<00:03:33.890> we<00:03:34.100> got<00:03:34.220> another<00:03:34.400> cornered<00:03:34.940> one<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.330> with

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
then we got another cornered one so with

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.360 
then we got another cornered one so with
those<00:03:35.570> Campea<00:03:36.140> mine<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:36.680> can't<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.190> mind

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
those Campea mine this can't be in mind

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.250 
those Campea mine this can't be in mind
this<00:03:37.549> can't<00:03:37.820> be<00:03:37.970> in<00:03:38.060> mind<00:03:38.299> this<00:03:38.690> can't<00:03:39.049> be<00:03:39.230> a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
this can't be in mind this can't be a

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.759 
this can't be in mind this can't be a
mine<00:03:39.560> here<00:03:40.060> we<00:03:41.060> go<00:03:41.209> then<00:03:41.630> we<00:03:41.780> have<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.930> tool<00:03:42.230> it's

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
mine here we go then we have a tool it's

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.229 
mine here we go then we have a tool it's
only<00:03:42.950> touching<00:03:43.430> two<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.940> means<00:03:44.150> that

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
only touching two so that means that

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.390 
only touching two so that means that
this<00:03:44.420> one<00:03:44.600> has<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.049> be<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.260> mine<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:45.980> two<00:03:46.280> is

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
this one has to be in mine this two is

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.370 
this one has to be in mine this two is
already<00:03:46.549> touching<00:03:46.910> twos<00:03:47.329> this<00:03:47.690> one<00:03:47.870> can't<00:03:48.170> be

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
already touching twos this one can't be

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.350 
already touching twos this one can't be
in<00:03:48.470> mine<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.930> then<00:03:51.200> ah<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:52.700> we'll<00:03:52.910> see<00:03:53.180> this

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
in mine and then ah this we'll see this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.360 
in mine and then ah this we'll see this
one<00:03:53.600> is<00:03:53.810> is<00:03:53.989> already<00:03:54.410> touching<00:03:54.739> ones<00:03:55.100> that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
one is is already touching ones that

that<00:03:57.950> can't<00:03:58.340> be<00:03:58.549> a<00:03:58.579> mine<00:03:58.880> then<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.019> three<00:04:00.380> is

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
that can't be a mine then this three is

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.259 
that can't be a mine then this three is
touching<00:04:00.890> too<00:04:01.130> but<00:04:01.370> there's<00:04:01.549> one<00:04:01.730> more<00:04:02.030> so

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
that means that this has to be in mind

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.120 
that means that this has to be in mind
so<00:04:05.120> we<00:04:05.209> can<00:04:05.360> put<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.570> flag<00:04:05.870> there<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:06.500> this

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
so we can put a flag there and this

that means that this cannot possibly be

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.770 
that means that this cannot possibly be
a<00:04:17.060> mine

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780
