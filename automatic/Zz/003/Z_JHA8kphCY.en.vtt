00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.680 
I've locked out in dark situations
during<00:03:21.950> films<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.670> black<00:03:22.880> areas<00:03:23.239> can<00:03:23.390> tend<00:03:23.600> to

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
during films the black areas can tend to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.660 
during films the black areas can tend to
look<00:03:23.780> slightly<00:03:24.080> gray<00:03:24.500> due<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.250> backlight

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
look slightly gray due to the backlight

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.000 
look slightly gray due to the backlight
in<00:03:26.209> all<00:03:26.480> fairness<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.080> WT<00:03:27.530> does<00:03:27.769> well<00:03:27.980> on

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
in all fairness the WT does well on

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.740 
in all fairness the WT does well on
providing<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.610> good<00:03:28.850> range<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.239> contrast

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
providing a good range of contrast

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.140 
providing a good range of contrast
however<00:03:30.530> for<00:03:30.769> my<00:03:30.860> personal<00:03:31.130> taste<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.760> would

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
however for my personal taste I would

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.370 
however for my personal taste I would
probably<00:03:32.269> lower<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.690> brightness<00:03:32.870> setting

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
probably lower the brightness setting

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.289 
probably lower the brightness setting
slightly<00:03:33.799> for<00:03:33.950> day-to-day<00:03:34.100> viewing<00:03:34.760> as<00:03:34.880> the

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
slightly for day-to-day viewing as the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.850 
slightly for day-to-day viewing as the
brightness<00:03:35.660> can<00:03:35.810> be<00:03:35.870> too<00:03:36.019> bright<00:03:36.290> on<00:03:36.470> default

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
brightness can be too bright on default

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.670 
brightness can be too bright on default
settings<00:03:37.250> I<00:03:37.810> really<00:03:38.810> like<00:03:38.989> this<00:03:39.140> new<00:03:39.350> design
