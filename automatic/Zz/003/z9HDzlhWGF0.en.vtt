another<00:01:12.960> feature<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.380> liked<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> cable<00:01:14.400> as

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
another feature I liked was the cable as

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
another feature I liked was the cable as
opposed<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> rubberized<00:01:16.500> cord<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.580> Kinzua

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
opposed to a rubberized cord the Kinzua

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.570 
opposed to a rubberized cord the Kinzua
uses<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> braided<00:01:19.020> design<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.740> reduce<00:01:19.860> tangles

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
uses a braided design to reduce tangles

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.300 
uses a braided design to reduce tangles
and<00:01:20.790> increase<00:01:21.090> durability<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.860> length<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and increase durability the length of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.820 
and increase durability the length of
the<00:01:23.430> cable<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.850> 2<00:01:24.090> meters<00:01:24.500> great<00:01:25.500> if<00:01:25.650> your

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the cable is 2 meters great if your

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.499 
the cable is 2 meters great if your
computer<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.369> hard<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> reach<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.360> we've

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
computer is hard to reach so we've

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.060 
computer is hard to reach so we've
talked<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> good<00:01:28.200> points<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:28.890> what

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
talked about the good points but what

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.140 
talked about the good points but what
about<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> negatives

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
about the negatives

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.600 
about the negatives
well<00:01:30.659> first<00:01:31.020> off<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.500> build<00:01:31.829> quality<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.280> not

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
well first off the build quality is not

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850

plastic<00:01:35.070> which<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> say<00:01:36.299> feels<00:01:36.630> rather

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
plastic which I have to say feels rather

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.179 
plastic which I have to say feels rather
cheap<00:01:39.200> disappointingly<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.619> functionality

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
cheap disappointingly the functionality

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.910 
cheap disappointingly the functionality
is<00:01:41.280> basic<00:01:42.259> although<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
is basic although this is one of the

cheaper<00:01:44.280> gaming<00:01:44.579> peripherals

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310

the Kinzua still likes buttons and modes

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.330 
the Kinzua still likes buttons and modes
