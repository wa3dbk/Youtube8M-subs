is doing an experimental procedure that

is doing an experimental procedure that
can<00:00:54.629> help<00:00:54.719> retrain<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.469> eye<00:00:55.500> muscles<00:00:55.829> making

can help retrain the eye muscles making
people<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.789> Peggy<00:00:57.090> hopefully<00:00:57.840> never<00:00:58.590> need

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
people like Peggy hopefully never need

the<00:01:01.230> show<00:01:03.229> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.409> an<00:01:04.530> experimental

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the show this is an experimental

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
the show this is an experimental
procedure<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> doing<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.900> how<00:01:07.020> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
procedure what are you doing and how is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.750 
procedure what are you doing and how is
it<00:01:07.229> affecting<00:01:07.530> someone<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.310> Peggy's<00:01:08.610> eyes

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it affecting someone like Peggy's eyes

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.660 
it affecting someone like Peggy's eyes
the<00:01:09.150> first<00:01:09.390> step<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:11.189> peel

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the first step that we do is we peel

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
the first step that we do is we peel
back<00:01:11.700> very<00:01:12.360> delicately<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.140> outer<00:01:13.260> membrane

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
back very delicately the outer membrane

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.760 
back very delicately the outer membrane
over<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.939> eye<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.990> doesn't<00:01:16.409> cover<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
over the eye and it doesn't cover the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.910 
over the eye and it doesn't cover the
skin<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.880> white<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.240> eye<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
skin it's just the white of the eye and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.240 
skin it's just the white of the eye and
the<00:01:19.920> second<00:01:20.280> step<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.759> make<00:01:21.350> four<00:01:22.350> little

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the second step is make four little

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
the second step is make four little
tunnels<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:28.280> different<00:01:29.280> segments<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
tunnels here in different segments and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
tunnels here in different segments and
then<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:32.579> third<00:01:32.880> step<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.930> take<00:01:34.579> these

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
then the third step is we take these

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.620 
then the third step is we take these
four<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.960> tiny<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:37.920> implants<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.850> we

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
four very tiny little implants and we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
four very tiny little implants and we
insert<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.259> into<00:01:40.590> each<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.130> these<00:01:41.250> tunnels

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
insert them into each of these tunnels

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.840 
insert them into each of these tunnels
around<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:43.290> these<00:01:43.799> implants<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.640> said

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
around and these implants like I said

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.780 
around and these implants like I said
they're<00:01:45.030> very<00:01:45.060> tiny<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.430> here

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
they're very tiny you can see one here

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
they're very tiny you can see one here
it's<00:01:47.939> about<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> size<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> grain<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> rice

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it's about the size of a grain of rice

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
it's about the size of a grain of rice
and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> implants<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.600> though<00:01:51.869> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and then what the implants do though is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.560 
and then what the implants do though is
that<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.710> delicately<00:01:53.579> lift<00:01:53.970> up<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that they delicately lift up on the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.630 
that they delicately lift up on the
outer<00:01:55.200> layer<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.829> eye<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> white<00:01:56.310> part<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
outer layer of the eye the white part of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.880 
outer layer of the eye the white part of
the<00:01:56.700> eye<00:01:56.790> called<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> sclera<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.500> allows

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the eye called the sclera that allows

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.030 
the eye called the sclera that allows
the<00:01:59.250> muscles<00:01:59.820> underneath<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:01.290> focus<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.920> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the muscles underneath to focus on the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
the muscles underneath to focus on the
internal<00:02:02.399> lens<00:02:02.790> again<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.780> focusing<00:02:04.229> a

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
internal lens again like focusing a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.469 
internal lens again like focusing a
