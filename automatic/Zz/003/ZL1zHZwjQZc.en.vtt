I<00:02:32.810> see<00:02:33.810> how<00:02:33.870> long<00:02:34.079> it's<00:02:34.290> been<00:02:34.379> from<00:02:35.340> few

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
I see how long it's been from few

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.660 
I see how long it's been from few
minutes<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.510> 36<00:02:37.140> seconds<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.859> far<00:02:38.159> it's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
minutes and 36 seconds so far it's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
minutes and 36 seconds so far it's
probably<00:02:39.000> gonna<00:02:39.150> take<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.450> minute<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.019> you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
probably gonna take a minute so you

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.110 
probably gonna take a minute so you
should<00:02:40.469> hold<00:02:41.569> still<00:02:43.519> it's<00:02:44.519> quite<00:02:44.819> slow

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
should hold still it's quite slow
