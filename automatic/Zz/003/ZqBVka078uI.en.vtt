00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 hello I'm meta bartek this is my first video I tell him today he talked about the 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.990
 legends of videogames let's start may tyson pucha aut we start with a 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.899
 game of need madonna and tyson puncha oct 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:15.239
 the legend tells that if you press the button be when there are 1 m 30 s left in 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.560
 the second round 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.740
 Mario appears with a gun and shoots tyson in the face 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.849
 obviously this rumor is false 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.140
 Nintendo would never allow something like this to see the light as it would damage the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.060
 picture of your pet 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.759
 polybius the ark that erases the memory and causes nightmares there is a legend 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.310
 mysterious around this game which appeared in a few sites of 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.130
 porlamar egon in the early 80's 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.020
 attributed to a company called sines the 100 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.830
 polybius is a puzzle game whose legend tells that it can cause 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.190
 nightmares and memory losses to players 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.630
 unfortunately there is no unit of this arcade machine 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.150
 it is rumored that there is some theft with the game but it has not been 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.330
 localized 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.380
 the only thing that remains is the dot screen title I think it is some 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.070
 government project they do not want us to know bokun from killing the dog in 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.630
 this other classic of the month 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.280
 the document also spread a hoax that the dog could be killed if 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.480
 it was shooting at just the right moment 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.490
 but as much as you shoot the dog will keep laughing at you every time he does not 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 you hit the ducks 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.200
 the strict rare hayter when the arcade machine rooms were a 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.330
 profitable business 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.100
 not like now that the only machines that give money are the slots 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 talking to friends, stories about machines that were the same in the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.140
 that the game was something different 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.240
 In many cases, this was favored by the owners' tax collection 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.270
 of the salons who had gotten into the configuration panel and 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.840
 they had increased the difficulty to get the quarters 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.870
 players in a faster way 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.350
 especially effective when the machines were new and formed 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.330
 queues but leaving the difficulty increases apart 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.510
 Once a machine appeared that again had nothing 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.970
 a strict more hayter 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.010
 some said after playing the debord warriors and the champion edition 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.260
 but none of that 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.459
 this machine was completely different 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.239
 known as the strict hayter second campion edition rainbow 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.129
 this game is one of the original title of capcom to which are added some 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.779
 many rather strange novelties but that add a plus of emotion and 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.949
 fun to a game that many of us had very trite 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:28.109
 magics are better many fighters have agok hens these are 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.139
 airships and we can have several at the same time on screen 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.549
 the game moved much faster than the original ark 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:41.049
 you could change players during the game by pressing the player 1 key 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.169
 possibility of launching almost any type of attack in the air 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:45.849
 etc 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.900
 the playstation of sony and nintendo at the beginning of the 90s the esm is 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.330
 led the 16 bit market 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.290
 maintaining a tough rivalry with the sega megadrive and to a lesser extent with 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.919
 the turbo gas espenak 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.230
 at that time the word multimedia sounded in the future 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.959
 and it was thought that the company that endows its system with the capacity 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.510
 of playing cds could reach the leadership without disheveled 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:13.239
 thus began one of the toughest marketing battles in the history of 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.499
 the videogames 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.689
 The magazines in the sector were filled with news that did nothing more than create 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.449
 increase the expectation of the users 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.589
 the turbo cd of metco he is done since sega promised games with better 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:26.349
 graphics 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.450
 a film sound and a duration never seen to date 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.479
 and nintendo 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.209
 Well, as a good foresight, I had an ace up my sleeve for a long time 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:40.219
 when the super nintendo was just a prototype signed an agreement with sony 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.299
 to use its sound processor and various components in manufacturing 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.469
 of your console and in the case that this discussion is given a cd unit 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.059
 sony would be in charge of manufacturing the 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:52.040
 on the other hand 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.319
 Sony reserved the right to market a video game console 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.679
 compatible with the games of the 16 bits of nintendo and with the super cd 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:00.639
 so that 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.909
 sony and nintendo presented by hand the reading unit of cd s for the super 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.909
 nintendo under the name esm esplai station proyect 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.869
 but this agreement between the two Japanese companies put at a disadvantage 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.479
 to nintendo 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.500
 many things had changed in recent years 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.870
 and the super nintendo held a very enviable position in the market 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.170
 in the case of taking the contract out nintendo would depend on sony for 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.350
 the manufacture of lesmes cd and on the other hand sony could launch their own 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.560
 compatible console 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.560
 planted face on the field at 16 bits of nintendo 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.889
 there were also discussions regarding the format of the cd to be used 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.490
 nintendo came scalding from the consoles and pirate cartridges of the 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.509
 time of the month 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.849
 and I wanted to develop a very secure system 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.759
 so he asked sony for a 580 megawatt CD coated with a casing 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:51.580
 plastic 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.810
 where there would be a memory chip of 54 kilos ballets to save the 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.789
 games 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.029
 are already on the other hand I was not willing to use CDs that did not respect their 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:02.289
 standard format 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.819
 then the negotiations between both companies broke and nintendo 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:11.009
 left zombie side to negotiate with filipe is the creation of lesmes cd 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.099
 between both companies would reach an agreement by which filip would develop 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.819
 the reader and it would be compatible with your future cd console and also 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.780
 would have some of the best licenses of the big n as a cell and 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:23.520
 Mario 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.560
 but nevertheless 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.590
 sony would not sit idly by while watching as nintendo and filip 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.919
 they distributed their cake 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.940
 and took nintendo to court for breach of contract 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.050
 to end all this soap opera 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.740
 The three companies finally reached an agreement to develop 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.949
 joint reading unit 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.189
 when launching seemed imminent and even a price had been set 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.349
 exit 299 dollars suddenly everything went to nothing and nobody returned to remove 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:52.479
 the topic 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.909
 the sega cd and the turbo cd did not achieve the success they expected 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.520
 the fx chip endowed the games with an attractive polygonal graphic appearance 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.969
 three companies were sharing the profits so 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.180
 he played less for beard 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.060
 even though the esm exceeded it never came out 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.129
 they are already learned everything they needed from the best teacher 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.259
 and used the technology developed to immediately launch its market 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.759
 Play Station 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.990
 nintendo was a little off the hook on the one hand had lost too much 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.580
 time on the cd lesmes project and on the other the virtual boy system turned out to be 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.659
 a failure 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:34.379
 between one thing and another, he did not react in time by launching a 32-piece video game console 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.819
 bits 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.819
 and by the time he got his homework ready with the nintendo 64 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:40.389
 sony already dominated the market 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.210
 this is all for today subscribe promptly commented there were more legends 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.639
 goodbye
