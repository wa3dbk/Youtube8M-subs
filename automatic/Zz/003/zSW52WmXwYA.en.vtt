00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.350
 hi to all his sales with youtube 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.550
 hours that do not take the head 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
 how are you me I'm fine 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
 so today a challenge a challenge on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 black ops a challenge on the map 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.170
 redact a challenge that will give you some thread to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 twists I think you'll say 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.710
 but super simple this challenge and then 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.570
 finally you will start once 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.130
 you will redo two more times 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.250
 to the east rage and 1 you are going rage and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.350
 like on the multi here I'm kidding so 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 that's all is just a small 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.200
 challenge will get me ready so you have 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 obviously go to the basketball court 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 everyone suspecting it will take 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.120
 play with a ball so with the little 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.500
 emme d'arvida reflex you will put 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.239
 a bompas basket am here because i have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.980
 been zero but you will put a basket 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.870
 there is a chrono that leaves I'm told 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.219
 what is this chrono ok ok on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.230
 change of in exchange of weapons we take your 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.160
 45th now we take his ball on 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.600
 balloon that went into the basket 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.829
 obviously he is made to mount 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.420
 stairs then we're not going to do that we 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.699
 would go around the map on 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.820
 as quickly as possible so I you I 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.110
 you say the heap 45 and is great 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.939
 to do to advance the ball 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.110
 I find it makes him leave far from 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.090
 anyway if you take another 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.460
 weapon this will not be counted as 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.549
 the challenge that the challenge is with these 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 trees before we go to cut you to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.939
 their hosts at 45 at the n10 all that 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.560
 you want to see you the way is 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.110
 plot so you have to go from behind 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.000
 the little rock there behind here we 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.080
 pass behind the roundabout in false steps 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 this sheet like me you will see 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.490
 I easily lose 20 seconds that I 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.220
 tell you this challenge is beatable from wide 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.680
 from very very wide ago they already 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.240
 have already beaten me elsewhere so here is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.579
 just not a little challenge for 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.740
 change two of the +100 kg to change 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.270
 carnage to change from the multi 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.890
 simply you have solo like 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.049
 it partly customized more you 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.040
 are quiet or wander or pro you 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.020
 enjoy the map 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.509
 you even have pretty cars there 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.950
 as you finally see short so what 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.149
 I propose in this video it's 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.520
 just trying to beat me 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.740
 valves this challenge is to tell your time 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.450
 in the comments if you want 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.460
 to register your service 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.049
 well you there we wanted to record you 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.759
 put a little time for those who 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.960
 do not know that with sony vegas pro that I 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.970
 do it it's called time code 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.250
 at the level select your your band 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.900
 video then you put sony timecode that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.380
 will put everything all alone if you cut at 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.780
 good place 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.910
 So the time trial course of 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.410
 moment that the balloon pierced the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.110
 nets I want to say do very 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.790
 attention to the water it besides not only to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.140
 water if you start beating too much 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.120
 against a wall the balloon will disappear 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.230
 as much as it will disappear in the water I 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.250
 you say it you started again quite a bit 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.780
 many times but once you have them 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.490
 to succeed to the very happy like me 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.990

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.240
 minute 44 and 15 hundredths 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.850
