about<00:03:53.640> throwing<00:03:54.270> bars<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.750> bike<00:03:54.930> for<00:03:54.959> just

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
about throwing bars on the bike for just

about throwing bars on the bike for just
this<00:03:55.620> almost<00:03:55.950> data<00:03:56.400> stuff<00:03:56.990> no<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.020> think<00:03:58.260> if<00:03:58.530> we

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
this almost data stuff no I think if we

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.710 
this almost data stuff no I think if we
give<00:03:58.830> them<00:03:58.920> enough<00:03:59.130> muscle<00:03:59.340> milk<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.970> cut

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
give them enough muscle milk and cut

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.710 
give them enough muscle milk and cut
back<00:04:00.930> on<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.200> fries<00:04:01.440> for<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:01.800> little<00:04:02.010> bit

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
it's a big expense going racing when you

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.080 
it's a big expense going racing when you
have<00:04:09.570> you<00:04:09.750> know<00:04:09.870> 10<00:04:10.680> 12<00:04:11.040> people<00:04:11.400> on<00:04:11.520> here<00:04:11.760> your
