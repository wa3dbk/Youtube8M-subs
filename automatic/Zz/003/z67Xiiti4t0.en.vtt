00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
want to start with is a for this size I

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.930 
want to start with is a for this size I
used<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.850> four<00:00:43.510> inch<00:00:44.760> circle<00:00:45.840> Styrofoam<00:00:46.840> ball

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
used a four inch circle Styrofoam ball

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.040 
used a four inch circle Styrofoam ball
so<00:00:48.940> that's<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.930> four<00:00:53.470> inch<00:00:53.680> Styrofoam<00:00:54.460> ball<00:00:54.670> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
so that's the four inch Styrofoam ball I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.609 
so that's the four inch Styrofoam ball I
cut<00:00:56.050> that<00:00:56.260> in<00:00:56.470> half<00:00:56.500> and<00:01:00.750> then<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:03.430> covered<00:01:04.030> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
cut that in half and then I covered that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.139 
cut that in half and then I covered that
with<00:01:05.619> some<00:01:06.600> rhinestone<00:01:07.600> mesh<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:09.729> cut

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
with some rhinestone mesh so I cut

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.389 
with some rhinestone mesh so I cut
rhinestone<00:01:10.960> mesh<00:01:11.290> into<00:01:11.649> strips<00:01:12.100> like<00:01:12.250> this

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
rhinestone mesh into strips like this

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:21.350 
rhinestone mesh into strips like this
and<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:14.729> glued<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:17.100> around<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.580> half<00:01:18.970> circle

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and I glued it around the half circle

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.450 
and I glued it around the half circle
once<00:01:22.360> I<00:01:22.600> did<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:23.560> took<00:01:24.520> some<00:01:25.050> e6000<00:01:26.050> glue

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
once I did that I took some e6000 glue

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.150 
once I did that I took some e6000 glue
and<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.800> started<00:01:29.800> attaching<00:01:31.649> rings<00:01:32.649> like

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
and I started attaching rings like

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.800 
and I started attaching rings like
rhinestone<00:01:33.789> type<00:01:34.180> of<00:01:34.360> reins<00:01:34.770> onto<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:37.119> half<00:01:37.600> a

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
rhinestone type of reins onto the half a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.719 
rhinestone type of reins onto the half a
circle<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:40.000> like<00:01:40.659> if<00:01:40.810> you<00:01:40.930> look<00:01:41.140> closely<00:01:41.729> you

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
circle and like if you look closely you

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.380 
circle and like if you look closely you
can<00:01:42.760> see<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.150> mesh<00:01:43.540> in<00:01:43.810> between<00:01:44.940> but<00:01:45.940> I<00:01:46.000> try<00:01:46.330> to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
can see the mesh in between but I try to

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.840 
can see the mesh in between but I try to
cover<00:01:46.780> up<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.470> know<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:48.010> majority<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:48.700> so

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
cover up you know the majority of it so

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.149 
cover up you know the majority of it so
you<00:01:48.909> really<00:01:49.450> can't<00:01:49.720> see<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:53.799> did<00:01:53.920> is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
you really can't see it so what I did is

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.620 
you really can't see it so what I did is
I<00:01:54.280> just<00:01:54.310> took<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.740> round<00:01:57.040> part<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.880> goes

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
I just took the the round part that goes

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.440 
I just took the the round part that goes
onto<00:01:58.900> your<00:01:59.170> finger<00:01:59.590> off<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.580> range<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:01.180> took

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
onto your finger off the range I took

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.050 
onto your finger off the range I took
that<00:02:01.570> off<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.960> ring<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.560> then<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:02.830> just<00:02:03.130> took

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
that off the ring and then I just took

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.249 
that off the ring and then I just took
some<00:02:04.119> e6000<00:02:05.110> glue<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.729> glued<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.909> on<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
some e6000 glue and glued it on to the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.140 
some e6000 glue and glued it on to the
ball

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.350 

and<00:02:14.269> then<00:02:15.080> what<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.069> did<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.730> made<00:02:17.030> this

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
and then what I did is I made this

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.440 
and then what I did is I made this
little<00:02:17.750> flower<00:02:18.470> feather<00:02:19.129> type<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.819> thing

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
little flower feather type of thing

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.330 
little flower feather type of thing
and<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:22.540> put<00:02:23.540> another<00:02:24.050> ring<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.860> inside<00:02:25.310> of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and I put another ring in the inside of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.130 
and I put another ring in the inside of
that<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:29.060> haven't<00:02:29.269> even<00:02:29.480> attached<00:02:29.900> this

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
that and I haven't even attached this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140 
that and I haven't even attached this
yet<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.739> this<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.220> how<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:31.519> would<00:02:31.760> look<00:02:31.940> without

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
yet so this is how I would look without

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.589 
yet so this is how I would look without
it<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.549> that's<00:02:34.549> how<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.790> look<00:02:35.120> if<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.900> put<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.709> on

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
it and that's how to look if I put it on

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.780 
it and that's how to look if I put it on
the<00:02:38.599> next<00:02:38.930> thing<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.379> am<00:02:39.410> going<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.160> do<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.610> this

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
the next thing I am going to do to this

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.160 
the next thing I am going to do to this
is<00:02:41.150> I'm<00:02:42.049> going<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.470> add<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.580> letter<00:02:43.849> J<00:02:44.739> and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
is I'm going to add the letter J and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.800 
is I'm going to add the letter J and
this<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.349> how<00:02:48.530> it's<00:02:48.829> looking<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.430> far<00:02:49.780> what<00:02:50.780> I

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
this is how it's looking so far what I

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.210 
this is how it's looking so far what I
did<00:02:51.049> is<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.380> took<00:02:51.410> some<00:02:53.260> what<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.560> called

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
did is I took some what is it called

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.210 
did is I took some what is it called
like<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:56.019> chipboard<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:58.269> I<00:03:00.040> cut<00:03:01.040> out<00:03:01.069> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
like a chipboard and I cut out the

letter J did I print it off of my
computer<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:05.680> then<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.799> painted<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
computer and then I painted the

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.550 
computer and then I painted the
chipboard<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.959> gray<00:03:09.379> color<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:12.019> far<00:03:12.319> what

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
chipboard the gray color and so far what

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.600 
chipboard the gray color and so far what
I've<00:03:12.709> done<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.430> attached<00:03:14.180> for<00:03:14.959> rains<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:16.400> it

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610
