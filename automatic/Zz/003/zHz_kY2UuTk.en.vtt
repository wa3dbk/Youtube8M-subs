00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.290
 of how much that with a key on May 19th 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.290
 we find leather 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.629
 good if African brake discs 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.430
 de fra the elements that we are going 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.050
 replace is here so to remove 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.790
 the brake pads you need everything 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.739
 first insert a screw turn so 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:01.050
 to remove the piston with a slight 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.579
 pressure on the wafer we see that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.579
 the president returns to his home 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.350
 a pollution the stirrup to finish off 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.350
 push the piston to its stop 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.430
 here are pistons in his place then we 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.370
 let's proceed to the removal of this screw 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.660
 here with a key of 13 and a cons and 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.660
 crew is a key to 17 years 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.550
 we remove all alone 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.950
 then I give myself the plate is equipped 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.630
 a brake indicator or disconnecting it 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:04.650
 says if I do not welcome the qualities 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:10.830
 here disconnect me we say if okay 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:15.670
 then we get up we move on and here 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.190
 then we get up and shout as well 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.700
 Brake pad with a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.230
 screwdriver 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.230
 I will drop it 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:32.540
 the outside of the coi to come out is 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:39.380
 a little hard is done here it's mostly 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:43.310
 your good here we saw the thickness he 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.730
 no longer round to yes almost safe because 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.730
 he sees there 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.500
 it was time to change them indeed 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.500
 it 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:04.250
 then we take the pads 9 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:06.830
 we reiterate here here and not easy from 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.099
 all the same fright at the level of the 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.099
 garnish 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.720
 to see that England is well known 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.160
 why we do to go well 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.130
 platelet because there given that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.710
 platelets 9 l of the paint and the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.040
 painting a thick 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.850
 it comes in a little bit take away 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.120
 some wafers see we do everything 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.459
 only 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.459
 according to the manufacturer the plate model 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.820
 that's it but all the same time goal is 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.070
 so be careful because its 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:54.140
 ears when I closed well 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:57.840
 positioned so it does not go through the hole 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.560
 then george usap supported because they 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.500

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:12.180
