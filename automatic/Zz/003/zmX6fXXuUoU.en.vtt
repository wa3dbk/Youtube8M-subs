00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.809
 some more words about the initiative 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.369
 governor of the Stavropol Territory 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.410
 which is supported by the government 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 Medvedev about so to speak tightening the rules 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.060
 and in regards to 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.450
 personal subsidiary farms what is its essence 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.020
 they consider it necessary to install 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.010
 hard frames by quantity 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.210
 manufactured products 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.360
 Protective in personal subsidiary farms 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:50.250
 but we need to see that federal law 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.640
 and why he passed a federal law on 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.710
 private farms 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.260
 stipulates that produced in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.949
 private farms products are not 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.619
 so to speak in essence is 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:12.020
 property here so to speak owner 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.299
 personal farm and here is one 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.280
 activities that are carried out at 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.970
 production it is not 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.140
 business activities and not 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.430
 subject to taxation here 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.659
 the only restriction 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:36.570
 this is so to say the size of the area he 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.770
 installed half a sector of land no more than half 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.670
 Paul Victor 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.060
 but so to speak subjects of the federation can 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.579
 increase this rate by 5 1 to 2 s 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.579
 half a hectare but 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 agricultural producers right now 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.600
 many who got land 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:07.770
 they would like to work not within 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.289
 federal law there worldly 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.270
 farms and within 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.830
 personal farm 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:22.550
 that is to develop well as they say 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.550
 production without but those taxes that 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.590
 have a place in peasant farmers 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.590
 farms need to say that the peasant 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.570
 and our farms 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.080
 domestic and farm enterprises 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.490
 foreign countries 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.140
 well let's say Finland subsidies in them 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:52.670
 composition reach 80 percent in commodity 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.630
 products and our farms 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.510
 virtually no such subsidies and 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.630
 grow farm 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.800
 essentially starting a start is best 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.710
 just like a private farm 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.300
 quietly gained technology technology 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:18.630
 we are the material base and on like this 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.570
 say you can increase the area here is how 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.670
 This was done in the Stavropol Territory 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:28.500
 Well, the problem is this 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.959
 why set the task this one 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.540
 governor of the Stavropol Territory 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:39.870
 I think she is very well mercantile for 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.110
 so that â€™s how it leads 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.540
 there are 15 thousand hectares 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.709
 rather 15 thousand heads of large 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.770
 cattle large areas so 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.000
 say they all work within 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:59.280
 federal law on personal subsidiary 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.580
 farm manager it can lead 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.310
 its norms so worth offering 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.780
 private farm in 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.850
 according to those volumes 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.560
 production translate them into frames 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.560
 peasant farm or 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.709
 ordinary enterprise 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.490
 agricultural is not complicated 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:29.490
 question and he sets the task to enter 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:32.910
 let's say no more than 5 cows will go on 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.810
 how many rabbits are there to keep 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.590
 kurt keep how many ostriches keep then 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.830
 there is this process but we rate it as 10 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:47.760
 clear this question in the framework of the current 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:52.880
 legislation quite solvable and won 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:55.760
 the governor is just like that 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.460
 a proposal which is supported by the cop 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.700
 it is not clear why the government 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.680
 Medvedev then showed his treasury as 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.380
 states incompetence in these 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.410
 issues within the current 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.410
 legislation 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.680
 legally personal subsidiary farm 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.140
 the law on peasant farmers 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.390
 farms and farms these are all 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:25.850
 questions are solved and do not need to enter 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.850
 here are these wild limits
