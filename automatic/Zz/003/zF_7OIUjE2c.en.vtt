single-use camera is a camera meant to

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.500 
single-use camera is a camera meant to
be<00:00:16.920> used<00:00:17.010> once<00:00:17.220> only<00:00:17.609> once<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:18.240> give<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
be used once only once you give the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.570 
be used once only once you give the
entire<00:00:18.720> camera<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> lab<00:00:19.580> they'll

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
entire camera to the lab they'll

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.210 
entire camera to the lab they'll
disassemble<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.410> take<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> film<00:00:22.769> print<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
disassemble it take the film print it

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.880 
disassemble it take the film print it
out<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.380> yeah<00:00:25.380> because<00:00:25.590> basically

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
out for you and yeah because basically

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.920 
out for you and yeah because basically
it<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.519> thought<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.420> myself

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it I thought that myself

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.189 
it I thought that myself
these<00:00:28.109> disposable<00:00:28.560> cameras<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.760> reused

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
these disposable cameras can be reused

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.959 
these disposable cameras can be reused
they're<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> cheaper<00:00:31.920> way<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.880> an

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
they're a cheaper way to have an

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.160 
they're a cheaper way to have an
artistic<00:00:33.270> shot<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.630> always<00:00:33.930> thought<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
artistic shot I always thought that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.690 
artistic shot I always thought that
maybe<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.770> could<00:00:34.980> turn<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.430> into<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
maybe I could turn this into a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.240 
maybe I could turn this into a
lomography<00:00:36.239> camera<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:37.559> does<00:00:37.829> not<00:00:37.980> give

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
lomography camera but it does not give

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.850 
lomography camera but it does not give
you<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.719> vignette<00:00:39.719> thing<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> side<00:00:40.649> our

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
you that vignette thing on the side our

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
you that vignette thing on the side our
saturation<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.820> no<00:00:42.059> mission<00:00:42.480> failed<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
saturation so no mission failed on the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.410 
saturation so no mission failed on the
low<00:00:43.110> moon<00:00:43.700> but<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.930> upside<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.890> cheap

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
low moon but the upside is it's cheap

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.729 
low moon but the upside is it's cheap
it's<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.660> cheap<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.140> does<00:00:49.320> take<00:00:49.530> these

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it's very cheap and it does take these

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.910 
it's very cheap and it does take these
pictures<00:00:51.140> especially<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> friend
