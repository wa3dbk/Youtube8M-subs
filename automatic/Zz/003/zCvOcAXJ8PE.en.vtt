and once we login we are connected now

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.580 
and once we login we are connected now
go<00:01:22.479> next<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.710> now<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:24.819> going<00:01:24.969> to<00:01:25.090> try<00:01:25.450> to

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
go next and now it's going to try to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.309 
go next and now it's going to try to
connect<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.710> device<00:01:27.009> but<00:01:27.399> we<00:01:27.939> are<00:01:28.509> not<00:01:28.869> going

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
connect the device but we are not going

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.230 
connect the device but we are not going
to<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:30.219> we're<00:01:30.399> just<00:01:30.429> going<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.700> go<00:01:30.819> away<00:01:30.969> from

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
to so we're just going to go away from

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.480 
to so we're just going to go away from
that<00:01:36.929> now<00:01:37.929> let's<00:01:38.380> just<00:01:38.560> go<00:01:38.770> out<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:39.069> that<00:01:39.219> well

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.289 
that now let's just go out of that well
skip<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.819> for<00:01:39.969> now<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.640> would<00:01:43.000> of

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
skip that for now and then you would of

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.050 
skip that for now and then you would of
course<00:01:43.569> activate<00:01:44.530> your<00:01:44.829> Google<00:01:45.399> account<00:01:45.759> so

we're<00:01:46.329> just<00:01:46.359> going<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:46.750> do<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:47.250> again<00:01:48.250> this

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
we're just going to do that again this

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.249 
we're just going to do that again this
might<00:01:48.640> vary<00:01:48.880> from<00:01:49.060> carrier<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.599> carrier<00:01:50.020> that

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
might vary from carrier to carrier that

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.319 
might vary from carrier to carrier that
activation<00:01:50.739> part<00:01:51.099> may<00:01:51.280> come<00:01:51.520> later<00:01:51.759> it<00:01:52.119> may

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
activation part may come later it may

00:01:52.329 --> 00:02:11.150 
activation part may come later it may
come<00:01:52.569> before<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:53.349> just<00:01:53.649> bear<00:01:53.860> with<00:01:54.069> that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.940 

and<00:02:11.870> then<00:02:12.870> once<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.200> sign<00:02:13.440> into<00:02:13.800> your<00:02:13.890> Google

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
and that can take a bit of time as you

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.790 
and that can take a bit of time as you
can<00:02:24.360> see

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.240 

and<00:02:33.040> now<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:33.850> get<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.600> name<00:02:35.260> our<00:02:35.560> device<00:02:35.920> so
