00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
alright this is one of our traps haven't

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.150 
alright this is one of our traps haven't
been<00:00:12.780> using<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.230> much<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.740> got<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> little

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
been using it much so we got a little

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.289 
been using it much so we got a little
bit<00:00:14.250> grown<00:00:14.460> up<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.940> but<00:00:14.969> we're<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.210> to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
bit grown up in it but we're going to

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.320 
bit grown up in it but we're going to
show<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.540> how<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:15.929> trigger<00:00:16.199> design<00:00:16.590> works

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
show you how this trigger design works

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.769 
show you how this trigger design works
alright<00:00:18.330> now<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.570> door<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.350> jammed<00:00:19.800> up

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
alright now the door is just jammed up

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.790 
alright now the door is just jammed up
we're<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> get<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.260> here<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.529> show<00:00:22.740> you

we're going to get in here and show you
how<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.100> trigger<00:00:24.060> design<00:00:24.420> works<00:00:24.720> if<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.019> was

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
how the trigger design works if I was

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
how the trigger design works if I was
building<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.529> trap<00:00:25.769> today<00:00:25.949> I'd<00:00:26.310> build<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> pin<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
building a trap today I'd build a pin a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.040 
building a trap today I'd build a pin a
lot<00:00:27.779> larger<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.660> door<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
lot larger but this is a good door to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.660 
lot larger but this is a good door to
use<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.529> want<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> build<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.460> your<00:00:33.090> own

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
use if you want to build it on your own

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.010 
use if you want to build it on your own
basically<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:35.850> we've<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.809> just

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
basically what we've got here you just

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.750 
basically what we've got here you just
got<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.350> we've<00:00:37.500> got<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> design<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> lets

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
got it we've got a design here that lets

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.240 
got it we've got a design here that lets
this<00:00:38.940> door<00:00:40.129> slide<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.579> down<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:43.160> it's<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
this door slide up and down I it's a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790 
this door slide up and down I it's a
half<00:00:44.489> inch<00:00:44.789> sheet<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.780> plywood<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.620> don't

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
half inch sheet of plywood you don't

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
half inch sheet of plywood you don't
need<00:00:46.980> anything<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:47.579> strong<00:00:48.230> or<00:00:49.230> any

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
need anything very strong or any

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.020 
need anything very strong or any
stronger<00:00:49.739> than<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> Hogs<00:00:50.579> will<00:00:50.670> try<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
stronger than that the Hogs will try to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.490 
stronger than that the Hogs will try to
get<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.420> through<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> fence<00:00:52.079> they're<00:00:52.320> not

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
get out through the fence they're not

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.380 
get out through the fence they're not
going<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:53.039> through<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:54.770> through<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> door

website alright what we have is our door
design<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.760> our<00:01:06.659> trigger<00:01:07.070> these<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.250> two

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
design and our trigger these are two

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.380 
design and our trigger these are two
boards<00:01:09.470> it's<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.340> board<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
boards it's really just one board it's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.020 
boards it's really just one board it's
been<00:01:12.570> sawed<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.229> half<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.280> they're

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
been sawed in half right here they're

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.010 
been sawed in half right here they're
sitting<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.509> down<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:16.080> you've<00:01:16.920> got<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:18.020> string

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
sitting in down in you've got a string

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740 
sitting in down in you've got a string
attached<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.880> we'll<00:01:21.360> look<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
attached right here so we'll look at the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.960 
attached right here so we'll look at the
trigger<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.740> moment<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.520> when<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> hog

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
trigger in a moment but when the hog

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.160 
trigger in a moment but when the hog
steps<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> trigger

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
steps on the trigger

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.149 
steps on the trigger
it<00:01:25.890> puts<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.880> pull<00:01:27.650> it<00:01:28.650> dislodges

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
it puts just a little pull it dislodges

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.410 
it puts just a little pull it dislodges
these<00:01:29.670> two<00:01:30.560> two<00:01:31.560> boards<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
these two two boards right here and the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.330 
these two two boards right here and the
door<00:01:33.630> falls<00:01:34.009> real<00:01:35.009> simple<00:01:35.540> wah<00:01:39.860> all<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.070> our

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
door falls real simple wah all right our

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:50.590 
door falls real simple wah all right our
string<00:01:41.759> goes<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.579> down<00:01:44.579> your<00:01:45.240> trigger

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.850 

sometimes<00:01:51.600> what<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> also<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.560> put<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> couple

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
sometimes what I also do is put a couple

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.270 
sometimes what I also do is put a couple
of<00:01:53.220> sticks<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.850> under<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.960> board<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
of sticks up under this board just to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.910 
of sticks up under this board just to
hold<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.030> little<00:01:57.270> bit<00:01:57.360> better<00:01:57.710> put<00:01:58.710> some

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
hold it up a little bit better put some

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.789 
hold it up a little bit better put some
corn<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.460> top<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.560> want<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
corn on top of here you don't want to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.969 
corn on top of here you don't want to
make<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.039> too<00:02:02.220> easy<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.970> set<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.450> off

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
make it too easy for them to set it off

but just enough where there's a little

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.999 
but just enough where there's a little
bit<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:06.570> tension<00:02:06.869> BAM

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
bit of tension BAM
