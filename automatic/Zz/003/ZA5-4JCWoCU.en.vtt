00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
gonna fold this over and that's why I

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.880 
gonna fold this over and that's why I
doubled<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.080> why<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.260> doubled<00:03:05.799> it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
doubled this this is why I doubled it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.050

these<00:04:54.330> lines<00:04:54.690> it's<00:04:55.199> gonna<00:04:55.410> go<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.590> little<00:04:55.770> bit

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
these lines it's gonna go a little bit

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.350 
these lines it's gonna go a little bit
faster<00:04:56.310> basically<00:04:56.820> I'm<00:04:57.570> doing<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.990> same

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
faster basically I'm doing the same

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.120 
faster basically I'm doing the same
repeating<00:05:00.380> for<00:05:01.380> peak<00:05:01.650> of<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.970> neck<00:05:04.130> finding

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
this is the final product of my

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.360 
this is the final product of my
sweatshirt<00:05:35.340> we<00:05:35.699> fashioned

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
sweatshirt we fashioned

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.850 

one<00:05:39.370> thing<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.850> would<00:05:39.970> probably<00:05:40.690> change<00:05:41.200> for

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
one thing that would probably change for

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.710 
one thing that would probably change for
my<00:05:42.010> next<00:05:42.280> refashion<00:05:42.970> if<00:05:43.120> I'm<00:05:43.300> going<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.570> use

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
my next refashion if I'm going to use

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.870 
my next refashion if I'm going to use
like<00:05:45.270> this<00:05:46.270> fabric<00:05:46.810> isn't<00:05:47.320> made<00:05:48.130> for

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
like this fabric isn't made for

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.480 
like this fabric isn't made for
stability<00:05:49.630> it's<00:05:49.870> very<00:05:50.110> flexible<00:05:51.040> and

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
stability it's very flexible and

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.390 
stability it's very flexible and
infeasible<00:05:51.970> so<00:05:52.600> what<00:05:53.590> I<00:05:53.620> would<00:05:53.919> do<00:05:54.100> for<00:05:54.340> my

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
infeasible so what I would do for my

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.040 
infeasible so what I would do for my
next<00:05:54.940> one<00:05:55.090> I'm<00:05:55.360> just<00:05:55.510> looking<00:05:55.840> at<00:05:55.930> in<00:05:55.990> the

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
next one I'm just looking at in the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.960 
next one I'm just looking at in the
camera<00:05:56.410> what<00:05:56.620> I<00:05:56.650> would<00:05:56.860> do<00:05:57.040> for<00:05:57.220> my<00:05:57.340> next<00:05:57.639> one<00:05:57.760> I

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
camera what I would do for my next one I

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.710 
camera what I would do for my next one I
would<00:05:58.300> add<00:05:58.480> interfacing<00:05:59.850> to<00:06:00.850> this<00:06:01.030> so<00:06:01.540> it

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
would add interfacing to this so it

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.830 
would add interfacing to this so it
could<00:06:01.870> be<00:06:02.050> more<00:06:02.230> sturdier<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:03.240> not<00:06:04.240> buckled

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
could be more sturdier and not buckled

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.860 
could be more sturdier and not buckled
like<00:06:05.050> it's<00:06:05.230> doing<00:06:05.500> right<00:06:05.740> now<00:06:05.850> but<00:06:06.850> I<00:06:07.240> like<00:06:07.630> it

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
like it's doing right now but I like it

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:16.680 
like it's doing right now but I like it
it's<00:06:08.110> good<00:06:08.680> contrast<00:06:10.650> here<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:15.210> arm<00:06:16.210> bends

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
it's good contrast here the arm bends

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.820 
it's good contrast here the arm bends
see<00:06:18.750> perfectly<00:06:19.750> the<00:06:19.900> same<00:06:19.960> I<00:06:20.260> like<00:06:20.560> mine's

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
see perfectly the same I like mine's

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.700 
see perfectly the same I like mine's
rolled<00:06:21.190> up<00:06:21.400> you<00:06:21.640> know<00:06:23.310> 3/4<00:06:24.310> of<00:06:24.400> the<00:06:24.550> way<00:06:25.530> it's<00:06:26.530> a

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
rolled up you know 3/4 of the way it's a

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.400 
rolled up you know 3/4 of the way it's a
good<00:06:26.890> contrast<00:06:27.490> with<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:27.820> color<00:06:28.060> and<00:06:28.360> the<00:06:28.540> the

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
good contrast with the color and the the

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.300 
good contrast with the color and the the
gold<00:06:29.880> on<00:06:30.880> the<00:06:31.090> actual<00:06:31.419> sweatshirt<00:06:32.160> it's<00:06:33.160> a

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
gold on the actual sweatshirt it's a

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.270 
gold on the actual sweatshirt it's a
cool<00:06:33.550> little<00:06:33.700> contrast<00:06:34.600> but<00:06:35.050> let's<00:06:35.919> just<00:06:36.130> get
