from<00:02:02.240> not<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.540> get<00:02:03.659> rushed<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.140> there

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
from not going to get rushed but there

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.289 
from not going to get rushed but there
he<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.740> already<00:02:05.159> building<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.820> photon

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
he is already building that photon

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.510 
he is already building that photon
cannon<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.710> there's<00:02:08.340> no

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
cannon as you can see and I there's no

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.160 
cannon as you can see and I there's no
way<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.819> stop<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.599> point<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.020> now<00:02:10.140> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
way I can stop it at this point so now I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.869 
way I can stop it at this point so now I
just<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> turtle<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.489> make<00:02:11.640> sure<00:02:11.849> i

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
just have to turtle up and make sure i

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.040 
just have to turtle up and make sure i
get<00:02:12.120> an<00:02:12.239> army<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.629> can

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
get an army that can

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.200 
get an army that can
can<00:02:13.440> deal<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.010> rush<00:02:14.370> as<00:02:14.670> as

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
can deal with this rush as as

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.370 
can deal with this rush as as
effectively<00:02:15.840> as<00:02:16.110> possible<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:19.110> see

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
effectively as possible now you see

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.830 
effectively as possible now you see
night<00:02:20.250> game<00:02:20.550> here<00:02:20.760> throwing<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.240> really<00:02:21.660> nice

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
night game here throwing a really nice

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.380 
night game here throwing a really nice
photon<00:02:22.680> cannon<00:02:23.010> up<00:02:23.130> here<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.490> my<00:02:23.640> base<00:02:23.850> but<00:02:24.150> I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
photon cannon up here in my base but I

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.960 
photon cannon up here in my base but I
do<00:02:24.900> not<00:02:25.200> dare<00:02:25.500> try<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.950> attack<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.550> because

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
do not dare try to attack it because

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.000 
do not dare try to attack it because
there<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.570> photon<00:02:28.230> cannon<00:02:28.500> down<00:02:28.680> on<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
there is the photon cannon down on the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.690 
there is the photon cannon down on the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
on the lower plan plateau so I'm just

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.020 
on the lower plan plateau so I'm just
going<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.940> sit<00:02:33.120> here<00:02:33.150> now<00:02:33.810> idling<00:02:34.290> my<00:02:34.470> work<00:02:34.710> is

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
going to sit here now idling my work is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.070 
going to sit here now idling my work is
quite<00:02:36.030> bad<00:02:36.300> but<00:02:37.040> just<00:02:38.270> keeping<00:02:39.270> cool<00:02:39.510> throwing

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
quite bad but just keeping cool throwing

see my circlings not really doing any

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.920 
see my circlings not really doing any
good<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.980> all<00:02:53.310> at<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:53.730> point<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.360> just

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
good at all at this point so just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.480 
good at all at this point so just
pulling<00:02:55.230> those<00:02:55.350> back<00:02:55.620> getting<00:02:55.920> my<00:02:56.130> workers

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
pulling those back getting my workers

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.280 
pulling those back getting my workers
back<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.730> work<00:02:56.910> because<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.390> really<00:02:57.780> fail<00:02:57.990> there

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
back to work because I really fail there

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.120 
back to work because I really fail there
but<00:02:58.940> right<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.210> right<00:03:01.170> now<00:03:01.230> I'm<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.860> saving

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
but right so right now I'm just saving

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.550 
but right so right now I'm just saving
up<00:03:02.400> my<00:03:02.580> lolly<00:03:02.820> not<00:03:03.780> doing<00:03:04.140> anything<00:03:04.380> just

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
up my lolly not doing anything just

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.020 
up my lolly not doing anything just
making<00:03:05.040> sure<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.400> I'm<00:03:05.490> going<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.850> have

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
making sure that I'm going to have

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.680 
making sure that I'm going to have
enough<00:03:07.070> supply<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.610> get<00:03:08.820> up<00:03:08.940> some<00:03:09.150> roaches<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
enough supply to get up some roaches to

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.320 
enough supply to get up some roaches to
defend<00:03:09.990> against<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.850> trying<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.030> throw

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
defend against this and trying to throw

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.960 
defend against this and trying to throw
up<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.510> few<00:03:12.870> spine<00:03:13.170> crawlers<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:14.190> prevent<00:03:14.760> him

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
up a few spine crawlers to prevent him

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.900 
up a few spine crawlers to prevent him
getting<00:03:15.300> too<00:03:15.690> close<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.290> my<00:03:16.410> actual<00:03:16.620> base<00:03:17.010> so

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
getting too close to my actual base so

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.640 
getting too close to my actual base so
as<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.330> can<00:03:18.450> see<00:03:18.600> here<00:03:18.810> if<00:03:19.110> we<00:03:19.320> look<00:03:19.470> at<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
as you can see here if we look at the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.300 
as you can see here if we look at the
production<00:03:21.140> whoops<00:03:22.140> wrong<00:03:22.530> key<00:03:22.830> all<00:03:23.130> right

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
production whoops wrong key all right

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.830 
production whoops wrong key all right
I'm<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:23.730> going<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.940> go<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.270> way<00:03:24.390> if<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:24.660> look

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
I'm just going to go this way if we look

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.570 
I'm just going to go this way if we look
at<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.050> production<00:03:25.560> we<00:03:25.650> see<00:03:25.830> three<00:03:26.130> roaches

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
at the production we see three roaches

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.910 
at the production we see three roaches
on<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.970> way<00:03:27.090> from<00:03:27.150> me<00:03:27.420> now<00:03:28.020> as<00:03:28.260> soon<00:03:28.590> as<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.860> get

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
on the way from me now as soon as I get

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.810 
on the way from me now as soon as I get
those<00:03:29.310> three<00:03:29.940> roaches<00:03:30.360> out<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.690> am<00:03:31.340> pretty<00:03:32.340> safe

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
those three roaches out I am pretty safe

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.410 
those three roaches out I am pretty safe
I<00:03:33.150> mean<00:03:33.540> roaches<00:03:34.670> three<00:03:35.670> roaches<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.209> take

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
I mean roaches three roaches can take

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.250 
I mean roaches three roaches can take
down<00:03:36.600> one<00:03:36.810> photon<00:03:37.290> cannon<00:03:37.880> alone<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.840> at<00:03:40.110> this

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
down one photon cannon alone so at this

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.229 
down one photon cannon alone so at this
point<00:03:40.500> just<00:03:40.770> moving<00:03:41.190> my<00:03:41.220> roaches<00:03:41.610> up<00:03:41.970> into<00:03:42.209> a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
point just moving my roaches up into a

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.180 
point just moving my roaches up into a
position<00:03:42.420> where<00:03:42.690> they<00:03:42.930> won't<00:03:43.110> get<00:03:43.350> hit<00:03:43.530> by<00:03:43.739> by

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
position where they won't get hit by by

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.030 
position where they won't get hit by by
the<00:03:44.220> photon<00:03:44.640> cannon<00:03:44.940> down<00:03:45.150> here<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:46.320> trying<00:03:46.980> to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
the photon cannon down here so trying to

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.240 
the photon cannon down here so trying to
prevent<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.550> photon<00:03:47.820> cannon<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.450> does

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
prevent this photon cannon and that does

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.370 
prevent this photon cannon and that does
that<00:03:50.250> does<00:03:50.310> work<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.870> making<00:03:52.170> sure<00:03:52.350> that

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
that does work so just making sure that

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.790 
that does work so just making sure that
I<00:03:52.620> get<00:03:52.739> this<00:03:53.480> this<00:03:54.480> pylon<00:03:54.780> down<00:03:55.140> so<00:03:55.380> he<00:03:55.500> cannot

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
I get this this pylon down so he cannot

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.660 
I get this this pylon down so he cannot
build<00:03:56.310> any<00:03:56.670> more<00:03:57.030> up<00:03:57.660> there<00:03:58.050> now<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.010> was<00:03:59.370> trying

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
build any more up there now I was trying

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.430 
build any more up there now I was trying
to<00:03:59.880> move<00:04:00.090> my<00:04:00.330> spine<00:04:00.720> crawl<00:04:00.989> into<00:04:01.110> a<00:04:01.260> better

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
to move my spine crawl into a better

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.229 
to move my spine crawl into a better
position<00:04:01.590> by<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.160> photon<00:04:02.610> cannon<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.030> keep

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
position by that photon cannon just keep

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.090 
position by that photon cannon just keep
shooting<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:03.870> I'm<00:04:04.170> going<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.650> give<00:04:04.800> up<00:04:04.950> on

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
shooting it so I'm going to give up on

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.890 
shooting it so I'm going to give up on
that<00:04:05.130> one<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:05.670> pull<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.480> back<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.870> a

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
that one just pull it back to a

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.690 
that one just pull it back to a
defensive<00:04:07.590> position<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:08.160> make<00:04:08.280> sure<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.610> he

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
defensive position to make sure that he

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.110 
defensive position to make sure that he
doesn't<00:04:08.910> get<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.900> closer<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.500> my<00:04:10.620> base<00:04:11.120> now

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
doesn't get in closer to my base now

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.550 
doesn't get in closer to my base now
what<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.390> want<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.660> do<00:04:12.840> now<00:04:13.019> is<00:04:13.050> you<00:04:13.320> want<00:04:13.470> to

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
what you want to do now is you want to

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.170 
what you want to do now is you want to
put<00:04:13.739> some<00:04:13.950> pressure<00:04:14.160> on<00:04:14.340> your<00:04:14.550> opponent<00:04:14.970> so

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
put some pressure on your opponent so

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.390 
put some pressure on your opponent so
I'm<00:04:15.239> just<00:04:15.450> going<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.690> send<00:04:15.900> my<00:04:16.220> my<00:04:17.220> roaches

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
I'm just going to send my my roaches

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.430 
I'm just going to send my my roaches
into<00:04:17.970> his<00:04:18.120> face<00:04:18.330> because<00:04:18.690> right<00:04:19.049> now<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:19.260> know

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
into his face because right now I know

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.490 
into his face because right now I know
his<00:04:19.830> main<00:04:20.070> focus<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.669> down<00:04:20.880> here<00:04:21.180> now<00:04:22.080> as<00:04:22.320> soon

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
his main focus is down here now as soon

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.020 
his main focus is down here now as soon
as<00:04:22.650> he<00:04:22.770> sees<00:04:22.919> me<00:04:22.979> run<00:04:23.310> out<00:04:23.460> there<00:04:23.610> he's<00:04:23.820> going

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
as he sees me run out there he's going

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.730 
as he sees me run out there he's going
to<00:04:24.090> be<00:04:24.180> throwing<00:04:24.450> down<00:04:24.660> photon<00:04:25.110> cannon

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
to be throwing down photon cannon

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.100 
to be throwing down photon cannon
cannons<00:04:26.190> in<00:04:26.400> his<00:04:26.610> own<00:04:26.759> base<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.720> at<00:04:27.900> this

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
cannons in his own base but at this

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.480 
cannons in his own base but at this
point<00:04:28.349> I'm<00:04:29.039> pretty<00:04:29.370> safe<00:04:29.819> because<00:04:31.099> he's<00:04:32.099> been

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
point I'm pretty safe because he's been

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.400 
point I'm pretty safe because he's been
using<00:04:32.699> so<00:04:33.180> much<00:04:33.330> resources<00:04:33.930> putting<00:04:34.289> down

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
using so much resources putting down

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.469 
using so much resources putting down
pylons<00:04:34.889> and<00:04:35.130> photon<00:04:35.699> cannons<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.090> my<00:04:36.270> base

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
pylons and photon cannons in my base

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.719 
pylons and photon cannons in my base
that<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.500> amount<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.949> can<00:04:38.069> have<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.400> his<00:04:38.550> own

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
that the amount you can have in his own

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.390 
that the amount you can have in his own
base<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.240> pretty<00:04:39.539> limited<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.979> if<00:04:41.009> i<00:04:41.370> just

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
base is pretty limited so if i just

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.300 
base is pretty limited so if i just
bring<00:04:41.880> those<00:04:42.690> three<00:04:43.319> roaches<00:04:43.740> up<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:43.979> his<00:04:44.130> face

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
bring those three roaches up to his face

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.920 
bring those three roaches up to his face
and<00:04:44.550> keep<00:04:44.759> putting<00:04:45.090> out<00:04:45.210> roaches<00:04:45.630> down<00:04:45.780> at

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
and keep putting out roaches down at

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.290 
and keep putting out roaches down at
mine<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.380> am<00:04:46.889> safe<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.430> I<00:04:47.520> should<00:04:47.880> win<00:04:48.090> this

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
mine I am safe and I should win this

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.790 
mine I am safe and I should win this
game<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:50.030> now<00:04:51.030> sing<00:04:51.599> here<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:51.990> move<00:04:52.319> up<00:04:52.440> into<00:04:52.590> his

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
game so now sing here I move up into his

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.230 
game so now sing here I move up into his
base<00:04:52.979> and<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.190> can<00:04:53.340> see<00:04:53.490> there<00:04:53.669> is<00:04:53.699> a<00:04:53.789> photon

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
base and I can see there is a photon

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.300 
base and I can see there is a photon
cannon<00:04:54.569> so<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:54.750> tried<00:04:55.199> to<00:04:55.229> move<00:04:55.590> around<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:56.130> now

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
cannon so I tried to move around it now

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.129 
cannon so I tried to move around it now
as<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.729> can<00:04:56.819> see<00:04:56.880> he<00:04:57.090> just<00:04:57.120> put<00:04:57.509> up<00:04:57.630> two<00:04:57.900> more

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
as you can see he just put up two more

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.800 
as you can see he just put up two more
photon<00:04:58.560> cannons<00:04:58.949> but<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.400> don't<00:05:00.060> really<00:05:00.300> care<00:05:00.599> i

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
photon cannons but I don't really care i

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.540 
photon cannons but I don't really care i
just<00:05:00.870> want<00:05:01.169> to<00:05:01.349> stop<00:05:01.620> him<00:05:01.830> from<00:05:01.860> producing

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
just want to stop him from producing

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.550 
just want to stop him from producing
more<00:05:02.729> units<00:05:03.120> on<00:05:03.300> more<00:05:03.479> photon<00:05:03.960> cannons<00:05:04.349> and

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
more units on more photon cannons and

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.860 
more units on more photon cannons and
just<00:05:05.310> make<00:05:05.520> sure<00:05:05.759> that<00:05:05.789> he<00:05:06.150> can't<00:05:06.389> do<00:05:06.599> anything

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
just make sure that he can't do anything

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.100 
just make sure that he can't do anything
in<00:05:07.229> this<00:05:07.380> game<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:08.599> trying<00:05:09.599> to<00:05:09.750> get<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:09.900> good

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
in this game so trying to get a good

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.050 
in this game so trying to get a good
position<00:05:10.440> just<00:05:10.889> make<00:05:11.099> sure<00:05:11.310> i<00:05:11.340> got<00:05:11.639> him<00:05:11.849> locked

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
position just make sure i got him locked

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.850 
position just make sure i got him locked
down<00:05:12.210> really<00:05:12.780> nice<00:05:12.960> here<00:05:13.229> making<00:05:13.620> sure<00:05:13.650> that

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
down really nice here making sure that

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.520 
down really nice here making sure that
he<00:05:14.190> doesn't<00:05:14.430> place<00:05:14.759> any<00:05:15.030> photon<00:05:15.419> cannons<00:05:15.810> near

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
he doesn't place any photon cannons near

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.180 
he doesn't place any photon cannons near
to<00:05:17.130> my<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:18.180> my<00:05:18.210> roaches<00:05:18.539> here<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.590> as<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:20.099> can

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
to my to my roaches here so as you can

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.800 
to my to my roaches here so as you can
see<00:05:20.370> at<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:20.610> point<00:05:20.909> he's<00:05:21.210> not<00:05:21.419> getting<00:05:21.690> any

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
see at this point he's not getting any

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.439 
see at this point he's not getting any
minerals<00:05:22.259> he<00:05:22.380> can't<00:05:22.620> do<00:05:22.860> anything<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:24.240> he's

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
minerals he can't do anything so he's

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.870 
minerals he can't do anything so he's
pretty<00:05:25.080> much<00:05:25.380> screwed<00:05:25.830> at<00:05:26.099> this<00:05:26.250> point<00:05:26.550> I<00:05:26.699> mean

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
pretty much screwed at this point I mean

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.230 
pretty much screwed at this point I mean
he's<00:05:27.060> got<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.539> pretty<00:05:28.199> good<00:05:28.470> luck<00:05:28.770> on<00:05:29.009> my<00:05:29.220> own<00:05:29.460> in

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
he's got a pretty good luck on my own in
