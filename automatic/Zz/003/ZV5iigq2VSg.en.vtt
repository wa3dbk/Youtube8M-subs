00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.610
 Hello big island today how to build a wind power plant electric facility 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:19.710
 once 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.710
 I 'll see you later. 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.190
 There are three big towers. 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:42.450
 If you look at the next swim , you can build three vertical axes 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.840
 Airedale close due to the difference is the space occupied 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.960
 I'll let you know how to do this. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.960
 Each of us now has to build 24 generators. 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:02.650
 Well, first thing you see is that you can now 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:05.560
 When you occupy the space you are looking at, take four spaces and enter the new room. 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.190
 Will be two spaces in a row. 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.760
 It's a total of eight cars now occupying the space. 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.660
 It's not hard to build it. 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.540
 Oh, just after I put it in work around 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.640
 1c Now you can put it and rest. 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.880
 This is not difficult 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.680
 It's time to go . 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.050
 In the case of dn, you will find quite a lot of space . 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:41.160
 Now you see 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:44.880
 Oh, it's four boxes in a row, six boxes in a new base , and 24 in a baseball. 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.870
 Notes'll tell you the one gonna offering Oh February 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.640
 This is weak 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.640
 22 spaces, 2 spaces, and 11 new spaces. 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.920
 Now go see you find 24 spaces 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.920
 It was a breathtaking place to open dealers . 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:10.729
 Mr.'ve just middle hanging pendent real lighthouse to the next 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:17.470
 I'm standing in line and I'm just looking at the chip on both sides. 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.470
 I 'll try this once again to see how it's done. 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.610
 Others dare 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.760
 I 'll be Rato. 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.639
 Develop a dry mouth doegeodeun jump a little more because of the size itself must control over evil 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:52.010
 I'll give you 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:56.239
 If you see 1 2 3 5 6 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.049
 Now me and remember one small van comes anywhere I do not care 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.469
 So Can you please just by looking at one situation to adjust the minimum six-Kahn afloat 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.469
 You have to. 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.700
 Next time, please do the demolition 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.050
 I remembered one of them. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.690
 Huh 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.690
 Le lead 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:40.930
 For example, let's take a look at it and then the closest thing to it. 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.930
 Next, this is the first time I've been so weak with a yacht . 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.750
 like this 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.380
 4 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.970
 4 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.370
 Like this, 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.370
 U 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.370
 U 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.510
 U 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.690
 5 Celsius 5 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.360
 5 222 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:30.490
 Let's be neat. 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:35.100
 Oh, now and then you see the vertical axis and the vertical axis is 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.100
 This is a good thing l brought've built 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.430
 Eight squares Two horizontal squares New eight squares Horizontal eight squares Vertical North Total 16 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.830
 I'm looking for Khan. 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:54.710
 If you look at the house, this is 4 times the society and you have 16 boxes . 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.710
 How to build it again, but this also one boneyo 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:22.009
 It floated doegeodeunyo give a new sword here 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.009
 23 Please look at me te Deccan 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:39.200
 For this also share ah ah ah here 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.200
 I have a look. 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.820
 5 I did 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:48.950
 Then, 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.950
 I saw the clock here. 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:00.650
 I want you to reconstruct it . 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.599
 Thank you. 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.599
 4 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.940
 U 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.940
 You have three of these . 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.080
 And the rest is fundamentally 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.169
 ee ee ee 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.000
 That 's how it all comes down to talking. 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.500
 Beef 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:54.449
 Since then, 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:58.710
 It occupies the space in the box next to the column for a total of eight, then the amount 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:02.509
 24 squares 2 Goals 22 Cats Next 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.509
 Suzu came to work 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:10.920
 16 squares here Asuka 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.630
 These thoughts that occupy that much space ange each other in developing city in abundance 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:17.100
 If you say thank you 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:20.190
 I think that as much space as it is now occupies space, 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:25.870
 I think I'll be able to build it now. 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:29.590
 A wind turbine is so big 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:33.760
 Of course, if you move to the vertical axis , 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:35.160
 If the Tong Tong own hands, the space efficiency is not so good 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.030
 same 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:42.660
 If the strap is wide 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:47.600
 Thinking about the environment and not causing pollution 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:51.979
 Another good fall comfortably somehow less space rattling wonak 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:56.949
 This much space forever to spend some tough characters, so if you like me 

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:56.949
 I usually use a lot of coal or oil. 

00:07:57.759 --> 00:08:04.360
 The map says that it has been put on the side of the wind , 

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:09.460
 I feel sorry. 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:12.090
 Uh Next time, I'll proceed once you build now as coal oil Trang 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.090
 Thank you
