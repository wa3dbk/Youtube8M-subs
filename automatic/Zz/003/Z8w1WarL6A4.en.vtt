been<00:01:19.460> used<00:01:19.670> a<00:01:19.789> lot<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.180> sounds<00:01:20.539> awesome

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
been used a lot it sounds awesome

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.320 
been used a lot it sounds awesome
basically<00:01:21.530> just<00:01:21.830> scraping<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.700> pig<00:01:22.909> across

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
basically just scraping the pig across

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.440 
basically just scraping the pig across
the<00:01:23.509> strings<00:01:23.840> but<00:01:24.500> if<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:24.920> just<00:01:25.330> went<00:01:26.330> like

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
the strings but if you just went like

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.899 
the strings but if you just went like
that<00:01:26.479> it<00:01:26.780> wouldn't<00:01:26.929> sound<00:01:27.140> good<00:01:27.319> also

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
that it wouldn't sound good also

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.070 
that it wouldn't sound good also
normally<00:01:28.909> I<00:01:28.970> would<00:01:29.119> hold<00:01:29.299> a<00:01:29.360> pic<00:01:29.569> with<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.990> a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
get that little snap that little tension

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.210 
get that little snap that little tension
in<00:01:38.959> there<00:01:39.110> what<00:01:39.709> you're<00:01:39.830> doing<00:01:40.009> is<00:01:40.100> you're

in there what you're doing is you're
creating<00:01:40.250> some<00:01:40.759> tension<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.619> snap<00:01:42.619> I'd<00:01:43.159> like<00:01:43.310> to

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
creating some tension a snap I'd like to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.219 
creating some tension a snap I'd like to
do<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:43.670> both<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.119> lower<00:01:44.270> strings<00:01:44.659> at<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.869> and

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
do it on both the lower strings at a and

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.059 
do it on both the lower strings at a and
the<00:01:45.319> e<00:01:47.289> starting<00:01:48.289> from<00:01:48.440> just<00:01:48.649> behind<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
the e starting from just behind the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.850 
the e starting from just behind the
pickup<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.700> rest<00:01:50.179> a<00:01:50.330> pic<00:01:50.569> on<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.409> lower<00:01:51.560> two

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
pickup I rest a pic on the lower two

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.469 
pickup I rest a pic on the lower two
strings<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.429> kind<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.670> angle<00:01:52.939> it<00:01:53.000> back<00:01:53.209> a<00:01:53.240> little

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
strings I kind of angle it back a little

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.510 
strings I kind of angle it back a little
so<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.780> wants<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.080> flip<00:01:54.350> forward<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.039> that

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
so it wants to flip forward and that

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.490 
so it wants to flip forward and that
forward<00:01:56.149> motion<00:01:56.569> is<00:01:56.630> what<00:01:56.810> really<00:01:56.990> creates<00:01:57.409> a

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
forward motion is what really creates a

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.630 
forward motion is what really creates a
good<00:01:57.740> scrapes<00:01:59.709> and<00:02:00.709> I<00:02:00.769> like<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.039> do<00:02:01.160> it<00:02:01.310> thumb
