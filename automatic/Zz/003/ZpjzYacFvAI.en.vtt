00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:18.419 
entire course what do you think about

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.120 
entire course what do you think about
because<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.960> were<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.619> best<00:00:19.740> double

polos<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> world<00:00:20.970> oh<00:00:21.650> yeah<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
polos in the world oh yeah I think it

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.170 
polos in the world oh yeah I think it
was<00:00:25.189> interesting<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.220> see<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.000> was

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
was interesting to see that it was

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.990 
was interesting to see that it was
possible<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.949> Davos<00:00:29.400> because<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
possible to do it in in Davos because of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.350 
possible to do it in in Davos because of
the<00:00:30.179> altitude<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.309> heart<00:00:32.309> right<00:00:32.940> yeah

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the altitude and the heart right yeah

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.780 
the altitude and the heart right yeah
I've<00:00:33.930> never<00:00:34.140> thought<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:34.470> that<00:00:34.769> in<00:00:35.129> my<00:00:35.339> my

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I've never thought about that in my my

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.920 
I've never thought about that in my my
day<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:37.159> and<00:00:38.159> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.339> maybe<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.720> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
day so and I think maybe it's because of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.920 
day so and I think maybe it's because of
the<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.409> little<00:00:40.650> bit<00:00:40.769> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.780> conditions<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the a little bit of the conditions it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.649 
the a little bit of the conditions it
was<00:00:43.049> a<00:00:48.860> little<00:00:49.879> problematic<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.239> maybe<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
was a little problematic so maybe that

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.100 
was a little problematic so maybe that
is<00:00:52.309> possible<00:00:53.309> actually<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:54.299> we<00:00:54.479> have<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.720> chance

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
is possible actually do we have a chance

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
is possible actually do we have a chance
that<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.470> is<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.769> peak<00:00:56.040> on<00:00:56.280> doing<00:00:56.580> more

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
that this is gonna peak on doing more

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.340 
that this is gonna peak on doing more
and<00:00:56.909> more<00:00:57.089> that<00:00:57.269> people<00:00:57.299> are<00:00:57.659> focusing<00:00:58.080> on<00:00:58.199> top

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and more that people are focusing on top

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.950 
and more that people are focusing on top
of<00:00:58.470> fall<00:00:58.619> in<00:00:58.799> most<00:00:58.979> places<00:00:59.220> is<00:00:59.820> classic<00:01:00.570> skiing

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
of fall in most places is classic skiing

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.780 
of fall in most places is classic skiing
history<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.979> don't<00:01:03.260> hope<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.729> don't

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
history I don't hope so and I don't

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.780 
history I don't hope so and I don't
think<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.390> any<00:01:06.570> good<00:01:06.660> idea<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.790> doesn't

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
think it's any good idea that doesn't

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.740 
think it's any good idea that doesn't
look<00:01:09.060> good<00:01:09.120> to<00:01:09.570> go<00:01:09.600> round<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> double<00:01:10.740> point

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
look good to go round the double point

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.990 
look good to go round the double point
the<00:01:12.750> point<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.200> two<00:01:13.410> techniques<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.370> in<00:01:14.730> a<00:01:14.820> way

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the point of two techniques are in a way

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.300 
the point of two techniques are in a way
gone<00:01:15.480> I<00:01:17.360> will<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.620> certainly<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.800> racers<00:01:20.160> are

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
gone I will see certainly the racers are

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.240 
gone I will see certainly the racers are
stronger<00:01:20.700> than<00:01:20.850> before<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:24.830> gives<00:01:25.830> us

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
stronger than before in there gives us

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.420 
stronger than before in there gives us
results<00:01:26.810> yes<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.260> what<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:28.980> doing<00:01:29.220> here

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
results yes and what are you doing here

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.340
