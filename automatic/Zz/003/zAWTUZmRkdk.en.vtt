00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
that are right there breathing down our

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.400

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
necks because if we lose again just like

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.570 
necks because if we lose again just like
in<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:30.590> last<00:05:30.680> game<00:05:30.919> if<00:05:31.070> we<00:05:31.099> lose<00:05:31.400> we'll

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
in the last game if we lose we'll

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.790 
in the last game if we lose we'll

copolymer thought of which is two or
three<00:06:15.289> I<00:06:15.320> think<00:06:15.620> so<00:06:15.770> it<00:06:16.190> goes<00:06:16.550> I<00:06:16.820> think<00:06:16.849> in<00:06:17.180> the

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
three I think so it goes I think in the

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.300 
three I think so it goes I think in the

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
season for now I'm not exactly sure if

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.920 
season for now I'm not exactly sure if
that's<00:06:19.580> that's<00:06:19.909> proper<00:06:20.479> because<00:06:20.599> I<00:06:20.780> don't
