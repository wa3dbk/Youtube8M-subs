00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
but as we talk more about it i saw more

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.800 
but as we talk more about it i saw more
in<00:03:22.320> rogers<00:03:23.040> work<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.940> had<00:03:24.120> an<00:03:24.269> ethical

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
in rogers work that had an ethical

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.449 
in rogers work that had an ethical
dimension<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.739> really<00:03:26.100> excited

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
dimension to it and that really excited

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.850 
dimension to it and that really excited
me<00:03:26.610> because<00:03:27.030> i<00:03:27.120> think<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.420> art<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.860> probably

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
me because i think that art is probably
