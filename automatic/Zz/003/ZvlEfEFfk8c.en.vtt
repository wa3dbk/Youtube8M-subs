00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.309
 even a four-year-old child is quite 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.070
 condition with the help of a teacher 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:49.170
 I do such a job very well 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.600
 and nice to give and show my mother very much 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.159
 liked our children to do a picture with 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.850
 wool animals 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.970
 in an hour, the children did well 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.210
 such is the work I offer today 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.610
 together with you do work dedicated 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.340
 March 8, we are just around the corner 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.920
 wonderful holiday and something we will 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.920
 give to our loved ones and so to make 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.700
 such wool work we need here 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.220
 some kind of photo frame can 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.030
 little green little white any color we 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:31.110
 we separate the basis of the glass which is inside 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:36.070
 and the frame itself we put this one 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.530
 the substrate and let's start began to lay out the background 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.840
 for this we usually use white 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.080
 wool wool is of course the most necessary 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.760
 element in our work is wool for 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.830
 felting carding 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.400
 we will lay out in small strands 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.640
 started the background neatly lay out 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:00.270
 all background to close all our 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 work lay out the background 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.729
 when the white background is closed we'll add more 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.550
 multicolored slightly different colors 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.030
 wool different pink blue blue 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.780
 to make our work more vivid 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.350
 and memorable is the background on which 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.140
 then we post our 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.910
 wool pattern 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.470
 if we take my pink put in 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.380
 several places as well as blue 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:40.480
 add a little blue of different colors 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.090
 maybe a little yellow now 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.090
 when our background is finished we will take 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.160
 such an orange shift, and we will 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.090
 lay out our drawing since we 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.600
 March 8 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.810
 I propose to put eight to write 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:00.370
 March 8 and make here postcards 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.100
 there are a sprig of mimosa we add to here 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.260
 this piece of pole and other cheaper 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.600
 other colors 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.950
 small strands will add a 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.570
 then we will turn the eight 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.940
 in some intricate way so that 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.380
 we got the figure eight well 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.250
 about probably like it here and so once 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.519
 we put it here right here with our edge 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.540
 pictures and will continue to lay out 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:34.150
 mimosa which we will have and so that 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.989
 we make mimosa enough for us to take 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.320
 several such thin 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:44.799
 wool strings put them so not 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.829
 in an elaborate way to our eight and 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:51.450
 roll up yellow wool like that 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:56.910

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.090
