legs of pastors as they're preaching and

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.130 
legs of pastors as they're preaching and
parishioners<00:04:58.970> as<00:04:59.210> they're<00:04:59.420> listening<00:04:59.870> and

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140

teaching<00:05:09.470> so<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:09.770> think<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:10.160> pastors<00:05:10.880> would

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
teaching so I think that pastors would

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.400 
teaching so I think that pastors would
be<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.150> little<00:05:11.390> bit<00:05:11.510> more<00:05:11.660> on<00:05:11.780> their<00:05:11.900> toes<00:05:12.110> to

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
be a little bit more on their toes to

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.280 
be a little bit more on their toes to
read<00:05:12.890> scripture<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:14.240> guard<00:05:14.480> their<00:05:14.690> souls<00:05:14.990> and

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290
