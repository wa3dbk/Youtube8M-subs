00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 good afternoon, we're here with the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.280
 our Motoca and this video here 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.559
 His goal is to show the latest in 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
 that we put on the bike with the bike 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.330
 was originally June in the world and stayed 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.060
 much more is 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.300
 I found it very interesting to look for a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.689
 protecting the filter medium of the filter 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.900
 motorcycle oil that runs down the engine 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.410
 behind the tire and with when you are 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 walking fast slow even going 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.660
 very stone thrown by the tire and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 risk of sticking filter is very large and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.219
 you walk on the road for example in 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.379
 high speed through a filter of this 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.610
 Empty looks you do not realize when you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.520
 see the cast motor 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:58.770
 so I found it interesting to stick to joão 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:01:05.909
 jlm he made this side of the bike and a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.780
 filter because it protects the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.110
 Another novelty that is on the bike is 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.549
 the joão made for us is a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:23.549
 sports line and was very cool 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:26.250
 even the bike was cool is also sent 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.549
 make the tip already for the sake of 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.040
 security really make noise but 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.630
 It's the bike how fast the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.970
 driver does not realize that we are going to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.060
 coming and often forget to give 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.490
 and the risk of the agent colliding is very 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.360
 big then with a little noise 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.509
 bigger 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 is the driver already realizes that he was in 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.320
 and if you are smart enough to 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.750
 slowing down will protect the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.110
 people run the bike and the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.680
 made a new noise from ours. 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.680
 our motorcycle 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.650
 O 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.510
 O 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.569
 Thanks. 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.610
 A big hug to everyone, a great ending. 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.970
 week and one more weekend 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.620
 the china that you like anyone who likes 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.540
 you are interested in contacting the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.910
 people who pass the phone from 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.860
 joão to make the equipment for the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.860
