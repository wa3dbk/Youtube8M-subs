00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.790
 with everything that has happened since your 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.980
 last defeat how it feels to return to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.830
 a poster of the great being here 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.090
 right now I think that all my 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.539
 fight has been great all my experience 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.970
 important 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.880
 I have lived as the casualties as the high ones 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.969
 It is very normal but it was necessary 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.699
 back again to climb almost almost hand 

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:30.199
 at least one major fight a 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.140
 fight at least like this we're going to 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.850
 have past tomorrow for pepper saw a 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.100
 fight that we did not expect that that 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.199
 so many people were going to be there 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.120
 waiting to see her not so much as the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.670
 Japanese people like the people here from 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.530
 america latin america so it was already given 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.820
 given the opportunity and now as in 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.280
 that you have to take advantage of thanks to 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.070
 God that is given is this great great 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.879
 fight and now just give everything up 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.189
 of the ring 3 of your last loss against 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.680
 of frame that you have learned from yourself 

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:03.409
 of that experience of that defeat not me 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.530
 I think it was a lucky night that had 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.670
 of frame that night we prepared 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.100
 pretty good but pitifully 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.720
 we had a disadvantage that I had a 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.880
 accident with manny training 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.860
 pacquiao and good are things that happen in 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.110
 the boxing world does not 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.850
 the cuc man that we had that night 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.520
 could stop the blood and I think those 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.470
 were the reasons for the reasons in the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.390
 in which the refrigerator made the decision to 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.590
 stop the fight unnecessarily but 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.160
 good are things that happen boxing and 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.750
 was left behind 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.479
 after that I had another loss but 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.010
 it really is something that happens in the world 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.979
 of boxing as I told you at the beginning 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.160
 low and high but it brought me a lot 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.750
 learning and in fact look at all the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.700
 people have realized that the year 2013 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.920
 it was excellent for me three very fights 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.430
 well very good with different 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.660
 boxers with different this style of 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.369
 boxing and different not out so already 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.890
 I'm re already I'm ready for a 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.330
 big fight and look has just been given in 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:06.410
 2012 was very successful moment and 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.899
 then in 2013 I work hard to 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.790
 through upload to this moment speak to me 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.620
 of that yes that's why I tell you 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.480
 We went climbing, I think that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.820
 Well first of all thank God for 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.590
 the opportunity and me to my promoter 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.900
 I remove where that gave me the opportunity to 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.150
 train with ismael halls and I think that 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.540
 that 's what has made me better 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.540
 many things
