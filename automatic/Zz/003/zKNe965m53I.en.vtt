each of the different enemy types our

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.340 
each of the different enemy types our
current<00:02:38.880> climate<00:02:39.090> system<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:39.990> work<00:02:40.140> on

current climate system that can work on
arbitrary<00:02:41.010> spaces<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.480> idea<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:43.200> we

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
arbitrary spaces and so the idea that we

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.560 
arbitrary spaces and so the idea that we
had<00:02:43.710> when<00:02:43.890> we<00:02:43.950> started<00:02:44.460> working<00:02:44.580> on<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:45.420> the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
had when we started working on on the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.010 
had when we started working on on the
UGC<00:02:46.050> was<00:02:46.200> how<00:02:46.920> do<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.160> make<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.910> system<00:02:48.420> so

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
UGC was how do we make it so a system so

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.100 
UGC was how do we make it so a system so
that<00:02:49.050> end<00:02:49.560> users<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.820> create<00:02:51.110> totally

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
that end users can create totally

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.250 
that end users can create totally
reasonable<00:02:52.560> playable<00:02:53.600> missions<00:02:54.600> for<00:02:54.900> game

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
reasonable playable missions for game

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.800 
reasonable playable missions for game
and<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.070> idea<00:02:56.370> had<00:02:56.550> been<00:02:56.580> well<00:02:57.570> we

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
and and the idea had been well we

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.450 
and and the idea had been well we
already<00:02:57.960> have<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.380> big<00:02:58.590> city<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.220> what<00:02:59.370> if

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
already have this big city and what if

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.420 
already have this big city and what if
as<00:02:59.580> I<00:02:59.700> was<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.030> was<00:03:00.270> running<00:03:00.600> around<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.950> and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
as I was I was running around and and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.430 
as I was I was running around and and
you<00:03:02.850> know<00:03:02.940> my<00:03:03.090> friend<00:03:03.360> John<00:03:03.600> or<00:03:03.990> some<00:03:04.290> guy<00:03:04.410> I

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
you know my friend John or some guy I

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.900 
you know my friend John or some guy I
don't<00:03:04.470> even<00:03:04.680> know<00:03:04.860> Jonathan<00:03:05.310> made<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.460> mission

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
don't even know Jonathan made a mission

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.150 
don't even know Jonathan made a mission
and<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.480> just<00:03:06.690> saw<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.110> green<00:03:07.470> mission<00:03:07.740> start

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
and I just saw this green mission start

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.800 
and I just saw this green mission start
to<00:03:08.250> pop<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.850> was<00:03:08.970> just<00:03:09.150> sort<00:03:09.360> of<00:03:09.450> into<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
to pop in it was just sort of into the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.750 
to pop in it was just sort of into the
in<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.170> game<00:03:10.350> world<00:03:10.530> not<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.860> go<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.400> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
in the game world not to go on to it and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.449 
in the game world not to go on to it and
i<00:03:11.820> would<00:03:11.970> say<00:03:12.120> it's<00:03:12.450> john<00:03:12.690> mission<00:03:13.110> it's<00:03:13.230> going

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
i would say it's john mission it's going

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.460 
i would say it's john mission it's going
story<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.820> go<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.450> could<00:03:15.600> play<00:03:15.750> them<00:03:16.050> like

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
story and go in you could play them like

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.630 
story and go in you could play them like
that<00:03:16.530> seemed<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> really<00:03:17.220> compelling

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that seemed like a really compelling

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.120 
that seemed like a really compelling
thing<00:03:18.000> because<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> immersion<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.770> it

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
thing because of the immersion of it

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.550 
thing because of the immersion of it
directly<00:03:20.670> into<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> game<00:03:21.180> world<00:03:21.450> coming<00:03:22.380> and

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
directly into the game world coming and

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.290 
directly into the game world coming and
so<00:03:22.800> we<00:03:22.890> started<00:03:22.950> kind<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.670> trying<00:03:24.239> to

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
so we started kind of trying to

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.210 
so we started kind of trying to
conceptualize<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.470> think<00:03:25.830> about<00:03:26.010> what

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
conceptualize this and think about what

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.640 
conceptualize this and think about what
customers<00:03:27.209> would<00:03:27.390> need<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.930> make<00:03:28.080> admissions

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
customers would need to make admissions

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.960 
customers would need to make admissions
and<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:28.950> we<00:03:29.400> actually<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.790> lot<00:03:29.940> of

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and and we actually have a lot of

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.250 
and and we actually have a lot of
experience<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:30.690> because<00:03:31.020> we<00:03:31.140> have<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
experience of this because we have a

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.680 
experience of this because we have a
whole<00:03:31.560> bunch<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.890> tools<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.370> we<00:03:33.030> use<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.570> make

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
whole bunch of tools that we use to make

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.750 
whole bunch of tools that we use to make
the<00:03:33.870> mission<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.950> really<00:03:35.100> this<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.520> about

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
the mission and so really this was about

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.970 
the mission and so really this was about
trying<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.300> find<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:37.020> right<00:03:37.050> subset<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.739> back

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
trying to find the right subset of back

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.260 
trying to find the right subset of back
to<00:03:38.340> expose

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
to expose

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.480 
to expose
well<00:03:39.870> along<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.320> way<00:03:40.440> we<00:03:40.650> found<00:03:40.830> out<00:03:41.100> as<00:03:41.310> we

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
well along the way we found out as we

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.730 
well along the way we found out as we
did<00:03:41.700> some<00:03:42.150> testing<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.930> eventually<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:43.680> a

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
did some testing and eventually it's a

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.890 
did some testing and eventually it's a
beta<00:03:43.980> testing<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.090> users<00:03:45.360> don't<00:03:45.600> just

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
beta testing that the users don't just

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.180 
beta testing that the users don't just
want<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.140> make<00:03:46.260> what<00:03:46.620> we<00:03:46.770> would<00:03:46.890> call<00:03:47.040> them

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
want to make what we would call them

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.770 
want to make what we would call them
from<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.460> mission<00:03:47.640> they<00:03:48.330> want<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.510> make<00:03:48.630> all

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
from this mission they want to make all

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.590 
from this mission they want to make all
kinds<00:03:49.080> of<00:03:49.140> crazy<00:03:49.290> bitch<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.700> one<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.480> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
kinds of crazy bitch and so one of the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.750 
kinds of crazy bitch and so one of the
demos<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:51.960> we<00:03:52.620> have<00:03:52.770> here<00:03:52.920> today<00:03:53.250> somebody

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
demos that we have here today somebody

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.430 
demos that we have here today somebody
made<00:03:53.880> space<00:03:54.240> invaders<00:03:54.720> out<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.990> our<00:03:55.080> system

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
made space invaders out of our system

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.040 
made space invaders out of our system
which<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.370> kind<00:03:56.820> of<00:03:56.940> crazy<00:03:57.300> but<00:03:57.660> I'm<00:03:57.780> really

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
which is kind of crazy but I'm really

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.110 
which is kind of crazy but I'm really
glad<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.350> they<00:03:58.560> could<00:03:58.710> make<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.970> think

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
glad that they could make it and I think

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.510 
glad that they could make it and I think
that<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:01.020> lot<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.530> missions<00:04:01.950> have<00:04:02.220> great

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
that a lot of the missions have great

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.050 
that a lot of the missions have great
humor<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.390> of<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:04.740> bigger<00:04:05.280> things<00:04:05.670> we<00:04:05.880> could

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
humor and of the bigger things we could

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.480 
humor and of the bigger things we could
not<00:04:06.240> do<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.350> game<00:04:07.590> world<00:04:07.770> itself<00:04:08.190> because

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
not do in the game world itself because

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.010 
not do in the game world itself because
it<00:04:08.580> would<00:04:08.700> break<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.240> fiction<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.750> we're

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
it would break the fiction that we're

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.050 
it would break the fiction that we're
creating<00:04:10.200> about<00:04:10.710> infamous<00:04:11.220> so<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:11.940> this

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
creating about infamous so it's this

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.690 
creating about infamous so it's this
really<00:04:12.180> awesome<00:04:12.660> release<00:04:13.290> or<00:04:13.700> creativity

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
really awesome release or creativity

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.850 
really awesome release or creativity
purpose<00:04:15.210> for<00:04:15.420> users<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:16.049> it's<00:04:16.590> just<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.830> fun

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
purpose for users and it's just a fun

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.580 
purpose for users and it's just a fun
way<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.730> extending<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.570> game<00:04:18.810> kind<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.440> to

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
way of extending this game kind of to

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.830 
way of extending this game kind of to
infinity<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.100> mean<00:04:20.310> if<00:04:20.670> you<00:04:20.940> love<00:04:21.180> infamous<00:04:21.660> you

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
infinity I mean if you love infamous you

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.690 
infinity I mean if you love infamous you
want<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.110> keep<00:04:22.260> playing<00:04:22.290> there's<00:04:23.250> going<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.670> be

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
want to keep playing there's going to be

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.940 
want to keep playing there's going to be
I<00:04:24.090> think<00:04:24.450> an<00:04:24.540> effectively<00:04:25.020> infinite<00:04:25.560> supply

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
I think an effectively infinite supply

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.890 
I think an effectively infinite supply
of<00:04:26.420> reasonably<00:04:27.420> high<00:04:27.660> if<00:04:27.870> not

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
of reasonably high if not

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.900 
of reasonably high if not
extraordinarily<00:04:28.590> high<00:04:29.130> quality<00:04:29.580> missions

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
extraordinarily high quality missions

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.900 
extraordinarily high quality missions
now<00:04:30.540> we've<00:04:31.110> been<00:04:31.140> running<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.680> beta<00:04:31.890> for<00:04:32.280> gosh

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
now we've been running a beta for gosh

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.780 
now we've been running a beta for gosh
