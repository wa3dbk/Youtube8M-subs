between<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.900> Denon<00:00:19.289> now<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.520> gonna

between this is Denon now and I'm gonna
go<00:00:20.820> over<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.619> Apple<00:00:22.619> tell<00:00:23.189> me<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.550> think

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.500 

I<00:00:31.119> don't<00:00:31.810> know<00:00:31.930> it's<00:00:32.529> uh<00:00:32.649> it's<00:00:33.070> hard<00:00:33.880> to<00:00:33.970> say<00:00:34.239> I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
I don't know it's uh it's hard to say I

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.190 
I don't know it's uh it's hard to say I
guess<00:00:35.260> it's<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.530> matter<00:00:35.770> of<00:00:35.920> preference<00:00:36.250> I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
