 yes and 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.399

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.540
 we cook very healthy very tasty and 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.200
 probably the most morning not smoothie 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.290
 firstly because in it we have oatmeal 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.410
 flakes and it will replace you with your 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.980
 habitual porridge in it strong green tea 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.590
 and it will invigorate you in the morning early 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.780
 also in the month fresh berries you can 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.979
 use what you like 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.040
 blackberries blueberries blueberries i love cherries i 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.729
 I use cherry recommend using 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.830
 frozen then you will need 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:23.270
 use ice also we use 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:23.270
 milk and yogurt or yogurt to the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.200
 flour 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:35.259
 now believe it all now is not tasty 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.610
 because it is very sour cherry sour 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.219
 in the original recipe offer 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.689
 use two tablespoons of honey i 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.920
 I suggest using agave syrup 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.810
 add to agave syrup 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.399
 can usually use blender i 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.700
 I will use the immersion that we are 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.700
 faster 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.650
 you 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.010
 and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.750
 and 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.980

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.980
 we sat down 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.970

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.660
 discover 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.820
