00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
energy for my midterm I wanted to take a

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.480 
energy for my midterm I wanted to take a
look<00:00:06.750> at<00:00:06.930> cell<00:00:07.649> phones<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.130> how<00:00:08.220> we<00:00:08.280> can

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
look at cell phones and how we can

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.400 
look at cell phones and how we can
empower<00:00:08.730> people<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.389> off-the-grid

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
empower people in off-the-grid

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.499

used and here is my circuit setup the
PVC<00:01:52.340> pipe<00:01:52.549> was<00:01:52.790> an<00:01:52.909> interesting<00:01:53.330> problem<00:01:53.540> to

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
PVC pipe was an interesting problem to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.889 
PVC pipe was an interesting problem to
look<00:01:54.020> at<00:01:54.229> I<00:01:55.130> started<00:01:55.909> with<00:01:56.060> just<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.360> hand<00:01:56.600> crank

where<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:57.979> can<00:01:58.130> see<00:01:58.280> that's<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.610> shorter<00:01:58.909> PVC

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
where you can see that's a shorter PVC

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.850 
where you can see that's a shorter PVC
pipe<00:01:59.540> and<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.780> eventually<00:01:59.990> moved<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
pipe and I eventually moved to the

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.230 
pipe and I eventually moved to the
longer<00:02:01.220> pipe<00:02:01.430> where<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.759> could<00:02:01.909> stick<00:02:02.119> it

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
longer pipe where you could stick it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.330 
longer pipe where you could stick it
underneath<00:02:02.539> kind<00:02:03.320> of<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.619> your<00:02:03.710> armpit<00:02:04.220> and

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
underneath kind of in your armpit and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.219 
underneath kind of in your armpit and
swing<00:02:04.789> it<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.119> could<00:02:05.600> last<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:06.020> lot<00:02:06.170> longer

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
swing it you could last a lot longer

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.899 
swing it you could last a lot longer
that<00:02:06.590> way<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.130> obviously<00:02:07.189> generate<00:02:07.759> more

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
that way and obviously generate more

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.030 
that way and obviously generate more
power<00:02:08.830> here's<00:02:09.830> my<00:02:09.979> cellphone<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:12.040> eventually
