much<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.560> last<00:02:10.709> step<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.540> flip<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.720> under<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
much the last step is flip it under and

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.500 
much the last step is flip it under and
through<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:17.220> may<00:02:17.430> need<00:02:17.700> one<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:18.150> two<00:02:18.180> bobby
