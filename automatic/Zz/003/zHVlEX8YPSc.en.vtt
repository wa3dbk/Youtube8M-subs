00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.560 

the<00:02:51.950> only<00:02:52.250> other<00:02:52.280> issue<00:02:52.670> which<00:02:53.120> i<00:02:53.330> would

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
the only other issue which i would

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.830 
the only other issue which i would
suggest<00:02:53.810> for<00:02:54.290> RAC<00:02:54.500> stir<00:02:54.800> is<00:02:55.450> they<00:02:56.450> need<00:02:56.660> to

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
suggest for RAC stir is they need to

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.990 
suggest for RAC stir is they need to
have<00:02:57.050> some<00:02:57.380> type<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.620> bungee<00:02:58.220> cord<00:02:58.520> or<00:02:58.700> strap

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
have some type of bungee cord or strap

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.390 
have some type of bungee cord or strap
that<00:02:59.240> will<00:02:59.420> hold<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.810> two<00:03:00.020> bikes<00:03:00.400> together

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
that will hold the two bikes together

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.510 
that will hold the two bikes together
because<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:03.080> road<00:03:03.350> vibration<00:03:04.100> will<00:03:04.280> cause

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
because the road vibration will cause

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
because the road vibration will cause
them<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.970> bang<00:03:05.980> but<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> bungee<00:03:07.400> strap<00:03:07.700> holding

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
them to bang but a bungee strap holding

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.460 
them to bang but a bungee strap holding
them<00:03:08.660> still<00:03:09.610> would<00:03:10.610> be<00:03:10.760> beneficial<00:03:11.470> otherwise

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
them still would be beneficial otherwise

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.540 
them still would be beneficial otherwise
