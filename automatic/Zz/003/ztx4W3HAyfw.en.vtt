00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 tired imagine taking a little bit of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.790
 water rises the ducks measures 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.790
 catch with is of tribes illusions 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.170
 I believe that 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.410
 during the whole game we did not 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.020
 we despair and the hour that very happy 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.029
 because this group deserves it maybe 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.040
 the two previous parties do not know 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.160
 they could give the results but always 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.040
 we try to play and the style that imposes 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.259
 the technician that the truth is a beast 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.800
 because he never lowers his arms and that 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.350
 gives much more strength to us so 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.590
 very happy let me dedicate the triumph 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.860
 first to my wife my mom my sister in law to 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.680
 all women today like this 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.900
 that this triumph for them so 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.520
 very happy and we go home with three 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.900
 google points that is strong because 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.700
 I spoke with him the leaders are 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.500
 conform you mark important greeting 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.730
 have to continue as a technician beyond 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.070
 of what was said in the week that 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.310
 It really was not true, it's not that 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.960
 never hesitated to always manufacture with 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.710
 we 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.030
 is the head of us and the only thing that 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.860
 it is up to us to defend it inside 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.380
 of the court and today I want that to be 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.900
 it was demonstrated that it is a very 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.479
 important that we live we have to have 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.400
 feet on the ground so this is 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.399
 a large campus all the things that are 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.290
 say the door to the outside does not have 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.810
 without care because today we show that 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.399
 that hurricane is a big one so we have 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.659
 to continue on this dedicated path 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.700
 someone especially advises me of the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.179
 women and family to my wife who 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.399
 It's always next to my children like that 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.100
 that my family is happy for me 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.070
 mom to my brother who are always 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.770
 with me at all times in the good and 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.150
 bad moments so the triumph is 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.830
 for them and for all the people of 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.230
 hurricane what 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.270
 who trusts us that we go up 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.620
 the end 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.480
 some forgetfulness for your passage in racing 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.440
 how did you take that and how did you see the 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.130
 independent players in this 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.580
 delicate moment 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.600
 we do not prefer not to talk about 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.990
 independent we know what's going on 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.420
 a hard moment but 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.880
 I'm thinking about hurricane this is the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.310
 folklore of football that improves the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.510
 whistled put by his past but today 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.580
 I'm in a hurricane and I defend this 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.599
 T-shirt that opens the doors for me 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.599
