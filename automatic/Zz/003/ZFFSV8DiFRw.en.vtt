I'd get that far if you look at my

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.569 
I'd get that far if you look at my
original<00:02:03.630> video<00:02:04.110> who's<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.710> did<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.130> 23

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
original video who's that I did like 23

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and that was about the level that I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.600

big<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.519> there<00:02:48.150> really<00:02:48.390> should<00:02:48.569> be<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.989> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
big as there really should be and the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.069 
big as there really should be and the
quality<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.370> f<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.359> people<00:02:51.660> put<00:02:51.870> into

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
quality and f of the people put into

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.319 
quality and f of the people put into
videos<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.280> can't<00:02:53.519> say<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:53.790> gone<00:02:53.940> down<00:02:54.209> but

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
videos you can't say it's gone down but

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.780 
videos you can't say it's gone down but
it's<00:02:54.480> definitely<00:02:54.750> changed<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:56.010> i<00:02:56.250> think

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
it's definitely changed and i think

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.119 
it's definitely changed and i think
possibly<00:02:57.390> graded<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.440> don't<00:02:58.709> know<00:02:58.829> whether<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
possibly graded I don't know whether I

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.550 
possibly graded I don't know whether I
can<00:02:59.160> say<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.579> or<00:02:59.849> not<00:03:00.060> um<00:03:00.299> but<00:03:01.230> anyway<00:03:01.530> I

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
can say that or not um but anyway I

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.289 
can say that or not um but anyway I
don't<00:03:01.829> really<00:03:01.950> know<00:03:02.129> one<00:03:02.310> saying<00:03:02.579> less<00:03:02.910> about

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
don't really know one saying less about

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.210 
don't really know one saying less about
that<00:03:03.359> kind<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.810> stuff<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.470> more<00:03:04.890> about<00:03:05.010> the

second year of uni and doing that so I'm

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.569 
second year of uni and doing that so I'm
quite<00:03:12.810> busy<00:03:12.840> with<00:03:13.319> works<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
quite busy with works so that is the

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.009 
quite busy with works so that is the
reason<00:03:14.760> i<00:03:15.030> guess<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.629> i<00:03:15.660> haven't<00:03:15.840> uploaded

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
reason i guess that i haven't uploaded

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.620 
reason i guess that i haven't uploaded
in<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.470> last<00:03:16.650> 3<00:03:16.950> 3<00:03:17.489> weeks<00:03:17.669> but<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.419> main

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
in the last 3 3 weeks but the main

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.569 
in the last 3 3 weeks but the main
reason<00:03:18.660> i<00:03:19.109> can<00:03:19.319> say<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:19.859> my<00:03:20.010> channel<00:03:20.370> is

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
reason i can say is that my channel is

and<00:04:35.909> you<00:04:36.810> know<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.139> days<00:04:37.289> of<00:04:37.469> modern<00:04:37.800> warfare

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
and you know the days of modern warfare

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.659 
and you know the days of modern warfare
2<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.370> long<00:04:38.639> gone<00:04:38.969> but<00:04:39.569> they're<00:04:40.259> definitely

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
2 a long gone but they're definitely

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.189 
2 a long gone but they're definitely
live<00:04:41.669> on<00:04:41.819> a<00:04:41.849> lot<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.240> people's<00:04:42.599> memories<00:04:43.020> and

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
live on a lot of people's memories and

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.379 
live on a lot of people's memories and
you<00:04:43.319> ask<00:04:43.529> you<00:04:44.249> ask<00:04:44.430> anybody<00:04:44.789> who's<00:04:45.120> played

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
you ask you ask anybody who's played

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.170 
you ask you ask anybody who's played
that<00:04:45.599> game<00:04:45.779> and<00:04:46.069> I<00:04:47.069> think<00:04:47.639> a<00:04:47.729> lot<00:04:47.759> of<00:04:47.879> them<00:04:48.060> will

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
that game and I think a lot of them will

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.969 
that game and I think a lot of them will
say<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.539> was<00:04:48.719> the<00:04:48.870> best<00:04:49.229> ecology<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.800> gain

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
say that was the best ecology to gain

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.860 
say that was the best ecology to gain
that<00:04:50.099> it<00:04:50.249> was<00:04:50.370> produced<00:04:50.759> not<00:04:51.419> because<00:04:51.689> it<00:04:51.840> was

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
that it was produced not because it was

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.839 
that it was produced not because it was
terrifically<00:04:52.710> made<00:04:53.039> or<00:04:53.370> terrifically

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
terrifically made or terrifically

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.790 
terrifically made or terrifically
balanced<00:04:54.479> or<00:04:54.629> anything<00:04:55.199> because<00:04:55.319> it<00:04:55.560> really

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
balanced or anything because it really

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.760 
balanced or anything because it really
really<00:04:56.129> was<00:04:56.370> and<00:04:56.639> it<00:04:57.240> was<00:04:57.419> just<00:04:57.719> so<00:04:58.169> much<00:04:58.409> fun

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
really was and it was just so much fun

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.980 
really was and it was just so much fun
and<00:04:59.069> they<00:04:59.430> were<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.699> best<00:04:59.909> days<00:05:00.060> for<00:05:00.210> call<00:05:00.960> of

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
and they were the best days for call of

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.649 
and they were the best days for call of
duty<00:05:01.379> and<00:05:02.060> unfortunately<00:05:03.060> those<00:05:03.240> kind<00:05:03.569> of

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
duty and unfortunately those kind of

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:05.869 
duty and unfortunately those kind of
days<00:05:03.840> are<00:05:04.169> it<00:05:04.469> seems<00:05:04.830> like<00:05:05.069> they're<00:05:05.219> over<00:05:05.580> and

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
days are it seems like they're over and

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.550 
days are it seems like they're over and
I<00:05:06.120> don't<00:05:06.419> think<00:05:06.629> the<00:05:06.719> gaming<00:05:06.990> industry<00:05:07.050> will

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
I don't think the gaming industry will

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.339 
I don't think the gaming industry will
ever<00:05:07.800> see<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.490> game<00:05:08.759> like<00:05:09.449> that<00:05:09.509> game<00:05:10.020> ever

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
ever see a game like that game ever

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.309 
ever see a game like that game ever
again<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:10.860> yeah<00:05:11.789> it<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.569> kind<00:05:12.900> of<00:05:13.050> depressing

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
again and yeah it is kind of depressing

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.290 
again and yeah it is kind of depressing
they<00:05:14.129> were<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.370> days<00:05:14.550> when<00:05:14.759> anything<00:05:15.210> was

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
they were the days when anything was

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.600 
they were the days when anything was
possible<00:05:15.479> on<00:05:15.900> youtube<00:05:16.349> so<00:05:16.860> as<00:05:16.979> I<00:05:17.129> said<00:05:17.189> this<00:05:17.460> is

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
possible on youtube so as I said this is

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.399 
possible on youtube so as I said this is
not<00:05:17.759> the<00:05:17.939> end<00:05:17.969> of<00:05:18.389> me<00:05:18.449> in<00:05:18.719> my<00:05:18.750> channel<00:05:19.289> I'm
