just an unboxing but I'll start off by

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.870 
just an unboxing but I'll start off by
pointing<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.920> two<00:00:26.220> main<00:00:26.400> features<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
pointing out the two main features of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
pointing out the two main features of
this<00:00:27.390> actual<00:00:27.720> case<00:00:28.019> which<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.769> illustrated

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
this actual case which are illustrated

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.980 
this actual case which are illustrated
right<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> back<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> packaging<00:00:30.570> as

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
right at the back of the packaging as

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.120 
right at the back of the packaging as
you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.439> you've<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:31.619> two<00:00:32.009> different

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you can see you've got two different

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.889 
you can see you've got two different
modes<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> left<00:00:33.120> hand<00:00:33.360> side<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.750> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
modes on the left hand side we have a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.290 
modes on the left hand side we have a
Productivity<00:00:34.500> mode<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> right<00:00:36.059> hand

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
Productivity mode and on the right hand

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.660 
Productivity mode and on the right hand
side<00:00:36.390> media<00:00:37.110> consumption<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.280> fairly

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
side media consumption so fairly

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.000 
side media consumption so fairly
straightforward<00:00:39.260> basically<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.530> would<00:00:40.860> say

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
straightforward basically I would say

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.280 
straightforward basically I would say
standard<00:00:41.820> fare<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.480> you'd<00:00:42.600> expect<00:00:42.719> from

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
standard fare for what you'd expect from

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.889 
standard fare for what you'd expect from
a<00:00:43.530> case<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.730> only<00:00:44.850> thing<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.450> really<00:00:45.629> adds

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
a case the only thing that really adds

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.979 
a case the only thing that really adds
to<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:47.730> overall<00:00:48.180> experience<00:00:48.510> beyond

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
to this the overall experience beyond

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.630 
to this the overall experience beyond
the<00:00:49.110> protection<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.739> case<00:00:49.920> offers<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.460> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the protection the case offers is that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360 
the protection the case offers is that
it<00:00:50.760> does<00:00:50.940> have<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.500> magnetized<00:00:52.500> front<00:00:52.739> cover

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it does have a magnetized front cover

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.450 
it does have a magnetized front cover
which<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:54.120> allow<00:00:54.420> similar<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.199> Apple<00:00:56.129> Smart

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
which will allow similar to Apple Smart

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.240 
which will allow similar to Apple Smart
Cover<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.059> ability<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:58.140> basically<00:00:58.500> bring<00:00:59.070> up

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
Cover the ability to basically bring up

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.700 
Cover the ability to basically bring up
the<00:00:59.430> tablet's<00:00:59.940> backlight<00:01:00.449> without<00:01:01.079> having<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the tablet's backlight without having to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.799 
the tablet's backlight without having to
actually<00:01:02.370> press<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.879> backlight<00:01:03.300> button<00:01:03.510> so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
actually press the backlight button so

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.090 
actually press the backlight button so
essentially<00:01:04.140> whenever<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> open<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.860> cover

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
essentially whenever you open the cover

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
essentially whenever you open the cover
your<00:01:05.640> back<00:01:05.850> light<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.270> come<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
your back light will come on and of

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.330 
your back light will come on and of
course<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.380> decide<00:01:07.680> whether<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
course you can decide whether or not to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
course you can decide whether or not to
turn<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:09.000> off<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.270> lock<00:01:09.450> screen

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
lock screen or backlight button
technically<00:01:15.060> which<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.570> certainly<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.229> nice

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
technically which is certainly a nice

technically which is certainly a nice
addition<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:18.030> case<00:01:18.270> worth<00:01:18.930> $50<00:01:19.650> in

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
addition now is this case worth $50 in

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
addition now is this case worth $50 in
my<00:01:19.860> opinion<00:01:20.250> absolutely<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.659> part<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
my opinion absolutely not but part of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.999 
my opinion absolutely not but part of
the<00:01:21.960> reason<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.350> sharing<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> guys

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.270 
the reason I'm sharing it with you guys
is<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.880> price<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.659> about<00:01:25.320> half<00:01:25.710> now<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
is that it's price is about half now of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.969 
is that it's price is about half now of
what<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.759> originally<00:01:27.330> launched<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.619> the

I<00:01:41.820> mentioned<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.509> very<00:01:42.899> similar<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.670> other

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
I mentioned it's very similar to other

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.319 
I mentioned it's very similar to other
book<00:01:46.049> cover<00:01:46.320> cases<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:47.159> Samsung<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.090> you're

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
book cover cases from Samsung so you're

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.789 
book cover cases from Samsung so you're
not<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.869> shocked<00:01:49.110> by<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> design

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
not going to be shocked by the design

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.830 
not going to be shocked by the design
there<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.700> several<00:01:50.970> different<00:01:51.420> colors<00:01:51.689> I

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
there are several different colors I

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260 
there are several different colors I
think<00:01:51.899> four<00:01:52.290> or<00:01:52.320> five<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.979> total<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.520> went<00:01:54.119> with

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
think four or five in total I went with

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.090 
think four or five in total I went with
what<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:54.930> opinion<00:01:54.960> represents<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> most

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
what in my opinion represents the most

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.109 
what in my opinion represents the most
subdued

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
subdued

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.569 
subdued
although<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:57.930> am<00:01:58.170> matching<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
although I am matching it up with a

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760 
although I am matching it up with a
white<00:02:00.390> note<00:02:00.719> which<00:02:01.049> will<00:02:01.259> see<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:01.619> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
white note which will see what that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.100 
white note which will see what that
looks<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> moment<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> little

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
looks like in a moment I was a little

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.899 
looks like in a moment I was a little
bit<00:02:04.229> concerned<00:02:04.560> about<00:02:04.680> doing<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.130> clash<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
bit concerned about doing a clash on the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.300 
bit concerned about doing a clash on the
colors<00:02:06.210> but<00:02:06.420> quite<00:02:06.630> frankly<00:02:07.190> some<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
colors but quite frankly some of the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.160 
colors but quite frankly some of the
colors<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:08.789> more<00:02:08.970> expensive<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.929> one

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
colors are more expensive and this one

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.240 
colors are more expensive and this one
is<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:11.370> my<00:02:11.430> opinion<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.030> nicest<00:02:12.390> case

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
is in my opinion the nicest case

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.520 
is in my opinion the nicest case
so<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> fact<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.330> price<00:02:14.570> also<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
so the fact that the price also is the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.130 
so the fact that the price also is the
softest<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.310> just<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.700> benefit<00:02:17.360> let's<00:02:17.900> go<00:02:18.050> ahead

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
softest is just a benefit let's go ahead

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.170 
softest is just a benefit let's go ahead
and<00:02:18.320> take<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> look<00:02:18.620> at<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.950> inside

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
and take a look at the inside

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.870 
and take a look at the inside
I've<00:02:20.420> got<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.840> little<00:02:21.020> styrofoam<00:02:21.590> inlay<00:02:22.010> some

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
I've got a little styrofoam inlay some

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.640 
I've got a little styrofoam inlay some
instructions<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.660> basically<00:02:23.990> Samsung

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
instructions so basically Samsung

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.980 
instructions so basically Samsung
telling<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.130> exactly<00:02:25.580> how<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.180> case<00:02:26.420> can<00:02:26.810> be

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
telling you exactly how this case can be

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.280 
telling you exactly how this case can be
used<00:02:27.260> as<00:02:27.470> well<00:02:28.040> as<00:02:28.160> how<00:02:28.520> not<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.180> use<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.420> again

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
used as well as how not to use it again

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.740 
used as well as how not to use it again
this<00:02:30.440> is<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:30.770> driven<00:02:31.070> by<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.480> magnets<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.690> the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
this is all driven by the magnets on the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.350 
this is all driven by the magnets on the
front<00:02:33.740> cover<00:02:33.980> they<00:02:34.550> will<00:02:34.700> actually<00:02:34.880> stick<00:02:35.330> to

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
front cover they will actually stick to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.970 
front cover they will actually stick to
the<00:02:35.540> back<00:02:35.750> case<00:02:36.080> I'll<00:02:36.440> give<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.650> guys<00:02:36.770> an

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
the back case I'll give you guys an

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.620 
the back case I'll give you guys an
example<00:02:37.040> right<00:02:37.550> now<00:02:37.730> let<00:02:37.880> me<00:02:37.940> just<00:02:38.000> get<00:02:38.420> rid<00:02:38.540> of

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
example right now let me just get rid of

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.530 
example right now let me just get rid of
this<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:40.460> you<00:02:40.550> can<00:02:40.580> see<00:02:40.790> they've<00:02:40.940> got<00:02:40.970> cutouts

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
this and you can see they've got cutouts

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.380 
this and you can see they've got cutouts
for<00:02:41.870> everything<00:02:42.530> as<00:02:42.710> you'd<00:02:42.890> expect<00:02:43.310> with<00:02:44.210> a

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
for everything as you'd expect with a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.480 
for everything as you'd expect with a
case<00:02:44.720> designed<00:02:45.200> by<00:02:45.470> Samsung<00:02:46.130> made

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
case designed by Samsung made

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.130 
case designed by Samsung made
specifically<00:02:47.030> for<00:02:47.180> their<00:02:47.570> own<00:02:47.690> product

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
specifically for their own product

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.720 
specifically for their own product
they're<00:02:48.590> really<00:02:48.890> at<00:02:49.100> least<00:02:49.340> from<00:02:49.460> what<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.640> can

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
they're really at least from what I can

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.250 
they're really at least from what I can
see<00:02:49.850> right<00:02:50.120> now<00:02:50.270> have<00:02:50.450> done<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> very<00:02:50.990> nice<00:02:51.200> job

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
see right now have done a very nice job

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.930 
see right now have done a very nice job
of<00:02:51.770> accommodating<00:02:52.840> everything<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:54.050> terms<00:02:54.320> of

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
of accommodating everything in terms of

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.630 
of accommodating everything in terms of
microphones<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:57.190> mean<00:02:58.190> you'll<00:02:58.340> see<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.580> a

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
microphones I mean you'll see in a

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.290 
microphones I mean you'll see in a
moment<00:02:58.790> as<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.090> actually<00:02:59.590> put<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.890> note<00:03:01.610> 8<00:03:01.850> into

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
moment as I actually put the note 8 into

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.780 
moment as I actually put the note 8 into
the<00:03:02.390> case<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:02.930> overall<00:03:03.200> just<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:04.370> know<00:03:04.460> for

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
the case but overall just you know for

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.580 
the case but overall just you know for
what<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:05.660> certainly<00:03:05.840> one<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.440> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
what it is it's certainly one of the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.070 
what it is it's certainly one of the
nicer<00:03:07.040> book<00:03:08.030> covers<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.540> I've<00:03:08.660> ever<00:03:08.810> seen

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
nicer book covers that I've ever seen

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.230 
nicer book covers that I've ever seen
Samsung<00:03:09.680> make<00:03:09.920> which<00:03:10.580> is<00:03:10.610> certainly<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.120> good

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
Samsung make which is certainly a good

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.640 
Samsung make which is certainly a good
thing<00:03:11.300> because<00:03:11.570> again<00:03:11.900> they<00:03:12.050> are<00:03:12.170> asking<00:03:12.560> a

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
thing because again they are asking a

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.560 
thing because again they are asking a
lot<00:03:12.800> for<00:03:12.950> these<00:03:13.070> arguably<00:03:13.910> even<00:03:14.330> at<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
lot for these arguably even at the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.780 
lot for these arguably even at the
reduced<00:03:14.870> price<00:03:15.110> but<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.380> have<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.650> say<00:03:15.860> when<00:03:16.700> you

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
reduced price but I have to say when you

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.490 
reduced price but I have to say when you
look<00:03:16.970> at<00:03:17.090> generic<00:03:17.480> cases<00:03:17.870> for<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.170> note<00:03:18.320> 8

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
look at generic cases for the note 8

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.320 
look at generic cases for the note 8
they're<00:03:18.739> gonna<00:03:18.920> fall<00:03:19.250> into<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.730> price<00:03:20.000> range

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
they're gonna fall into this price range

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.810 
they're gonna fall into this price range
for<00:03:20.420> at<00:03:20.660> least<00:03:20.810> well-made<00:03:21.650> ones<00:03:21.920> granted<00:03:22.730> this

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
for at least well-made ones granted this

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.360 
for at least well-made ones granted this
isn't<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.270> most<00:03:23.480> ruggedized<00:03:24.170> but<00:03:24.890> certainly

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
isn't the most ruggedized but certainly

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.420 
isn't the most ruggedized but certainly
nice<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.239> with<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.900> said<00:03:27.680> let's<00:03:27.950> get<00:03:28.100> it<00:03:28.220> into

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
nice so with that said let's get it into

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.630 
nice so with that said let's get it into
the<00:03:28.730> actual<00:03:29.450> case<00:03:29.810> here<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:31.160> then<00:03:31.280> I'll<00:03:31.400> show

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
the actual case here and then I'll show

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.350 
the actual case here and then I'll show
you<00:03:31.670> what<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:31.970> was<00:03:32.180> talking<00:03:32.660> about<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:35.150> just

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
you what I was talking about you just

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.900 
you what I was talking about you just

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
pop it in really easy not gonna have any

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.490 
pop it in really easy not gonna have any
problem<00:03:38.420> that's<00:03:38.570> not<00:03:38.720> going<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.900> represent<00:03:39.080> a

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
problem that's not going to represent a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.260 
problem that's not going to represent a
challenge<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:40.070> any<00:03:40.220> user<00:03:40.520> out<00:03:40.790> there<00:03:41.060> and

challenge to any user out there and
there<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:42.050> have<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.680> do<00:03:43.160> like<00:03:43.550> that<00:03:43.580> you

there you have it I do like that you
really<00:03:44.480> get<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:45.290> textured<00:03:45.860> finish<00:03:46.220> almost

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
really get that textured finish almost

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.880 
really get that textured finish almost
as<00:03:46.790> if<00:03:46.940> there<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.300> not<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:47.810> case<00:03:48.080> on<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.650> device

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
as if there is not a case on the device

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.030 
as if there is not a case on the device
something<00:03:49.610> that<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.290> book<00:03:51.290> cover<00:03:51.530> case

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
something that the book cover case

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.710 
something that the book cover case
lineup<00:03:52.550> is<00:03:52.730> really<00:03:53.030> all<00:03:53.150> about<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:53.600> know<00:03:53.690> a

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
lineup is really all about you know a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.259 
lineup is really all about you know a
seamless<00:03:54.500> case<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.430> that's<00:03:55.940> what<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:56.120> get

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
seamless case and that's what you get

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.940 
seamless case and that's what you get
here<00:03:56.480> plus<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:57.019> additional<00:03:57.350> features<00:03:57.709> now

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950

the<00:03:58.239> magnetic<00:03:59.239> stuff<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.780> was<00:03:59.900> talking<00:04:00.050> about

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
the magnetic stuff I was talking about

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.410 
the magnetic stuff I was talking about
before<00:04:00.650> just<00:04:00.830> an<00:04:00.920> example<00:04:01.430> is<00:04:01.610> if<00:04:02.150> you're<00:04:02.300> in

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
before just an example is if you're in

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.240 
before just an example is if you're in
the<00:04:02.510> productivity<00:04:03.140> mode<00:04:03.350> as<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.620> can<00:04:03.739> see<00:04:03.950> it

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
the productivity mode as you can see it

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.580 
the productivity mode as you can see it
just<00:04:04.489> locked<00:04:04.880> in<00:04:05.090> there<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:06.230> that's<00:04:06.410> the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
just locked in there and that's the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.070 
just locked in there and that's the
magnet<00:04:07.070> at<00:04:07.220> work<00:04:07.640> I'm<00:04:08.330> not<00:04:08.600> sure<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:08.989> it

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
magnet at work I'm not sure that it

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.250 
magnet at work I'm not sure that it
works<00:04:09.260> as<00:04:09.500> well<00:04:09.769> in<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.660> viewing<00:04:11.660> mode

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
works as well in the viewing mode

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.630 
works as well in the viewing mode
I<00:04:12.290> haven't<00:04:12.769> played<00:04:12.860> around<00:04:13.070> with<00:04:13.370> this

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
I haven't played around with this

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.310 
I haven't played around with this
obviously<00:04:14.239> but<00:04:14.450> I<00:04:14.480> have<00:04:14.660> seen<00:04:14.900> this<00:04:15.080> case

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
obviously but I have seen this case

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.409 
obviously but I have seen this case
before<00:04:15.580> overall<00:04:16.580> though<00:04:16.790> again<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.209> think

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
before overall though again I just think

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.740 
before overall though again I just think
it<00:04:18.019> does<00:04:18.230> a<00:04:18.260> very<00:04:18.380> nice<00:04:19.190> job<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.820> giving<00:04:20.150> you<00:04:20.480> at

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
it does a very nice job of giving you at

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.230 
it does a very nice job of giving you at
least<00:04:21.229> basic<00:04:21.739> protection<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.850> covers<00:04:23.210> just

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
least basic protection it covers just

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.700 
least basic protection it covers just
about<00:04:23.539> everything<00:04:23.690> as<00:04:24.229> you<00:04:24.289> can<00:04:24.410> see<00:04:24.530> on<00:04:24.620> the

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
about everything as you can see on the

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.430 
about everything as you can see on the
right<00:04:24.890> hand<00:04:25.100> side<00:04:25.190> of

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
right hand side of

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.070 
right hand side of
tablet<00:04:25.890> right<00:04:26.010> here<00:04:26.070> we<00:04:26.850> do<00:04:27.030> have<00:04:27.080> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
tablet right here we do have the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.750 
tablet right here we do have the
infrared<00:04:28.470> port<00:04:28.860> exposed<00:04:29.250> as<00:04:29.460> well<00:04:29.490> as<00:04:29.670> the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
infrared port exposed as well as the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.120 
infrared port exposed as well as the
volume<00:04:30.120> rocker<00:04:30.390> power<00:04:30.990> button<00:04:31.470> which

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
volume rocker power button which

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.130 
volume rocker power button which
obviously<00:04:32.460> you'll<00:04:32.850> need<00:04:33.240> less<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.690> with<00:04:33.990> the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
obviously you'll need less of with the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.450 
obviously you'll need less of with the
magnetic<00:04:34.440> smart<00:04:34.920> type<00:04:35.490> cover<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:37.430> access<00:04:38.430> to

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
magnetic smart type cover and access to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.640 
magnetic smart type cover and access to
the<00:04:38.670> s-pen<00:04:39.150> there's<00:04:39.360> even<00:04:39.630> some<00:04:39.870> rubber<00:04:40.230> here

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
the s-pen there's even some rubber here

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.990 
the s-pen there's even some rubber here
in<00:04:40.800> order<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.250> give<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.520> little<00:04:41.670> bit<00:04:41.910> of

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
in order to give it a little bit of

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.090 
in order to give it a little bit of
shock<00:04:42.210> absorption<00:04:42.480> but<00:04:43.080> that's<00:04:43.260> really<00:04:43.980> not

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
shock absorption but that's really not

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.470 
shock absorption but that's really not
going<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.280> be<00:04:44.340> quite<00:04:44.640> much<00:04:44.850> so<00:04:45.000> don't<00:04:45.120> rely<00:04:45.450> on

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
going to be quite much so don't rely on

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.020 
going to be quite much so don't rely on
it<00:04:45.630> they've<00:04:46.470> even<00:04:46.740> brought<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.310> bezel<00:04:47.640> around

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
it they've even brought the bezel around

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.690 
it they've even brought the bezel around
the<00:04:48.210> camera<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.900> mean<00:04:49.440> just<00:04:49.650> every<00:04:49.980> detail<00:04:50.430> is

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
the camera I mean just every detail is

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.010 
the camera I mean just every detail is
there<00:04:50.910> since<00:04:51.210> there's<00:04:51.360> nothing<00:04:51.480> on<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.810> left

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
there since there's nothing on the left

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.830 
there since there's nothing on the left
side<00:04:52.490> clearly<00:04:53.490> no<00:04:54.060> reason<00:04:54.450> to<00:04:54.540> have<00:04:54.690> any

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
side clearly no reason to have any

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.110 
side clearly no reason to have any
access<00:04:55.320> there<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.680> anything<00:04:56.070> bottom<00:04:56.850> of<00:04:56.970> the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
access there to anything bottom of the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.750 
access there to anything bottom of the
tablet<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.750> course<00:04:58.470> still<00:04:59.160> need<00:04:59.310> access<00:04:59.460> to

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
tablet of course still need access to

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.540 
tablet of course still need access to
the<00:05:00.230> charging<00:05:01.230> port<00:05:01.440> as<00:05:01.710> well<00:05:01.740> as<00:05:02.070> the

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
the charging port as well as the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.270 
the charging port as well as the
speaker's<00:05:03.030> so<00:05:03.630> everything<00:05:04.410> is<00:05:04.620> still<00:05:04.830> clearly

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
speaker's so everything is still clearly

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.580 
speaker's so everything is still clearly
accessible<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.480> then<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.780> course<00:05:07.020> at<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.350> top

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
accessible and then of course at the top

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.740 
accessible and then of course at the top
we've<00:05:08.370> got<00:05:08.580> access<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:09.180> our<00:05:09.270> three-and-a-half
