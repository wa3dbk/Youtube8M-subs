00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.080
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.630
 Review of maxis technically and indeed goes 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.119
 it's about the gaming keyboard sharkoon today 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.250
 player I bought at alternate de 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.699
 but I will down the company 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.320
 in the description link 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:42.300
 and yes in the scope of delivery are on the one hand 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:50.100
 So they share these keys that these 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:52.370
 feel this rubber and then stop 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.370
 still 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.409
 they are touching this one in black 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:11.110
 by default in here and here 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:17.790
 then this is partly take out 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 Maybe it has to be there for example 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:35.819
 therefore more important than ever just more 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:35.819
 so happy and not out there and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.090
 such a false case if it is now 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.850
 little rushes that's my computer 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.500
 but I do not think so because he is straight 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:03.960
 pretty heavy but still there are 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:06.689
 here are the drivers and drivers cd where 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.209
 also the program on it is for the 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.039
 levels around the keyboard layout so 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.450
 key assignment but I will you 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:20.790
 still on pc show but let's come 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:30.260
 to keyboard itself here is next to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:34.140
 the browser before back 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:40.310
 in principle, e5 then update 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:43.200
 save as favorites home page and 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.390
 then here you go to the desktop, the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.079
 opens the library or the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:54.799
 workplace e-mail just opens 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:57.959
 windows outlook - office outlook around 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.940
 then task manager simply seeking halt 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.430
 just search for computers 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.930
 in addition to the computer and media easy 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.030
 mediaplayer then down here bakom here 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 this is a load with it for the killer 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.370
 which lights up when the pc anis and if 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.940
 he is out but you can see if the pc 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.890
 is seen firstly on the pc itself and 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:30.590
 Up here on the led you can see the then 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.590
 then here too 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.340
 then here is just back and forth 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.930
 again as a man behind film browser 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.349
 So that does not mean that's just that 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.349
 just for library or but 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.680
 stayed here and then what I really cool 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.849
 Financial keyboard is that the power is 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.639
 that means you always have to 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.049
 go to the start menu and just open 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.250
 Shut down press one presses 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:05.709
 easy on farmers thanks to their 14 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:11.909
 automatically off and then here is for 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:15.129
 here is pause and media player 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:21.160
 then continue here stops louder 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:24.030
 quieter and silent so then I show 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:30.940
 you the rest on the pc until the same 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:37.740
 hello and yes only here on the pc and yes 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.740
 So let's open that 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.130
 here should 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:50.509
 So yes you can do it in three 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:54.550
 then divide it into different levels 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.550
 Here are many choose 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.139
 Here I have it for example 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.569
 is now there comes to me there you can 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:08.960
 Looks more like this button presses 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:14.629
 now comes this thing and 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.460
 So the browser and yes so I think 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:20.439
 know it is done pretty well 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:23.360
 I find modern design now 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.009
 and yes and as you can see here on the 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:33.469
 the first level is more but nothing on 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:35.479
 second level is alright well so then here 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:43.610
 second level I can prove the number 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:46.629
 I can do that, for example 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.629
 make but broke off 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.930
 Visitors and then we go 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:11.060
 Here comes like that 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:13.419
 Let's just think then just come to 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.419
 search 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.340
 level reset we'll do that 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.890
 woman now I do not need that anyway 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.230
 give 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.180
 and yes I can for example too 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:32.390
 here you can, for example, until 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.740
 enter or here is office 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.280
 I'm not at the moment I have to 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.960
 first get 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.960
 and yes and up here you can help 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.140
 would 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.890
 here was extended what update check 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.960
 in planning 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.440
 that looks good and then here 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.440
 Out 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.250
 I imagine all sorts ago 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:30.229
 then windows me and then it was synonymous 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:30.229
 everything and everything
