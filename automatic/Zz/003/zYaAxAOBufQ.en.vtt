00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
you want to make sure you can see really

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.250 
you want to make sure you can see really
well<00:01:54.800> good<00:01:55.220> lighting<00:01:55.520> if<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.480> wear<00:01:56.990> reading

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
well good lighting if you wear reading

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.940 
well good lighting if you wear reading
glasses<00:01:57.410> put<00:01:58.100> those<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:59.260> so<00:02:00.260> you<00:02:00.350> can<00:02:00.530> see<00:02:00.710> just

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
glasses put those on so you can see just

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.270 
glasses put those on so you can see just
what<00:02:01.400> you're<00:02:01.580> doing<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.600> little<00:02:06.280> guard

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
what you're doing so that little guard

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.419 
what you're doing so that little guard
thing<00:02:07.989> keeps<00:02:08.989> it<00:02:09.229> from<00:02:09.349> going<00:02:09.530> down<00:02:09.830> real<00:02:10.099> far

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
thing keeps it from going down real far

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.030 
thing keeps it from going down real far
because<00:02:11.180> if<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.450> go<00:02:11.599> down<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.140> pink<00:02:12.709> area

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
because if you go down to the pink area

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.699 
because if you go down to the pink area
you<00:02:13.730> know<00:02:13.849> you<00:02:14.000> are<00:02:14.180> actually<00:02:14.590> getting<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
you know you are actually getting a

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.190 
you know you are actually getting a
little<00:02:15.860> bleep<00:02:16.129> it's<00:02:16.700> pretty<00:02:17.510> traumatic<00:02:17.840> so

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
little bleep it's pretty traumatic so

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.500 
little bleep it's pretty traumatic so
you<00:02:18.260> make<00:02:18.560> sure<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:19.129> you've<00:02:19.280> got<00:02:19.310> that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
you make sure that you've got that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.480 
you make sure that you've got that
safety<00:02:20.510> guard<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:23.680> if<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.190> do<00:02:25.340> it

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
safety guard on and that if you do it
