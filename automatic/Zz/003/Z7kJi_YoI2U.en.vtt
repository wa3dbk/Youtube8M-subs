00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.180
 dvd review and it is again 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.099
 weekend and there it is time for the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.719
 tip for the weekend I know that you 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.469
 but I'll never do that again 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.929
 to repeat 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.280
 and if you have sunday at 20.15 film 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.379
 wants to look should watch TV in one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.150
 definitely the social network foam in the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.390
 Film is very interesting for sport 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 is done well and that like many before 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.930
 Jesse Eisenberg played a leading role 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.310
 is pretty neat and that makes 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.439
 a lot of fun to watch the movie 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.240
 Unfortunately , I already have a criticism 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.949
 and that's why it's today 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.050
 I 'm the second to go to the film 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.110
 would look at the shows rtl am 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:44.550
 sunday and 20:15 namely x-men origins 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:47.180
 wolverine all the dreadful things in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180
 your life 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.780
 the wars 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.149
 to know that the woman you lived 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.149
 hunted and killed 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.870
 I can forget all that 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.570
 I put together a team of specialists 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:15.610
 along with special privileges 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.150
 Join in and you will be your thing 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.150
 to get 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.390
 I want new ones 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.390
 and what should be on them 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.799
 she had to the animal for poor the other 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.579
 page 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.579
 I think she heard 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.900
 do not worry we stop him 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:00.270
 we have a fortune for his 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:03.110
 indestructible I know who 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.110
 you are changed 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.180
 no mercy 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.410
 no rules 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.390
 no law 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.150
 x-men origins wolverine knows that 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.019
 I want to kill myself again I cut 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.150
 your head off 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.480
 let's see if that works soon 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.480
 only in the cinema 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.290
 x-men origins wolverine year 2009 106 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.910
 minutes in the extended ethernet seven 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.200
 minutes one minute more very rare 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.239
 that the difference is so close but 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.040
 what is it all about, and indeed it works 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.019
 even though we have him and his story 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.120
 behind it played by hugh jackman and 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.160
 is a kind of prequel in front of the x-men 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.720
 trilogy we had previously told 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.250
 We should not know how it came about and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.630
 mainly of course all of them 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.489
 story around the figure of 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 Wolverine like him at his parents' house 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.920
 big becomes logan together with his 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.299
 Brother puts you here played by liev 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.890
 writers in actors who are not considered 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.390
 absolutely undervalued think that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.310
 hollywood plays great every time 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.079
 and so many varied characters 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.579
 yes and these two brothers live through 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.920
 the history of time and several wars 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.959
 are invulnerable with a mutation 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.049
 to carry them in until one day 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.810
 an elite group of a kind mutant yes 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.740
 elite isolate your ways separate 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.660
 and 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.280
 but always loving brothers 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.230
 At some point you will be enemies and then 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.700
 is the story about his wolverine 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.920
 of all skeleton and all that 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.540
 associated narrates also gives way 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.550
 little of the original of the first three 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.470
 But it's a very interesting part 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.030
 number for all the x-men anyway 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.920
 series like it still here the one 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.560
 or another difference gives but 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.570
 later as director monogamous again 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.980
 was gavin hood also at those 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.030
 a first three share was with it 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.380
 as a director 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.180
 that's always done pretty well 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.350
 and babbel has the dark look too 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.370
 a little in the direction already 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.570
 as it has done in the last few years 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.160
 are used to 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.840
 That was one of the newer attempts 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.540
 own fabric even ufa film &amp; me 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.030
 I think I succeeded that x-men 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.830
 origins wolverine my favorite or 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.510
 my second favorite x-men part is beside 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.610
 the latest disposal first class 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.200
 better than the first three parts though 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.420
 he does not have these partners 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.250
 quite often this question is missing 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.780
 we know what the x-men series like in 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.700
 how far can one intervene 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.230
 to help humankind and to what extent 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.760
 you have responsibility for a special one 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.860
 ability to survive and to what extent 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.540
 is reflected in great power too 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.890
 great responsibility again all of these 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.480
 Questions will not really be in here 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.700
 moved the foreground but more 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.500
 or less a 08 15 blockbuster the 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.930
 conjured up around hugh jackman and 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.820
 just his character wolverine something 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.770
 there is no harm and so much potential 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.630
 loses one hand, I see hugh 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.400
 jackman so incredibly like me 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.320
 Nevertheless, a lot of fun has the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.670
 Action is well done by the actors 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.560
 well chosen for example still by 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.150
 William and Ryan Reynolds agents and the 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.040
 one or 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.300
 face known, we also have in 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.010
 get this strip gives it 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.780
 one or the other to the end 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.250
 you did not necessarily expect it 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.990
 the showdown turn on again 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.430
 but little is weak 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.380
 trained hugh jackman the 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.180
 really only from muscles and testosterone 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.520
 This is especially true for women 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.960
 eye candy and can at least as far as it 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.880
 the whole action is already hung 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.020
 wear on his shoulders and that's why 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.360
 makes this movie for me more than 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.310
 action comic filming much more fun 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.750
 but for the really hard-boiled 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.340
 comic fans maybe a little bit too 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.620
 Lasch and soft washed you have to at the 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.360
 say it is just a whole lot more 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.830
 subjective opinion the direction because I 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.290
 just a huge hugh jackman 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.790
 fan if the x-men origins wolverine 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.140
 Never seen the trip like this 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.430
 I should like it anyway 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.810
 watch every case on the weekend then 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.680
 maybe even the social network 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.120
 leave left 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.920
 for me, the movie gets as 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.480
 blockbuster you have seen once 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.460
 can definitely be worth seeing 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.990
 but do not have to see two three times as 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.520
 action comic filming definitely 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.980
 seven and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.810
 because i really enjoy it though 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.730
 now that some shoot against it 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.470
 especially since I am x-men first 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.820
 class sometime relatively bad 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.590
 have rated and that also one of my 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.300
 the biggest hindsight is a mistake 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.890
 I have to admit to it 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.870
 the movie is far better than me 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.550
 have then seen in affective ago 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.100
 seen everything at the two-three times 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.570
 but what's the point when he's considered as 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.330
 total value then I give then x-men 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.770
 origins wolverine very neat and 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.110
 acceptable seven out of ten possible 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.910
 score worth seeing is not a must 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.800
 you can see exactly what's right for fans 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.570
 you look at sunday at 20 15 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.850
 leave me comments otherwise I would 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.350
