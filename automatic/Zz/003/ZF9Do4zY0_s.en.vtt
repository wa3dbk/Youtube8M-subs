 It is in my box because I 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.200
 I want to teach that for example this is 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.879
 what I use for service 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.590
 domicile which is what in reality 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.250
 I work in a store that in my 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.819
 house and then I put them here but 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.530
 when my home delivery but the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:37.530
 true if it is somewhat heavy 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:41.530
 take it well in hand not then then I 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.910
 I made a cart to give it 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:48.010
 I did this cart with ya see that the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.340
 children's backpacks serve 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.050
 as a good structure to this 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.790
 structure will remove the bolus that the 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.750
 backpack and on that amount the box just 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.720
 he tied it with 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.269
 contact with tape contact the and then 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.990

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.620
