00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
segment we're to talk about how to grow

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.530 
segment we're to talk about how to grow
a<00:00:09.510> peach<00:00:09.809> tree<00:00:10.110> indoors<00:00:10.910> now<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:11.969> materials

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
a peach tree indoors now the materials

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.790 
a peach tree indoors now the materials
that<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.780> will<00:00:12.929> need<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.910> either<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.030> peach

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
that you will need are either a peach

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.529 
that you will need are either a peach
pit<00:00:16.800> or<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.730> seed<00:00:18.560> or<00:00:19.580> much<00:00:20.580> easier<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.390> get

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
pit or a seed or much easier to get

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.830 
pit or a seed or much easier to get
actually<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> peach<00:00:22.500> tree<00:00:22.949> start<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.600> way

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
actually a peach tree start and that way

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.259 
actually a peach tree start and that way
you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.470> grow<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.890> much<00:00:26.099> easier<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:26.939> it's

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you can grow it much easier because it's

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.120 
you can grow it much easier because it's
really<00:00:27.480> hard<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> grow<00:00:27.960> from<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.230> seed<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.710> lot<00:00:29.070> of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
really hard to grow from a seed a lot of

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.859 
really hard to grow from a seed a lot of
times<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.490> let<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.849> fruit<00:00:30.179> rot<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
times you can just let the fruit rot and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
times you can just let the fruit rot and
then<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.800> seed<00:00:32.040> will<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.550> good<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.910> turn

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
then the seed will be good you turn

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.639 
then the seed will be good you turn
around<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.360> plant<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> lot<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> times

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
around and plant it but a lot of times

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.530 
around and plant it but a lot of times
the<00:00:34.770> fresh<00:00:34.980> seeds<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.640> germinate

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the fresh seeds do not germinate

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.729 
the fresh seeds do not germinate
you'll<00:00:37.230> also<00:00:37.380> need<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> container<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.739> some

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
tree it does not like to sit in water so

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
tree it does not like to sit in water so
once<00:00:55.469> you've<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.010> materials<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.360> best

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
once you've got your materials the best

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.119 
once you've got your materials the best
thing<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.289> fill<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> bottom<00:00:59.100> with

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
thing to do is fill the bottom with

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.490 
thing to do is fill the bottom with
gravel<00:00:59.850> because<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.600> good<00:01:00.840> drainage<00:01:01.109> so

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
gravel because that's good drainage so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.049 
gravel because that's good drainage so
the<00:01:01.620> first<00:01:01.829> step<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> gravel<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the first step is the gravel on the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.060 
the first step is the gravel on the
bottom<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.510> pot<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.260> order<00:01:04.710> for<00:01:04.890> peach

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
bottom of your pot in order for peach

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
bottom of your pot in order for peach
tree<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.580> grow<00:01:05.700> well<00:01:06.000> indoors<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.869> needs<00:01:07.049> lots

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
drainage so a lot of times of putting it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
drainage so a lot of times of putting it
in<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.579> tray<00:01:53.880> with<00:01:54.090> gravel<00:01:54.570> underneath<00:01:55.020> with
