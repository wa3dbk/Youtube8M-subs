00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
that nowadays I usually just use it on a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
while I teach whenever that happens

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.950 
while I teach whenever that happens
still<00:01:10.810> sounds<00:01:11.580> decent<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.940> got<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.210> tuned<00:01:13.450> up<00:01:13.630> so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
still sounds decent I got it tuned up so

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.730

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.480 
it's a reasonable sounding snare and uh
it's<00:01:18.490> still<00:01:18.789> in<00:01:18.969> good<00:01:19.180> working<00:01:19.390> condition<00:01:20.490> now

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
it's still in good working condition now

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.190 
it's still in good working condition now
the<00:01:21.549> second<00:01:22.119> one<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:23.009> six<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.189> a<00:01:24.280> half<00:01:24.460> by

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
the second one is six and a half by

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.800 
the second one is six and a half by
fourteen<00:01:26.200> it's<00:01:27.159> called<00:01:27.430> free<00:01:27.909> floating<00:01:28.329> snare

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
fourteen it's called free floating snare

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.830 
fourteen it's called free floating snare
by<00:01:29.079> pearl<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:30.670> got<00:01:30.909> a<00:01:30.939> brass<00:01:31.240> shell<00:01:31.630> in

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
by pearl and it's got a brass shell in

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.980 
by pearl and it's got a brass shell in
it<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.939> they're<00:01:33.939> really<00:01:33.969> kind<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.539> cool<00:01:34.719> the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
it and they're really kind of cool the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.359 
it and they're really kind of cool the
reason<00:01:35.320> it's<00:01:35.439> called<00:01:35.469> free<00:01:35.859> floating<00:01:36.189> is

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
reason it's called free floating is

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.649 
reason it's called free floating is
because<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:37.539> shell<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.259> not<00:01:39.329> attached<00:01:40.329> to

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
because the shell is not attached to

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.569 
because the shell is not attached to
anything<00:01:40.899> it's<00:01:41.320> sort<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.829> clamped<00:01:42.429> between

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
anything it's sort of clamped between

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.010 
anything it's sort of clamped between
the<00:01:43.119> two<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.240> can<00:01:46.390> see<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.710> head<00:01:48.009> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the two if you can see this head and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.279 
the two if you can see this head and
this<00:01:50.020> kind<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.890> piece<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:51.789> metal<00:01:52.329> it's<00:01:52.780> clamped

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
this kind of piece of metal it's clamped

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.410 
this kind of piece of metal it's clamped
between<00:01:53.590> those<00:01:54.039> two<00:01:54.310> by<00:01:54.579> virtue<00:01:54.880> of<00:01:55.060> the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
between those two by virtue of the

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.139 
between those two by virtue of the
tightening<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.960> all<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.229> lugs<00:01:56.469> and<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:58.060> you

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
tightening of all the lugs and so you

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.819 
tightening of all the lugs and so you
can<00:01:58.359> take<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.689> actual<00:01:58.990> shell<00:01:59.350> out<00:01:59.560> and

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
can take the actual shell out and

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.940 
can take the actual shell out and
replace<00:02:00.429> it<00:02:00.609> with<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:00.759> look<00:02:00.939> of<00:02:01.090> wooden<00:02:01.390> one<00:02:01.570> or

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
replace it with a look of wooden one or

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.380 
replace it with a look of wooden one or
any<00:02:02.950> other<00:02:03.189> material<00:02:03.729> they<00:02:03.850> make<00:02:04.030> several

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
any other material they make several

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.880 
any other material they make several
different<00:02:04.600> shells<00:02:05.049> that<00:02:05.229> are<00:02:05.350> exactly<00:02:05.710> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
different shells that are exactly the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.029 
different shells that are exactly the
same<00:02:06.039> size<00:02:06.310> so<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.609> can<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:09.009> all

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
same size so you can have you have all

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.670 
same size so you can have you have all
the<00:02:09.340> hardware<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.060> can<00:02:10.230> switch<00:02:11.230> out<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
the hardware and you can switch out the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.800 
the hardware and you can switch out the
shells<00:02:11.950> which<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.430> kind<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.700> neat<00:02:12.880> but<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.330> fell

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
shells which is kind of neat but I fell

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.530 
shells which is kind of neat but I fell
in<00:02:13.930> love<00:02:14.110> with<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.319> sound<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:14.890> one<00:02:15.130> so

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
in love with the sound of this one so

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.760 
in love with the sound of this one so
I'll<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.690> dealing<00:02:17.020> with<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> little<00:02:17.680> bit

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
I'll be dealing with that a little bit

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.370 
I'll be dealing with that a little bit
later<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:19.090> next<00:02:19.510> one<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.720> one<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:20.260> my
