00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
to have ambidextrous ball handling

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.930

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
your dribble will open up so many more

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.950 
your dribble will open up so many more
doors<00:00:34.829> simply<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.180> least<00:00:36.480> double

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
doors simply because you at least double

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.540 
doors simply because you at least double
the<00:00:36.989> options<00:00:37.469> available<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.190> attack

the options available to your attack

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.610 
the options available to your attack
when<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> rely<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:40.020> hand<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> carry

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
when you rely just on one hand to carry

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
when you rely just on one hand to carry
you<00:00:40.829> through<00:00:40.860> your<00:00:41.190> game<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:42.000> only<00:00:42.180> limit

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
you through your game you not only limit

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.030 
you through your game you not only limit
your<00:00:42.840> options<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.379> put<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> ball<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.950> the

your options to put the ball on the
floor<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:44.879> yourself<00:00:45.239> vulnerable

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
floor but you make yourself vulnerable

floor but you make yourself vulnerable
to<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> defense<00:00:46.469> over<00:00:46.860> playing<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.309> strong

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to the defense over playing your strong

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
to the defense over playing your strong
side<00:00:47.789> exploiting<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.660> weaknesses<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
side exploiting your weaknesses and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.990 
side exploiting your weaknesses and
completely<00:00:49.980> taking<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.430> out<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> game

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
completely taking you out of the game

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
completely taking you out of the game
and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> truth<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.140> handicap<00:00:52.680> like

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and the truth is that a handicap like

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.709 
and the truth is that a handicap like
this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.250> 100%<00:00:53.879> avoidable

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
this is 100% avoidable

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
this is 100% avoidable
if<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> put<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> necessary<00:00:55.500> work<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> develop

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
if you put the necessary work to develop

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.849 
if you put the necessary work to develop
both<00:00:56.850> hands<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.420> an<00:00:57.539> equal<00:00:57.840> ability<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.559> here's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
both hands to an equal ability so here's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
both hands to an equal ability so here's
what<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> do<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.149> first

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
what you have to do to get there first

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.000 
what you have to do to get there first
you<00:01:00.750> need<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.140> thousands<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.829> repetitions

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you need to get thousands of repetitions

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
you need to get thousands of repetitions
and<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.730> innovate<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.359> build<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:03.780> mind

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and to innovate and build your mind

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.750 
and to innovate and build your mind
muscle<00:01:04.229> connections<00:01:04.860> over<00:01:05.250> time<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
muscle connections over time the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
muscle connections over time the
consistent<00:01:06.299> repetitions<00:01:06.869> will<00:01:07.049> develop<00:01:07.439> your

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
consistent repetitions will develop your

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
consistent repetitions will develop your
muscle<00:01:08.010> memory<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> point<00:01:08.790> where<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
muscle memory to the point where you

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.370 
muscle memory to the point where you
wouldn't<00:01:09.360> even<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.200> what

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
wouldn't even have to think about what

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.940 
wouldn't even have to think about what
you're<00:01:10.530> doing

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you're doing

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.219 
you're doing
it'll<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:11.880> fingertips<00:01:12.330> second

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it'll just be in your fingertips second

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.899 
it'll just be in your fingertips second
you<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> realize<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:14.549> end<00:01:14.790> is

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
you have to realize that your off end is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.340 
you have to realize that your off end is
going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> feel<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> lot<00:01:15.659> less<00:01:15.869> comfortable

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
going to feel a lot less comfortable

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.050 
going to feel a lot less comfortable
doing<00:01:16.590> anything<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> first<00:01:17.820> start

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
doing anything when you first start

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.700 
doing anything when you first start
working<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> feel<00:01:19.320> weak

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
working with it it's going to feel weak

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
working with it it's going to feel weak
and<00:01:19.950> clumsy<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.610> you'll<00:01:20.729> probably<00:01:20.909> feel<00:01:21.330> like

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and clumsy and you'll probably feel like

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
and clumsy and you'll probably feel like
it's<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.780> lost<00:01:22.020> cause<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:22.950> how

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it's a lost cause but that's how
