00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:08.630
 that is a long way off whether from dÃ¶rr and 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.490
 Although this is a so-called fisherman 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.870
 we have a shock like that 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.730
 different camera systems so 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.469
 different cabinets i will do that 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.490
 has this example for the mark 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.560
 Sony the mount we make the lens 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.540
 turn it off to the camera and turn it off 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.400
 Of course , this film is then 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.560
 representative of the others 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.780
 wide-angle lenses for these others 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.070
 Systems cameras we then so job 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.660
 offer or 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.600
 the lenses before I am now though 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.960
 more further further just hurt 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.329
 do 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.250
 the wide-angle lens will do so 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.290
 delivered over that the cd in this 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.850
 carton for make then covers and then 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.430
 But here's a little cook with you 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.399
 a zipper and that you one 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.380
 no bend in it 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.750
 the objective that you all come with the 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.730
 foreground moves are moves the lid 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.020
 with 1 had 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.630
 then we take the appropriate 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.670
 Just solve this camera here 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.320
 original lens and then we have to 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.170
 only work with the mark 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.250
 once here red dot here that 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.049
 put sony on the white point and 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.380
 then we can do it all here 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.909
 again so irritating forward easy 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.990
 then again the cap off and on seven 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.450
 we then here the wide-angle lens 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.710
 here the fresh amnesty next 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.900
 representative of course for all 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.310
 other bayonets I just 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.200
 called or had with us 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.260
 In the shop people search for micro four 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.220
 thirds for fuji finepix for the nikon 1 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.350
 and for the car center can be here 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.210
 just then with sharp focus 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.520
 Of course, when contributing objectively 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 with these two here seven and a half 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.020
 or twelve millimeters the active little 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.950
 Camera bayonet then drive 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.659
 of course , then in principle 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.159
 actually stop working 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.939
 I can not remember the blind anymore 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.360
 and in the range of 0 5 meters up 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.890
 infinite in this short way here 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.720
 this short stroke we have 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.979
 just the whole then agreed because making 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.540
 I draw my fun times an entirely different 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.970
 view of the normal everyday 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.140
 Life's so fun with it and so 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.330
 So that was the stranger wide-angle lens 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.770
 Deputy sony nex for the whole 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.770
 still wander
