new vehicle this kiddie express it's

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.210 
new vehicle this kiddie express it's
basically<00:00:18.850> like<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.180> uh<00:00:19.390> a<00:00:20.130> roller<00:00:21.130> coaster

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
basically like a uh a roller coaster

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
basically like a uh a roller coaster
train<00:00:22.060> thing<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:22.840> they<00:00:23.740> have<00:00:23.920> added<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.700> track

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
train thing and they have added a track

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.910 
train thing and they have added a track
for<00:00:25.750> it<00:00:25.900> so<00:00:26.620> I<00:00:26.650> don't<00:00:26.830> find<00:00:26.980> it<00:00:28.530> roller<00:00:29.530> coaster

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
for it so I don't find it roller coaster

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.819 
for it so I don't find it roller coaster
roller<00:00:30.760> coaster<00:00:31.240> is<00:00:31.300> a<00:00:31.360> kind<00:00:32.259> of<00:00:32.349> fun<00:00:32.529> track

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
roller coaster is a kind of fun track

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.650 
roller coaster is a kind of fun track
it's<00:00:33.070> extremely<00:00:33.670> difficult<00:00:33.850> and<00:00:34.239> if<00:00:34.390> you<00:00:34.449> try

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
it's extremely difficult and if you try

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.810 
it's extremely difficult and if you try
to<00:00:34.719> do<00:00:34.899> it<00:00:35.050> with<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.410> card<00:00:36.100> that<00:00:36.250> came<00:00:36.310> pretty

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
to do it with the card that came pretty

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.850 
to do it with the card that came pretty
much<00:00:37.030> for<00:00:37.360> it<00:00:37.450> you're<00:00:38.350> going<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.530> have<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.680> bad

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
much for it you're going to have a bad

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.300 
much for it you're going to have a bad
time<00:00:39.270> believe<00:00:40.270> it<00:00:40.450> or<00:00:40.540> not<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:41.380> best<00:00:41.829> car<00:00:42.280> for

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
time believe it or not the best car for

time believe it or not the best car for
this<00:00:42.700> track<00:00:43.030> is<00:00:43.300> actually<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.989> snowmobile<00:00:44.500> I

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
this track is actually the snowmobile I

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.360 
this track is actually the snowmobile I
will<00:00:45.670> show<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:46.060> now<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:47.980> can<00:00:48.070> see<00:00:48.130> my

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
will show you that now as you can see my

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.180 
will show you that now as you can see my
snowmobiles<00:00:48.880> fully<00:00:49.120> upgraded<00:00:49.600> I<00:00:50.370> will<00:00:51.370> start

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
snowmobiles fully upgraded I will start

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.569 
snowmobiles fully upgraded I will start
now

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
now

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
now
the<00:00:54.820> advantage<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.989> snowmobile<00:00:56.649> over<00:00:56.980> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the advantage to the snowmobile over the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.780 
the advantage to the snowmobile over the
vehicle<00:00:59.350> that's<00:00:59.500> actually<00:00:59.829> I<00:01:00.010> guess<00:01:00.700> you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
vehicle that's actually I guess you

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.479 
vehicle that's actually I guess you
could<00:01:00.910> say<00:01:01.030> design<00:01:01.450> for<00:01:01.899> this<00:01:02.020> track<00:01:02.410> is<00:01:02.710> that

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
could say design for this track is that

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.130 
could say design for this track is that
the<00:01:03.820> snowmobile<00:01:04.390> unlike<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.960> kiddie

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
the snowmobile unlike the kiddie

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.830 
the snowmobile unlike the kiddie
expressed<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.770> not<00:01:05.950> overheat<00:01:06.579> when<00:01:07.539> you're

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
expressed is not overheat when you're

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.809 
expressed is not overheat when you're
running<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:08.289> gas<00:01:08.469> hard<00:01:09.100> for<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.399> long<00:01:09.579> time

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:09.819 
running the gas hard for a long time

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.270 
running the gas hard for a long time
which<00:01:10.719> is<00:01:10.749> extremely<00:01:11.499> important<00:01:11.979> on<00:01:12.100> these

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
which is extremely important on these

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.069 
which is extremely important on these
hills

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
hills

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.849 
hills
so<00:01:15.359> this<00:01:16.359> snowmobile<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:17.139> actually<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.649> best

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
so this snowmobile is actually the best

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:19.800 
so this snowmobile is actually the best
vehicle<00:01:18.429> or<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:19.119> shouldn't<00:01:19.450> say<00:01:19.569> the<00:01:19.659> best

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
vehicle or I shouldn't say the best

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.120 
vehicle or I shouldn't say the best
vehicle<00:01:20.139> because<00:01:20.439> that<00:01:20.649> it's<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:20.889> better

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
vehicle because that it's a better

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.669 
vehicle because that it's a better
vehicle<00:01:21.369> because<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:23.200> reason<00:01:23.560> why

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
vehicle because of that the reason why

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.190 
vehicle because of that the reason why
the<00:01:23.740> snowmobile<00:01:24.429> is<00:01:24.609> actually<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.450> best<00:01:25.840> for

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
the snowmobile is actually the best for

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.389 
the snowmobile is actually the best for
this<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.299> track<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:30.369> track

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
this is because of the track the track

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.999 
this is because of the track the track
that<00:01:30.789> it<00:01:30.880> has<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:32.079> track<00:01:32.409> allows<00:01:32.649> it<00:01:32.829> to<00:01:32.859> get

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
that it has that track allows it to get

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.879 
that it has that track allows it to get
extremely<00:01:33.639> good<00:01:33.999> traction<00:01:34.359> going<00:01:34.779> up<00:01:35.740> these

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889 
extremely good traction going up these

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:38.010 
extremely good traction going up these
steep<00:01:36.159> hills<00:01:36.389> all<00:01:37.389> the<00:01:37.630> other<00:01:37.749> vehicles

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
steep hills all the other vehicles

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.129 
steep hills all the other vehicles
either<00:01:38.529> don't<00:01:39.009> get<00:01:39.219> traction<00:01:39.899> or<00:01:40.899> they're

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
either don't get traction or they're

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:43.289 
either don't get traction or they're
like<00:01:41.349> the<00:01:41.560> kiddie<00:01:41.770> ride<00:01:42.009> they<00:01:42.219> or<00:01:42.459> in<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.179> case

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
like the kiddie ride they or in the case

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.419 
like the kiddie ride they or in the case
the<00:01:43.420> kiddie<00:01:43.599> ride<00:01:43.779> which<00:01:44.590> overheats<00:01:45.130> even

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
the kiddie ride which overheats even

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.800 
the kiddie ride which overheats even
though<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.609> gets<00:01:45.789> plenty<00:01:46.060> of<00:01:46.209> traction<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.689> has

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
though it gets plenty of traction it has

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.529 
though it gets plenty of traction it has
plenty<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.169> power<00:01:47.289> to<00:01:47.409> climb<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.799> hills<00:01:48.539> this

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
plenty of power to climb the hills this

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.080 
plenty of power to climb the hills this
has<00:01:49.899> plenty<00:01:50.349> of<00:01:50.409> traction<00:01:50.819> plenty<00:01:51.819> of<00:01:51.909> power

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
has plenty of traction plenty of power

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.349 
has plenty of traction plenty of power
even<00:01:52.389> when<00:01:52.569> you<00:01:52.749> have<00:01:53.049> almost<00:01:53.380> no<00:01:53.649> momentum

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
even when you have almost no momentum

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.679 
even when you have almost no momentum
and<00:01:55.359> it<00:01:55.869> doesn't<00:01:56.139> overheat<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.450> kiddie

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
and it doesn't overheat so the kiddie

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.679 
and it doesn't overheat so the kiddie
ride<00:01:58.959> is<00:01:59.439> fully<00:01:59.739> upgraded<00:02:00.249> you<00:02:01.060> can<00:02:01.299> get<00:02:01.509> to

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
ride is fully upgraded you can get to

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.409 
ride is fully upgraded you can get to
about<00:02:02.399> 3000<00:02:03.399> meters<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.939> then<00:02:04.149> you're<00:02:04.270> about

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:04.419 
about 3000 meters and then you're about

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:08.279 
about 3000 meters and then you're about
done<00:02:05.849> this<00:02:06.849> on<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.299> other<00:02:07.389> hand

done this on the other hand

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.069 
done this on the other hand
you<00:02:08.799> can<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.159> as<00:02:09.250> you<00:02:09.369> see<00:02:09.519> my<00:02:09.700> max<00:02:09.969> is<00:02:10.209> 37

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.670 
you can get to as you see my max is 37
ad<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:12.239> that's<00:02:13.239> only<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.989> have<00:02:14.469> yet<00:02:14.650> to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
ad and that's only because I have yet to

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.250 
ad and that's only because I have yet to
find<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.040> next<00:02:15.189> gas<00:02:15.400> cam<00:02:15.870> if<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.019> knew<00:02:17.170> where

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
find the next gas cam if I knew where

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.229 
find the next gas cam if I knew where
the<00:02:17.379> next<00:02:17.620> gas<00:02:17.769> can<00:02:18.099> was<00:02:18.370> if<00:02:18.819> this<00:02:19.000> had<00:02:19.209> a

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
the next gas can was if this had a

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.149 
the next gas can was if this had a
longer<00:02:19.510> range<00:02:20.200> if<00:02:21.159> it<00:02:21.340> was<00:02:21.489> faster<00:02:23.159> anything

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
longer range if it was faster anything

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.740 
longer range if it was faster anything
it<00:02:24.310> would<00:02:24.430> go<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.609> lot<00:02:24.849> farther<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.540> not

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
it would go a lot farther it's not

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.839 
it would go a lot farther it's not
limited<00:02:26.260> by<00:02:26.290> performance<00:02:27.099> it's<00:02:27.310> not<00:02:27.489> limited

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
limited by performance it's not limited

limited by performance it's not limited
by<00:02:27.879> traction<00:02:28.739> it's<00:02:29.739> only<00:02:30.069> limited<00:02:30.340> by<00:02:30.549> range

so<00:02:32.109> legs<00:02:32.530> I'll<00:02:33.129> try<00:02:33.310> not<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.489> flip<00:02:33.760> over<00:02:33.909> and<00:02:34.180> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
so legs I'll try not to flip over and I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.390 
so legs I'll try not to flip over and I
will<00:02:35.079> hopefully<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.470> able<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.829> get<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.129> up<00:02:36.340> to

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
will hopefully be able to get you up to

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.770 
will hopefully be able to get you up to
37<00:02:37.329> 80<00:02:37.510> or<00:02:37.810> somewhere<00:02:38.290> close<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.720> the

37 80 or somewhere close to that now the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.839 
37 80 or somewhere close to that now the
only<00:02:41.079> thing<00:02:41.439> I<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.739> wary<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.189> is<00:02:42.489> some<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.760> these

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
only thing I be wary of is some of these

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.020 
only thing I be wary of is some of these
hoops<00:02:43.180> when<00:02:43.870> you're<00:02:44.049> dropping<00:02:44.650> down<00:02:44.829> in<00:02:45.609> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
hoops when you're dropping down in the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.440 
hoops when you're dropping down in the
hoops<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:48.280> actually<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:48.609> should<00:02:48.639> it's<00:02:49.359> not

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
hoops or actually I should it's not

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.390 
hoops or actually I should it's not
really<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.810> hoops<00:02:50.049> it's<00:02:50.409> when<00:02:50.980> you're<00:02:51.129> flying

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
really the hoops it's when you're flying

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.649 
really the hoops it's when you're flying
up<00:02:51.609> these<00:02:51.819> hills<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:53.819> you<00:02:54.819> just<00:02:55.030> keep<00:02:55.359> going

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
up these hills and you just keep going

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.110 
up these hills and you just keep going
which<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.739> thing<00:02:56.980> can<00:02:57.220> will<00:02:57.519> flying<00:02:57.819> over<00:02:58.000> a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
which this thing can will flying over a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.240 
which this thing can will flying over a
hill<00:02:58.329> when<00:02:59.049> you're<00:02:59.169> coming<00:02:59.349> back<00:02:59.470> down<00:02:59.950> you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
hill when you're coming back down you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.099 
hill when you're coming back down you
really<00:03:00.760> don't<00:03:01.450> know<00:03:01.599> what<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.840> might<00:03:01.959> be

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
really don't know what you might be

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.550 
really don't know what you might be
landing<00:03:02.560> on<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.790> as<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.480> see<00:03:04.629> that's<00:03:04.840> perfect

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
landing on and as you see that's perfect

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.199 
landing on and as you see that's perfect
reason<00:03:06.010> for<00:03:06.159> why<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.609> a<00:03:06.730> great<00:03:07.030> vehicle

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
reason for why this is a great vehicle

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.580 
reason for why this is a great vehicle
that<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.659> splendid<00:03:07.989> traction<00:03:08.349> even

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
that have splendid traction even

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.429 
that have splendid traction even
climbing<00:03:08.829> up<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.069> steep<00:03:09.250> hill<00:03:09.280> like<00:03:09.489> that

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
climbing up the steep hill like that

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.390 
climbing up the steep hill like that
that's<00:03:11.439> what<00:03:11.620> I'm<00:03:11.739> saying<00:03:11.919> about<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.189> hills

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
that's what I'm saying about the hills

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.399 
that's what I'm saying about the hills
if<00:03:12.609> you<00:03:12.760> go<00:03:12.879> flying<00:03:13.090> up<00:03:13.479> over<00:03:13.690> one<00:03:14.139> of<00:03:14.260> these

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
if you go flying up over one of these

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.830 
if you go flying up over one of these
you<00:03:15.250> might<00:03:15.519> have<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:16.000> loop<00:03:16.239> like<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.479> at<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
you might have a loop like that at the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.140 
you might have a loop like that at the
bottom<00:03:16.989> if<00:03:17.859> you<00:03:17.919> hit<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.430> loop<00:03:18.699> with<00:03:18.909> just

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
bottom if you hit that loop with just

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.089 
bottom if you hit that loop with just
your<00:03:19.269> front<00:03:19.540> skid<00:03:19.900> you're<00:03:20.620> going<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.829> flip

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
your front skid you're going to flip

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.689 
your front skid you're going to flip
over<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.579> land<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:24.099> whole<00:03:24.220> snowmobile

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
over and land and the whole snowmobile

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.099 
over and land and the whole snowmobile
is<00:03:24.790> going<00:03:24.909> to<00:03:24.970> land<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.239> this<00:03:25.329> guy's<00:03:25.540> head<00:03:25.870> in

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
is going to land on this guy's head in

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.349 
is going to land on this guy's head in
which<00:03:27.099> case<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.400> kill<00:03:27.549> me<00:03:27.729> at<00:03:27.849> start<00:03:28.150> again

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
which case you kill me at start again

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.219 
which case you kill me at start again
and<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:30.190> snowmobile<00:03:31.120> isn't<00:03:31.659> all<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.750> great

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.229 
and the snowmobile isn't all that great

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.129 
and the snowmobile isn't all that great
at<00:03:32.440> stopping<00:03:33.010> at<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.519> top<00:03:33.699> of<00:03:33.940> hills<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.599> it's

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
at stopping at the top of hills and it's

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:36.780 
at stopping at the top of hills and it's
one<00:03:35.349> of<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.530> fastest<00:03:36.010> vehicles<00:03:36.310> going<00:03:36.459> up<00:03:36.639> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
one of the fastest vehicles going up the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.899 
one of the fastest vehicles going up the
hills<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.199> the<00:03:38.680> most<00:03:38.949> trouble<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.579> try<00:03:39.849> to

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
hills so it's the most trouble to try to

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.689 
hills so it's the most trouble to try to
stop<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.709> great<00:03:41.889> example<00:03:42.069> what's<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.489> good

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
stop of a great example what's a good

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.479 
stop of a great example what's a good
vehicle<00:03:42.849> for<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.239> is<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:44.159> tire<00:03:45.159> burning

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
vehicle for this is that tire burning

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.920 
vehicle for this is that tire burning
out<00:03:45.699> thing<00:03:46.269> sorts<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.299> will<00:03:49.510> continue<00:03:49.720> to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
out thing sorts so I will continue to

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.679 
out thing sorts so I will continue to
play<00:03:50.349> this<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:52.079> hopefully<00:03:54.180> see<00:03:55.180> more<00:03:55.449> proof

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
play this and hopefully see more proof

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.030 
play this and hopefully see more proof
that<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:55.930> is<00:03:56.019> a<00:03:56.109> great<00:03:56.319> vehicle<00:03:56.470> for<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:56.859> it

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
that this is a great vehicle for this it

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.379 
that this is a great vehicle for this it
doesn't<00:03:57.310> come<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.549> a<00:03:57.579> stop<00:03:57.909> climbing<00:03:58.329> a<00:03:58.359> hill

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
doesn't come to a stop climbing a hill

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.099 
doesn't come to a stop climbing a hill
like<00:03:58.599> this<00:03:58.829> that's<00:03:59.829> one<00:04:00.069> that<00:04:00.220> Hill<00:04:00.669> is<00:04:00.879> that

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
like this that's one that Hill is that

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.349 
like this that's one that Hill is that
the<00:04:02.109> vehicle<00:04:02.859> that<00:04:03.310> basically<00:04:03.760> came<00:04:04.090> with

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
the vehicle that basically came with

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.809 
the vehicle that basically came with
this<00:04:04.479> track<00:04:04.720> would<00:04:04.840> have<00:04:04.959> struggled<00:04:05.500> on<00:04:05.819> it

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
this track would have struggled on it

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.460 
this track would have struggled on it
would<00:04:07.030> have<00:04:07.180> been<00:04:07.449> the<00:04:07.959> probably<00:04:08.259> have<00:04:08.379> been

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
would have been the probably have been

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.399 
would have been the probably have been
overheating<00:04:09.009> or<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:10.780> would<00:04:10.930> have<00:04:11.019> needed<00:04:11.199> an

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
overheating or you would have needed an

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.610 
overheating or you would have needed an
extreme<00:04:11.799> amount<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.099> momentum<00:04:12.509> this<00:04:13.509> I<00:04:13.870> think

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
extreme amount of momentum this I think

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.769 
extreme amount of momentum this I think
yes<00:04:15.549> this<00:04:15.790> is<00:04:15.970> another<00:04:16.150> place<00:04:16.479> where<00:04:16.690> it

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:16.779 
yes this is another place where it

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.449 
yes this is another place where it
really<00:04:17.049> struggle<00:04:17.440> you'd<00:04:18.010> have<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.370> actually

really struggle you'd have to actually

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.520 
really struggle you'd have to actually

have<00:07:04.870> been<00:07:05.020> overheating<00:07:05.590> a<00:07:05.650> long<00:07:05.920> time<00:07:06.280> ago

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
have been overheating a long time ago

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.070

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
but the snowmobiles up here at the top

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.270 
but the snowmobiles up here at the top
I've<00:07:11.080> got<00:07:11.350> one<00:07:11.650> more<00:07:11.890> stretch<00:07:12.190> to<00:07:12.460> go<00:07:12.790> I<00:07:14.280> think

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 
I've got one more stretch to go I think

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.930 
I've got one more stretch to go I think
this<00:07:16.090> is<00:07:16.390> the<00:07:16.660> top<00:07:17.250> coming<00:07:18.250> up<00:07:18.550> I<00:07:20.610> think<00:07:21.610> I<00:07:21.820> ever

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940 
this is the top coming up I think I ever

this is the top coming up I think I ever
dug<00:07:22.150> up<00:07:22.420> this<00:07:22.600> top<00:07:22.900> I<00:07:23.140> think<00:07:23.680> I<00:07:23.710> ever<00:07:23.830> got<00:07:23.950> the

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
dug up this top I think I ever got the

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.610 
dug up this top I think I ever got the

train that far and if I did was

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:34.710 
train that far and if I did was
overheating<00:07:27.220> it<00:07:27.310> out<00:07:27.430> of<00:07:27.550> gas<00:07:31.200> okay<00:07:33.510> now<00:07:34.510> let's
