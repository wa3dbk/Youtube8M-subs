little bit mysterious as he put soon

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.530

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
enough but not too soon so looking into

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.860 
enough but not too soon so looking into
what<00:00:39.660> Van<00:00:39.899> Dam<00:00:40.140> said<00:00:40.469> I'm<00:00:40.950> gonna<00:00:41.550> predict<00:00:42.420> that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
what Van Dam said I'm gonna predict that

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.069

RVD will make his return at the Royal

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.860 
RVD will make his return at the Royal
Rumble<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.910> would<00:00:48.090> make<00:00:48.210> sense<00:00:48.539> because

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
Rumble and this would make sense because

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990 
Rumble and this would make sense because
if<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.410> about<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.920> timeline<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.700> time

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
if you think about the timeline and time

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.220 
if you think about the timeline and time
frame<00:00:51.329> now<00:00:51.600> well<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:53.010> Royal<00:00:53.250> Rumble<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.730> soon

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
frame now well the Royal Rumble is soon

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.310 
frame now well the Royal Rumble is soon
but<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.530> too<00:00:55.770> soon<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.840> it<00:00:57.840> also<00:00:57.989> makes

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
but it's not too soon and it also makes

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
but it's not too soon and it also makes
sense<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.770> Van<00:00:59.160> Dam<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> past<00:00:59.969> has<00:01:00.600> made

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
sense as Van Dam in the past has made

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.149 
sense as Van Dam in the past has made
his<00:01:01.020> returns<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.710> Royal<00:01:02.370> Rumble<00:01:03.000> event<00:01:04.159> now

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
his returns at Royal Rumble event now

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.070 
his returns at Royal Rumble event now
what<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.460> think<00:01:05.729> will<00:01:05.850> come<00:01:06.119> if<00:01:06.360> Rob<00:01:06.630> Van<00:01:06.810> Dam

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
what do I think will come if Rob Van Dam

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
what do I think will come if Rob Van Dam
does<00:01:07.470> indeed<00:01:07.979> returned<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> Royal<00:01:08.850> Rumble

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
does indeed returned at the Royal Rumble

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.510 
does indeed returned at the Royal Rumble
well<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.570> don't<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:10.049> he's<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> win<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
well I don't think he's going to win the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.149 
well I don't think he's going to win the
Royal<00:01:11.790> Rumble<00:01:11.909> match<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.500> believe<00:01:13.860> he

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
Royal Rumble match but I believe he

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.640 
Royal Rumble match but I believe he
would<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.760> participant<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.409> pop

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
would be a participant because the pop

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
would be a participant because the pop
value<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.369> r<00:01:17.670> VD<00:01:18.000> returning<00:01:18.689> at<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> Royal

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
value of r VD returning at a Royal

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.310 
value of r VD returning at a Royal
Rumble<00:01:19.290> well<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.939> goes<00:01:21.270> down<00:01:21.540> pretty<00:01:21.840> damn

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
Rumble well it goes down pretty damn

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.109 
Rumble well it goes down pretty damn
well<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.500> expect<00:01:26.189> him<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> Royal

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119

Rumble match and what do I hope to come

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.569 
Rumble match and what do I hope to come
of<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> well<00:01:29.640> I'd<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.329> RVD<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.409> gain<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.979> feud

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
out of the Royal Rumble match and this

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.670 
out of the Royal Rumble match and this
would<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.659> bit<00:01:36.869> different<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
would be a little bit different to the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.390 
would be a little bit different to the
norm<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.810> moment<00:01:40.159> legends<00:01:41.159> like

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
norm because at the moment legends like

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
on their final

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.620 
on their final
you<00:02:14.160> would<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.460> to<00:02:14.520> say<00:02:14.730> their<00:02:14.910> final<00:02:14.940> runs

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
you would have to say their final runs

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.970 
you would have to say their final runs
in<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.170> WWE<00:02:17.210> now<00:02:18.210> with<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.570> mind<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.260> would

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
in the WWE now with that in mind I would

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.070 
in the WWE now with that in mind I would
think<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.280> would<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.460> rather<00:02:20.670> nice<00:02:21.000> if<00:02:21.360> we

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
think it would be rather nice if we

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.860 
think it would be rather nice if we
bring<00:02:22.290> together<00:02:22.530> Van<00:02:22.980> Damme<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.430> Jericho<00:02:24.240> for

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
bring together Van Damme and Jericho for

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.040 
bring together Van Damme and Jericho for
a<00:02:24.930> feud<00:02:25.320> after<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.160> Royal<00:02:26.430> Rumble<00:02:26.930> now<00:02:27.930> they

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
chemistry so for me personally I would

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.360 
chemistry so for me personally I would
like<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.700> see<00:02:42.090> somehow<00:02:42.750> maybe<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:43.920> Chris

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
like to see somehow maybe if Chris

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.400 
like to see somehow maybe if Chris
Jericho<00:02:44.760> does<00:02:45.000> also<00:02:45.300> return<00:02:45.930> at<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.140> Royal

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
Jericho does also return at the Royal

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.430 
Jericho does also return at the Royal
Rumble<00:02:46.470> may<00:02:47.130> be<00:02:47.190> here<00:02:47.670> Chuck's<00:02:48.360> our<00:02:48.600> video<00:02:49.050> and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
Rumble may be here Chuck's our video and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.560 
Rumble may be here Chuck's our video and
this<00:02:49.950> develops<00:02:50.490> into<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.850> little<00:02:51.210> bit<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.480> a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
this develops into a little bit of a

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.410 
this develops into a little bit of a
feud<00:02:52.370> not<00:02:53.370> only<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.580> as<00:02:53.850> well<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> think

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
feud not only that as well I think

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.940 
feud not only that as well I think
that's<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.690> little<00:02:54.960> bit<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> tip<00:02:55.410> at<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.740> hat

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
that's a little bit of a tip at the hat

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.510 
that's a little bit of a tip at the hat
because<00:02:57.080> in<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.380> past<00:02:58.590> Jericho<00:02:59.190> has<00:02:59.310> always

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
because in the past Jericho has always

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.910 
because in the past Jericho has always
said<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.730> he<00:02:59.970> wouldn't<00:03:00.290> sort<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.380> outstayed

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
said that he wouldn't sort of outstayed

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.130 
said that he wouldn't sort of outstayed
his<00:03:01.950> welcome<00:03:02.130> in<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.820> WWE<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.570> he<00:03:03.840> wouldn't

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
his welcome in the WWE and he wouldn't

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660 
his welcome in the WWE and he wouldn't
want<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.500> become<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.070> those<00:03:05.160> superstars

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
want to become one of those superstars

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.030 
want to become one of those superstars
that<00:03:05.910> literally<00:03:06.420> just<00:03:06.600> goes<00:03:06.780> losing<00:03:07.680> match

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
that literally just goes losing match

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.950 
that literally just goes losing match
after<00:03:08.340> match<00:03:08.580> because<00:03:09.120> he's<00:03:09.390> putting<00:03:09.780> over

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
after match because he's putting over

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.470 
after match because he's putting over
the<00:03:10.110> younger<00:03:10.500> talent<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:10.980> he<00:03:11.130> has<00:03:11.400> become<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
the younger talent and he has become a

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.740 
the younger talent and he has become a
little<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.800> bit<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.460> way<00:03:14.750> orientated

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
little a little bit that way orientated

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.020 
little a little bit that way orientated
Van<00:03:16.080> Dam<00:03:16.380> not<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.860> much<00:03:17.070> because<00:03:17.310> he's<00:03:17.730> had<00:03:17.940> his

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
Van Dam not so much because he's had his

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.090 
Van Dam not so much because he's had his
matches<00:03:18.450> with<00:03:18.660> Alberto<00:03:19.050> Del<00:03:19.320> Rio<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:19.950> he's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
matches with Alberto Del Rio so he's

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.860 
matches with Alberto Del Rio so he's
been<00:03:20.250> utilized<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.120> slightly<00:03:21.540> different

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
been utilized in a slightly different

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.400 
been utilized in a slightly different
way<00:03:22.320> but<00:03:23.160> all<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.490> all<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.840> point<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.260> these

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
way but all in all the point of these

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.800 
way but all in all the point of these
two<00:03:25.650> guys<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.459> put<00:03:26.730> forward<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.390> younger

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
two guys is to put forward the younger

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.750 
two guys is to put forward the younger
talent<00:03:28.050> by<00:03:29.010> having<00:03:29.400> them<00:03:29.610> lose<00:03:30.090> matches<00:03:30.390> and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
talent by having them lose matches and

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.120

just to give those guys a bit of a boost

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030
