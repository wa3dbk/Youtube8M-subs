natural resources at the end of the day
it's<00:01:04.580> more<00:01:04.820> expensive<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.900> took<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.170> hacks

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
it's more expensive if you took a hacks

it's more expensive if you took a hacks
on<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:06.950> cut<00:01:07.369> up<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.700> standard<00:01:08.240> motherboard

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
on you cut up a standard motherboard

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.469 
on you cut up a standard motherboard
into<00:01:09.140> three<00:01:09.500> ideal<00:01:10.009> pieces<00:01:10.580> that's<00:01:11.030> basically

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
into three ideal pieces that's basically

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.540 
into three ideal pieces that's basically
what<00:01:11.690> a<00:01:11.720> modular<00:01:12.170> motherboard<00:01:12.619> is<00:01:12.740> what<00:01:13.399> that

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
what a modular motherboard is what that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.889 
what a modular motherboard is what that
allows<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.970> do<00:01:14.119> is<00:01:14.300> kind<00:01:14.509> of<00:01:14.630> think<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:14.840> it

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
allows you to do is kind of think of it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.560 
allows you to do is kind of think of it
as<00:01:15.050> Legos<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.979> can<00:01:16.160> mix<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:16.610> match<00:01:16.670> or<00:01:17.149> change

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
as Legos you can mix and match or change

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.570

pieces<00:01:18.380> of<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.710> motherboard<00:01:19.160> for<00:01:19.520> a

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
pieces of the motherboard for a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.609 
pieces of the motherboard for a
particular<00:01:19.790> application<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:20.960> one<00:01:21.380> day<00:01:21.560> you

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
particular application so one day you

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.920 
particular application so one day you
might<00:01:21.920> have<00:01:22.160> it<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.460> kiosk<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:23.810> has

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
might have it in a kiosk and it has

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.719 
might have it in a kiosk and it has
special<00:01:24.200> inputs<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.100> outputs<00:01:25.399> for<00:01:25.580> that

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
special inputs and outputs for that

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.969 
special inputs and outputs for that
kiosk<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.960> next<00:01:27.170> day<00:01:27.259> you<00:01:27.410> might<00:01:27.649> decide

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
kiosk and the next day you might decide

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.980 
kiosk and the next day you might decide
well<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.670> want<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:28.880> move<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.240> computer<00:01:29.720> into<00:01:29.960> a

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
well I want to move that computer into a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.630 
well I want to move that computer into a
different<00:01:30.350> application<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.190> they<00:01:31.310> would<00:01:31.460> put

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
different application so they would put

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.850 
different application so they would put
in<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.880> an<00:01:32.090> i/o<00:01:32.360> card<00:01:32.810> or<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.320> piece<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:33.619> that

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
in a an i/o card or a piece of that

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.080 
in a an i/o card or a piece of that
motherboard<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.399> is<00:01:34.700> designed

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
motherboard that is designed

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.109 
motherboard that is designed
specifically<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.780> work<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.410> that<00:01:36.440> environment

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
specifically to work in that environment

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.510 
specifically to work in that environment
the<00:01:38.119> trend<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.630> technology<00:01:39.259> is<00:01:39.470> not<00:01:39.709> to<00:01:40.069> have

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
the trend and technology is not to have

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.639 
the trend and technology is not to have
a<00:01:40.550> smaller<00:01:41.179> computer<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.080> trend<00:01:42.410> in

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
a smaller computer the trend in

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.680 
a smaller computer the trend in
technology<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.000> have<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.149> more<00:01:44.420> powerful

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
technology is to have a more powerful

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.889 
technology is to have a more powerful
computer<00:01:45.440> in<00:01:45.560> a<00:01:45.619> smaller<00:01:45.920> space<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.580> so<00:01:47.509> we

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
computer in a smaller space and so we

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.109 
computer in a smaller space and so we
have<00:01:48.020> done<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:49.130> extreme<00:01:49.640> we've

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
have done that to the extreme we've

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.990 
have done that to the extreme we've
taken<00:01:50.420> dual<00:01:50.990> core<00:01:51.319> 64-bit<00:01:52.160> processors<00:01:52.789> and

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
taken dual core 64-bit processors and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.910 
taken dual core 64-bit processors and
stuffed<00:01:53.360> them<00:01:53.479> into<00:01:53.660> 40<00:01:54.050> square<00:01:54.289> inches<00:01:54.590> it's

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
stuffed them into 40 square inches it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.800 
stuffed them into 40 square inches it's
never<00:01:55.130> been<00:01:55.369> done<00:01:55.429> before<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.300> we<00:01:56.539> had<00:01:56.690> to

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
never been done before and so we had to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.900 
never been done before and so we had to
invent<00:01:57.259> all<00:01:57.470> sorts<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:58.039> technologies<00:01:58.399> there's

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
invent all sorts of technologies there's

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.760 
invent all sorts of technologies there's
actually<00:01:59.270> six<00:01:59.479> international<00:02:00.140> patents<00:02:00.560> at
