what<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.330> does<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.960> allows<00:00:15.990> us<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
what this does is it allows us to have a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160 
what this does is it allows us to have a
