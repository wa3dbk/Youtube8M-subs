00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
that actually reminded me of essen

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.670 
that actually reminded me of essen
because<00:04:36.270> when<00:04:36.690> i<00:04:36.720> was<00:04:36.930> at<00:04:37.050> s<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.350> what<00:04:37.470> struck

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
because when i was at s and what struck

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.110 
because when i was at s and what struck
me<00:04:37.740> was<00:04:37.890> that<00:04:38.010> family<00:04:38.490> environment<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.090> i

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
me was that family environment and i

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.640 
me was that family environment and i
think<00:04:39.270> you've<00:04:39.390> managed<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.840> get<00:04:40.200> that<00:04:40.410> same

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
think you've managed to get that same

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.409 
think you've managed to get that same
family<00:04:41.040> environment<00:04:41.520> here<00:04:41.730> which<00:04:42.150> can<00:04:42.330> be

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
family environment here which can be

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.600 
family environment here which can be
hard<00:04:42.600> to<00:04:42.660> do<00:04:42.890> what<00:04:43.890> do<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:43.980> see<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.280> future

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
hard to do what do you see is the future
