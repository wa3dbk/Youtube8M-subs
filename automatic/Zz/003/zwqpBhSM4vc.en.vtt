kind<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.610> make<00:01:59.759> sense<00:01:59.820> because<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.930> earth<00:02:01.259> is

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
kind of make sense because if earth is

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.859 
kind of make sense because if earth is
the<00:02:01.710> only<00:02:01.920> thing<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.360> builders<00:02:03.719> are

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the only thing that the builders are

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.929 
the only thing that the builders are
after<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.380> someone<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.399> leading<00:02:05.759> an

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
after as someone that's leading an

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.850 
after as someone that's leading an
empire<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.540> think<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> responsibility

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
empire I think you have a responsibility

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.040 
empire I think you have a responsibility
to<00:02:08.160> protect<00:02:08.280> your<00:02:08.910> empire<00:02:09.300> yeah<00:02:09.450> he's

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
basically saying we can't win so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.220 
basically saying we can't win so
gotta<00:02:12.560> make<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.740> deal<00:02:12.980> yeah<00:02:13.750> but<00:02:14.750> he<00:02:14.900> was<00:02:15.020> pretty

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
either of you backwater aids I think he

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.600 
either of you backwater aids I think he
had<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.870> valid<00:02:27.290> point<00:02:27.530> why<00:02:27.860> were<00:02:28.070> they<00:02:28.280> even

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
had a valid point why were they even

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.720 
had a valid point why were they even
there<00:02:28.820> right<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:29.840> was<00:02:30.470> all<00:02:30.710> empty<00:02:30.980> except<00:02:31.610> for

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
there right it was all empty except for

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.280 
there right it was all empty except for
them<00:02:32.180> just<00:02:32.450> sort<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.690> standing<00:02:33.020> off<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
them just sort of standing off to the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.010 
them just sort of standing off to the
side<00:02:33.380> while<00:02:33.770> these<00:02:33.920> powers<00:02:34.280> are<00:02:34.370> talking<00:02:34.820> I

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
side while these powers are talking I

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.210 
side while these powers are talking I
would<00:02:36.020> I<00:02:36.200> just<00:02:36.380> felt<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.680> was<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> way

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
would I just felt that was like a way

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.250 
would I just felt that was like a way
Franklin<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.760> just<00:02:37.940> drive<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.300> plot<00:02:38.510> fours<00:02:38.870> it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
Franklin to just drive the plot fours it

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260 
Franklin to just drive the plot fours it
didn't<00:02:39.440> make<00:02:39.560> as<00:02:39.680> much<00:02:39.800> sense<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.160> me<00:02:40.340> well<00:02:40.970> he

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
didn't make as much sense to me well he

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.730 
didn't make as much sense to me well he
did<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.600> decree<00:02:42.110> supreme<00:02:42.470> intelligence

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
did have a decree supreme intelligence

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.830 
did have a decree supreme intelligence
stick<00:02:43.340> up<00:02:43.490> for<00:02:43.760> though<00:02:44.210> he's<00:02:44.360> like<00:02:44.510> oh<00:02:44.660> they

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
stick up for though he's like oh they

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.300 
stick up for though he's like oh they
got<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:44.990> way<00:02:45.170> better<00:02:45.200> winning<00:02:45.590> percentage

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
got a way better winning percentage

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.590 
got a way better winning percentage
against<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.850> Kree<00:02:47.120> then<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.380> Jason<00:02:49.600> cap

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
against the Kree then you do Jason cap

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.300 
against the Kree then you do Jason cap
and<00:02:50.870> Thor<00:02:51.110> are<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.440> guys<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.620> show<00:02:52.040> up<00:02:52.160> at

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
and Thor are the guys that show up at

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.340 
and Thor are the guys that show up at
the<00:02:52.490> Alliance<00:02:52.880> meeting<00:02:53.120> but<00:02:53.750> my<00:02:53.930> question<00:02:53.959> is

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
the Alliance meeting but my question is

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.140 
the Alliance meeting but my question is
maybe<00:02:54.830> someone<00:02:55.340> else<00:02:55.550> should<00:02:55.700> be<00:02:55.850> there<00:02:56.060> do

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
maybe someone else should be there do

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
maybe someone else should be there do
you<00:02:56.240> think<00:02:56.390> someone<00:02:56.570> else<00:02:56.750> would<00:02:56.930> have<00:02:56.990> been<00:02:57.140> a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
you think someone else would have been a

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.020 
you think someone else would have been a
better<00:02:57.350> representative<00:02:57.980> earth<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.580> think<00:02:58.940> if

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
better representative earth I think if

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.120 
better representative earth I think if
you<00:02:59.150> were<00:02:59.300> gonna<00:02:59.480> happen<00:02:59.959> a<00:03:00.230> human

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
you were gonna happen a human

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.070 
you were gonna happen a human
representative<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.330> galactic<00:03:02.570> alliance

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
representative to this galactic alliance

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.280 
representative to this galactic alliance
you<00:03:03.740> want<00:03:03.980> somebody<00:03:04.130> smart<00:03:04.700> or<00:03:05.540> smarter<00:03:05.750> at

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
you want somebody smart or smarter at

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.590 
you want somebody smart or smarter at
least<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.370> thank<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.120> probably<00:03:08.390> won't<00:03:08.570> like

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
least so thank you probably won't like

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.080 
least so thank you probably won't like
Reed<00:03:08.959> Richards<00:03:09.380> or<00:03:09.680> Tony<00:03:09.890> Stark<00:03:10.250> that's<00:03:10.880> true

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
Reed Richards or Tony Stark that's true

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.310 
Reed Richards or Tony Stark that's true
but<00:03:11.120> they're<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.570> not<00:03:11.690> there<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:11.900> think<00:03:11.990> Tony

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
but they're just not there I think Tony

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.510 
but they're just not there I think Tony
Stark<00:03:12.620> would<00:03:12.709> actually<00:03:12.950> be<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.070> really<00:03:13.250> good

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
Stark would actually be a really good

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.520 
Stark would actually be a really good
addition<00:03:13.970> considering<00:03:14.450> his<00:03:14.600> cosmic

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
addition considering his cosmic

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.400 
addition considering his cosmic
wanderings<00:03:16.310> of<00:03:16.430> late<00:03:16.640> yeah<00:03:17.330> I<00:03:17.660> like<00:03:18.260> the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
wanderings of late yeah I like the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.949 
wanderings of late yeah I like the
Brutes<00:03:18.680> analysis<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.640> their<00:03:20.090> last<00:03:20.360> defeat

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
Brutes analysis of their last defeat

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.280 
Brutes analysis of their last defeat
where<00:03:21.530> they<00:03:21.769> said<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:23.300> beasts<00:03:23.510> had<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> second

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
where they said the beasts had a second

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.870 
where they said the beasts had a second
mouth<00:03:24.440> we<00:03:24.709> only<00:03:24.890> saw<00:03:25.130> because<00:03:25.489> we<00:03:25.580> made<00:03:25.760> it

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
mouth we only saw because we made it

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.740 
mouth we only saw because we made it
scream<00:03:26.239> now<00:03:26.750> we<00:03:26.810> really<00:03:27.380> know<00:03:27.650> what<00:03:27.830> we<00:03:27.950> face

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.820 
scream now we really know what we face
just<00:03:29.750> thought<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:29.930> was<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.230> nice<00:03:30.530> like

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
just thought that was a nice like

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.250 
just thought that was a nice like
optimistic<00:03:31.610> way<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:31.820> look<00:03:32.030> at<00:03:32.209> this<00:03:32.390> yeah

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
optimistic way to look at this yeah

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.610 
optimistic way to look at this yeah
glass<00:03:33.739> half<00:03:33.950> full<00:03:34.150> but<00:03:35.150> Hickman<00:03:35.989> presented<00:03:36.500> us

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
glass half full but Hickman presented us

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.320 
glass half full but Hickman presented us
another<00:03:36.920> great<00:03:37.220> storyline<00:03:37.880> in<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.180> issue

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
another great storyline in this issue

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.660 
another great storyline in this issue
which<00:03:38.930> was<00:03:39.110> actually<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.620> Avenger<00:03:40.040> prisoners

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
for all kind of went into stasis before

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.110 
for all kind of went into stasis before
or<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:24.530> big<00:04:24.710> battle<00:04:24.940> probably<00:04:25.940> should<00:04:26.060> have

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
or the big battle probably should have

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.760 
or the big battle probably should have
brought<00:04:26.300> them<00:04:26.479> out<00:04:26.599> it<00:04:27.139> could<00:04:27.380> have<00:04:27.470> done<00:04:27.590> some

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
brought them out it could have done some

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.129 
brought them out it could have done some
damage<00:04:27.919> but<00:04:28.280> I<00:04:29.210> do<00:04:29.300> like<00:04:29.539> this<00:04:29.720> prisoner<00:04:30.080> of

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
damage but I do like this prisoner of

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.320 
damage but I do like this prisoner of
war<00:04:30.199> storyline<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.889> really<00:04:31.310> feel<00:04:31.490> like<00:04:31.520> this

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
war storyline I really feel like this

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.230 
war storyline I really feel like this
Marvel<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.560> Hawkeye<00:04:34.370> could<00:04:34.940> do<00:04:35.030> some<00:04:35.210> damage

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
Marvel and Hawkeye could do some damage

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.020 
Marvel and Hawkeye could do some damage
behind<00:04:35.810> enemy<00:04:36.050> lines<00:04:36.520> they<00:04:37.520> definitely<00:04:37.789> could

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
behind enemy lines they definitely could

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.150 
behind enemy lines they definitely could
I<00:04:38.090> think<00:04:38.449> it's<00:04:38.750> just<00:04:38.810> smart<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:39.620> way<00:04:39.650> Hickman

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
I think it's just smart the way Hickman

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.279 
I think it's just smart the way Hickman
is<00:04:40.250> presented<00:04:40.759> this<00:04:40.880> war<00:04:41.150> it's<00:04:41.660> not<00:04:41.780> not<00:04:42.110> only

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
is presented this war it's not not only

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.589 
is presented this war it's not not only
do<00:04:42.410> they<00:04:42.530> have<00:04:42.560> POWs<00:04:43.370> they<00:04:43.580> also<00:04:43.729> have<00:04:44.030> refugee

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
do they have POWs they also have refugee

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.870 
do they have POWs they also have refugee
camps<00:04:44.960> on<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.650> Allied<00:04:46.039> forces<00:04:46.400> it's<00:04:46.699> just

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
camps on the Allied forces it's just

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.240 
camps on the Allied forces it's just
they're<00:04:47.569> trying<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.930> find<00:04:48.139> ways<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.740> house<00:04:49.009> all

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
they're trying to find ways to house all

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.559 
they're trying to find ways to house all
these<00:04:49.460> people<00:04:49.639> and<00:04:49.910> feed<00:04:50.210> all<00:04:50.389> these<00:04:50.509> people

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
these people and feed all these people

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.140 
these people and feed all these people
and<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.530> think<00:04:51.860> that's<00:04:52.160> often<00:04:52.580> story<00:04:52.940> lines

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
and I think that's often story lines

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.670 
and I think that's often story lines
that<00:04:53.270> are<00:04:53.360> overlooked<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:54.020> these<00:04:54.289> large

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
that are overlooked and these large

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.499 
that are overlooked and these large
cosmic<00:04:55.160> events<00:04:55.430> in<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.580> past<00:04:55.610> although<00:04:56.300> that

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
cosmic events in the past although that

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.080 
cosmic events in the past although that
refugee<00:04:56.840> camp<00:04:57.169> does<00:04:57.470> look<00:04:57.620> like<00:04:57.740> it's<00:04:58.090> about

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
refugee camp does look like it's about

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.480 
refugee camp does look like it's about
to<00:04:59.240> get<00:04:59.419> destroyed<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.080> know<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:01.340> was

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490

generally people lots of people are

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.430 
generally people lots of people are
gonna<00:05:02.659> die<00:05:03.069> as<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:05.300> great<00:05:05.630> deal<00:05:05.840> for<00:05:06.050> ventures

with Kurt that the space side of
infinity<00:05:26.030> is<00:05:26.120> really<00:05:26.509> good<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:26.930> I<00:05:27.199> also

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
infinity is really good and I also
