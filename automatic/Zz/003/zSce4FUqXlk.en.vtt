cherries which are roughly chopped to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.850 
cherries which are roughly chopped to
this<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> add<00:01:04.260> some<00:01:04.530> sugar<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
this I'm going to add some sugar and

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.550 
this I'm going to add some sugar and
very<00:01:07.860> little<00:01:08.159> lemon<00:01:09.000> juice<00:01:12.020> give<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.260> nice

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
very little lemon juice give this a nice

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
very little lemon juice give this a nice
mix<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.490> reason<00:01:14.790> behind<00:01:14.909> adding<00:01:15.360> lemon<00:01:15.659> juice

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
mix the reason behind adding lemon juice

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.399 
mix the reason behind adding lemon juice
is<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.070> sugar<00:01:17.369> should<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.729> crystallize

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
is that the sugar should not crystallize

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.260 
is that the sugar should not crystallize
so<00:01:19.409> after<00:01:19.680> some<00:01:19.860> time<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.490> will<00:01:20.640> find<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
so after some time we will find that the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
so after some time we will find that the
sugar<00:01:21.780> has<00:01:22.140> given<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.680> water<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
sugar has given out this water and the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.120 
sugar has given out this water and the
cherries<00:01:23.880> too<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.659> now<00:01:25.530> I'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> leave
