 just taking out the robot in melee 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.420
 be careful will hit you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.400
 electric charge 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 best plans not only in opinion 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.880
 2 week of play 1 month 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.790
 players managed to score about 1 million 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.670
 300 thousand years one of the most sensational 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.540
 taboo plans and to this day is the plan 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.610
 strength ginger 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.829
 at the moment is on the third 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.799
 place quite a bit yielding to a friend not 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.360
 less good plan gx100 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.500
 we wish Vasilevsky in particular and strength 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.899
 empire luck in 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.549
 you are us one more and we turn to 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.979
 discussion next news 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.680
 if I'm not mistaken, the clan golden ax is already 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.390
 more than three years old at the moment it 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.329
 the creator is in gravy 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.689
 as deputy officer for compatibility 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.710
 georgy molinos their clan lied about 350 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.479
 thousand I think we'll hear again 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.460
 the most discussed topics of the week was water 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.619
 which rises after 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.599
 a certain number of moves now 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.920
 personally in my opinion bring to the end 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.690
 has the meaning 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.690
 because as always goes 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.090
 rebounds your chance to drown without also 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.640
 grow and your drowning characters can 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.830
 play in favor of rivals term 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.020
 heavy weapon means weapon 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.160
 the number of which is not more than 1 that is 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.739
 these are all kinds 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.599
 both hit at the moment is the main 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.940
 the weapon that the moment uses 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.069
 reach rival no more disputes 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.680
 players will be called because of small 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.170
 delay their opening gear want 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.760
 remind that airstrike is available in combat 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.850
 only after the third of your code 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.190
 the rest lived before 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.830
 after 2 is also one of the most relevant 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.710
 topics this week are becoming a set of commands 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.050
 Eternal I do not advise taking the kitchen and the robot 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.230
 perfectly balanced team of 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.340
 four characters is about which player 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.530
 ruling ones 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.410
 Alchemist and the character of a small veins 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.150
 desirable zones and you can smash 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.710
 enemy barricades and also without 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.990
 any danger to myself 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.810
 will be a character or an old fragment 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.520
 the main thing is not sorry for the assassin 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.710
 easier to pass with a little 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.510
 character in your team before 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.670
 to strike him with a sledgehammer advise others 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.070
 blocker and surrender also should not 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.840
 run and hide convoy the closer you are 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.390
 his attack the less likely to get 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.870
 damage his ability to release lots 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.330
 schrecken 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.980
 first and most effective tactic you 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.230
 takeaway the essence lies in 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.090
 next you try to catch 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.430
 opponent in a predicament 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.740
 introducing his team under grew by 2 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.490
 tactics such a given lesson throughout 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.950
 the whole battle 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.320
 you wear your opponent cheers while holding 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.720
 its at a safe distance here the main thing 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.910
 restraint and prudently because such fights 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.070
 usually does not take long and 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.300
 losing at least one move you doom 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.760
 yourself in the garage 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.590
 these tactics including takeaway and play 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.160
 his mouth and surely logical 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.200
 thinking 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.150
 the essence is as follows 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.610
 cover your most valuable 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.690
 while the rest of the character play on 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.970
 own discretion 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.370
 when you feel the time has come 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.040
 either when the opponent will be on 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.360
 not very comfortable positions means the most 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.460
 time to go out and ban 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.380
 and completes the protracted year according to 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.070
 many players music while playing 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.260
 motivates raises 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.780
 does not stimulate and increases accordingly 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.100
 your chances of winning 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.380
 music usually should be 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.870
 energetic and being that is it is different 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.850
 rock song tuber techno music and 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.070
 so on depending on your choice 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.170
 the musical composition will depend 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.890
 a whole victory and maybe not on 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.140
 today everything 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.540
