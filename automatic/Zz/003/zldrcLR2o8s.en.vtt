above<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.330> rest<00:04:13.310> something<00:04:14.310> else<00:04:14.630> our<00:04:15.630> show

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
above the rest something else our show

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.820 
above the rest something else our show
on<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.600> guy<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:21.230> they've<00:04:22.230> got<00:04:22.530> always

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
on this guy is the they've got always

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.410 
on this guy is the they've got always
that<00:04:23.250> mode<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:25.410> composing<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:26.340> costume<00:04:26.850> or<00:04:26.970> as

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
that mode you composing in costume or as

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.160 
that mode you composing in costume or as
a<00:04:27.480> say<00:04:27.720> as<00:04:27.900> Kato<00:04:28.200> let<00:04:29.100> me<00:04:29.220> take<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.550> hell

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
a say as Kato let me take the hell

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.170 
a say as Kato let me take the hell
perhaps<00:04:31.170> there's<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:32.040> magnum<00:04:32.460> side<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.940> holds

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
perhaps there's a magnum side that holds

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.850 
perhaps there's a magnum side that holds
everything<00:04:33.390> in

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
everything in

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.620 
everything in
so<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.760> is<00:04:35.880> what<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.090> back<00:04:36.240> of<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.450> head

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
so this is what the back of the head

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.150 
so this is what the back of the head
looks<00:04:36.840> like<00:04:38.330> top<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.510> head<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.890> bring<00:04:41.040> that

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
looks like top of the head to bring that

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.860 
looks like top of the head to bring that
forward<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:42.570> top<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:42.960> head<00:04:44.360> hasn't<00:04:45.360> got<00:04:45.660> a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
forward the top of the head hasn't got a

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.110 
forward the top of the head hasn't got a
top<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.350> head

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
top of the head

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.020 
top of the head
so<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.240> Hat<00:04:48.390> fits<00:04:48.600> snugly<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:50.460> mask<00:04:50.700> comes<00:04:51.600> up

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
so the Hat fits snugly the mask comes up

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.250 
so the Hat fits snugly the mask comes up
exactly<00:04:54.030> is<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.210> real<00:04:54.360> 1d<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:58.050> hair

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
exactly is the real 1d and the hair

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.610 
exactly is the real 1d and the hair
comes<00:04:58.560> off<00:04:58.740> hope<00:04:59.870> this<00:05:00.870> is<00:05:01.020> all<00:05:01.140> a<00:05:01.170> bit<00:05:01.380> weird

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
comes off hope this is all a bit weird

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.670 
comes off hope this is all a bit weird
and<00:05:01.830> scary<00:05:03.170> but<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:05.400> hip<00:05:05.580> oops<00:05:06.230> negative<00:05:07.230> ends
