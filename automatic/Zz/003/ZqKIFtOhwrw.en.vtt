you know what I'm considered like more
like<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:20.180> Cadillac<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.680> touchscreen<00:00:22.680> devices

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
like the Cadillac of touchscreen devices

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.210

okay<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.510> here's<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.869> rotation<00:00:25.410> feature<00:00:25.650> on

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
okay so here's the rotation feature on

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.810 
okay so here's the rotation feature on
my<00:00:26.279> phone<00:00:26.660> here's<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> rotation<00:00:28.260> feature

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
my phone here's the rotation feature

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.749

included<00:00:40.820> easy<00:00:41.820> bits<00:00:42.180> quick<00:00:42.540> menu<00:00:43.050> thing<00:00:43.410> here

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
included easy bits quick menu thing here

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
included easy bits quick menu thing here
which<00:00:44.960> seems<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> kind<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.590> thing<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
which seems like the kind of thing that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.389 
which seems like the kind of thing that
would<00:00:47.010> benefit<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.090> lot<00:00:48.420> from<00:00:48.899> an<00:00:49.379> SSD<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.100> well

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
would benefit a lot from an SSD as well

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.490 
would benefit a lot from an SSD as well
as<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> slightly<00:00:50.850> more<00:00:51.030> powerful<00:00:51.420> GPU<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:52.020> keep

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
as a slightly more powerful GPU I keep

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.299 
as a slightly more powerful GPU I keep
watching<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:53.149> ezza<00:00:54.149> oh<00:00:54.829> whoops<00:00:55.829> yeah<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
watching this ezza oh whoops yeah this

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.170 
watching this ezza oh whoops yeah this
is<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> home<00:00:56.610> network<00:00:57.859> okay<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.000> go

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
is a home network okay do that but go

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.369 
is a home network okay do that but go
away<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> try<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.510> browse<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.140> it's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
away so when I try and browse this it's

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.580 
away so when I try and browse this it's
not<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:06.390> doesn't<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.810> snappiness

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
not like it doesn't have that snappiness

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.649 
not like it doesn't have that snappiness
to<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> GUI<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.580> something<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.030> an<00:01:09.210> iOS

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to the GUI that something like an iOS

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.260 
to the GUI that something like an iOS
does<00:01:10.040> wear<00:01:11.040> when<00:01:11.280> you're<00:01:11.430> navigating<00:01:11.790> around

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
does wear when you're navigating around

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.050 
does wear when you're navigating around
things<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.110> you're<00:01:13.260> looking<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.920> stuff<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
things and you're looking at stuff you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.780 
things and you're looking at stuff you
know<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.299> has<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:16.220> that<00:01:17.220> feel<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
know it just has that that feel to it

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.420 
know it just has that that feel to it
like<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.299> all<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.830> meant<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> work

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
like it's all you know meant to work

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
like it's all you know meant to work
that<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.270> leg<00:01:21.450> eNOS<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.900> think<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
that way you see that leg eNOS I think I

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380 
that way you see that leg eNOS I think I
think<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> lot<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.430> accessing<00:01:24.180> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
think a lot of that is accessing the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.510 
think a lot of that is accessing the
hard<00:01:24.570> drive<00:01:24.720> right<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.080> or<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> overall

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
hard drive right now or when the overall

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.359 
hard drive right now or when the overall
choppiness<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.270> probably<00:01:28.229> GPU<00:01:28.770> related<00:01:29.930> um

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
choppiness is probably GPU related um

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.530 
choppiness is probably GPU related um
you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.460> what<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> keyboard<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.180> actually

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you know what the keyboard is actually

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.580

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
hats for example and then I could easily

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.270 
hats for example and then I could easily
do<00:02:12.609> my<00:02:12.819> internet<00:02:13.209> browsing<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:14.140> my<00:02:15.040> little

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.110 
do my internet browsing on my little
tablet<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.180> i<00:02:16.209> can<00:02:16.569> scroll<00:02:16.870> around<00:02:17.049> now

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
tablet so i can scroll around now

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.270

zooming<00:02:19.260> doesn't<00:02:20.260> oh<00:02:20.439> oh<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.799> does<00:02:20.920> work<00:02:21.129> I

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
zooming doesn't oh oh it does work I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.949 
zooming doesn't oh oh it does work I
look<00:02:21.459> about<00:02:21.670> okay<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.269> didn't<00:02:22.480> even<00:02:22.569> figure<00:02:22.900> out

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
look about okay I didn't even figure out

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.289 
look about okay I didn't even figure out
it<00:02:23.140> worked<00:02:23.349> before<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.099> you<00:02:24.730> see<00:02:24.909> zooming

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
compared to once again we'll go back to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.509 
compared to once again we'll go back to
