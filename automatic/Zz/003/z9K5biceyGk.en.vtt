Maria Grazia has asked you the following question on Facebook: 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
The fans already consider you a part of the club's history.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
How do you feel to be part of it and what contribution do you think you've made?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.000
I’ve spent twelve years of my career here, a considerable amount of time for a 34-year-old man, almost half of my life. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I hope that my association with Juventus can continue even longer, at least by completing 15 years with the club.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The first five years were fantastic, made up of great victories, above all in the championship.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
The Champions League has been a bit disappointing. 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.000
We had a strong side, probably the strongest in Europe, but never managed to win it. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Then I had the year in Serie B. However, I’d almost call that a pleasurable experience, 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.000
because I owed it to the Juventus fans, myself and my conscience. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It would have been too easy to walk away at that point. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.000
For the type of guy I am, it wouldn’t have felt right.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The toughest years were probably when we first returned to Serie A,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and realised that it was going to be tough to get back to winning ways. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And at times you think, was it worth the effort? 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Now that we’ve returned to the top, I’d say yes. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.000
The feeling I got last year was so amazing 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
I probably wouldn’t have experienced such emotions with any other team. 
0:02:00.500,0:01:12.000
But I hope I’ll be able to win something a little more important, before concluding my time with Juventus.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.000
Another fan of the official Juventus Facebook page, Lorenzo,
0:02:14.500,0:01:22.000
 asks if you see yourself as a director when you hang up your boots. 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:39.000
I don’t know. I always need projects, challenges and games to contest and win, 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.000
even when I retire from football. 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.000
My life’s been like that ever since I was a youngster. That’s what I need.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:13.000
Away from football, I have plenty of hobbies and situations that take up my time and keep me busy. 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.000
I’ve got a great desire to try and spread my life over 360 degrees. 
0:03:33.o00,0:03:35.000
Thanks everyone! Bye!
