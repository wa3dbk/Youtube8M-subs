00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.459
 for drilling a well not 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.170
 conventionally, you need to have the 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:12.270
 same environmental permits as for a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.789
 conventional well these permits 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.320
 regulated by the enforcement authority 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.510
 They are those that define the area in which 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.070
 will place the well and the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.380
 conditions to preserve the environment 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.660
 environment both on the surface and in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
 the subsoil is first made the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 construction of the location that consists 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.600
 in the preparation of the land in which 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.879
 the equipment will be installed in the 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.210
 unconventional development can be 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.710
 perform four or more wells per location 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 this multiple punching technique 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.280
 aims to reduce the impact 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.819
 of the activity on the environment 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.499
 and make the operation more efficient on 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:49.710
 Assembly of the equipment is done in 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.780
 parallel to 90 meters away each 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 one of these teams drill two 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.319
 wells in the location at a distance of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.319
 30 meters each 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.699
 Drilling starts until you reach 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.560
 the 350 or 400 meters to cover in 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.150
 excess levels where they usually 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.580
 be housed water resources 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.110
 underground and that should be isolated 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.570
 from the well 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.760
 in this instance it is lowered along the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.220
 well a high steel pipe 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.350
 alloy and large thickness called key zinc 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.570
 then the space between the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.850
 steel pipe and the well of this 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.100
 way the water layers are isolated and 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.500
 protect the rock layers throughout 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.670
 the useful life of the well is used the 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.760
 cement for being a material 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.090
 completely inert and innocuous for 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.250
 rock and for water 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.859
 then it is lowered inside the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.570
 pipe climbs no and continues with the 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.509
 development of the next stage of the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.490
 well once this section is finished it 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.500
 Place a new steel pipe for 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.750
 isolate the well and the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.399
 segmentation of the walls all 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.979
 materials and facilities that 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.009
 perform are tested by about 25 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.439
 percent of your resistance is 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.299
 isolation and protection activity 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.989
 performed in stages until reaching 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.940
 geological formation objective yale 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.519
 thus the water tables are 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.560
 completely safe and without possibility 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.510
 of contact with the fluids in none 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.849
 of the sections that make up the 3000 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.780
 meters of the well when the well is 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.910
 finished 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.640
 teams move 30 meters online 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.180
 to perform the same activity in another 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.150
 pair of wells in this way two teams 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.190
 build four wells per location in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.530
 some cases you can reach six u 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.989
 eight wells making the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.420
 operation on some occasions for the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.670
 extraction of the king is necessary to perform 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.750
 horizontal wells the process is the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.180
 same as in a well 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.520
 to but in this case once 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.620
 reached the target depth within 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.350
 of the generating rock , a 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.360
 90 degree curve and the well extends 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.420
 horizontally along a 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.640
 kilometer or more after this 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.010
 phase the complete structure is checked 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.010
 of the well to ensure its integrity and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.930
 begin the next stage they retire 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.880
 the derricks and a team 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.190
 specialized company arrives at the location for 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.410
 perform the hydraulic stimulation in 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.310
 which will inject a compound fluid 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.470
 by 95% water 4.5 percent of 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.010
 sand and less than 1 percent 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.010
 additives 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.360
 as a first step through a punch 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.370
 electric spaces open up in the 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.290
 steel pipe and cement in the 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.319
 bottom of the well 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.659
 then water is pumped at high pressure to 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.620
 generate small hydraulic channels in 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.629
 the micron thick rock 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.849
 to prevent these channels from closing 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.430
 when the hydraulic pressure is removed, it 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.409
 Pumping synthetic sand are small 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.260
 ceramic spheres that keep 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.120
 open fissures then a 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.700
 stopper to prevent the hydrocarbon 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.379
 flow to the surface and the 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.959
 procedure in another section of the 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.540
 pipe when the stage is finished 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.519
 of stimulation the plugs are removed and 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.440
 the hydrocarbon begins to flow through the 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.440
 microscopic channels that remained 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.540
 open this is the time to enter 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.970
 in well production the pressure 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.979
 natural pushes the water first and then 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.720
 the hydrocarbon up in the 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.510
 surface a series of facilities 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.130
 allow to handle the fluid to receive it and 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.520
 derive it through valves and 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.169
 pipes to separation units are 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.780
 performs a primary separation of 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.970
 liquids and gas the gas is sent to a 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.380
 compressor plant there treated for 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.289
 then be sent to the line of 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.120
 gas pipelines turn oil 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.000
 drift to treatment batteries for 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.010
 be sent to the distillery finally 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.710
 the well remains in production by the 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.490
 next 20 or 40 years occupying in 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.729
 surface 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.520
 a very small space the production of 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.050
 unconventional oil and gas will allow 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.139
 a significant increase in 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.110
 production in this way we will achieve the 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.319
 self-supply in the short term and 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.599
 we will recover energy sovereignty and 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.599
 pf our energy
