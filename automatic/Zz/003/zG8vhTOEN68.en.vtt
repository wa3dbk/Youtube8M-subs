 dates because the one that will be left alone 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 It's me 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.179
 very much a gift way of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.179
 penalty like giving it away 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.380
 yes yes 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.890
 you're going to need flavor cake that you 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.890
 want 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.170
 bitumen or cream to decorate cakes like 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:53.840
 be told in your country or where you live 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.840
 dark chocolate or white chocolate 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.770
 transparent sticks and sachets 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.659
 colored food colors and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.729
 preferably decorated that are of 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.729
 valentine but I did not get those 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.310
 ribbon paper decorated letters of san 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.310
 valentine with what you can decorate 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.710
 to start you have to cut your cake 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.080
 or cake as you tell them in pieces 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.420
 little ones then you have to start 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.060
 destroy it destroy it so much much 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.430
 you can remember something that you did not like 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.320
 what happened on the day or someone who did not 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.940
 you street sell the truth if you have to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.050
 start destroying it until it becomes 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.050
 polvito 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.430
 it should be more or less with this texture 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.980
 well polvito 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.350
 after you have it all polvito 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.290
 you are going to add I had everything or your cream to 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.460
 Decorating cakes or cakes by calculation 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.370
 it's like I do not know how much the truth 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.810
 It depends on how many cakes you put then 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.580
 that you put the bitumen has to 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.040
 incorporate it with a spoon fold down 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.550
 with spoon or hand them 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.890
 I recommend in the hand better 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.430
 must stay with a texture like 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.770
 this that is half hard that is 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.260
 moldable then on a plate you place 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.490
 waxed paper and the more it starts to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 make balls of different balls 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.750
 sizes if you want or is better 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.130
 preferably the truth that they are all 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.860
 of the same size so that that data 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.920
 ordered, they are going to mess you up 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.730
 Much the truth but they are worth it 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.730
 will like it very much 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.750
 more or less of this size should be 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.750
 stay 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.080
 after you have all done the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.820
 you put in the refrigerator so they get 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.080
 cold you should expect them to get well 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.750
 Cold calculates about 20 minutes 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.970
 while your grandma gets cold you can go 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:18.420
 looking for colorful ribbons ribbons with 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.720
 little hearts ribbons or cutouts that say 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.000
 pretty words can print drawings 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.980
 make letters to decorate it and 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.980
 give it away and much more books 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.760
 and if you ask how I did as the base 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.099
 where I will stop my cake pops is very 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.370
 simple single two- finger pieces of anime 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.879
 and cut to the same extent paste 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.450
 one on top of the other and I wrapped it with a 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.129
 romantic cute paper with hearts of 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.569
 decorated valentine to be 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.060
 they would see a lot more books then open 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.250
 holes with the sticks to put 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.250
 my cake pops and it will look much prettier 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.359
 after it has passed the 20 10 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.689
 minutes or whatever you left your 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:11.519
 cake pop in the fridge or in the fridge goes to 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.980
 grab all melted chocolate on 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.700
 white whatever it is and you're going to 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.760
 put a little bit of the stick 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.790
 so this to stick it in the cake 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.600
 pop 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:30.110
 and so do not fall do not move 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.110
 as well as you see there yes yes 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.790
 after your tickets have all 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.920
 chopsticks puts them back to the rest 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.290
 but one minute nothing more 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.660
 while your little ball is still cooling 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.420
 you can go coloring your chocolate 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.430
 white of colors or color that 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.890
 want me at least the color already of 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.140
 red but you can put it 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.760
 any color the truth and the more 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.229
 colors better so it looks a lot more 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.419
 colorful and brighter 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.850
 after removing them from the fridge, they can 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.620
 start putting the white chocolate or 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.080
 the chocolate of the color that you have 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.080
 put or dark chocolate 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.919
 the way you want, I recommend you 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.569
 to help you with a knife or yes 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.030
 same chocolate protects was a 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.889
 bit hard and it did not serve me like that then 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.189
 had to help me to the final with a 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.189
 knife 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:27.449
 how can you tell the final yes I 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:29.309
 helped a lot more the knife 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.500
 chocolate was getting really hard 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:34.810
 I never understood why the truth 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.360
 after placing the chocolate you put 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.490

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.889

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:48.699
 put the chocolate as you will see a little ball 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.280
 she died poor and that's how all my 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.889
