 Geez, I'm still learning to 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.899
 play but I already got a way 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.610
 way of doing things 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.020

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.120

 Probably yes. I do not know, but beauty. 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.730
 This is how the game works. 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.370
 It will start in 15 seconds. 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.710

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.379
 kit I took the first and the since 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.629

 I'm playing it's two hours since 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.979
 I think I already think I can 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 explaining the leak how it works is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.909
 Like you have to take everyone down. 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.580
 here of that platform and in that you have 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.979
 some there were some could say so 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 for example the kit that I am playing it 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.360
 has this neath ball that leaves the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.040
