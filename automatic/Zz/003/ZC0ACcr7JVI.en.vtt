00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
going to plant it at the base of this

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.249 
going to plant it at the base of this
truth<00:01:56.240> see<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.359> not<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.630> much<00:01:57.810> fish<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
truth see it's not that much fish that

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.249 
truth see it's not that much fish that
was<00:01:58.350> left<00:01:58.560> over<00:01:58.709> but<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.569> smells<00:02:00.810> pretty<00:02:01.020> fishy

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
was left over but it smells pretty fishy

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.300 
was left over but it smells pretty fishy
but

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
but

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.920 
but
it's<00:02:03.310> enough<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.390> there's<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.630> couple<00:02:04.750> things

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
it's enough so there's a couple things

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
we need to keep in mind when we plant

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.130 
we need to keep in mind when we plant
this<00:02:06.760> stuff<00:02:06.970> around<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.270> tree<00:02:07.480> one<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:07.870> make

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
this stuff around the tree one is make

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.690 
this stuff around the tree one is make
it<00:02:08.260> deep<00:02:08.440> enough<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:08.740> that<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.160> cats<00:02:09.400> in<00:02:09.610> the

it deep enough so that the cats in the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.120 
it deep enough so that the cats in the
neighborhood<00:02:09.930> and<00:02:10.930> other<00:02:11.080> animals<00:02:11.650> raccoons

we have here don't smell it and don't

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.980 
we have here don't smell it and don't
try<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.640> dig<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.970> up<00:02:16.090> because<00:02:16.240> if<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.600> leave<00:02:16.810> it

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
try to dig it up because if you leave it

try to dig it up because if you leave it
any<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.470> near<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.130> surface<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.820> will

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
any of it near the surface that will

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.480 
any of it near the surface that will
happen<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:20.080> another<00:02:20.590> thing<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.250> want<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
not really kill too many of the roots

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.040 
not really kill too many of the roots
when<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:24.880> dig<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.210> hole<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.810> want<00:02:25.990> to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
plant it pretty close to the base of the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.760 
plant it pretty close to the base of the
tree<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.810> let's<00:02:29.080> get<00:02:29.200> started<00:02:31.530> alright<00:02:32.530> so

tree so let's get started alright so

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.480 
tree so let's get started alright so
this<00:02:32.920> tree

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
this tree

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.820 
this tree
these<00:02:33.970> trees<00:02:34.210> don't<00:02:34.330> get<00:02:34.510> very<00:02:34.750> large<00:02:34.990> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
these trees don't get very large the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.980 
these trees don't get very large the
everbearing<00:02:36.460> type<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.540> tree<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.780> about

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
everbearing type now this tree is about

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.190 
everbearing type now this tree is about
ten<00:02:38.230> years<00:02:38.380> old<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:40.510> stands<00:02:40.780> up<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.110> the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
that this sprinkler line runs this way

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.460 
that this sprinkler line runs this way
that's<00:02:58.090> one<00:02:58.270> thing<00:02:58.510> in<00:02:58.660> your<00:02:58.780> yard<00:02:58.990> you<00:02:59.170> if<00:02:59.350> you

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
that's one thing in your yard you if you

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.810 
that's one thing in your yard you if you
have<00:02:59.650> irrigation<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:00.310> really<00:03:00.640> need<00:03:00.760> to

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
have irrigation you really need to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.940 
have irrigation you really need to
understand<00:03:01.210> which<00:03:01.360> ways<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.570> pipes<00:03:02.560> are<00:03:02.770> run

understand which ways the pipes are run

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.530 
understand which ways the pipes are run
so<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.370> don't<00:03:03.550> put<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.790> shovel<00:03:04.000> right

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
so that you don't put the shovel right

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.199 
so that you don't put the shovel right
through<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.610> know<00:03:06.670> that<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.000> roots

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
through it and I know that the roots

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.340 
through it and I know that the roots
from<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.420> tree<00:03:07.630> are<00:03:07.750> going<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.959> generally

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
from the tree are going to generally

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.110 
from the tree are going to generally
grow<00:03:08.560> out<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.250> direction<00:03:09.459> with<00:03:09.910> side
