00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.430 
together and sticking together and that
can<00:01:28.369> add<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:29.270> couple<00:01:29.479> calories<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:30.229> what's<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
can add a couple calories and what's the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.960 
can add a couple calories and what's the
scale<00:01:30.619> for<00:01:30.830> it's<00:01:30.920> gonna<00:01:31.220> be<00:01:31.310> very<00:01:31.670> careful

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
scale for it's gonna be very careful

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.969 
scale for it's gonna be very careful
with<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.659> measurements<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:33.679> measure

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
with the measurements so I measure

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.980 
with the measurements so I measure
everything<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.610> graham<00:01:34.819> recipes<00:01:35.690> um

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
everything to the graham recipes um

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.289 
everything to the graham recipes um
inside<00:01:36.619> of<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.799> program<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:37.340> use<00:01:37.369> we

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
inside of the program that we use we

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.760 
inside of the program that we use we
specifically<00:01:38.780> put<00:01:38.959> how<00:01:39.140> many<00:01:39.319> grams<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.679> each

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
specifically put how many grams of each

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.960 
specifically put how many grams of each
thing<00:01:40.069> is<00:01:40.190> in<00:01:40.310> there<00:01:40.429> and<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.580> tells<00:01:40.729> us<00:01:40.850> how

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
thing is in there and it tells us how

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.910 
thing is in there and it tells us how
many<00:01:41.119> calories<00:01:41.330> how<00:01:42.140> many<00:01:42.319> carbs<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.799> what

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
many calories how many carbs and what

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.830 
many calories how many carbs and what
the<00:01:43.009> ratio<00:01:43.369> is<00:01:43.399> for<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.909> ketogenic<00:01:44.360> diet<00:01:44.539> so

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
the ratio is for the ketogenic diet so

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.320 
the ratio is for the ketogenic diet so
it<00:01:44.959> says<00:01:45.110> 25<00:01:45.440> grams<00:01:45.770> put<00:01:46.220> 25<00:01:46.580> grams<00:01:46.850> exactly

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
it says 25 grams put 25 grams exactly

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.969 
it says 25 grams put 25 grams exactly
got<00:01:47.509> it<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:47.840> now<00:01:47.899> how<00:01:48.440> long<00:01:48.500> would<00:01:48.770> something

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
got it and now how long would something

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.260 
got it and now how long would something
like<00:01:49.069> this<00:01:49.190> last<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.640> refrigerator<00:01:50.149> we

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
like this last the refrigerator we

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.430 
like this last the refrigerator we
usually<00:01:50.539> don't<00:01:50.659> keep<00:01:50.840> them<00:01:50.959> more<00:01:51.080> than<00:01:51.259> like

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
usually don't keep them more than like

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.380 
usually don't keep them more than like
two<00:01:51.590> days<00:01:51.770> days<00:01:52.190> so<00:01:52.640> maybe<00:01:52.970> I'll<00:01:53.119> make<00:01:53.240> it

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
two days days so maybe I'll make it

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.699 
two days days so maybe I'll make it
three<00:01:53.569> days<00:01:53.689> in<00:01:53.869> advance

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709
