for<00:00:04.859> Watchmen<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:05.910> know<00:00:06.000> he's<00:00:06.379> super

for Watchmen you know he's super

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.650 
for Watchmen you know he's super
talented<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.550> really<00:00:09.090> respect<00:00:09.240> him<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> lot

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
talented and I really respect him a lot

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.049 
talented and I really respect him a lot
and<00:00:10.170> he<00:00:10.230> had<00:00:11.099> his<00:00:11.190> work<00:00:11.340> cut<00:00:11.519> out<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.880> him<00:00:11.940> on

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
and he had his work cut out for him on

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.720 
and he had his work cut out for him on
this<00:00:12.240> because<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:13.130> believe<00:00:14.130> that

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
this because I believe that

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.960 
this because I believe that
aesthetically<00:00:15.269> audiences<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.260> moved

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
aesthetically audiences have moved

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.599 
aesthetically audiences have moved
pretty<00:00:17.970> far<00:00:18.240> down<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.869> road<00:00:19.020> toward<00:00:19.580> what<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
pretty far down the road toward what a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.460 
pretty far down the road toward what a
superhero<00:00:21.029> costume<00:00:21.180> looks<00:00:21.539> like

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.350 

there's<00:00:28.010> a<00:00:28.070> pretty<00:00:28.220> mammoth<00:00:28.580> task<00:00:28.820> getting<00:00:29.270> it

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
there's a pretty mammoth task getting it

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.700 
there's a pretty mammoth task getting it
all<00:00:29.480> together<00:00:29.660> because<00:00:29.960> we<00:00:30.200> had<00:00:30.350> to<00:00:30.500> cover

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
all together because we had to cover

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.650 
all together because we had to cover
different<00:00:31.369> decades<00:00:31.880> from<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.270> 20th<00:00:32.630> century

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
different decades from the 20th century

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.950 
different decades from the 20th century
the<00:00:33.590> film<00:00:33.830> starts<00:00:34.130> in<00:00:34.280> 1938<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:35.480> goes<00:00:35.630> forward

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
the film starts in 1938 and goes forward

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.510 
the film starts in 1938 and goes forward
to<00:00:36.220> 1985

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
to 1985

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.330 
to 1985
so<00:00:37.970> for<00:00:38.510> each<00:00:38.720> decade<00:00:39.200> we<00:00:39.410> had<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.650> try<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.010> get

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
so for each decade we had to try and get

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.850 
so for each decade we had to try and get
some<00:00:40.640> iconic<00:00:41.180> looks<00:00:41.660> from<00:00:41.809> each<00:00:42.260> period<00:00:42.620> that

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
some iconic looks from each period that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.590 
some iconic looks from each period that
really<00:00:43.220> sort<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.550> summed<00:00:43.879> up<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.120> period<00:00:44.449> so

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
really sort of summed up the period so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.119 
really sort of summed up the period so
the<00:00:44.720> audience<00:00:45.110> would<00:00:45.290> get<00:00:45.559> a<00:00:45.590> very<00:00:45.800> clear<00:00:46.100> idea

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
the audience would get a very clear idea

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.119 
the audience would get a very clear idea
as<00:00:46.790> we<00:00:47.000> jump<00:00:47.809> cut<00:00:48.110> back<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:48.830> forward

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
as we jump cut back and forward

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.619 
as we jump cut back and forward
throughout<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.489> decades<00:00:49.820> exactly<00:00:50.330> where<00:00:50.510> we

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
throughout the decades exactly where we

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.340 
throughout the decades exactly where we
were<00:00:50.780> in<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.019> 20th<00:00:51.379> century

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990 

so<00:00:55.890> when<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.190> think<00:00:56.310> about<00:00:56.430> someone<00:00:56.820> like

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
so when you think about someone like

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
so when you think about someone like
Charlie<00:00:57.270> Jupiter<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.900> see<00:00:58.110> her<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> way

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
Charlie Jupiter we see her all the way

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.400 
Charlie Jupiter we see her all the way
back<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.070> 1938<00:00:59.700> and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.630> she<00:01:00.900> has<00:01:01.110> I<00:01:01.380> think

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
back in 1938 and then she has I think

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.530 
back in 1938 and then she has I think
eight<00:01:01.860> or<00:01:01.890> nine<00:01:02.190> different<00:01:02.640> costumes<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.239> we

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
eight or nine different costumes as we

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.750 
eight or nine different costumes as we
go<00:01:03.690> through<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.050> different<00:01:04.229> decades<00:01:04.800> we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
go through the different decades we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
go through the different decades we
built<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.120> lot<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.420> things<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.780> Carla<00:01:07.229> we

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
built a lot of things for Carla we

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
built a lot of things for Carla we
sourced<00:01:08.430> some<00:01:08.610> vintage<00:01:08.850> pieces<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.570> mix<00:01:09.780> them

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
sourced some vintage pieces we mix them

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
sourced some vintage pieces we mix them
together<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:11.040> create<00:01:11.220> our<00:01:11.610> character

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
together and to create our character

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.480 
together and to create our character
which<00:01:12.330> was<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.570> lot<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> fun

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.429 

in<00:01:16.490> gathering<00:01:16.729> together<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.390> costume<00:01:18.080> stock

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
in gathering together the costume stock

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.710 
in gathering together the costume stock
for<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.710> film<00:01:18.979> we<00:01:19.280> really<00:01:19.549> tried<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.820> take<00:01:20.479> our

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
for the film we really tried to take our

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.289 
for the film we really tried to take our
starting<00:01:21.439> point<00:01:21.680> from<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.520> graphic<00:01:22.850> novel<00:01:23.180> we

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
starting point from the graphic novel we

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.149 
starting point from the graphic novel we
want<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.570> be<00:01:23.659> very<00:01:23.899> respectful<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.890> source

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
want to be very respectful to the source

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.270 
want to be very respectful to the source
material<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:27.380> affected<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:27.830> lot<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.189> our

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
material so it affected a lot of our

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.429 
material so it affected a lot of our
choice<00:01:28.520> of<00:01:28.729> colors<00:01:29.060> we<00:01:29.240> really<00:01:29.540> tried<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:29.899> keep

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
choice of colors we really tried to keep

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.980 
choice of colors we really tried to keep
within<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.399> greens<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:32.119> purples<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
within the the greens the purples the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.020 
within the the greens the purples the
murky<00:01:33.440> sort<00:01:33.680> of<00:01:33.740> secondary<00:01:34.280> colors<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.880> are

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
murky sort of secondary colors that are

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.200 
murky sort of secondary colors that are
in<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:36.140> graphic<00:01:36.710> novel<00:01:36.740> but<00:01:37.430> we<00:01:37.610> also<00:01:37.759> tried

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
in the graphic novel but we also tried

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.050 
in the graphic novel but we also tried
to<00:01:38.240> really<00:01:38.899> give<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:39.680> real<00:01:39.950> sense<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.430> period<00:01:40.880> or

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
to really give a real sense of period or

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.550 
to really give a real sense of period or
fantasy<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.840> movie<00:01:42.140> because<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.439> was

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
fantasy to the movie because it was

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.130 
fantasy to the movie because it was
important<00:01:43.130> for<00:01:43.250> us<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:43.460> we<00:01:44.030> wanted<00:01:44.990> to

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
important for us that we wanted to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.460 
important for us that we wanted to
represent<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.220> 20th<00:01:46.580> century<00:01:46.970> as<00:01:47.179> it<00:01:47.780> was<00:01:48.020> if

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
represent the 20th century as it was if

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.070 
represent the 20th century as it was if
there<00:01:49.009> had<00:01:49.190> really<00:01:49.520> been<00:01:49.729> superheroes<00:01:50.450> we

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
there had really been superheroes we

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.070 
there had really been superheroes we
really<00:01:51.380> needed<00:01:51.679> to<00:01:52.420> be<00:01:53.420> faithful<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.869> the

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
really needed to be faithful to the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.289 
really needed to be faithful to the
original<00:01:54.310> designs<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.729> time<00:01:56.630> period<00:01:57.049> but<00:01:57.799> I

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
original designs and time period but I

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.770 
original designs and time period but I
think<00:01:59.299> we<00:01:59.690> needed<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.409> address<00:02:00.909> what<00:02:01.909> my

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
think we needed to address what my

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.980 
think we needed to address what my
parents<00:02:03.049> or<00:02:03.409> my<00:02:03.920> neighbors<00:02:04.549> knew<00:02:05.240> about

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
parents or my neighbors knew about

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.840
