00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.520
 that i get because triathlon scene de 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.549
 "We can address the issues of the brain today 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.969
 License affect the factor in endurance benefits 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.250
 Dorweiler we speak above all about the Prussian findings the us 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.570
 Provide science 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.890
 a not very easy topic but to hear all the more interesting 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.890
 yes that's actually starting points percent how to do that 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.070
 Brain can provide accordingly 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.410
 that the muscles also benefit from it and want exactly that in the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.250
 contribution 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.170
 discuss 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.960
 it works 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 not only about competition performance but of course training performances as well 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.620
 Of course, there are various possibilities that can not influence this 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.140
 legal means 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.510
 and the assumption you just made it up front 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.620
 to say 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.520
 Which 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.960
 There are factors influencing the supply of the brain around the turn 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.030
 to draw conclusions as to how the muscles are controlled in plain text 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.220
 does that mean 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.030
 tired means to belong 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.500
 That could be faster than my local muscles 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.830
 Be starting point 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.090
 or are the conditions different? 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.340
 an investigation that I just want to sketch very briefly um 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.840
 to make it clear how the whole 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.050
 Yarbrough Calisir was sure of this 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.350
 is so that you can different subjects 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.680
 under a sports load has tested 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.480
 back to just a certain amount of fatigue 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.299
 and percent has then 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.179
 after this 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.990
 the subjects willingly 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.400
 were no longer able to increase their performance at the end 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.750
 The muscles are electrically irritated and 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.549
 you could tell that the muscles were actually there 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.650
 was able 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.020
 still to open up performance potential 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.780
 So that means the brain is actually falling at the moment 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.220
 Has 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.990
 to work even harder in intensity Demus sounded to himself 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 even considered but still able was still ready to perform 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.800
 put 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.140
 the steadier I accept 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.620
 have called this 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.990
 at the beginning 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.380
 that the brain actually seemed tired quickly 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.159
 as local musculature 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.369
 that means central efforts 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.000
 in front of the restaurant one million 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.360
 so he really was 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.219
 breakthrough 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.799
 a park in science, and that fatigue of the brain is that 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:21.299
 Wars 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.180
 It is after this brain performance that the brain is really percent Prokop 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.370
 Percent, how it looks from the body, what help me with measured values 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.569
 Maestri gives feedback from the body 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.709
 Percent and then squat does not say plenty of rule down so it's handy 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.609
 only active power and that's what the brain will be doing 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.719
 so it's just really tired and 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.109
 The chemical processes or the aliens mother can no longer produce the 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.039
 it would be necessary to understand that, so it's the brain 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:50.820
 They are constantly receiving information from the periphery 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.960
 so that means 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.059
 about the lactate behavior about the oxygen saturation of the blood ezb-rat 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.579
 and around 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.019
 this information is processed in the brain and indeed 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.819
 Prey frontal cortex is discussed exactly so this is the area the 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.510
 directly behind our stands 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.959
 that is also the youngest part in the history of the brain and development 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.369
 There, the information is bundled 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.599
 balanced across many complicated circuits 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.769
 so that in the end then a decision is made as behavior 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.790
 I'm on the Havel, I behave myself 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.059
 The brain is assured that my own survival is assured 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.889
 around 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:29.700
 So first of all try to secure your own existence that means 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.060
 if the oxygen saturation 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.459
 Absinthe in the blood 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.589
 then it means 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.179
 Shut down the system 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:37.129
 because for me it is important that I first 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.309
 50 can continue working so you can 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.509
 maybe roughly outline more carrots 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.760
 and that's why it's just like you 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.029
 said firm will sure decisions 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.059
 for the brain, which of course we do not influence at the moment 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.859
 can 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.239
 So then, then seen an automatism 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.159
 and that's exactly what you have tried to test 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.159
 Now this influence of the brain on the but it must Color Tour so big 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:01.449
 Jan 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.050
 that the work 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.229
 is set earlier than it should actually be set 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.369
 and that was the result of these different investigations 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.639
 and then you wondered how can you do that percent 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.219
 measure on the one hand he has thought Rische irritate as I said 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.310
 and percent but which mechanisms are behind it Utøya reasons 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.310
 So not only that is stuff saturation but other things 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:26.659
 and there came 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.110
 very interesting 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.420
 Things to the fore 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.820
 and then there comes his significance percent for us triathletes 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.699
 but it is crucial 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.629
 m with rather intense loads 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.479
 that the body or that he had the muscles first Kundra 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.259
 it is also used in intensive or long-lasting 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.539
 Burdens that we had our contributions 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:49.740
 to 1 m 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.330
 interestingly, there is more to the burning of protein than 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.849
 fuels 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:59.839
 and percent if now a shortage of amino acids are presented amino acids 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.810
 nothing else than split 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.080
 Proteins here 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.339
 so if it is here 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:08.330
 Anger to the lack of percent determine amino acids comes because they just as 

00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:09.979
 Energy sources are consumed 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.050
 then there are supposed to be other anime 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.659
 Weightings within the blood pressure Düren outweigh 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.580
 to this amino acid tryptophan 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.330
 and tryptophan eventually leads to the formation of Pizarro Tuningen Xarelto 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.479
 minister 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.210
 the percent 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.289
 the middle 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.909
 Drowsy and percent sleepy makes the Sunset Spanung 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.479
 In fact, something like that is basically not desirable in some situations 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.669
 to play sports 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.030
 thus ensures that the brain meets the mill 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.800
 because the so-called blood-brain barrier 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.480
 Barrier then ensures 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.610
 that this amino acid is very fast 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.030
 penetrates into spheres and, as I said there, provides for mills and if that 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.689
 Brain it more tired that 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:52.800
 then percent 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.150
 Also, do not paint or become the appropriate signals in the musculature 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.010
 just throttled 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.110
 that means we have 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.270
 Percent certain foul of amino acids in the blood 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.470
 If we use sports, it comes to a consumption of these amino acids 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.110
 burned somehow and thereby percent to one 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.480
 it comes with the indiscriminate of the stamp amino acids we could bit 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.919
 messed up and that clears the way for Treptow in front and then in the episode 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.699
 Serotonin in the brain makes that effort and 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.949
 you tax often determines too high water and glory that somehow came to a halt 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.759
 could still save it exactly while that is yes 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.009
 Subject on the investigations who keeps to questions FIFA 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.830
 this and how can you counter it and you have noticed 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.150
 that especially with endurance load the 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.710
 over 90 minutes 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.919
 that this consumption of amino acids is incredibly high that you have to 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.689
 Example detected by both marathons 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.330
 that consumption 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.650
 Proteins Eiweißen because one 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.410
 Marathon races at about 40 to 60 grams of lights were already extremely high 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.919
 and the question was then what can you do in the area 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.009
 To stop these with this developmental process the brain 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:58.330
 to keep fresh 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.680
 and that with a while in the meaning for us as triathletes because 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.400
 this is a torso of the classic competition area from 90 minutes onwards 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.130
 now times the folk of the tooth so the sprint competitions was out 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.490
 Starting and ending the dance move us normally 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.449
 in such a time range 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:18.680
 and as I said from this time from 90 minutes he drove dead ramp up 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.580
 extremely high 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.120
 yes, it is again different from what you do 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.880
 in the short interview in the area
