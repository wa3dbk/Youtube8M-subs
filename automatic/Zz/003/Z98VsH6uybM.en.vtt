this<00:03:12.970> video<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.450> think<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.959> would<00:03:14.079> be<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.230> great

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
this video I think it would be a great

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.390 
this video I think it would be a great
idea<00:03:14.560> yep<00:03:15.549> okay<00:03:16.269> good<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:16.810> bust<00:03:17.440> it<00:03:17.680> into<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
idea yep okay good so bust it into the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.699 
idea yep okay good so bust it into the
shield<00:03:18.700> generator<00:03:18.790> tower<00:03:19.480> another<00:03:20.079> guy<00:03:20.260> on

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
shield generator tower another guy on

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.160 
shield generator tower another guy on
the<00:03:20.860> ceiling<00:03:21.220> somewhere<00:03:21.930> still<00:03:22.930> didn't
