00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.709 
rendering on the Mac and Windows if you
wanted<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.610> but<00:00:11.790> he<00:00:11.880> says<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.210> got<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.509> Mac

side<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.950> I'll<00:00:14.160> show<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.089> steps<00:00:15.269> I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
side going so I'll show you the steps I

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.870 
side going so I'll show you the steps I
used<00:00:15.629> to<00:00:16.260> do<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.100> first<00:00:17.460> thing<00:00:17.610> I<00:00:17.670> did<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
used to do this so first thing I did is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.730 
used to do this so first thing I did is
actually<00:00:18.650> created<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.830> path<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.660> solid<00:00:22.410> path<00:00:22.530> on

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
actually created a path a solid path on

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.490 
actually created a path a solid path on
my<00:00:22.890> root<00:00:23.760> drive<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.870> which<00:00:25.020> is<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.200> IP<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
my root drive here so which is the IP to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.170 
my root drive here so which is the IP to
my<00:00:25.800> server<00:00:26.130> where<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.730> files<00:00:26.910> are

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
my server where all the files are

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.840 
my server where all the files are
sitting<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.190> basically<00:00:29.190> there's<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.550> machine

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
sitting so basically there's the machine

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.430 
sitting so basically there's the machine
and<00:00:30.060> there's<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.360> share<00:00:30.600> folder<00:00:30.870> and<00:00:31.290> then

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:31.440 
and there's the share folder and then

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.829 
and there's the share folder and then
from<00:00:31.650> there<00:00:32.089> it's<00:00:33.089> just<00:00:33.179> through<00:00:33.449> your<00:00:33.480> here

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839 
from there it's just through your here

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:35.779 
from there it's just through your here
whatever<00:00:34.079> shirt<00:00:34.379> folders<00:00:34.739> are<00:00:34.859> within<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
whatever shirt folders are within that

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.599 
whatever shirt folders are within that
they<00:00:36.269> you<00:00:36.420> share<00:00:37.019> over<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> network<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
they you share over the network so I

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.520 
they you share over the network so I
just<00:00:38.850> made<00:00:38.999> a<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.329> directory<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:40.260> IP

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
just made a make directory the IP

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.380 
just made a make directory the IP
address<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.339> the<00:00:41.460> share<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.089> make

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
address and then the share so to make

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.509 
address and then the share so to make
directories<00:00:42.929> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.949> do<00:00:44.039> in<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
directories and then what I do in the

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.290 
directories and then what I do in the
terminal<00:00:45.179> here<00:00:45.620> oops

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
terminal here oops

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.819 
terminal here oops
you<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.539> minimize<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.589> in<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you just minimize this so in the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.360 
you just minimize this so in the
terminal<00:00:50.159> then<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.820> need<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.269> do<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:52.370> just

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
terminal then all I need to do is just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.569 
terminal then all I need to do is just
clear<00:00:53.609> this<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.940> make<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.179> cleaner<00:00:55.109> I<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.429> a

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
clear this to make it cleaner I do a

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
clear this to make it cleaner I do a
mount<00:00:57.120> there's<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.809> SMB

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
mount there's an SMB

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.250 
mount there's an SMB
filesystem<00:00:59.370> mount<00:00:59.519> specifically<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:01.050> what<00:01:01.229> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
filesystem mount specifically so what I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.460 
filesystem mount specifically so what I
do<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.710> use<00:01:02.519> the<00:01:02.729> SMB<00:01:03.420> FS<00:01:04.370> here's<00:01:05.370> my<00:01:06.470> network

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
do is use the SMB FS here's my network

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.890 
do is use the SMB FS here's my network
Samba<00:01:08.340> directory<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.940> then<00:01:09.360> I'm<00:01:09.480> mounting<00:01:09.810> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
Samba directory and then I'm mounting it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.410 
Samba directory and then I'm mounting it
to<00:01:09.930> basically<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> identical<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.300> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to basically the identical one and the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.020 
to basically the identical one and the
idea<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:12.900> all<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> operating<00:01:14.340> systems<00:01:14.460> have

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
idea is all the operating systems have

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.600 
idea is all the operating systems have
to<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> same<00:01:15.900> same<00:01:16.620> mounts<00:01:17.010> alright<00:01:17.310> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to have the same same mounts alright so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.410 
to have the same same mounts alright so
without<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> nothing<00:01:19.080> will<00:01:19.230> work<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> it's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
without that nothing will work so it's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.930 
without that nothing will work so it's
gonna<00:01:21.540> hit<00:01:22.050> enter<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.670> should

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
gonna hit enter on that and they should

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.240 
gonna hit enter on that and they should
go<00:01:24.120> through<00:01:24.380> take<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.410> second<00:01:25.770> or<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.010> mount

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
go through take a second or so to mount

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.420 
go through take a second or so to mount
everything<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:27.780> now<00:01:28.440> there<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.040> my<00:01:29.190> share

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
everything and now there it is my share

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.100 
everything and now there it is my share
is<00:01:29.580> actually<00:01:30.000> done<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.630> pop<00:01:30.810> up<00:01:30.990> in

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
is actually done you see it pop up in

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.590 
is actually done you see it pop up in
the<00:01:31.200> finder<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:32.100> good<00:01:32.340> here

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the finder so I'm good here

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.570 
the finder so I'm good here
the<00:01:33.810> next<00:01:34.020> thing<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.200> need<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.890> I'm

the next thing you need to do is I'm
just<00:01:35.640> gonna<00:01:35.790> cat<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> create

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
just gonna cat this but I have to create

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.430 
just gonna cat this but I have to create
a<00:01:36.900> file<00:01:37.230> in<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.650> path<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.090> file<00:01:39.090> folder<00:01:39.870> into

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
a file in my path the file folder into

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.790 
a file in my path the file folder into
etc'<00:01:40.860> directory<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.900> is<00:01:43.200> does<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
etc' directory and what this is does is

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.190 
etc' directory and what this is does is
basically<00:01:44.010> sets<00:01:44.430> my<00:01:44.610> path<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.480> when<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.660> type<00:01:46.050> in

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
basically sets my path so when I type in

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.890 
basically sets my path so when I type in
render<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.940> know<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.480> renders<00:01:48.630> the
