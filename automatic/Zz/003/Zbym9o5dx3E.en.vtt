driving more than that five minutes okay
okay<00:00:49.370> there's<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:50.520> ways<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:50.969> your

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
okay there's two ways you can get your

okay there's two ways you can get your
radio<00:00:51.270> serial<00:00:51.750> number<00:00:52.020> first<00:00:52.320> way<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
radio serial number first way is that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
radio serial number first way is that
you<00:00:53.309> pull<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.550> radio<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.300> look<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
serial number on the side or the rear

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.360 
serial number on the side or the rear
spoiler<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> sticker<00:00:57.960> somewhere<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.469> but

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
spoiler on a sticker somewhere on it but

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.889 
spoiler on a sticker somewhere on it but
the<00:00:59.489> second<00:00:59.820> much<00:00:59.969> easier<00:01:00.270> way<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
I'll radio code for this for this radio

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.980 
I'll radio code for this for this radio
is<00:02:18.500> three<00:02:18.740> one<00:02:18.980> four<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.640> five<00:02:19.990> actually

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
is three one four to five actually

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.350 
is three one four to five actually
having<00:02:21.260> entered<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.770> yet<00:02:22.040> but<00:02:22.370> I'm<00:02:23.090> gonna

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
having entered this yet but I'm gonna

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.360 
having entered this yet but I'm gonna
try<00:02:24.080> figuring<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:24.830> out<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.640> we<00:02:25.760> got<00:02:26.110> three

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
try figuring this out so we got three

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:36.490 
try figuring this out so we got three
one<00:02:28.570> four<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:30.080> five<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:35.510> was<00:02:35.690> not<00:02:36.020> how<00:02:36.320> it's

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
one four to five that was not how it's

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.090 
one four to five that was not how it's
gonna<00:02:36.620> work

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
gonna work

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:45.729 
gonna work
yes<00:02:43.600> okay<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.900> actually<00:02:45.080> taking<00:02:45.590> me<00:02:45.709> a

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
yes okay this is actually taking me a

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.410 
yes okay this is actually taking me a
couple<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.040> times<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.430> enter<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:46.820> radio<00:02:47.209> at

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
couple of times to enter this radio at

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.000 
couple of times to enter this radio at
the<00:02:47.690> inter<00:02:47.989> radio<00:02:48.230> code<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.530> don't<00:02:48.650> know<00:02:48.860> why

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
the inter radio code I don't know why

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.970 
the inter radio code I don't know why
but<00:02:49.310> anyway<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:50.780> I<00:02:51.260> got<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.620> key<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
but anyway so I got the key in the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.509 
but anyway so I got the key in the
accessory<00:02:52.340> position<00:02:53.230> turn<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.260> radio<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.100> and

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
accessory position turn the radio on and

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.420 
accessory position turn the radio on and
got<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.269> word<00:02:56.480> code<00:02:57.110> up<00:02:57.320> here<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.950> then<00:02:58.100> I'm

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
got the word code up here and then I'm

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.890 
got the word code up here and then I'm
just<00:02:58.580> going<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.820> put<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.180> code<00:02:59.360> 3<00:03:00.320> 1<00:03:00.560> 4<00:03:01.120> 2<00:03:02.120> 5

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
just going to put in the code 3 1 4 2 5

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.920 
just going to put in the code 3 1 4 2 5
there<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:03.709> go<00:03:04.180> finally<00:03:06.790> but<00:03:07.790> uh<00:03:07.820> yeah<00:03:08.570> for<00:03:08.780> some

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
there we go finally but uh yeah for some

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.810 
there we go finally but uh yeah for some
reason<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.260> was<00:03:09.590> doing<00:03:09.680> exactly<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.519> and

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
reason I was doing exactly this and

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.870 
reason I was doing exactly this and
after<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.630> got<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.989> radio<00:03:12.260> code<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.769> got<00:03:13.580> exactly

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
after I got the radio code I got exactly

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.000 
after I got the radio code I got exactly
this<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.480> put<00:03:14.690> three<00:03:14.989> one<00:03:15.260> four<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.739> five

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
this and I put three one four to five

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.280 
this and I put three one four to five
and<00:03:16.220> on<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.030> would<00:03:17.630> hear<00:03:17.810> a<00:03:17.840> beep

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
and on to I would hear a beep

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.770 
and on to I would hear a beep
it<00:03:18.380> would<00:03:18.530> beep<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.040> they<00:03:19.190> would<00:03:19.340> say<00:03:19.489> error

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
it would beep and they would say error

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.420 
it would beep and they would say error
so<00:03:20.780> keep<00:03:21.230> trying<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> couple<00:03:21.920> times<00:03:22.220> it

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
so keep trying that a couple times it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.270 
so keep trying that a couple times it
still<00:03:22.640> didn't<00:03:22.910> work<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.269> ended<00:03:23.480> up<00:03:23.570> actually

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
still didn't work I ended up actually

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.190 
still didn't work I ended up actually
just<00:03:25.280> right<00:03:25.459> now<00:03:25.610> I<00:03:25.640> took<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.750> reset<00:03:27.170> the

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
just right now I took I reset the

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.789 
just right now I took I reset the
disconnected<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.040> battery<00:03:28.070> again<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:29.799> since

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
disconnected the battery again and since

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.500 
disconnected the battery again and since
I<00:03:30.890> had<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.160> code<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.640> just<00:03:31.790> came<00:03:32.060> here<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.329> got

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
I had the code it just came here and got

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.420 
I had the code it just came here and got
it<00:03:32.630> directly<00:03:33.019> just<00:03:33.530> put<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.070> if<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.310> run
