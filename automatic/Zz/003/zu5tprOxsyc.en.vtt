00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
going to happen as flashbacks later on

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.889 
going to happen as flashbacks later on
in<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.160> story<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> guys<00:00:33.030> read<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.510> manga

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
in the story if you guys read the manga

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.520 
in the story if you guys read the manga
now<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:35.760> did<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.870> series<00:00:37.140> it

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
now what they did in this series it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.260 
now what they did in this series it
seems<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:39.510> put<00:00:40.020> these<00:00:40.469> flashbacks

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
seems is that they put these flashbacks

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.150 
seems is that they put these flashbacks
when<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.570> appear<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.649> not<00:00:43.739> really

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
when they appear so they are not really

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700 
when they appear so they are not really
flashbacks<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> series<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.379> put

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
flashbacks in this series they are put

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.029 
flashbacks in this series they are put
in<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.219> right<00:00:47.520> order<00:00:48.469> when<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.649> happen

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
in there right order when they happen

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.250 
in there right order when they happen

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
like for example were some flashbacks

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.680 
like for example were some flashbacks
that<00:00:52.559> happened<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.460> training<00:00:53.760> camp<00:00:54.120> which

of the episode he was training with dead

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.530 
of the episode he was training with dead
a<00:02:56.980> three-dimensional<00:02:57.980> manuring<00:02:58.430> year<00:02:58.820> which

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
a three-dimensional manuring year which

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.160 
a three-dimensional manuring year which
turns<00:02:59.930> out<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.860> was<00:03:01.040> actually<00:03:01.360> faulty<00:03:02.360> it

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
turns out it was actually faulty it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.350 
turns out it was actually faulty it
resulted<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.430> reason<00:03:04.730> why<00:03:04.820> he<00:03:04.940> was<00:03:05.060> failing

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
resulted the reason why he was failing

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.080 
resulted the reason why he was failing
constantly<00:03:05.989> was<00:03:06.560> because<00:03:07.100> he<00:03:07.310> can<00:03:07.520> he<00:03:07.910> get

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
constantly was because he can he get

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.340 
constantly was because he can he get
like<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.300> rusty<00:03:08.630> belt<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:10.930> in<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.110> end<00:03:12.140> he

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
like a rusty belt and in the end he

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.060 
like a rusty belt and in the end he
changed<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.190> year<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.820> he<00:03:14.060> was<00:03:14.090> able<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:15.070> be

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
changed that year and he was able to be

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.460 
changed that year and he was able to be
stable<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.970> that<00:03:17.209> like<00:03:17.480> training<00:03:17.810> apparatus

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
stable in that like training apparatus

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.229 
stable in that like training apparatus
so<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:19.250> also<00:03:19.489> what<00:03:19.610> I<00:03:19.700> really<00:03:19.970> liked<00:03:20.150> about

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
so that's also what I really liked about

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.170 
so that's also what I really liked about
the<00:03:20.540> episode<00:03:20.810> over<00:03:21.170> all<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.820> say<00:03:22.850> I

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
the episode over all I have to say I

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.720 
the episode over all I have to say I
liked<00:03:23.660> this<00:03:23.989> episode<00:03:24.170> because<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:25.310> the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
liked this episode because of the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.970 
liked this episode because of the
realism<00:03:26.180> now<00:03:26.810> not<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.380> part<00:03:27.709> with<00:03:27.950> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
realism now not the part with the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.910 
realism now not the part with the
tightest<00:03:28.549> because<00:03:28.940> obviously<00:03:29.769> taxes<00:03:30.769> not

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
tightest because obviously taxes not

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.300 
tightest because obviously taxes not

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
that was funny as hell at one point

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.720 
that was funny as hell at one point
actually<00:04:00.290> thought<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:00.860> she<00:04:01.130> became<00:04:01.400> like<00:04:01.670> a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
actually thought that she became like a

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.960 
actually thought that she became like a
real<00:04:02.000> demon<00:04:02.630> but<00:04:03.530> later<00:04:03.920> on<00:04:04.070> I<00:04:04.220> realized<00:04:04.549> that

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
real demon but later on I realized that

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.420 
real demon but later on I realized that
that<00:04:05.540> was<00:04:05.720> just<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:06.079> comedic<00:04:06.829> moment<00:04:08.380> overall

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
that was just a comedic moment overall

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.490 
that was just a comedic moment overall
the<00:04:10.430> episode<00:04:10.730> was<00:04:10.880> quite<00:04:11.150> interesting<00:04:11.780> he

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
the episode was quite interesting he

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.090 
the episode was quite interesting he
seems<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.010> micasa<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.790> really<00:04:14.120> a<00:04:14.150> badass

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
seems that a micasa is really a badass

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.630 
seems that a micasa is really a badass
irony<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.850> can<00:04:17.030> say<00:04:17.239> it's<00:04:17.539> he's<00:04:18.229> also<00:04:18.640> quite

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
irony and I can say it's he's also quite

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.599 
irony and I can say it's he's also quite
awesome

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609
