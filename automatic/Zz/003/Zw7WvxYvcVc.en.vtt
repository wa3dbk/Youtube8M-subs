that<00:01:30.899> sand<00:01:31.680> off<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> track<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:34.140> figure<00:01:34.469> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that sand off the track you figure that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.959 
that sand off the track you figure that
if<00:01:34.680> you're<00:01:34.799> running<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.130> race<00:01:35.399> league<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.909> you

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
if you're running a race league that you

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.420 
if you're running a race league that you
wouldn't<00:01:36.270> move<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.439> huge<00:01:37.680> sand<00:01:38.070> drifting

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
wouldn't move in a huge sand drifting

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
wouldn't move in a huge sand drifting
the<00:01:38.490> track<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.880> people<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.210> run<00:01:39.360> into<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the track for people to run into you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.310 
the track for people to run into you
know<00:01:40.680> might<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.039> dangerous

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.770 

and<00:01:44.830> then<00:01:45.040> again<00:01:45.280> Mario<00:01:45.910> Kart<00:01:46.240> has<00:01:46.300> bought

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
and then again Mario Kart has bought

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.600 
and then again Mario Kart has bought
active<00:01:47.200> lava<00:01:47.470> fields<00:01:48.040> in<00:01:48.130> some<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.460> race

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
active lava fields in some of the race

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:58.170 
active lava fields in some of the race
courses<00:01:48.940> so<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:50.080> can't<00:01:50.290> be<00:01:50.350> too<00:01:50.590> bad<00:01:57.180> speed

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
courses so it can't be too bad speed

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.000 
courses so it can't be too bad speed
boost<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.600> knock<00:01:58.900> sonic<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.440> which<00:01:59.710> means

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
boost and knock sonic on which means

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.650 
boost and knock sonic on which means
that<00:02:00.160> pretty<00:02:00.670> much<00:02:00.850> in<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.060> win<00:02:03.600> another<00:02:04.600> one

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
I just managed to get the first just at

I just managed to get the first just at
the<00:04:03.180> last<00:04:03.300> second<00:04:03.920> go<00:04:04.920> me<00:04:13.790> please<00:04:14.790> cap

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.810 

is<00:04:30.840> your<00:04:31.110> standard<00:04:31.500> snow<00:04:32.130> level<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.640> a<00:04:32.670> lot

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
is your standard snow level that a lot

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.740 
is your standard snow level that a lot
of<00:04:32.850> sonic<00:04:33.270> games<00:04:33.300> have<00:04:37.880> it<00:04:38.880> plays<00:04:39.150> similar<00:04:39.420> to

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
of sonic games have it plays similar to

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.180 
of sonic games have it plays similar to
you've<00:04:40.080> got<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.290> snow<00:04:40.530> dress<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.890> it<00:04:40.980> really

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
you've got the snow dress and it really

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.790 
you've got the snow dress and it really
does<00:04:41.400> play<00:04:41.610> pretty<00:04:42.030> similar<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.420> desert<00:04:42.810> Hill

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.200 

so<00:04:46.800> we've<00:04:46.980> got<00:04:47.160> snow<00:04:47.490> drifts<00:04:47.850> you've<00:04:47.940> got<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
so we've got snow drifts you've got the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.000 
so we've got snow drifts you've got the
loops<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:52.260> whole<00:04:52.410> track<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:52.860> pretty

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
loops and the whole track is pretty

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.100 
loops and the whole track is pretty
slick<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:53.700> actually<00:04:54.480> can<00:04:54.630> be<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.780> little<00:04:54.930> bit

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
slick so actually can be a little bit

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:06.580 
slick so actually can be a little bit
difficult<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.530> stairs

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.770 

this<00:05:07.220> level<00:05:07.430> takes<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:07.850> bit<00:05:08.000> longer<00:05:08.030> not

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
this level takes a bit longer not

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.140 
this level takes a bit longer not
because<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.170> track<00:05:09.590> itself<00:05:10.220> is<00:05:10.490> longer<00:05:10.940> but

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
because the track itself is longer but

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150 
because the track itself is longer but
because<00:05:11.540> of<00:05:11.570> that<00:05:11.780> just<00:05:12.560> because<00:05:12.830> of<00:05:12.860> all<00:05:13.040> the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
because of that just because of all the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.310 
because of that just because of all the
snow<00:05:13.460> drifts<00:05:13.820> making<00:05:14.480> you<00:05:14.540> slow<00:05:14.840> down<00:05:15.050> all<00:05:15.230> the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
snow drifts making you slow down all the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:27.839 
snow drifts making you slow down all the
time

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.529 

particularly<00:05:28.849> amusing<00:05:29.030> what<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.389> takes

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
particularly amusing what it takes

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.900 
particularly amusing what it takes
itself<00:05:29.840> I<00:05:30.050> cheat<00:05:30.860> self<00:05:31.190> out<00:05:31.310> of<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.460> first-place

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
itself I cheat self out of a first-place

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.450 
itself I cheat self out of a first-place
win<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:32.449> way

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.559 

okay<00:05:38.460> you<00:05:38.520> might<00:05:38.789> want<00:05:38.940> to<00:05:39.000> stop<00:05:39.270> throwing

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
okay you might want to stop throwing

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.360 
okay you might want to stop throwing
those<00:05:39.810> thing<00:05:40.080> your<00:05:40.289> aim<00:05:40.470> seems<00:05:40.860> to<00:05:41.039> be<00:05:41.160> off

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
those thing your aim seems to be off

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
just because I can I forget whether this

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.650 
just because I can I forget whether this
level<00:06:10.600> is<00:06:10.690> a<00:06:10.720> cycle<00:06:11.170> I<00:06:11.350> think<00:06:11.560> it<00:06:11.650> does<00:06:12.630> okay<00:06:13.630> I

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
level is a cycle I think it does okay I

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.570 
level is a cycle I think it does okay I
