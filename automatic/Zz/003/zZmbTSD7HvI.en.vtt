 It's important that you use this part 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:47.049
 here the nail tone treats making 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.049

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:12.829
 Who do you know is making your outline? 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.070
 I like it that way if it's pulled 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.729
 people, each one of his parents in his own way 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.729

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.660
 It's important that you had told 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.470
 broken hand if you like some 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.800
 thing a little cranium 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:51.310
 I live an error cotton cream one 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:54.490
 little or even remove imperfections 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.550
 there it is only to return with a little base or 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.550
 to correct where you left off. 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.539
 removed base or concealer 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.810
 Look, people, I'm going to spend more now. 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.710

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.950

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:37.830
 components of the hand is to paint some 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:43.440

 I hope you have enjoyed it a lot more. 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.170
 close to a point 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.360
 As I said, you may be doing 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:55.110
 the second layer passes the first layer 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.840
 Shade a finger after her to stay 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.200
 more black back again with another 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:04.110
 layer of shadow over the tongue 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.950

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.500
