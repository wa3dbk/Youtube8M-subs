00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.270 
Donovan I believe that that said the
donut<00:01:03.120> position<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.809> American<00:01:04.500> psyllid

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
right mid 80 to rate our overall his

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.410 
right mid 80 to rate our overall his
pace<00:01:08.130> has<00:01:08.340> increased<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.030> year<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.299> think
