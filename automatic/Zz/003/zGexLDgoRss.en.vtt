00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
because it won't make a difference once

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.990 
because it won't make a difference once
it's<00:01:16.259> dry<00:01:16.560> let<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.580> dry<00:01:19.070> once<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.280> dry<00:01:20.640> it

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.320 
should look like that then what you want
to<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.780> take<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> baby<00:01:25.560> wipe<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.330> go

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
to do is just take a baby wipe and go

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.390 
to do is just take a baby wipe and go
over<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.610> embossed<00:01:29.610> image<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:31.619> rub<00:01:32.009> off

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
over the embossed image and just rub off

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.069 
over the embossed image and just rub off
that<00:01:33.500> paint<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> let<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that paint and you don't want to let the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.310 
that paint and you don't want to let the
tag<00:01:37.380> dry<00:01:37.920> completely<00:01:38.549> before<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.110> this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
tag dry completely before you do this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.819 
tag dry completely before you do this
because<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.280> harder<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:42.150> DM<00:01:42.829> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
because it will be harder to get DM the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.429 
because it will be harder to get DM the
paint<00:01:44.159> off<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> he'll<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:47.270> keep<00:01:48.439> rubbing

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
paint off so he'll just keep rubbing

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.120 
paint off so he'll just keep rubbing
