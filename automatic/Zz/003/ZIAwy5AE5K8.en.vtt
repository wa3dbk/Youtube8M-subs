a 18 connection as you can see right

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.419 
a 18 connection as you can see right
here<00:01:31.750> now<00:01:32.319> that's<00:01:32.740> really<00:01:33.009> nice<00:01:33.130> because

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
so you don't see it you kind of have a

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.830 
so you don't see it you kind of have a
little<00:02:12.940> tiny<00:02:13.209> wind<00:02:13.510> cover<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
little tiny wind cover here you have the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.820 
little tiny wind cover here you have the
law<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.110> itself<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.629> guessing<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.410> kind

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
law of itself and I'm guessing this kind

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.790 
law of itself and I'm guessing this kind
of<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.010> vlog<00:02:21.459> control<00:02:22.060> right<00:02:22.330> here<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:22.810> on

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
of the vlog control right here and on

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.869 
of the vlog control right here and on
and<00:02:24.280> off<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.599> let's<00:02:25.840> take<00:02:26.050> all<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.370> then

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
and off so let's take all that and then

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.320 
and off so let's take all that and then
you<00:02:28.000> get<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.349> u.s.<00:02:29.349> lifetime<00:02:30.220> warranty<00:02:31.090> on

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
you get a u.s. lifetime warranty on

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.970 
you get a u.s. lifetime warranty on
these<00:02:31.590> so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
these so

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.000 
these so
um<00:02:33.879> it's<00:02:34.569> gone<00:02:34.750> well<00:02:35.140> we<00:02:35.379> probably<00:02:35.560> don't<00:02:35.830> you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
um it's gone well we probably don't you

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.380 
um it's gone well we probably don't you
take<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.220> off<00:02:36.489> I'm<00:02:36.640> guessing<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.180> just

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
take that off I'm guessing you just

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.780 
take that off I'm guessing you just
unscrew<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.290> where<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.470> battery<00:02:38.860> goes

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.780 

yeah<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.150> battery<00:02:43.540> fits<00:02:43.780> in<00:02:43.989> here<00:02:44.310> okay<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.760> I

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
yeah the battery fits in here okay so I

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.559 
yeah the battery fits in here okay so I
believe<00:02:46.269> like<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:49.890> should<00:02:50.890> be<00:02:50.920> good<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
believe like this should be good I

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.330 
believe like this should be good I
wonder<00:02:52.569> if<00:02:52.629> there's<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.840> light<00:02:53.140> for<00:02:53.410> this<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:54.220> if

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
wonder if there's a light for this so if

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.369 
wonder if there's a light for this so if
you've<00:02:54.459> got<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:54.849> or<00:02:55.060> off<00:02:55.209> there<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.629> not<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.230> way

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
you've got on or off there is not a way
