00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.950 
thought that if we protected the land if
we<00:00:54.800> played<00:00:55.070> our<00:00:55.220> part<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.790> did<00:00:55.850> our<00:00:55.910> duty<00:00:56.210> the

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
land would protect us so either that was

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.840 
land would protect us so either that was
all<00:00:59.450> bullshit<00:00:59.960> or<00:01:00.380> we<00:01:01.010> haven't<00:01:01.220> held<00:01:01.490> up<00:01:01.610> our

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
all bullshit or we haven't held up our

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.710 
all bullshit or we haven't held up our
side<00:01:02.090> of<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.300> bargain
