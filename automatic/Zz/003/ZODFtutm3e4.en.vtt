hey<00:00:01.290> guys<00:00:01.500> RC<00:00:01.979> plane<00:00:02.159> guy<00:00:02.310> one<00:00:02.460> here<00:00:02.700> and<00:00:02.850> today

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
hey guys RC plane guy one here and today

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.150 
hey guys RC plane guy one here and today
I'm<00:00:03.990> just<00:00:04.110> going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.319> be<00:00:04.470> talking<00:00:04.680> about<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
I'm just going to be talking about the

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.419 
I'm just going to be talking about the
Beechcraft<00:00:06.150> Staggerwing<00:00:06.299> 480<00:00:07.290> it's<00:00:07.649> an<00:00:07.919> AR<00:00:08.220> F

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
Beechcraft Staggerwing 480 it's an AR F

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.209 
Beechcraft Staggerwing 480 it's an AR F
by<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> flight<00:00:09.630> display<00:00:10.559> will<00:00:10.740> be<00:00:10.800> coming<00:00:11.070> out

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
by a flight display will be coming out

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.110 
by a flight display will be coming out
around<00:00:11.730> late-september<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.990> 2011<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.759> look

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
around late-september in 2011 so look

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.750 
around late-september in 2011 so look
for<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.410> couple<00:00:16.590> details<00:00:16.859> start<00:00:17.609> off

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
for that just a couple details start off

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.150 
for that just a couple details start off
with<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.480> actually<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> Z<00:00:19.949> foam

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
with this is actually a Z foam

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.210 
with this is actually a Z foam
construction<00:00:20.609> plane<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:22.020> think<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:22.710> one<00:00:23.130> of

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
construction plane I think it's one of

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.189 
construction plane I think it's one of
flights<00:00:23.580> first<00:00:23.850> sea<00:00:24.210> foam<00:00:24.449> planes<00:00:24.810> like

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
flights first sea foam planes like

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.070 
flights first sea foam planes like
entirely<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.880> also<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.449> almost<00:00:27.869> ready

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
entirely but it is also an almost ready

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.290 
entirely but it is also an almost ready
to<00:00:28.199> fly<00:00:28.230> there<00:00:29.189> aren't<00:00:29.429> too<00:00:29.550> many<00:00:29.580> almost

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to fly there aren't too many almost

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.790 
to fly there aren't too many almost
ready<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.570> flies<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.929> RZ<00:00:31.230> foam<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.590> there

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
ready to flies that RZ foam out there

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.959 
ready to flies that RZ foam out there
right<00:00:31.949> now<00:00:32.059> but<00:00:33.059> getting<00:00:34.050> into<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:35.430> also<00:00:35.550> it

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
right now but getting into it it also it

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.030 
right now but getting into it it also it
is<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.690> Beechcraft<00:00:37.590> Staggerwing<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:39.300> takes<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
is a Beechcraft Staggerwing it takes the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.510 
is a Beechcraft Staggerwing it takes the
park<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.370> 80<00:00:41.550> size<00:00:42.149> motor<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> think<00:00:43.379> it's

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
park for 80 size motor the I think it's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.380 
park for 80 size motor the I think it's
1020<00:00:44.520> yeah<00:00:44.850> 10<00:00:45.090> 20<00:00:45.360> kv<00:00:45.750> brushless<00:00:46.410> outrunner

this<00:01:18.540> plane<00:01:19.040> they're<00:01:20.040> pretty<00:01:20.189> small<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.560> I'm

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this plane they're pretty small and I'm

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.710 
this plane they're pretty small and I'm
not<00:01:22.770> too<00:01:22.950> sure<00:01:23.130> how<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.460> cost<00:01:23.790> but

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
not too sure how much they cost but

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.780 
not too sure how much they cost but
those<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.890> plane<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.250> look<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.670> good

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
those this plane would look really good

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.609 
those this plane would look really good
with<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> pneumatic<00:01:27.990> retracts<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:29.210> it<00:01:30.210> also

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
with the pneumatic retracts on it also

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
with the pneumatic retracts on it also
has<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.210> an<00:01:33.329> error<00:01:33.509> off<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
has you will it's an error off so you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.580 
has you will it's an error off so you
need<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.549> supply<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.790> your<00:01:35.939> servos<00:01:36.590> it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
bottom aileron is down for the flaps so

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.140 
bottom aileron is down for the flaps so
it's<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.410> both<00:02:19.710> wings<00:02:20.070> like<00:02:20.310> flap<00:02:20.640> arounds<00:02:21.060> is

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
it's not both wings like flap arounds is

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.330 
it's not both wings like flap arounds is
just<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> bottom<00:02:21.870> set<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.560> Link's<00:02:22.950> which<00:02:23.070> is

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
just the bottom set of Link's which is

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.530 
just the bottom set of Link's which is
nice<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:24.510> plane<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:25.020> also<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.820> cowling<00:02:27.330> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
nice this plane is also the cowling and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.840 
nice this plane is also the cowling and
the<00:02:28.500> cowling<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.980> loaded<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.400> scale<00:02:29.820> details

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
the cowling is loaded with scale details

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.390 
the cowling is loaded with scale details
that's<00:02:32.850> pretty<00:02:33.360> much<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.660> for<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.620> detail

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
that's pretty much it for the detail

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.020 
that's pretty much it for the detail
side<00:02:36.380> like<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.500> said<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:37.980> seafoam<00:02:38.490> in<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
side like I said it is seafoam in the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
side like I said it is seafoam in the
Navy<00:02:39.630> construction<00:02:41.060> from<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.300> 30s<00:02:42.810> this

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
Navy construction from the 30s this

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.660 
Navy construction from the 30s this
plane<00:02:43.350> was<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.980> VA<00:02:44.280> VIP<00:02:45.080> transport<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:47.010> was<00:02:47.280> this

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
plane was a VA VIP transport it was this

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.650 
plane was a VA VIP transport it was this
looks<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.090> great<00:02:48.300> plane<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.880> comes<00:02:51.390> in

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
looks like a great plane it comes in

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.440 
looks like a great plane it comes in
pretty<00:02:52.200> much<00:02:52.350> just<00:02:52.920> an<00:02:53.130> AR<00:02:53.370> F<00:02:53.520> now<00:02:53.730> I'm<00:02:54.060> hoping

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
pretty much just an AR F now I'm hoping

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.570 
pretty much just an AR F now I'm hoping
to<00:02:54.780> see<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:54.990> bind<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.560> fly<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.860> plane<00:02:56.070> which

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
to see a bind and fly this plane which

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.600 
to see a bind and fly this plane which
would<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:57.060> great<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:58.530> mostly<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.190> scale

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
would be a great it's mostly a scale

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.450 
would be a great it's mostly a scale
flyer<00:03:00.050> if<00:03:01.050> I'm<00:03:01.380> guessing<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.830> will<00:03:01.890> fly<00:03:02.130> kind

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
flyer if I'm guessing it will fly kind

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.420
