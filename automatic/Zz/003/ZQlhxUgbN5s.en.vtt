00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hi there is a small review of the knife drongo 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.950
 Dropchik are the fruit market sandy 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 Maikop and we now have this view 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.400
 among external shoals which are 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.880
 immediately were here here here were ahl they 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.300
 all at once this aluminum feeling had 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:32.329
 turn it here here we have such here 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:35.940
 lining clearance due to this 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.809
 toothpick and strives improper 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.770
 time to fly out 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:47.190
 somewhere and not going to start the show 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.230
 we have here we have a bottle opener 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.719
 Zatravochka was at first not much 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640
 sharpened but after re-bed 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.350
 It became a good one 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:05.509
 screwdriver 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.060
 in the other hand we have a bottle 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.240
 bottle opener on 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.070
 fixed in two positions of the same 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.220
 see a hump on it such as in 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.470
 the original allows and pretty good 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.039
 to block 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.490
 if so here and a preload is generally very 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:28.479
 difficult shabana has developed here is isolation in 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:36.830
 principle takes off pretty well 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:38.810
 I'll show you what we got here 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.170
 Isolation made harder on you 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:49.039
 my like 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:54.799
 for example the same network wire here too 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:58.060
 we took off even from the efforts even further 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.060
 we have pliers 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.610
 such from pliers pliers 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.340
 not bad enough 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:15.520
 with such a good rivet the fate of them 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.520
 parties here 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.840
 here it is definitely good bumps if latex 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.660
 together with the same 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.770
 soldier copies of prenatal swiss 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:40.830
 secret before drying external 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:49.209
 she can also be seen sho no thicker 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:50.319
 here you can see a lot but the spirit of these is 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:58.450
 nippers 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:03:01.870
 big they bite the site very well 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.790
 principle, even paper cuts with this 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.920
 sides here we have such a keyway for 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.840
 Springs that is, the spring was not found 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.970
 but given that not flew to at all 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.430
 yes nowhere else shakes unlike 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.799
 in the third where the rivet we do not have such 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:27.970
 here's the grooves swinging all get very 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.390
 such even worthy goes further with us 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.470
 scissors scissors just don't live for 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.459
 the fact that the photos 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:41.310
 and what's inside this thing is not to 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:45.340
 mine will also have to take out a couple of nail files 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.579
 here and then take them out so here 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.579
 somehow 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:04:07.660
 good scissors take socks too 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:15.359
 better not bad some paper cut very 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:18.160
 smooth cool gashes not replace such 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.489
 newcomers just as well springed here 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.900
 here with such holidays 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.470
 spring nowhere do you do next 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.680
 there is a saw on metal 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:38.260
 saw on wood if you pay attention 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.530
 Sasha curves you are not very scary but here 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:45.810
 there is such a thing 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:49.360
 tags finally have us from copy 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.840
 swiss normal sharpened saw on 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.500
 really ok for. almost like 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.500
 on the original 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.319
 here 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:09.560
 normal before any problems but here 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.560
 we are a file 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:19.439
 Here is a file that will give you good points, although 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:23.749
 quality you can see it is not much here 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:26.399
 I'm here to saw for metal is the same again at 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:35.029
 there is almost none of us 

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:35.029
 the origins of the file such a man 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.410
 such here 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:48.389
 you glue nonsense and descents on rhodes point 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:52.270
 quite good chateau buha 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:55.589
 In principle, there is a boo, but it cuts 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:03.179
 not bad, he keeps sharpening more or less 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:03.179
 for the Chinese and the little wedge 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.740
 In principle, everyone also wants 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.159
 sharpen you had to give birth to a friend and not 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:16.499
 not much cut 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:20.229
 the final ones carried the nuance that's when 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:23.679
 my warehouse can not tepa 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.740
 and the knife in the big pot comes on the heel 

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:28.449
 small blade 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.779
 its here here's the slope channel reached 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:35.740
 press because then here here 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:38.459
 there are such nehily replacements we 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.459
 show 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.009
 until 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:56.610
 here it here it immediately replaces so with 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:07:00.610
 the other side of us corkscrew corkscrew corkscrew 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.590
 extinguished with a hole sharpened in principle 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.669
 still a good estimate and here too 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:12.159
 cum were less sharp further hook on 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:15.810
 functional keep there with us 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.810
 a screwdriver goes like this 

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:26.369
 you want to focus 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:38.640
 intensified there we go chisel 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:42.120
 understanding nipples sex stitched 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.120
 chisel sharp 

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.240
 what proxxon 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.110
 here also we have pintsetik to school 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.639
 forceps ace one side 

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:11.169
 crooked so it touches only one 

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:13.380
 parts of it all I wanted to show everyone 

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:13.380
 until
