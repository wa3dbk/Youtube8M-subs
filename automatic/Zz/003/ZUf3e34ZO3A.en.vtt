multiverse out there and potentially
even<00:00:25.710> more<00:00:26.070> multiverses<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.880> down<00:00:27.060> cold<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that didn't fit into continuity so again

that didn't fit into continuity so again
I<00:00:48.390> was<00:00:48.570> Dan's<00:00:48.750> idea<00:00:48.930> said<00:00:49.320> well<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.620> your

chance to tell those stories and we'll
make<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:52.140> multiverse<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.100> make<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
make it one multiverse to we make it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.619 
make it one multiverse to we make it
part<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.090> we'll<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.449> whole

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
part of this and we'll make this whole

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.689 
part of this and we'll make this whole
thing<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.170> concept<00:00:55.680> beggar<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.579> was

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
thing is concept beggar so it was

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.430 
thing is concept beggar so it was
absorbed<00:00:57.210> absorber<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.020> kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> done

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
absorbed absorber I was kind of done

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.959 
absorbed absorber I was kind of done
could<00:00:58.770> help<00:00:58.949> me<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.670> realized

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
could help me into this and I realized

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.660 
could help me into this and I realized
he<00:01:00.090> was<00:01:00.210> right<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.690> who<00:01:01.500> came<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.949> using<00:01:02.309> t

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
he was right so who came up with using t

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.410 
he was right so who came up with using t
00<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> stands<00:01:04.409> good<00:01:04.680> idea<00:01:05.420> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
00 I think that stands good idea so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.760 
00 I think that stands good idea so

a<00:01:28.229> long<00:01:28.380> time<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.670> we'll<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.939> doing

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
a long time and then we'll be doing

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.060 
a long time and then we'll be doing
whichever<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.049> next<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.740> look<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
whichever the next one is so look the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.160 
whichever the next one is so look the
comet<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:33.270> short<00:01:33.509> books<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> i<00:01:33.960> think

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
comet is as one short books and i think

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350 
comet is as one short books and i think
a<00:01:34.409> bunch<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.189> other<00:01:35.340> writers<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.060> going

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
a bunch of other writers are also going

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
a bunch of other writers are also going
to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.540> doing<00:01:36.689> their<00:01:36.990> own<00:01:37.049> things<00:01:37.770> because

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to be doing their own things because

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.310 
to be doing their own things because
again<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> opens<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.210> much<00:01:39.450> anybody<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.079> do

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
again it opens up so much anybody can do

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.690 
again it opens up so much anybody can do
anything<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.829> long<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> story<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
anything as long as the story that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.109 
anything as long as the story that
doesn't<00:01:42.180> fit<00:01:42.479> into<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.840> current<00:01:43.200> continuity

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
doesn't fit into the current continuity

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.510 
doesn't fit into the current continuity
now<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> flash<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.259> guess<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:47.280> all

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
now with the flash I guess that's all

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.620 
now with the flash I guess that's all
information<00:01:48.000> we're<00:01:48.119> getting<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.540> don't

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
information we're getting like we don't

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.240 
information we're getting like we don't
know<00:01:48.750> anything<00:01:48.930> else<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.439> any<00:01:49.590> specifics<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
know anything else like any specifics of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
know anything else like any specifics of
it's<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.790> gonna<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:51.030> somewhat<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it's just it's gonna be somewhat the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.850 
it's just it's gonna be somewhat the
flash<00:01:51.479> no<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> mean<00:01:52.110> I've<00:01:52.380> talked<00:01:52.619> about<00:01:52.799> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
flash no I mean I've talked about the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.289 
flash no I mean I've talked about the
story<00:01:53.130> before<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.579> everyone<00:01:53.909> actually<00:01:54.060> knows

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
story before so everyone actually knows

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.850 
story before so everyone actually knows
what<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.869> can't<00:01:55.140> talk<00:01:55.320> about<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.740> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
what is I can't talk about because I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.080 
what is I can't talk about because I
thought<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.369> years<00:01:56.549> I've<00:01:56.790> been<00:01:56.820> saying<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
thought for years I've been saying I

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.609

want<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.630> story<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> flash<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
want to do the story of the flash and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
want to do the story of the flash and
the<00:01:59.159> idea<00:01:59.460> was<00:01:59.490> quite<00:01:59.759> simple<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.240> was<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.479> to

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the idea was quite simple it was just to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.569 
the idea was quite simple it was just to
do<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> flash<00:02:01.439> stir<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.770> wasn't<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> superhero

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.969 
do a flash stir it wasn't a superhero
story<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.600> involves<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> idea<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.950> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
story but involves the idea of a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.319 
story but involves the idea of a
scientist<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.579> getting<00:02:05.790> faster<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.240> faster
