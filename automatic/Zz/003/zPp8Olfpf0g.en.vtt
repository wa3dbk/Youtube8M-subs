00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.930 
of doing it all one way you can flip
doing<00:01:30.750> some<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.380> some<00:01:31.950> until<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.490> looks

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
doing some out and some until it looks

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.670 
doing some out and some until it looks
a<00:01:32.970> bit<00:01:33.090> more<00:01:33.240> natural<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.840> all<00:01:34.170> your<00:01:34.500> hair

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
a bit more natural because all your hair

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.070 
a bit more natural because all your hair
naturally<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.400> go<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.730> way<00:01:35.940> but<00:01:36.690> for<00:01:36.900> me

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
naturally going to go one way but for me

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.050 
naturally going to go one way but for me
my<00:01:37.320> favorite<00:01:37.560> way<00:01:37.830> to<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.160> it<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
my favorite way to do it is to take the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
my favorite way to do it is to take the
straightener<00:01:39.480> out<00:01:39.660> away<00:01:40.200> from<00:01:40.230> your<00:01:40.620> face<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
straightener out away from your face and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
straightener out away from your face and
this<00:01:41.280> creates<00:01:41.730> those<00:01:41.880> ways<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.450> give<00:01:42.660> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
this creates those ways that give you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.720 
this creates those ways that give you
that<00:01:42.990> full<00:01:43.290> volume<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.070> body<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.610> you've

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
that full volume and body that you've

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.160 
that full volume and body that you've
kind<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:44.970> seen<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.420> victoria<00:01:45.840> Secret

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
kind of seen like the victoria Secret

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.110 
kind of seen like the victoria Secret
models<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.010> girls<00:01:47.550> that<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.910> those

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
models and the girls that have those

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.590 
models and the girls that have those
really<00:01:48.870> perfect<00:01:49.470> waves<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.550> what<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.540> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
really perfect waves so what you want to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.780 
really perfect waves so what you want to
do<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.990> after<00:01:52.200> you've<00:01:52.560> done<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.400> piece

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
do is after you've done this one piece

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.180 
do is after you've done this one piece
you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.390> go<00:01:54.570> around<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:55.080> head<00:01:55.350> but

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
you can just go around your head but

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.100 
you can just go around your head but
just<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.730> teach<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.150> few<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.570> times<00:01:57.840> how

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
just to teach you a few more times how

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.620 
just to teach you a few more times how
to<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.410> it<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.610> want<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.090> take<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to do it is that you want to take this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.950 
to do it is that you want to take this
bring<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.440> out<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:02.220> then<00:02:02.700> twist<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.300> once<00:02:03.360> and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
bring it out and then twist it once and

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630 
bring it out and then twist it once and
then<00:02:04.020> twist<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.620> again<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.370> you're<00:02:05.520> pretty

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
then twist it again so you're pretty

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160 
then twist it again so you're pretty
much<00:02:05.760> just<00:02:06.090> literally<00:02:06.540> sitting<00:02:06.900> your

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
much just literally sitting your

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.200 
much just literally sitting your
straightener<00:02:07.860> until<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.490> hit<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.850> bottom<00:02:08.970> of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
straightener until you hit the bottom of

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.030 
straightener until you hit the bottom of
your<00:02:09.270> hair<00:02:09.510> I'm<00:02:10.020> putting<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> long<00:02:10.619> hair<00:02:10.890> but

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
your hair I'm putting a long hair but

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.160 
your hair I'm putting a long hair but
this<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.430> work<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.420> shorter<00:02:12.840> here<00:02:13.020> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this can work if you shorter here you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.410 
this can work if you shorter here you
just<00:02:13.380> start<00:02:13.620> further<00:02:14.340> at<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> top<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.060> like<00:02:15.270> to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
just start further at the top I like to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.210 
just start further at the top I like to
start<00:02:15.690> further<00:02:16.320> down<00:02:16.560> because<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:17.190> that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
start further down because then that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.700 
start further down because then that
creates<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.180> straight<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.990> goes<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
creates that straight and goes into the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.680 
creates that straight and goes into the
waves<00:02:19.860> which<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> little<00:02:20.460> bit<00:02:20.700> more<00:02:21.480> natural

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
waves which is a little bit more natural

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.620 
waves which is a little bit more natural
especially<00:02:22.230> from<00:02:22.740> my<00:02:22.770> hair<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.850> again<00:02:24.300> you

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
especially from my hair so again you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.150 
especially from my hair so again you
want<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.930> take<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.110> from<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> top<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.920> want<00:02:26.100> to

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
want to take it from the top you want to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.930 
want to take it from the top you want to
pull<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.490> down<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.450> new<00:02:27.600> twist<00:02:27.990> once<00:02:28.320> and

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
pull it down and the new twist once and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.420 
pull it down and the new twist once and
then<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.060> twist<00:02:30.300> twice<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.830> again<00:02:32.070> you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
then you twist twice and then again you

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.730 
then you twist twice and then again you
get<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:32.760> wave<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.810> will<00:02:34.020> do<00:02:34.290> this<00:02:34.500> all

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
get this wave so you will do this all

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.640 
get this wave so you will do this all
around<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:35.190> head<00:02:35.370> as<00:02:36.090> much<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.600> want<00:02:36.840> so

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
around your head as much as you want so

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.850 
around your head as much as you want so
for<00:02:37.830> example<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.520> one<00:02:38.790> just<00:02:39.090> went<00:02:39.300> out<00:02:39.860> so

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
for example that one just went out so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.130 
for example that one just went out so
now<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.070> take<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.489> next<00:02:41.700> one<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.330> instead<00:02:43.080> of

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
now you take the next one and instead of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.650 
now you take the next one and instead of
bring<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.530> out<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.190> take<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.000> then

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
bring it out you can take it and then

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.510 
bring it out you can take it and then
you<00:02:45.780> curl<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.980> bring<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> straighter

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
you curl it in you bring the straighter

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.820 
you curl it in you bring the straighter
in<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.060> you<00:02:48.180> flip<00:02:48.540> once<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.170> then<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.620> flip

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
in and you flip once and then you flip

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.979 
in and you flip once and then you flip
again<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.459> bring<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.880> out<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.840> also

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
again and bring it out and it also

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.860 
again and bring it out and it also
creates<00:02:52.500> wave<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.730> let<00:02:54.360> me<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.750> this

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
creates wave so let me just do this

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.420 
creates wave so let me just do this
around<00:02:55.080> more<00:02:55.320> sections<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:55.890> my<00:02:56.010> head<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.310> I'll

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
around more sections in my head and I'll

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:42.670 
around more sections in my head and I'll
bring<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.700> right<00:02:56.730> back

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.080 

okay<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:43.740> once<00:03:44.070> you<00:03:44.190> got<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.550> face<00:03:44.790> framing

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
okay so once you got to the face framing

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.640 
okay so once you got to the face framing
pieces<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:45.720> really<00:03:46.020> want<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.290> make<00:03:46.380> sure<00:03:46.440> that

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
pieces you really want to make sure that

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.320 
pieces you really want to make sure that
you<00:03:46.890> bring<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:47.310> one<00:03:47.550> out<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:48.150> is

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
you bring this one out and this is

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.550 
you bring this one out and this is
really<00:03:48.510> going<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> give<00:03:49.020> you<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.320> volume

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
really going to give you that volume
