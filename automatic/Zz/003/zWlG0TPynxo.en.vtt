00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
too much salt is a bad thing but a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
too much salt is a bad thing but a
little<00:01:46.770> bit<00:01:46.950> does<00:01:47.640> help<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:50.060> two<00:01:51.060> big<00:01:51.240> pinches

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
little bit does help so two big pinches

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.480 
little bit does help so two big pinches
about<00:01:51.960> quarter<00:01:52.440> of<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.590> teaspoon<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.250> what

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
about quarter of a teaspoon is what

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
about quarter of a teaspoon is what
you're<00:01:53.610> looking<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:55.580> tiny<00:01:56.580> bit<00:01:56.790> more<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.649> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you're looking for tiny bit more and the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.340 
you're looking for tiny bit more and the
juice<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.369> half<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.940> lime<00:02:00.180> gives<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.960> some<00:02:01.110> zing

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
juice of half a lime gives it some zing

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.120 
juice of half a lime gives it some zing
and<00:02:05.600> if<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.780> lime<00:02:07.050> isn't<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.680> juicy

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
and if your lime isn't that juicy

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.320 
and if your lime isn't that juicy
because<00:02:08.369> sometimes<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.850> just<00:02:08.940> depends<00:02:09.269> on

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
because sometimes it just depends on

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.040 
because sometimes it just depends on
what<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.539> get

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050

what you get
I<00:02:10.370> feel<00:02:11.370> free<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.970> use<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> other<00:02:12.570> half

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I feel free to use the other half

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.390 
I feel free to use the other half
actually<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:13.650> I'm<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.070> do<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:16.400> see

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
actually I think I'm going to do and see

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.250 
actually I think I'm going to do and see
this<00:02:17.550> technique<00:02:17.970> I'm<00:02:18.239> squeezing<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.110> lime

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
this technique I'm squeezing the lime

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.290 
this technique I'm squeezing the lime
through<00:02:19.650> my<00:02:19.769> fingers<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:21.390> catch<00:02:21.570> any<00:02:21.810> pips<00:02:22.050> and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
through my fingers to catch any pips and
