adjustable<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> reason<00:03:24.390> why<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.630> gun

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
adjustable and the reason why this gun

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.199 
adjustable and the reason why this gun
is<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.080> inexpensive<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.980> because<00:03:26.310> there's<00:03:26.549> a

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
is so inexpensive is because there's a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.460 
is so inexpensive is because there's a
few<00:03:27.810> men<00:03:28.049> parts<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:29.760> frame<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.570> cast<00:03:30.900> but

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
few men parts and the frame is cast but

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.860 
few men parts and the frame is cast but
you<00:03:31.560> know<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:31.830> today's<00:03:32.220> technology<00:03:32.940> that

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
you know with today's technology that

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.770 
you know with today's technology that
really<00:03:34.049> doesn't<00:03:34.230> scare<00:03:34.500> me<00:03:34.560> whatsoever<00:03:34.980> I

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
really doesn't scare me whatsoever I

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890

I<00:04:02.120> might<00:04:03.120> eventually<00:04:03.239> change<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.170> a

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
I might eventually change that to a

I might eventually change that to a
metal<00:04:04.500> one<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.680> don't<00:04:04.950> know<00:04:05.010> we'll<00:04:05.190> see<00:04:05.540> again

metal one I don't know we'll see again

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.250 
metal one I don't know we'll see again
I'm<00:04:06.690> not<00:04:06.810> really<00:04:06.870> worried<00:04:07.260> about<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:09.260> flared

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
I'm not really worried about that flared

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.710 

and<00:04:20.610> when<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:20.790> feel<00:04:21.120> stripped<00:04:21.420> it<00:04:21.510> for<00:04:21.660> the

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
and when I feel stripped it for the

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.740 
and when I feel stripped it for the
first<00:04:21.930> time<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:23.520> push<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.850> pin<00:04:24.090> through<00:04:24.420> to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
first time to push that pin through to

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.410 
first time to push that pin through to
get<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.860> slide<00:04:26.220> off<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.700> literally<00:04:27.000> had<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.300> use

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
get the slide off I literally had to use

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.270 
get the slide off I literally had to use
a<00:04:27.450> plastic<00:04:27.930> punch<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.590> mail<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.920> because<00:04:29.160> it

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
a plastic punch and a mail it because it

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.910 
a plastic punch and a mail it because it
just<00:04:29.690> fit<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.870> they're<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.290> tight<00:04:31.560> hopefully

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
just fit and they're so tight hopefully

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.470 
just fit and they're so tight hopefully
that'll<00:04:32.100> work<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:32.490> just<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.820> little<00:04:32.850> bit<00:04:33.090> I

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
that'll work in just a little bit I

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.270 
that'll work in just a little bit I
don't<00:04:34.260> really<00:04:34.410> want<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.620> be<00:04:34.740> banging<00:04:34.920> on<00:04:35.160> my

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
don't really want to be banging on my

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.790 
don't really want to be banging on my
gun<00:04:35.490> but<00:04:35.760> it<00:04:35.820> was<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.000> only<00:04:36.150> way<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.680> could<00:04:37.680> get

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
gun but it was the only way I could get

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.340 
gun but it was the only way I could get
that<00:04:37.950> out<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.250> first<00:04:38.310> time<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.870> fit<00:04:40.110> is

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
that out the first time so the fit is

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.980 
that out the first time so the fit is
very<00:04:40.650> very<00:04:40.980> good<00:04:43.580> there's<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.690> another<00:04:45.690> shot<00:04:45.960> of

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
very very good there's a another shot of

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.390 
very very good there's a another shot of
the<00:04:46.170> grips<00:04:48.560> all<00:04:49.560> in<00:04:49.740> all<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.890> have<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.220> say<00:04:50.370> I

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
the grips all in all I have to say I

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.210 
the grips all in all I have to say I
really<00:04:50.670> like<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:52.140> American<00:04:52.440> classic<00:04:52.830> 2<00:04:52.980> by
