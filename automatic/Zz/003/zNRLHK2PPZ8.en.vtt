stage now or if it's some days you do

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.890 
stage now or if it's some days you do
from<00:01:39.600> days<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.990> don't

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.560 

okay<00:01:45.230> with<00:01:45.980> our<00:01:46.130> tip<00:01:46.460> can<00:01:46.760> see<00:01:47.030> that<00:01:47.210> clearly

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
okay with our tip can see that clearly

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.960 
okay with our tip can see that clearly
em<00:01:48.010> so<00:01:49.010> I'm<00:01:49.190> only<00:01:50.980> going<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.100> bring<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.430> down<00:01:52.460> at

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
em so I'm only going to bring it down at

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.540 
em so I'm only going to bring it down at
an<00:01:53.090> angle<00:01:53.240> till<00:01:54.110> we<00:01:54.200> hear<00:01:54.500> or<00:01:54.770> feel<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.130> click

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
an angle till we hear or feel a click

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.060 
an angle till we hear or feel a click
and<00:01:55.970> then<00:01:56.630> lift<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.380> up<00:01:57.790> into<00:01:58.790> place<00:01:59.860> I'm<00:02:00.860> going

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
and then lift it up into place I'm going

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.360 
and then lift it up into place I'm going
to<00:02:01.130> get<00:02:01.280> all<00:02:01.400> fully<00:02:01.760> a<00:02:01.790> bubble<00:02:05.980> do<00:02:06.980> we<00:02:07.070> need<00:02:07.250> to

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
to get all fully a bubble do we need to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.540 
to get all fully a bubble do we need to
rush<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.910> stage<00:02:08.590> no<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.619> think<00:02:09.830> that's<00:02:10.070> more

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
rush that stage no I think that's more

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.580 
rush that stage no I think that's more
over<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:11.000> forever<00:02:13.930> how<00:02:14.930> long<00:02:15.110> does<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.350> take

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
over to forever how long does it take

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.250 
over to forever how long does it take
for<00:02:15.800> your<00:02:15.920> glue<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.370> set<00:02:18.340> secondly<00:02:19.340> yes<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:21.170> it

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
for your glue to set secondly yes but it

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.600 
for your glue to set secondly yes but it
won't<00:02:21.410> set<00:02:21.890> until<00:02:22.490> you<00:02:22.640> apply<00:02:23.620> pressure
