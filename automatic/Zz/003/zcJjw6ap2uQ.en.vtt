00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 U 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.660
 When you walk through the forests in this fragrant wood scent, 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.369
 Looks like he's gone and his head clears. 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.750
 The limits of the forests and trees that you can take while taking a bath are hidden in a tremendous secret. 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.180
 They say 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:35.100
 I guarantee someone in the forest today Tonight I have this unique scent right on Phytoncide 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.539
 Let's learn more about 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.449
 There are many animals in the mugwort as well as plants. 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:46.980
 So much animal waste 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:51.899
 There is a lot of fragrance in the fresh forest than the smell of excreta . 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.519
 I say that because the material this very reason Phytoncide 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.260
 Phytoncide is a plant that produces or secretes to resist pathogens or insects 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.280
 I mean the substance. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.619
 So why do plants rain Phytoncide minutes 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.729
 Phytoncide was first born in 1943 to Russian-born American bacteriologist Wax Money 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.470
 I announced it. 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.080
 Russian side as a means of murder and Thai style of the means of plants 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.640
 It's a word from the front. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.440
 Because plants can not move on their own, pathogens and pests 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.000
 To protect it , we disintegrate phytoncide, a germicidal directional substance 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.649
 I will 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.030
 These keypoints are antibacterial antioxidants and screening agents 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.509
 Work, etc. 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.740
 This cypress Sheds Sheds Sheds so broken bite 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:45.060
 Cedar trees, and so on. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.860
 The more leftover, the greater the amount of pattern axes the tree emits . 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.930
 I can say that there are many 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.100
 And the temperature is not high, the wind is supposed to be released in the morning of the tree 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.450
 Having seen the number of its name beonchul amount borane rod summer to emerging 3-tap 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.229
 There is 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.520
 Recently phytoncide studies have been actively conducted 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:09.390
 This became known efficacy of this Phytoncide more people to the bathing 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.040
 The number of people looking for forests for the treatment of diseases is also increasing. 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:18.630
 However , when we try to do this 36, the hormone called " 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.579
 I'd like that secretion is activated so yisera Tony what our bodies 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.959
 Would it affect 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:29.160
 Toning is not in accordance with two vans Dolphin adrenaline go as I mentioned earlier quarter 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.390
 The role of calming the state ie 2 is excitement or tension 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.120
 It presented these things in the state there was a big help to find the composure themselves 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.500
 Cows on stress, anxiety 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.870
 And I play this role for things like wool . 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.519
 I can see that it is a great help in learning. 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:53.140
 While a child is born and passed through infancy and passes through adolescence, 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:57.280
 You know that resilience is so fast . 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.500
 However, if the adults are differences in immunity appears blossomed 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:07.569
 36 transplants have phytoncide emitted from the plants in the forest with a direct therapeutic effect 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.920
 But the diverse environment the forest has is as amazing as the phytoncide 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:15.310
 There is 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:20.290
 Intangible benefits to forests, such as serenity and comfort in the forest Escape from everyday life 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.250
 And the blue birds in the forest bear the hearts of those coming into the forest 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.920
 And 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:29.530
 Bright forests in the valleys I am clear water in the valleys and these trails are man's 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.659
 He says he's got the edge. 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:39.730
 Autumn is the season of burning the midnight oil so even if you eat a particularly valuable boyangshik 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:43.530
 If you walk 36 in the forest and read a book, it's my precious 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.530
 Is not it the wisdom to keep health?
