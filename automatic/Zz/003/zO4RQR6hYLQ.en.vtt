00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
do not find the layaway
I<00:00:37.600> think<00:00:38.289> it's<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.469> pain<00:00:38.679> nice

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.070 

the<00:00:42.059> stable<00:00:42.449> hands<00:00:42.690> reach

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.869 

the<00:00:45.380> ones<00:00:45.590> we<00:00:46.010> tried

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.510 

for<00:00:50.000> now

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
for now

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.869 
for now
I<00:00:51.580> think<00:00:51.880> about<00:00:52.060> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 

more<00:00:57.030> than<00:00:57.149> $20<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.109> you're<00:00:58.230> paying<00:00:58.410> for

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
more than $20 but you're paying for

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.040 
more than $20 but you're paying for
three<00:00:59.010> trucks<00:00:59.399> that

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.420 

so<00:01:03.560> you<00:01:03.620> know<00:01:03.770> it's<00:01:03.890> nice<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.220> always<00:01:04.340> have

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
so you know it's nice to always have

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.550 
so you know it's nice to always have
more

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:19.270 

nothing<00:01:09.220> much<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.549> say<00:01:09.909> about<00:01:10.090> this<00:01:10.240> truck

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.850 

so<00:01:19.460> basically<00:01:20.050> practice<00:01:21.050> that's<00:01:21.440> like<00:01:21.680> the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860
