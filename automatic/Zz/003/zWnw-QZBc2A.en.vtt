00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 Standing on the roof from night to night 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.800
 My face is wearing a mask, and the costume is really tight 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.500
 Looking for people in this troubled city 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.500
 But a completely different problem does not give me peace, because ... 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 When you fight, I'm all tense 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 I can smell the jokingly tingling of my spider scent 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.900
 But the ancient rule ruled out the possibility 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.800
 Heterosexual liability is attached to enormous power. 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.600
 We must stifle our desires. 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 Save your neighbor 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.800
 But without touching you, without touching 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.300
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.000
 This is an unspoken rule. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.700
 And it's kind of like sucking 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 But not a member, because it will be gay 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700
 Dealing with the gangsters, we are sort of luminaries of this city 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.000
 But what I'm really thirsty for is that in your tights 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 This is a fierce battle that I can not win 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.700
 I so want to have your peasant chin upside down! 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.000
 Run me to the moon and let me play among the stars 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.300
 Show me what love is with super power 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.500
 But you know, Mary Jane, you will not be with us, 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.300
 for superman and homosexual are not the same thing, and therefore ... 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.900
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200
 We must fight the villains 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.100
 Always alert 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.200
 Nope, watchful, this is not gay in Latin 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.100
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.300
 Catch smart assholes 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.200
 And send them to jail 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.100
 I can not stop thinking about the clever ass 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 I never thought you and me ... 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.300
 We have a secret behind three locks 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.700
 For the day I just muzhzyyyk ... 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.900
 But in the night I can fly 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 And I just realized that I'm in love with a man, he ... 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.300
 The same superhero as me 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.800
 And therefore we must do IT secretly 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.800
 So I go up to the room, and when I open the door, then ... 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 Ouuuuuuuuuuu 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.900
 Aw, man, you're so sexy and hot 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.300
 Kryptonite in your panties, Or are you so glad to see me? 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 Full of excitement and time that is necessary 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.800
 Let me light these candles with my laser vision. 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.000
 I could not even dream of a more perfect day 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 The hero in my shorts is higher and higher and higher in a hurry 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.200
 And I'm already ready for the boolean 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.500
 Comics always told me so 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.000
 Who did I want to be ?! 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300
 Well, why the hell didn't you lock the door behind you? 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.500
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.900
 The world inside me is crumbling 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.000
 And it's just ... 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.300
 ... fiiii 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.400
 This is not what you thought, he is my brother 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.700
 Shut up, you only make it worse 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.700
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.200
 Just like the bible 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200
 Comics are really harsh 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.500
 They are firm, but not in the right plan. 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.500
 Live in self-denial 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.000
 Dress up like bonnie m 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.300
 Really bastard from this group, dude 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.900
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.200
 We must stifle our desires. 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.200
 Save your neighbor 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.000
 but without touching you, without touching 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Superheroes can't be gay 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500
 This is an unspoken rule. 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 And it's kind of like sucking 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.800
 But not a member, because it will be gay 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.000
 Superheroes can't be gay
