00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 come on let's go to the destitute and to them 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.230
 I present that it was perfectly there is a lot 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.180
 pig production 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.290
 then as there is a lot of production of 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.670
 pigs we want to do something 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.710
 900 practical and fast round and round 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.900
 that they have to cook well because 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.820
 We are talking about pork but I'm not going 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.970
 to cook me what is tremendous not the 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.770
 I'm going to cut very thick because I want 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.420
 that are well cooked and I do not want 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:32.230
 be half an hour here, what I do is 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.230
 to cut some sheets of a feta I would say 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.629
 A) Yes 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.190
 now then we are going to cut like some 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.769
 wheels a few legs and we 're going to go 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 cooking to the plate where we are going to put 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.360
 almost fat because fat already 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.089
 what's inside the bondiola is going to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 come well as for just that 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.140
 go browning I will not have to add 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.989
 too much fat so little is 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.180
 with hot plate today 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.110
 Many people keep asking us what 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.110
 consists of the sheet 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.869
 the sheet is basically a sheet of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.440
 between 4 and 5 millimeters thick 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.270
 there also legal 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.820
 and what they usually do is obviously 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.530
 cure it warm it well and it works 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.200
 similar to a disc actually works 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.390
 it seems an iron is cooked to the great 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.480
 speed to model from one side let's 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.700
 to talk about the other 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.020
 with a special golden brown I think the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.050
 great feature that will give you the piece 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.100
 16 in my work we have a pretty 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:48.630
 big and we use it every day 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.960
 pretty all almost all the sheet almost 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.960
 everyone 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.200
 I'm going to run all this so that 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.720
 we started with 5 we distributed a little 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.650
 more and let's do the following myself 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.360
 I want to accompany you all this with one the 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.950
 speak no exact word If not 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.420
 a bittersweet perfect for me you saw the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.430
 little ones the bittersweet cucumbers that 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.780
 you often eat at homes in 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.250
 the hamburgers that I think what 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.780
 unique rich of the diaz hamburgers 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.300
 because to me basically hamburgers 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.980
 hence I do not like but many times 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.890
 cucumber blade that you're watching 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.470
 here of the sample if you look 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.350
 it has a process and it seems very difficult and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.600
 not like to make them at home they are super 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.920
 easy then what are we going to do what 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.470
 next so you do not stay 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.230
 too vinegary and have their touch 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.240
 of sweetness I think it's just like a 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.910
 perfect bittersweet preparation what 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.870
 let's make is japanese a cup and 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.909
 half 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.650
 of vinegar in this case white vinegar 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.599
 it can be an alcohol vinegar can 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.909
 be an apple cider vinegar in this case 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.549
 alcohol vinegar and complete both 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.099
 cups or half a cup plus one and a half 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.310
 of vinegar and half a cup more water 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:08.299
 you are boiling and with that same rate 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.819
 you thought that is based you're going to weigh or better 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.060
 you're going to measure sugar and you're going to 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.060
 put 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.510
 remember that trees came 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.010
 I'm going to see clearly a little bit 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.520
 so that it is founded learned so that 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.390
 funda and here we are going to put pictures 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.010
 of cucumber can do it with cucumber can 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.780
 do it with radish can do it with 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.210
 onion in this case I'm going to put 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.560
 mainly cucumber we change tables 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.980
 we clean knives because 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.750
 we had some meat here I'm not going to 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.370
 cut like that is going to cut us off we're 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.590
 cut more to the good with skin and everything 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.450
 approximately 2 millimeters 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.310
 are to make these kinds of preparations 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.760
 Matías or I'm not going to put them 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.760
 sandwiches 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.330
 with a hamás bag to the grid 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.330
 salsita more to the Greek 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.140
 exquisite then we have the cucumber 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.790
 we have a little purple onion and 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.560
 a little white onion there 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.560
 directly of the same thickness 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.440
 white onion point and more than two 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.440
 hours 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.940
 a little bit not much 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.590
 and then you're going to cut all this like this and 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.710
 we are going to put it inside 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.970
 of the ollita accordate was in this case 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.690
 because you can do many games of 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:46.400
 proportions a cup and a half of vinegar 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:50.350
 white plus average water plus one when 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.540
 broke boil of sugar you can do 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.120
 equal parts of vinegar and sugar 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.640
 you can do as I have done many times 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.800
 this 2 of vinegar and one of sugar in 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.510
 this case is this proportion because 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.180
 I want it to be a little softer 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.600
 you put it in here and you're going to give it a 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.990
 calm boil of 5 minutes to be paid 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.180
 fire and leave it there and forget it 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.249
 you enjoy when you want as it has 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.409
 a lot of vinegar goes to 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.939
 keep very well put it in the 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:23.539
 refrigerator but it will be preserved 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:24.859
 quietly a week two weeks if 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.739
 you want to pack not already you need 

00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:29.149
 put it sterilized and cover it with water 

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:31.390
 and boil at least 40 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:33.600
 minutes to see how this comes 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.380
 let's turn it around 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.900
 and I turn around and it's a little bit 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.370
 this is a matter of simply that 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.600
 is finished cooking on this side 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.420
 friendly a little bit of flavor but you 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:50.260
 We put the still touch of salt 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:54.700
 a little bit of garlic oil 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.280
 benitez needs what I do not like because 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.160
 the rest to give it a lot of flavor 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.770
 this type of meat nothing we put a 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.770
 we are cooking 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:11.770
 at the last moment of the young woman how 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.219
 I put garlic on top of many problems 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.930
 which left crude not why why 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:19.270
 now I'm going to brown on this side and last 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.979
 I 'm going to put it back on the other 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.569
 as for you to be a little garlic 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.759
 and do not stay so strong but you stay 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.120
 very tasty then imagine the 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:30.639
 combination of garlic all that are the 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.560
 cucumbers and sweet and sour onions a 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.840
 little pancetta got here this 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.110
 bacon I love the products of the 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.000
 bacon zone rolled in that 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.340
 hot a little bit that is toasted a 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.639
 little bit and then we go directly to 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.650
 put together our sandwich with some 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.060
 vegetables that we already have sautéed from 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.340
 beforehand how can you do it 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.110
 time for a little while we do not get to 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.389
 but we are going to put together the 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.729
 then with all that mix of vegetables 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:01.220
 sauteed that you see very well you have in the 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:03.500
 life you have the pig 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.840
 smoked sautéed vegetables is going to 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.480
 to be spectacular the sandwich the day 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.970
 today's bondiola a lot of production of 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.640
 pig in the area want to put some 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:18.320
 huevito also this was out of 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:20.900
 recipe the program there is a place 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.020
 I'm a little bit of a runner 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:26.550
 little direct well come 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.550
 even what to dear duckling 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.700
 one always that makes voice to the plate does not 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.500
 you add a lot of oil this same 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:39.270
 Fatty works well 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:43.040
 2 since we have in the hot plate not 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:46.550
 you would like to cost the bread a little 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.970
 but look, you finish doing the 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:52.400
 Bondiola of course also the eggs 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:55.110
 and the bread toast we put together the 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.060
 sandwiches after tiny ones 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.060
 he's just very little
