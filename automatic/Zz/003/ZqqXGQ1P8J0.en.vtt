00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
tutorial on how to create grass in Maya

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.580 
tutorial on how to create grass in Maya
all<00:00:13.769> right<00:00:13.950> let's<00:00:14.219> get<00:00:14.370> started<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:14.759> that

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
all right let's get started with that

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.630 
all right let's get started with that
okay<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.890> we're<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.310> start<00:00:17.550> off<00:00:17.609> with

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
okay so we're going to start off with

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.939 
okay so we're going to start off with
the<00:00:17.880> ground<00:00:18.119> plane<00:00:18.500> we're<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the ground plane we're just going to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.609 
the ground plane we're just going to
drag<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.430> out<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:20.939> grid<00:00:21.470> something<00:00:22.470> like

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
drag that out in the grid something like

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.670 
drag that out in the grid something like
that<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:24.019> we're<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.289> go<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> our

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
that and we're going to go to our

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.679 
that and we're going to go to our
attribute<00:00:26.250> editor<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.820> we're<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> make

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
attribute editor and we're going to make

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.790 
attribute editor and we're going to make
sure<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.590> enough<00:00:29.689> subdivisions<00:00:30.800> so

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
sure that we have enough subdivisions so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.799 
sure that we have enough subdivisions so
we're<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> our<00:00:32.850> subdivisions

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
we're going to go to our subdivisions

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.049 
we're going to go to our subdivisions
width<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.440> our<00:00:34.770> attribute<00:00:35.130> editor<00:00:35.250> select<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
width in our attribute editor select the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.750 
width in our attribute editor select the
poly<00:00:36.300> plane<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.870> tab<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:38.370> going<00:00:38.520> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
poly plane one tab and I'm going to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.600 
poly plane one tab and I'm going to
change<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.980> 50<00:00:41.629> by<00:00:43.129> 50<00:00:44.570> okay<00:00:45.800> now<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
change that to 50 by 50 okay now the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
change that to 50 by 50 okay now the
reason<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.420> when<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.020> create<00:00:49.320> grass

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
reason for that is when you create grass

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.150 
reason for that is when you create grass
the<00:00:50.190> more<00:00:50.399> subdivisions<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.160> easier

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the more subdivisions you got the easier

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.000 
the more subdivisions you got the easier
it<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> manipulate<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.899> settings<00:00:55.350> for

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it is to manipulate your settings for

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.670 
it is to manipulate your settings for
grass<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.390> importantly<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.530> can

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
grass but more importantly what you can

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.400 
grass but more importantly what you can
do<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.460> manipulate<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.149> surface<00:01:00.600> now

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
do is you can manipulate the surface now

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.070 
do is you can manipulate the surface now
what<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:01.920> mean<00:01:02.129> by<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.809> never<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
what do I mean by that you never see a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
what do I mean by that you never see a
grass<00:01:04.530> feel<00:01:05.280> looking<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.540> always

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
grass feel looking like that it's always

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.330 
grass feel looking like that it's always
a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:06.900> bit<00:01:07.049> bumpy<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.890> forth

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
a little bit bumpy and so forth

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.390 
a little bit bumpy and so forth
ok<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> start<00:01:09.450> off<00:01:09.600> by

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
ok so we're going to start off by

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.859 
ok so we're going to start off by
manipulating<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> bit<00:01:11.729> we're<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
manipulating that a bit we're going to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.340 
manipulating that a bit we're going to
go<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.260> deformation<00:01:13.950> tab<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.350> we're

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
go to a deformation tab here and we're

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.960 
go to a deformation tab here and we're
going<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> select<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:17.070> soft<00:01:17.580> modification

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
going to select our soft modification

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.160 
going to select our soft modification
tool<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.500> okay<00:01:20.330> now<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.840> see<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
tool right here okay now you see that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.340 
tool right here okay now you see that
there's<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:23.119> circle<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> got<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
there's a circle here and you got this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
there's a circle here and you got this
red<00:01:25.950> edge<00:01:26.280> around<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.500> by<00:01:29.090> hitting<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.390> plus

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
red edge around here by hitting the plus

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.200 
red edge around here by hitting the plus
key<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.470> keyboard<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> minus<00:01:33.000> key<00:01:33.180> on

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
key on the keyboard or the minus key on

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.260 
key on the keyboard or the minus key on
keyboard<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.380> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.400> influence<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
keyboard you can kind of influence that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
keyboard you can kind of influence that
range<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.990> we're<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.400> we're<00:01:38.520> just

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
range so we're going to do is we're just

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.420 
range so we're going to do is we're just
going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:40.189> click<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.310> various<00:01:41.790> places<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
going to click in various places and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.539 
going to click in various places and
we're<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> create<00:01:45.540> some

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
we're just going to create some

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.490 
we're just going to create some
difference<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.700> height<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.320> not

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
difference in height so it's not

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.370 
difference in height so it's not
absolutely<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.479> flat<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.290> know

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
absolutely you know flat if you know

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.880 
absolutely you know flat if you know
what<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.530> mean

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
what I mean

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.929 
what I mean
right<00:01:53.600> then<00:01:54.600> we're<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> scale<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.530> oops

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
right then we're going to scale it oops

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
right then we're going to scale it oops
that's<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.090> what<00:01:57.540> we're<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.100> we're

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that's not what we're going to do we're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.910 
that's not what we're going to do we're
going<00:01:59.310> to<00:02:02.570> push<00:02:03.570> down<00:02:03.869> here<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.530> there

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.750 

every<00:02:08.220> time<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.819> click<00:02:09.060> once<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:10.760> then

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
every time you just click once and then

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640 
every time you just click once and then
you<00:02:11.970> manipulate<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.930> drag<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.470> you're

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you manipulate if you drag it you're

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
you manipulate if you drag it you're
going<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.830> drag<00:02:14.099> your<00:02:14.250> object<00:02:14.700> okay<00:02:15.239> not<00:02:16.050> too

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
going to drag your object okay not too

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.490 
going to drag your object okay not too
bad<00:02:16.489> now<00:02:17.489> second<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.239> we're<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.200> apply

give us a little bit more options okay
okay<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.690> let's<00:04:54.560> increase<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.820> samples<00:04:56.630> here

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
okay so let's increase the samples here

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.320 
okay so let's increase the samples here
the<00:04:58.160> U<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:58.760> V<00:04:58.850> samples<00:04:59.650> like<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.889> and

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
the U and the V samples like that and

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.750 
the U and the V samples like that and
let's<00:05:02.330> give<00:05:02.539> this<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.750> quick<00:05:03.220> trial<00:05:04.220> render

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
let's give this a quick trial render

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.790 
let's give this a quick trial render
okay<00:05:06.490> that's<00:05:07.490> another<00:05:07.699> thing<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:08.030> was<00:05:08.180> doing

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
tab I want to increase the density so

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.040 
tab I want to increase the density so
I'm<00:06:00.080> going<00:06:00.199> to<00:06:00.260> add<00:06:00.410> a<00:06:00.440> zero<00:06:00.919> here<00:06:01.780> let's<00:06:02.780> see

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
I'm going to add a zero here let's see

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.029 
I'm going to add a zero here let's see
what<00:06:03.410> that<00:06:03.440> looks<00:06:03.590> like

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
what that looks like

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:09.790 
what that looks like

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
and we'll see that in our render much

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.580 
and we'll see that in our render much
better<00:06:10.099> okay<00:06:10.699> as<00:06:10.940> you<00:06:11.449> can<00:06:11.479> see<00:06:11.599> it's<00:06:12.199> starting

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
better okay as you can see it's starting

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.279 
better okay as you can see it's starting
to<00:06:12.650> look<00:06:12.889> much<00:06:13.039> more<00:06:13.310> like<00:06:13.370> a<00:06:13.699> dense<00:06:14.300> grass

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
to look much more like a dense grass

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.640 
to look much more like a dense grass
field<00:06:15.620> okay<00:06:16.389> now<00:06:17.389> we<00:06:17.750> can<00:06:17.900> still<00:06:18.139> improve<00:06:18.410> on

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
field okay now we can still improve on

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.800 
field okay now we can still improve on
that<00:06:18.849> what<00:06:19.849> we're<00:06:19.970> going<00:06:20.060> to<00:06:20.120> do<00:06:20.300> is<00:06:20.630> we're

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
that what we're going to do is we're

going to go to our render settings and

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.360 
going to go to our render settings and
we're<00:06:25.280> going<00:06:25.520> to<00:06:25.630> go<00:06:26.770> to<00:06:28.120> mental<00:06:29.120> ray<00:06:29.330> our

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
we're going to go to mental ray our

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.679 
we're going to go to mental ray our
intellect<00:06:31.370> indirect<00:06:32.300> lighting<00:06:32.539> tab

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689 
intellect indirect lighting tab

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:35.839 
intellect indirect lighting tab
and<00:06:33.809> we're<00:06:34.110> going<00:06:34.319> to<00:06:34.409> select<00:06:34.889> image<00:06:35.429> based

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
and we're going to select image based

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.369 
and we're going to select image based
lighting<00:06:36.299> like<00:06:37.259> so<00:06:37.499> okay<00:06:38.419> I'm<00:06:39.419> going<00:06:40.319> to
