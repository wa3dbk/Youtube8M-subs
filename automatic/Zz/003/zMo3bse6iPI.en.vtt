background yeah it's based on a 427 for

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.890 
background yeah it's based on a 427 for
mainly<00:00:27.279> aftermarket<00:00:28.179> parts<00:00:28.480> not<00:00:28.660> many

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
mainly aftermarket parts not many

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.710 
mainly aftermarket parts not many
original<00:00:29.410> parts<00:00:29.710> in<00:00:29.859> here<00:00:30.099> but<00:00:30.970> it's<00:00:31.539> all

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
original parts in here but it's all

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.630 
original parts in here but it's all
similar<00:00:32.379> in<00:00:32.529> terms<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.890> architecture<00:00:33.550> and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
similar in terms of architecture and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.180 
similar in terms of architecture and
layout<00:00:33.969> so<00:00:34.629> this<00:00:34.809> would<00:00:34.960> be<00:00:35.079> used<00:00:35.320> in<00:00:35.500> like<00:00:35.680> a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
layout so this would be used in like a

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.420 
layout so this would be used in like a
cobra<00:00:37.149> kit<00:00:37.390> car<00:00:37.629> or<00:00:38.079> a<00:00:38.140> sixty<00:00:38.920> seven<00:00:39.220> or<00:00:39.309> eight

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
hydraulic roller lifter on it so we work

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.040 
hydraulic roller lifter on it so we work
with<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.640> adjustment<00:00:52.149> on<00:00:52.300> that<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.690> get<00:00:52.839> that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
helpful and we picked out one cam going

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.050 
helpful and we picked out one cam going
through<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.860> parameters<00:01:12.429> of<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.700> engine

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
through the the parameters of the engine

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.090 
through the the parameters of the engine
and<00:01:13.210> what<00:01:13.360> we<00:01:13.450> were<00:01:13.539> trying<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.899> do<00:01:14.080> we<00:01:14.770> put<00:01:15.009> it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
and what we were trying to do we put it

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.760 
and what we were trying to do we put it
in<00:01:15.250> we<00:01:15.460> tried<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:16.119> saw<00:01:16.869> what<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.320> did<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.679> then

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
in we tried it saw what it did and then

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.980 
in we tried it saw what it did and then
came<00:01:18.039> back<00:01:18.070> around<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.940> chose<00:01:19.330> another<00:01:19.630> cam

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
came back around and chose another cam

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.200 
came back around and chose another cam
in<00:01:20.140> this<00:01:20.259> case<00:01:20.440> with<00:01:20.649> less<00:01:20.890> duration<00:01:21.220> trying

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
in this case with less duration trying

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.300 
in this case with less duration trying
to<00:01:22.330> optimize<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:23.080> engine<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.770> contest

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
to optimize the engine for the contest

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.639 
to optimize the engine for the contest
and<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:25.300> is<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.479> different<00:01:25.990> situation<00:01:26.619> than

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
and this is a different situation than

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.889 
and this is a different situation than
you<00:01:26.860> find<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.369> normal<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:28.659> race

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
you find in a normal like race

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.780 
you find in a normal like race
environment<00:01:29.500> because<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:29.920> not<00:01:29.979> about<00:01:30.460> peak

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790

horsepower<00:01:31.060> here<00:01:31.630> it's<00:01:32.259> about<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.619> wide<00:01:32.920> power

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
horsepower here it's about a wide power

thousandths lift duration and the second
one<00:01:47.829> we<00:01:47.950> put<00:01:48.159> in<00:01:48.310> there<00:01:48.460> we<00:01:48.579> shortened<00:01:48.939> it<00:01:48.969> up

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
one we put in there we shortened it up

quite a bit went down to 236 the lift is

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.450 
quite a bit went down to 236 the lift is
reasonably<00:01:53.020> similar<00:01:53.380> but<00:01:54.100> what<00:01:54.250> we<00:01:54.340> were

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
reasonably similar but what we were

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.980 
reasonably similar but what we were
trying<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.820> do<00:01:54.939> is<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.210> move<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.600> horsepower

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
trying to do is to move the horsepower

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.719 
trying to do is to move the horsepower
peak<00:01:56.380> down<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:56.860> try<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.039> get<00:01:57.219> more<00:01:57.430> torque

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
peak down and try to get more torque

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.080 
peak down and try to get more torque
down<00:01:57.909> through<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.240> bottom<00:01:58.390> m<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.640> know<00:02:00.729> we

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
down through the bottom m so you know we

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.520 
down through the bottom m so you know we
work<00:02:01.390> with<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.719> different<00:02:01.869> measurements

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
work with the different measurements

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.959 
work with the different measurements
we've<00:02:02.649> got<00:02:02.829> to<00:02:02.979> try<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.189> get<00:02:03.399> torque<00:02:03.670> through

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
we've got to try to get torque through

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.340 
we've got to try to get torque through
the<00:02:04.119> range<00:02:04.539> of<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:04.780> engine<00:02:05.109> through<00:02:05.289> the

whole pull because in this case 2500 rpm

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.720 
whole pull because in this case 2500 rpm
means<00:02:08.859> just<00:02:09.250> as<00:02:09.429> much<00:02:09.640> as<00:02:09.910> 6500<00:02:10.720> power<00:02:11.200> wise<00:02:11.730> in

your favor because you're trying to get

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.310 
your favor because you're trying to get
the<00:02:32.859> torque<00:02:33.100> down<00:02:33.310> low<00:02:33.419> so<00:02:34.419> you<00:02:34.510> try<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.930> get<00:02:35.199> as

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
the torque down low so you try to get as

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.610 
the torque down low so you try to get as
much

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
much

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.369

as<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.129> as<00:02:36.340> quickly<00:02:36.400> as<00:02:36.849> you<00:02:36.970> can<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:38.349> we

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
as you can as quickly as you can so we

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.530 
as you can as quickly as you can so we
end<00:02:38.680> up<00:02:38.799> having<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.190> fairly<00:02:39.459> radical<00:02:39.760> package<00:02:40.420> I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
end up having a fairly radical package I

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.509 
end up having a fairly radical package I
mean<00:02:40.659> this<00:02:40.750> has<00:02:40.870> got<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.019> 1:9<00:02:41.560> rocker<00:02:41.890> ratio<00:02:42.370> in

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
mean this has got a 1:9 rocker ratio in

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.360 
mean this has got a 1:9 rocker ratio in
it<00:02:42.640> which<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.470> pretty<00:02:44.470> extreme<00:02:44.860> compared<00:02:45.280> to

it which is pretty extreme compared to

it is still horsepower peaking right at
6500<00:02:57.280> which<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.940> probably<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> little<00:02:58.840> high<00:02:59.140> but

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
6500 which is probably a little high but

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.759 
6500 which is probably a little high but
it's<00:03:00.220> close<00:03:00.610> we<00:03:00.970> made<00:03:01.180> on<00:03:01.810> my<00:03:02.079> dyno<00:03:02.349> at<00:03:02.590> home

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
it's close we made on my dyno at home

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.839 
it's close we made on my dyno at home
this<00:03:03.010> made<00:03:03.220> 640<00:03:04.180> horsepower<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:05.620> at<00:03:05.760> 6200<00:03:06.760> it

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
this made 640 horsepower but at 6200 it

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.650 
this made 640 horsepower but at 6200 it
was<00:03:06.970> at<00:03:07.120> 636<00:03:08.109> so<00:03:08.319> it's<00:03:08.470> reasonably<00:03:08.980> close

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
was at 636 so it's reasonably close

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.610 
was at 636 so it's reasonably close
normally<00:03:10.660> for<00:03:10.840> something<00:03:11.109> like<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.440> you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
normally for something like this you

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.020 
normally for something like this you
want<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.890> see<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.129> power<00:03:12.310> peak<00:03:12.670> come<00:03:12.910> in

somewhere<00:03:13.450> around<00:03:13.480> 6<00:03:14.079> or<00:03:14.230> 62<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.069> then<00:03:15.730> you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
somewhere around 6 or 62 and then you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.369 
somewhere around 6 or 62 and then you
can<00:03:16.090> tail<00:03:16.359> it<00:03:16.540> off<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.690> little<00:03:16.959> bit<00:03:17.200> because

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
can tail it off a little bit because

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.020 
can tail it off a little bit because
you're<00:03:17.620> trying<00:03:17.859> to<00:03:17.950> grab<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.370> biggest<00:03:18.730> piece
