00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:17.949
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:17.949
 us review on headphones sennheiser hd 201 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:29.480
 combining a fairly humane price and 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:33.430
 decent sound quality + sennheiser 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.450
 saves you your hearing will never give you 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.450
 injure your eardrums 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.160
 I want to draw attention to this here 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.390
 pivoting ear which allows 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.470
 avoid pressure on the temporal lobe 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.350
 I personally very often arose with 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.840
 This problem on other models 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.650
 headphones that I once used 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:11.030
 This is a very good decision. 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:14.360
 although it may not know how soon 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:19.540
 all this but where used but because 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.540
 very important and useful and so about 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 advances 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.760
 height adjustment 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.980
 quite a big head distance here 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.490
 three and a half centimeters it turns out 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:52.520
 there is about such a height increases 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.740
 The length of the dushik very soft pad has 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.980
 something like that 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:06.630
 leatherette here is a headband such 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:11.030
 by surah so same mya same 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.030
 goats inside 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:21.000
 birch is a plastic wall speaker 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:26.510
 fully protected and closed on top of you 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.400
 knit fabric so nice stretches 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.400
 here the mount is pretty standard 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:52.489
 no volume control 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:58.050
 this model had an adapter 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:01.620
 so jigging on in this semblance of a guitar 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.450
 until an ordinary person remember specific 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.880
 diameter but i think everything with these 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.880
 chips adapters are familiar 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.830
 3 meter wire is ample and 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.300
 quite comfortable allows you to use 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.300
 headphones without even an extension cord 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.390
 The price of this model at the moment 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.400
 about 900 rubles 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:45.400
 which is very humane for quality and 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.560
 safe thing for health can be safely 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.000
 recommend 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.650
 as a musician guitar player so gamers and 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.239
 most music lovers I will give left to huane 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:01.480
 fit plus very light model so 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:05.140
 very compact and pretty though 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.570
 big ear but all this is done very 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.140
 neatly and without any frills this 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.650
 cool brief technical 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:20.169
 characteristics of these dynamic 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:23.710
 Headphone frequency range from 21 to 18 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:28.240
 thousand hertz sensitivity 108 db and white 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.820
 and the resistance of the 24 mind is quite 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:39.190
 enough for comfortable listening 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:46.090
 any compositions and conclusion want 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:55.590
 say that pretty comfortable ears in 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:05:00.460
 I spent them without taking more than 2 hours 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.950
 it feels like first but usually until 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.470
 you think that most likely will be the same 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.280
 the most problems with ear pain temples 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.240
 what most headphones through 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:17.080
 long time use 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:22.660
 but the more time passed 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:25.490
 less ex felt my head and that was me 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:31.010
 very pleasantly surprised 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.010
 the model is rather large ear has and 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.380
 the auricle fits here completely 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:40.890
 almost that very cool and 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.320
 comfortable plus these headphones closed 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.260
 like 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:51.300
 they have no bars here 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:54.180
 on the outer wall but this is a big plus 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.700
 so you won't annoy your 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.090
 music there games 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:02.400
 people around you also i they not 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.550
 will annoy you with their noise because 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.680
 that you will hear much less than 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:15.320
 in open headphones in which to 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:21.090
 this side of the mesh lattice 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:23.520
 many people think it's hot in such 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.680
 headphones ear as they are completely 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:30.600
 closed but i want to reassure you that 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.770
 open type headphones occur 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:39.150
 absolutely the same thing you have the same 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:45.750
 will only sweat you will hear 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:50.130
 the whole environment and it will be the same 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.410
 hear your rhythms that you will 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.960
 to audition 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:07:00.780
 what is actually not a dark topic i think 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:03.750
 not interested in you or others and everything 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.350
 all until new reviews and to new 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.350
 meeting
