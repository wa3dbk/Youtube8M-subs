bit<00:01:14.689> upset<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:17.450> think<00:01:18.450> today<00:01:18.630> she<00:01:19.080> serve<00:01:19.350> so

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
bit upset but I think today she serve so

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
bit upset but I think today she serve so
good<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.170> with<00:01:22.170> wind<00:01:23.030> she<00:01:24.030> has<00:01:24.290> more<00:01:25.290> chance

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
good and with wind she has more chance

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.490 
good and with wind she has more chance
than<00:01:26.009> me<00:01:26.250> because<00:01:27.240> when<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:28.020> serving

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
than me because when I was serving

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
than me because when I was serving
against<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> winner<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:30.350> want<00:01:31.350> me<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> 66<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
against the winner I want me to 66 and I

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510 
against the winner I want me to 66 and I
tried<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.140> push<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.650> as<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> could<00:01:35.310> but

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
tried to push as much as I could but

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.840 
tried to push as much as I could but
it's<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.140> Venus<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.100> she<00:01:38.340> served<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it's not like Venus that she served on

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.660 
it's not like Venus that she served on
second<00:01:39.600> floor<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.759> big<00:01:42.180> power<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.670> it's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
second floor and the big power so it's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.539 
second floor and the big power so it's
okay<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.680> okay<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.369> okay

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
okay and it's not okay but it's okay

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.990 
okay and it's not okay but it's okay
you<00:01:50.549> were<00:01:50.670> down<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.860> 0<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.100> first<00:01:53.640> set

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you were down for 0 in that first set

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.850 
you were down for 0 in that first set
tiebreaker<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.110> he<00:01:55.200> came<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:55.439> with

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
tiebreaker and then he came back with

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.490 
tiebreaker and then he came back with
four<00:01:55.950> straight<00:01:56.340> points<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> tie<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:57.500> what

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
four straight points to tie it up what

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.719 
four straight points to tie it up what
happened<00:01:58.829> from<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.549> got<00:01:59.700> away

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
happened from there kind of got away

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.310 
happened from there kind of got away
from<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:01.369> think<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.520> lost<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.119> first<00:02:03.360> first

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
from you I think I lost the first first

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.270 
from you I think I lost the first first
point<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:06.210> fight<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.899> they<00:02:07.170> miss<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.619> ball<00:02:07.920> so

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
point we fight and they miss a ball so

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.229 
point we fight and they miss a ball so
was<00:02:08.489> my<00:02:08.700> mistake<00:02:09.170> then<00:02:10.170> she<00:02:10.500> said<00:02:10.770> good<00:02:11.099> -<00:02:11.459> two

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
was my mistake then she said good - two

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.490 
was my mistake then she said good - two
points<00:02:12.450> Lilith<00:02:13.200> or<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:15.360> opposite<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:16.050> don't<00:02:16.290> I

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
points Lilith or the opposite I don't I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.260 
points Lilith or the opposite I don't I
don't<00:02:16.830> remember<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:17.489> but<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:20.120> think<00:02:21.120> she

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
don't remember really but I think she

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.180 
don't remember really but I think she
play<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> little<00:02:21.989> bit<00:02:22.170> better<00:02:22.379> in<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.860> moment

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
play a little bit better in that moment

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.710 
play a little bit better in that moment
and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.879> couldn't<00:02:24.300> catch<00:02:24.750> my<00:02:25.080> opportunity<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
and I couldn't catch my opportunity and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.360 
and I couldn't catch my opportunity and
then<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:28.020> played<00:02:28.319> very<00:02:29.280> high<00:02:29.489> level<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:31.370> came

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
then I played very high level and I came
