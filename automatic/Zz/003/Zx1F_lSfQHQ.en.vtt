00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.200 
I would assume their corner would have
their<00:01:04.430> fighters<00:01:04.820> do<00:01:05.120> I<00:01:05.830> wouldn't<00:01:06.970> have<00:01:07.970> ever

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.930 
their fighters do I wouldn't have ever
assumed<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.870> Cotto<00:01:09.140> would<00:01:09.530> try<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.520> bang

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940

with<00:01:11.240> Manny<00:01:11.540> Pacquiao<00:01:12.110> I<00:01:12.640> thought<00:01:13.640> code<00:01:13.910> a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
with Manny Pacquiao I thought code a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.440 
with Manny Pacquiao I thought code a
wood<00:01:14.240> box<00:01:14.450> because<00:01:15.200> when<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:15.770> noticed<00:01:16.160> in<00:01:16.550> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
wood box because when you noticed in the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.090 
wood box because when you noticed in the
three<00:01:17.720> rounds<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:18.230> Cotto<00:01:18.410> actually<00:01:18.830> tried

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
three rounds that Cotto actually tried

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.400 
three rounds that Cotto actually tried
to<00:01:19.130> box<00:01:19.460> Manny<00:01:20.360> was<00:01:20.600> stumped<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:21.020> little<00:01:21.260> bit

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
to box Manny was stumped a little bit

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.200 
to box Manny was stumped a little bit

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
boxing in like a 15-6 ring and looked

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.720 
boxing in like a 15-6 ring and looked
pretty<00:03:47.470> decent<00:03:47.680> but<00:03:48.300> after<00:03:49.300> that

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.760 

can<00:03:52.270> I<00:03:52.330> just<00:03:52.480> went<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.840> try<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.349> bang<00:03:53.530> in

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
can I just went to try and bang in

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.059 
can I just went to try and bang in
everything<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.400> that's<00:03:54.810> not<00:03:55.810> what<00:03:56.080> was<00:03:56.860> gonna

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
everything and that's not what was gonna

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.370 
everything and that's not what was gonna
do<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.520> mean<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:58.030> want<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.750> pay<00:03:58.900> with<00:03:58.930> somebody

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
do I mean you want to pay with somebody

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.830 
do I mean you want to pay with somebody
that's<00:03:59.530> slower<00:03:59.800> than<00:04:00.069> you<00:04:00.510> because<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.720> hit

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
that's slower than you because you hit

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.020 
that's slower than you because you hit
him<00:04:01.959> three<00:04:02.170> times<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.650> his<00:04:02.770> wall<00:04:03.010> which<00:04:04.000> is

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
him three times to his wall which is

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.199 
him three times to his wall which is
what<00:04:04.270> Pacquiao<00:04:04.630> was<00:04:04.780> doing<00:04:05.880> but<00:04:06.880> when<00:04:07.000> he<00:04:07.060> was

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
what Pacquiao was doing but when he was

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.850 
what Pacquiao was doing but when he was
boxing<00:04:07.480> when<00:04:08.170> he<00:04:08.260> was<00:04:08.380> keeping<00:04:08.590> his<00:04:08.739> distance

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
boxing when he was keeping his distance

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.860 
boxing when he was keeping his distance
and<00:04:09.550> he<00:04:09.640> was<00:04:09.760> able<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:10.120> keep<00:04:10.300> Manning<00:04:10.630> off<00:04:10.750> a

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
and he was able to keep Manning off a

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.240 
and he was able to keep Manning off a
little<00:04:10.989> bit<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.319> could<00:04:11.470> see<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.860> Manning<00:04:12.130> was

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
little bit you could see the Manning was

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.990 
little bit you could see the Manning was
off<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:13.860> but<00:04:14.860> when<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.010> make<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.370> predictions<00:04:15.850> I

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
off so but when I make the predictions I

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.370 
off so but when I make the predictions I
assume<00:04:16.359> that<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.620> corner<00:04:18.040> is<00:04:18.549> going<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.810> have

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
assume that the corner is going to have

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.680 
assume that the corner is going to have
a<00:04:20.410> decent<00:04:20.889> game<00:04:21.370> plan<00:04:21.730> at<00:04:21.940> least<00:04:22.120> going<00:04:22.330> into

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
a decent game plan at least going into

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.620 
a decent game plan at least going into
the<00:04:22.780> fight<00:04:22.990> how<00:04:23.860> do<00:04:23.919> you<00:04:24.100> go<00:04:24.340> into<00:04:24.760> a<00:04:25.030> fight

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
the fight how do you go into a fight

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.159 
the fight how do you go into a fight
like<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:27.090> throw<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.240> just<00:04:28.690> throw<00:04:29.050> it

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
like that and and throw it just throw it

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.260 
like that and and throw it just throw it
down<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.350> tubes<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:30.550> second<00:04:30.880> he<00:04:30.940> gets<00:04:31.030> in<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
down the tubes the second he gets in the

down the tubes the second he gets in the
ring<00:04:32.669> never<00:04:33.669> standing<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.870> that's<00:04:38.800> my<00:04:39.040> that's

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
ring never standing so that's my that's

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.469 
ring never standing so that's my that's
my<00:04:42.130> take<00:04:42.430> on<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.639> I<00:04:42.850> was<00:04:43.000> wrong<00:04:43.180> on<00:04:43.389> the

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
my take on it I was wrong on the

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.860 
my take on it I was wrong on the
prediction<00:04:44.460> as<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.610> stated<00:04:45.850> earlier<00:04:46.060> but<00:04:46.510> the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
prediction as I stated earlier but the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.780 
prediction as I stated earlier but the
guy<00:04:47.050> didn't<00:04:47.320> do<00:04:47.470> anything<00:04:48.010> that<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.430> said<00:04:48.669> he

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
guy didn't do anything that I said he

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.550 
guy didn't do anything that I said he
would<00:04:48.970> do<00:04:49.180> or<00:04:50.080> shouldn't<00:04:50.350> do<00:04:52.139> that<00:04:53.139> gets<00:04:53.350> me<00:04:53.470> in

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
would do or shouldn't do that gets me in

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.530 
would do or shouldn't do that gets me in
trouble<00:04:53.590> on<00:04:53.979> some<00:04:54.190> predictions<00:04:54.729> I<00:04:54.910> assume

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
trouble on some predictions I assume

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.060 
trouble on some predictions I assume
their<00:04:55.750> corners<00:04:56.169> gonna<00:04:57.960> use<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.140> brain<00:04:59.410> and

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
their corners gonna use the brain and

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.930 
their corners gonna use the brain and
then<00:05:00.340> I'm<00:05:00.430> off<00:05:02.310> well<00:05:03.310> anyway<00:05:04.240> uh<00:05:05.760> hope<00:05:06.760> you
