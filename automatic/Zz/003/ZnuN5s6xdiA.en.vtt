00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.939

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.220
 compatible version of minecraft 1.7 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.960
 points x through 1.8 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.239
 it's time to move on to the next level 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.880
 cracks it's time to raise your server to 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.230
 a new state a new level 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.879
 compatible with current versions of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.360
 minecraft of the most played by 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.660
 course it would be 1.7 onwards 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 up to 1,800 the thing that you have to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.890
 clarify idols that not only supports what 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320
 what would these versions of minecraft be 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.510
 from 1.7 to 1.8 but that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.000
 it's also a generic version so 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.620
 they will be able to use both their plugin layoffs 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.600
 as your booking series plugin are 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.430
 fully compatible may 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.259
 use it and mix them together 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.939
 will have any kind of inconvenience 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.040
 good idols so do not worry 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.390
 they work absolutely all flow 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.909
 available until the date of the date 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.159
 both in bukit and in the breakwater as well 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.009
 that is something to keep in mind 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.140
 very good the truth is incredible with 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.179
 this without doubt to highlight what 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.189
 which is the server from among others 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.140
 well and pain the only thing that they should do 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.819
 you crack like there is always in the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.439
 description of leaving a link with the 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.609
 section of its simple version in its 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 full version you should 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.189
 download it and already have available the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.950
 that would be your server in version 1.7 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.450
 point x onwards would well support 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.609
 any type of minecraft version 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.590
 your characters inside your server already 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.630
 whether in offline mode or in online mode is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.890
 say non-premium awards may enter 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.289
 to the server in any of those 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.659
 versions the guarantee that I give to 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.219
 through this version that I bring to you is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.079
 very good since it is the one that I use 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.360
 currently on my server cookie craft 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.979
 so they would not have any problem 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.649
 because I leave tested and works 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.569
 perfection so once you 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.640
 add from this your server declared in 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.890
 your server officially enchulado already 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.509
 would go to the next level well idols 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.250
 up to here what would be today's video 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.840

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.609
 look for those new ones until the first 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.170
 Once you see one of my videos, I'll tell you 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.120
 to the programming of my channel is the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.950
 next monday wednesday and friday there was 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.730
 plugin packs and server maps 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.650
 varied 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.480
 between those days Monday and Wednesday 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.209
 Friday this series called in chula in 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.129
 the server with this series will give you a 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.500
 special and unique touch to your server and 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.970
 you will make it stand out from the rest 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.159
 I suggest you see the sections 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.200
 previous doubts if you need 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.810
 something that will surely serve you 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.819
 a lot of help for your server well and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.830
 pain and finally the days abuse one is 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.930
 call grabbing a test game where all 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.299
 minigames famous varied servers 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.250
 Regarding the club, impact the map pack 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.390
 I'm going up lately since the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.269
 Most of the servers are 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.310
 protected and can no longer be downloaded 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.140
 currently what would be your maps by 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.510
 course since they have used some 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.609
 software that prevents you from collecting 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.829
 what with the program that I used to 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.180
 download those lost maps as 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.400
 always do not worry that 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.019
 soon something new will come out and for 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.700
 of course we will be sharing the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.319
 other maps besides this series I the 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.540
 he has very much asked me 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.829
 quite and regarding the plugin file is 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.739
 that there are guards I go to approximately 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.319
 50% we are already progressing 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.840
 I'm marching marching 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.670
 the truth that is quite complicated 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.650
 to do it but we are already moving forward 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.719
 a lot so the only thing I ask is 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.280
 patience well and pains a mental layman 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:36.200
 subscription are very good gesture of 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.200
 gratitude and it will be until next time 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.080
