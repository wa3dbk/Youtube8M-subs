our next set of drills have to do with

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.790 
our next set of drills have to do with
shoulder<00:00:05.939> touches<00:00:06.380> what's<00:00:07.380> the<00:00:07.470> idea<00:00:07.740> behind

shoulder touches what's the idea behind

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.180 
shoulder touches what's the idea behind
that<00:00:08.189> well<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.969> solder<00:00:09.240> touches<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:10.070> knew<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
that well the solder touches I knew the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.549 
that well the solder touches I knew the
competition's<00:00:11.960> you're<00:00:12.960> doing<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.230> handstand

competition's you're doing the handstand

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.039 
competition's you're doing the handstand
walks<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.280> lot<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.820> times<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.930> know

walks a lot of times it's you know
transfer<00:00:16.439> of<00:00:16.650> weight<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.580> know<00:00:17.670> learning<00:00:18.359> how

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
transfer of weight you know learning how

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.880 
transfer of weight you know learning how
to<00:00:18.660> transfer<00:00:19.170> your<00:00:19.199> body<00:00:19.500> weight<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:19.830> side

to transfer your body weight from side
to<00:00:20.100> side<00:00:20.250> or<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.180> know<00:00:21.300> up<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> down<00:00:22.110> so<00:00:22.680> this

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
to side or you know up and down so this

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
to side or you know up and down so this
is<00:00:23.190> a<00:00:23.369> little<00:00:23.789> drill<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.360> help<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.690> learn<00:00:24.960> the

is a little drill to help you learn the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.040 
is a little drill to help you learn the
balance<00:00:25.770> okay<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:27.270> transferring<00:00:27.869> your<00:00:27.990> weight

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
balance okay of transferring your weight

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
balance okay of transferring your weight
to<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.440> left<00:00:28.500> side<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.100> right<00:00:29.189> side<00:00:29.630> just

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to the left side to the right side just

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
to the left side to the right side just
getting<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.930> feeling<00:00:31.289> ingrained<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.070> your

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
getting that feeling ingrained in your

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
getting that feeling ingrained in your
head<00:00:32.399> over<00:00:32.699> and<00:00:32.969> over<00:00:33.239> again<00:00:33.359> so<00:00:33.690> you're<00:00:33.930> able

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
head over and over again so you're able

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
head over and over again so you're able
to<00:00:34.199> do<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.440> movement<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:35.730> chains<00:00:36.180> gonna

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
to do that movement the chains gonna

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.700 
to do that movement the chains gonna
climb<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.500> them<00:00:37.710> all<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.760> show<00:00:39.030> us<00:00:39.270> these

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
climb up them all and show us these

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.549 
climb up them all and show us these
handstand<00:00:40.710> alternating<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.399> touches<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
handstand alternating on touches and the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.560 
handstand alternating on touches and the
idea<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.520> want<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.760> say<00:00:48.000> nice<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> tight

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
yeah right Scott in our development

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.330 
yeah right Scott in our development
phase<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:12.380> you<00:01:13.380> did<00:01:13.529> a<00:01:13.560> set<00:01:13.889> a<00:01:13.920> rep<00:01:14.189> scheme

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
phase here you did a set a rep scheme

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550 
phase here you did a set a rep scheme
for<00:01:14.909> today<00:01:15.149> on<00:01:15.389> the<00:01:15.509> hand<00:01:15.689> touches<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.439> were

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
for today on the hand touches what were

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.499 
for today on the hand touches what were
they<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.920> how<00:01:17.039> would<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.219> modify<00:01:17.549> them<00:01:17.789> yeah

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
they and how would you modify them yeah

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.649 
they and how would you modify them yeah
so<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:19.740> you're<00:01:20.219> just<00:01:20.340> learning<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.509> had<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
so if you're just learning this we had a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.859 
so if you're just learning this we had a
new<00:01:22.200> person<00:01:22.529> in<00:01:22.619> class<00:01:22.740> today<00:01:23.389> what<00:01:24.389> I<00:01:24.420> had<00:01:24.659> her

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
new person in class today what I had her

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.109 
new person in class today what I had her
do<00:01:25.079> was<00:01:25.439> climb<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.219> wall<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.579> 45<00:01:27.090> degree

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
do was climb up the wall to a 45 degree

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.849 
do was climb up the wall to a 45 degree
angle<00:01:27.450> okay<00:01:28.319> it<00:01:28.499> can<00:01:28.709> be<00:01:28.740> even<00:01:29.069> lower<00:01:29.219> to<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
angle okay it can be even lower to and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.949 
angle okay it can be even lower to and
from<00:01:31.859> that<00:01:32.039> angle<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:33.240> lift<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.659> nice<00:01:33.929> and

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
from that angle just lift up nice and

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.319 
from that angle just lift up nice and
slow<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.009> want<00:01:35.099> to<00:01:35.249> want<00:01:35.429> to<00:01:35.459> show<00:01:35.609> Shane<00:01:35.880> sure

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.999 

so<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.719> see<00:01:39.840> Shane's<00:01:40.109> not<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.439> high<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.619> time

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so you see Shane's not as high this time

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.059 
so you see Shane's not as high this time
or<00:01:41.399> gaze<00:01:41.549> about<00:01:41.819> a<00:01:41.849> 45<00:01:42.389> degree<00:01:42.419> angle<00:01:42.829> okay<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
or gaze about a 45 degree angle okay and

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.440 
or gaze about a 45 degree angle okay and
you

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.080

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.639 
body's opening as one okay you want to
break<00:01:57.409> up<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.560> movement<00:01:58.040> at<00:01:58.220> all<00:01:59.380> so<00:02:00.380> from<00:02:00.560> a

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
break up that movement at all so from a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.680 
break up that movement at all so from a
progression<00:02:01.009> standpoint<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.240> would<00:02:02.420> if

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
progression standpoint you would if

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.570 
progression standpoint you would if
somebody<00:02:03.049> was<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.170> absolute<00:02:03.920> beginner<00:02:04.280> what's

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
somebody was a absolute beginner what's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.789 
somebody was a absolute beginner what's
the<00:02:04.670> first<00:02:04.880> stage<00:02:05.119> of<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.450> first<00:02:06.350> stage<00:02:06.590> is

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
the first stage of this first stage is

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.639 
the first stage of this first stage is
just<00:02:07.179> hold<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.300> plank<00:02:08.479> position<00:02:08.720> on<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.470> wall

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
just hold a plank position on the wall

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.240 
just hold a plank position on the wall
45-degree<00:02:10.489> next<00:02:11.150> step<00:02:11.300> would<00:02:11.510> be<00:02:11.980> next<00:02:12.980> step

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
45-degree next step would be next step

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.030 
45-degree next step would be next step
would<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.790> go<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.870> handstand<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:15.709> for

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
would be go to the handstand but for

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.360 
would be go to the handstand but for
alternating<00:02:16.790> shoulder<00:02:17.440> touches<00:02:18.440> next<00:02:19.190> step

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
alternating shoulder touches next step

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.640 
alternating shoulder touches next step
would<00:02:19.550> be<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.940> stay<00:02:20.209> at<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.540> 45<00:02:21.019> degree<00:02:21.170> angle

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
would be to stay at that 45 degree angle

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.890 
would be to stay at that 45 degree angle
and<00:02:21.830> not<00:02:22.489> lift<00:02:22.790> up<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.150> touch<00:02:23.330> your<00:02:23.480> shoulder

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
and not lift up and touch your shoulder

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.559 
and not lift up and touch your shoulder
but<00:02:24.650> just<00:02:25.160> maybe<00:02:25.610> lift<00:02:25.910> your<00:02:26.030> hand<00:02:26.239> off<00:02:26.390> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
but just maybe lift your hand off the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.630 
but just maybe lift your hand off the
ground<00:02:26.780> just<00:02:27.049> to<00:02:27.620> get<00:02:27.769> an<00:02:27.890> eye<00:02:28.010> just<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.430> see

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
ground just to get an eye just to see

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.740 
ground just to get an eye just to see
how<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.910> feels<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.390> get<00:02:29.510> used<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.989> okay<00:02:30.440> and

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
how it feels and get used to it okay and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.570 
how it feels and get used to it okay and
the<00:02:32.750> next<00:02:32.989> step<00:02:33.140> after<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.440> well<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.069> next

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
the next step after that well this next

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.979 
the next step after that well this next
step<00:02:34.819> would<00:02:35.000> be<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.180> go<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.420> little<00:02:35.600> bit<00:02:35.810> higher

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
step would be to go a little bit higher

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.590 
step would be to go a little bit higher
and<00:02:36.319> start<00:02:37.069> to<00:02:37.160> touch<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.489> shoulder<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:38.000> then

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
and start to touch the shoulder and then

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.360 
and start to touch the shoulder and then
the<00:02:38.720> final<00:02:39.049> step<00:02:39.260> is<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.470> move<00:02:39.950> up<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.250> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
the final step is to move up to the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.809 
the final step is to move up to the
handstand<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:41.630> do<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.170> same<00:02:42.350> thing<00:02:42.819> and

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
handstand and then do the same thing and

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.570 
handstand and then do the same thing and
I<00:02:43.850> guess<00:02:44.120> at<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.350> end<00:02:45.380> you<00:02:45.830> go<00:02:46.010> as<00:02:46.100> fast<00:02:46.250> as<00:02:46.459> you

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
I guess at the end you go as fast as you

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.760 
I guess at the end you go as fast as you
want
