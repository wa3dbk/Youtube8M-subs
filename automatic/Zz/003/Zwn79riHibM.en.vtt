00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
and like all of these penetration from

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.940 
and like all of these penetration from
the<00:03:58.450> enemies<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:58.989> game<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.349> like<00:03:59.470> in<00:03:59.650> my<00:03:59.769> log

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
the enemies this game is like in my log

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.650 
the enemies this game is like in my log
like<00:04:00.220> I'm<00:04:00.400> not<00:04:00.579> really<00:04:00.819> angry<00:04:01.150> properly

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
like I'm not really angry properly

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.930 
like I'm not really angry properly
because<00:04:01.780> I<00:04:01.989> cannot<00:04:02.200> be<00:04:02.440> bothered<00:04:02.940> since

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
because I cannot be bothered since

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.789 
because I cannot be bothered since
there's<00:04:04.180> only<00:04:04.299> like<00:04:04.450> two<00:04:04.599> tanks<00:04:05.079> left<00:04:05.260> and

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
there's only like two tanks left and

done anything and again like I'm facing

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.180 
done anything and again like I'm facing
upwards<00:04:08.109> and<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.379> guys<00:04:08.560> just<00:04:08.799> painting<00:04:09.069> my

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
upwards and the guys just painting my

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.860 
upwards and the guys just painting my
lower<00:04:09.340> plate<00:04:09.640> I'll<00:04:10.030> show<00:04:10.390> you<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.720> two

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
lower plate I'll show you the two

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.319 
lower plate I'll show you the two
penetration<00:04:11.470> shown<00:04:11.680> like<00:04:12.519> you<00:04:12.879> can<00:04:13.030> see<00:04:13.180> in

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
penetration shown like you can see in

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.750 
penetration shown like you can see in
global<00:04:13.660> point<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.470> bad<00:04:14.859> angle<00:04:15.160> if<00:04:15.549> you

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
global point it's a bad angle if you

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.520 
global point it's a bad angle if you
angle<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.120> lower<00:04:16.389> plate<00:04:16.570> downwards<00:04:17.169> than

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
angle the lower plate downwards than

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.610 
angle the lower plate downwards than
people<00:04:17.949> might<00:04:18.750> shoot<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> lot<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.139> weight<00:04:20.349> and

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
people might shoot a lot of weight and

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.700 
people might shoot a lot of weight and
balance<00:04:20.889> off<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:22.000> it's<00:04:22.479> not<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.630> bad<00:04:22.930> but

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
balance off so it's not that bad but

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.190 
balance off so it's not that bad but
like<00:04:24.330> when<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.419> cannot<00:04:25.720> be<00:04:25.840> bothered<00:04:26.169> to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
like when you cannot be bothered to

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.320 
like when you cannot be bothered to
angle<00:04:26.620> properly<00:04:27.130> because<00:04:27.310> there's<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.120> two

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
angle properly because there's like two

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.050 
angle properly because there's like two
entries<00:04:28.630> left<00:04:28.810> then<00:04:29.520> they<00:04:30.520> will<00:04:30.669> paint<00:04:30.910> you

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
entries left then they will paint you

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.600 
entries left then they will paint you
that's<00:04:31.360> for<00:04:31.539> sure<00:04:32.039> only<00:04:33.039> thing<00:04:33.190> I'm<00:04:33.340> period

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
that's for sure only thing I'm period

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.310 
that's for sure only thing I'm period
that<00:04:33.760> usually<00:04:34.270> bouncer<00:04:34.599> shut<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.169> gun

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
that usually bouncer shut is the gun

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.770 
that usually bouncer shut is the gun
mantlet<00:04:35.560> it's<00:04:36.039> gum<00:04:36.970> at<00:04:37.120> least<00:04:37.330> be<00:04:37.510> good<00:04:37.750> i

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
mantlet it's gum at least be good i

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.850 
mantlet it's gum at least be good i
guess<00:04:38.110> but<00:04:38.320> not<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.590> lot<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.770> people<00:04:38.860> shoot

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
guess but not a lot of people shoot

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.300 
guess but not a lot of people shoot
and<00:04:40.219> I<00:04:41.210> think<00:04:41.750> downhill<00:04:42.289> is<00:04:42.439> pretty<00:04:42.680> fast<00:04:42.949> goes

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
and I think downhill is pretty fast goes

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.999 
and I think downhill is pretty fast goes
40<00:04:43.699> so<00:04:43.909> grabbing<00:04:44.300> things<00:04:44.840> can<00:04:45.409> work<00:04:45.560> as<00:04:45.830> well

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
40 so grabbing things can work as well

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.159 
40 so grabbing things can work as well
like<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.639> do<00:04:46.849> 200<00:04:47.360> arriving<00:04:47.689> damage<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.080> the

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
like I do 200 arriving damage to the

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.589 
like I do 200 arriving damage to the
5100<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:48.979> I<00:04:49.009> can<00:04:49.219> finish<00:04:49.370> him<00:04:49.610> off<00:04:49.729> with<00:04:49.969> the

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
5100 so I can finish him off with the

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.950 
5100 so I can finish him off with the
shot<00:04:50.919> which<00:04:51.919> is<00:04:52.340> quite<00:04:52.610> nervous<00:04:52.879> if<00:04:53.719> you<00:04:53.840> have

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
shot which is quite nervous if you have

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.770 
shot which is quite nervous if you have
to<00:04:54.080> choose<00:04:54.259> between<00:04:54.550> i-96<00:04:55.550> or<00:04:55.879> the<00:04:56.030> 112<00:04:56.509> I

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
to choose between i-96 or the 112 I

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.559 
to choose between i-96 or the 112 I
think<00:04:57.199> the<00:04:57.289> choice<00:04:57.740> is<00:04:58.009> obviously<00:04:58.759> between<00:04:59.030> if

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
think the choice is obviously between if

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.149 
think the choice is obviously between if
you<00:04:59.780> are<00:04:59.930> running<00:05:00.139> in<00:05:00.439> Russian<00:05:00.740> heavy<00:05:00.949> so

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
you are running in Russian heavy so

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:02.619 
you are running in Russian heavy so
Chinese<00:05:01.520> heavy<00:05:01.759> is<00:05:01.879> just<00:05:02.150> for<00:05:02.330> a<00:05:02.360> group

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:02.629 
Chinese heavy is just for a group

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.869 
Chinese heavy is just for a group
training<00:05:02.990> some<00:05:03.800> people<00:05:04.099> might<00:05:04.280> disagree<00:05:04.460> and

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
training some people might disagree and

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.850 
training some people might disagree and
say<00:05:05.030> well<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.599> van<00:05:05.780> 12<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.289> much<00:05:06.500> better<00:05:06.770> and

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
say well the van 12 is much better and

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.399 
say well the van 12 is much better and
better<00:05:07.069> armor<00:05:07.520> and<00:05:07.729> better<00:05:08.150> gold<00:05:08.750> rounds<00:05:09.169> well

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
better armor and better gold rounds well

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.050 
better armor and better gold rounds well
if<00:05:09.770> you're<00:05:09.949> making<00:05:10.250> money<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:10.669> don't<00:05:10.879> really

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
if you're making money you don't really

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.369 
if you're making money you don't really
give<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.270> shit<00:05:11.419> about<00:05:11.479> how<00:05:11.870> good<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.169> gold

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
give a shit about how good the gold

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.279 
give a shit about how good the gold
ounces<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.449> armor<00:05:14.449> wise<00:05:14.629> as<00:05:14.810> probably<00:05:15.110> is

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
ounces and armor wise as probably is

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.080 
ounces and armor wise as probably is
better<00:05:15.529> but<00:05:15.710> it's<00:05:15.830> probably<00:05:16.039> slower<00:05:16.370> well<00:05:16.849> and

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
better but it's probably slower well and

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.179 
better but it's probably slower well and
I<00:05:17.120> think<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.479> Isaacs<00:05:17.900> just<00:05:18.080> looks<00:05:18.319> better<00:05:18.529> but

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:19.189 
I think the Isaacs just looks better but

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:21.909 
I think the Isaacs just looks better but
I<00:05:19.430> think<00:05:19.879> it's<00:05:20.029> just<00:05:20.300> all<00:05:20.449> the<00:05:21.050> like<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.680> small

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
I think it's just all the like the small

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.890 
I think it's just all the like the small
things<00:05:21.949> does<00:05:22.669> it<00:05:22.819> look<00:05:22.969> better<00:05:23.120> this<00:05:23.360> to

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
things does it look better this to

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.170 
things does it look better this to
actually<00:05:24.169> gives<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.740> shit<00:05:24.949> so<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.969> choice

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
actually gives a shit so the choice

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.480 
actually gives a shit so the choice
between<00:05:26.419> is<00:05:26.990> six<00:05:27.349> and<00:05:27.469> a<00:05:27.560> 112<00:05:27.979> I<00:05:28.099> think<00:05:28.340> is<00:05:28.460> just

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
between is six and a 112 I think is just

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.740 
between is six and a 112 I think is just
the<00:05:29.000> good<00:05:29.180> between<00:05:29.659> what<00:05:31.479> kind<00:05:32.479> of<00:05:32.539> heavy

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
the good between what kind of heavy

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.689 
the good between what kind of heavy
tanks<00:05:33.080> you're<00:05:33.199> actually<00:05:33.319> grinding<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.460> if

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:34.699 
tanks you're actually grinding and if

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:36.100 
tanks you're actually grinding and if
they're<00:05:34.909> Chinese<00:05:35.330> then<00:05:35.569> it<00:05:35.689> would<00:05:35.779> be<00:05:35.900> silly

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
they're Chinese then it would be silly

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.600 
they're Chinese then it would be silly
to<00:05:36.229> buy<00:05:36.469> a<00:05:36.500> nice<00:05:36.680> six<00:05:37.069> and<00:05:37.340> if<00:05:37.400> they<00:05:37.550> are

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
to buy a nice six and if they are

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.730 
to buy a nice six and if they are
Russian<00:05:38.029> it<00:05:38.509> will<00:05:38.659> be<00:05:38.719> silly<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.050> x<00:05:39.289> naught<00:05:39.500> 1

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
Russian it will be silly to x naught 1

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.019 
Russian it will be silly to x naught 1
12<00:05:40.629> so<00:05:41.629> yeah<00:05:41.840> that<00:05:42.439> is<00:05:42.620> my<00:05:42.949> judgment<00:05:43.460> on<00:05:43.639> that

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
12 so yeah that is my judgment on that

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.829 
12 so yeah that is my judgment on that
matter<00:05:44.800> some<00:05:45.800> people<00:05:46.069> might<00:05:46.190> argue<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.879> t-34

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
matter some people might argue the t-34

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.809 
matter some people might argue the t-34

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
strong it makes it really good credit

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.360 
strong it makes it really good credit
and<00:06:04.789> it's<00:06:05.659> a<00:06:05.750> good<00:06:05.870> returner<00:06:06.349> the<00:06:06.800> coop<00:06:07.039> what

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
lot of crew so for instance of you

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.540 
lot of crew so for instance of you
training<00:06:11.719> an<00:06:11.930> i7<00:06:12.589> through<00:06:12.919> it<00:06:13.099> will<00:06:13.339> mean<00:06:13.520> that

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
training an i7 through it will mean that

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.490 
training an i7 through it will mean that
you<00:06:13.909> have<00:06:14.599> to<00:06:15.439> switch<00:06:15.830> out<00:06:16.039> loggers<00:06:17.319> back<00:06:18.319> and

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
you have to switch out loggers back and

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.950 
you have to switch out loggers back and
forth<00:06:18.710> because<00:06:18.919> I<00:06:19.310> son<00:06:19.669> has<00:06:19.879> to<00:06:20.089> I<00:06:20.330> six<00:06:20.779> have

forth because I son has to I six have
only<00:06:21.169> one<00:06:21.439> so<00:06:22.310> there<00:06:22.580> we<00:06:22.699> go<00:06:22.729> a<00:06:23.060> foot<00:06:23.779> per

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
only one so there we go a foot per

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.469 
only one so there we go a foot per
circuit<00:06:24.110> damage<00:06:24.610> 96<00:06:25.610> spotting<00:06:25.969> damage<00:06:26.089> what<00:06:26.389> I

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
circuit damage 96 spotting damage what I

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:27.700 
circuit damage 96 spotting damage what I
think<00:06:26.750> this<00:06:26.900> thing<00:06:27.050> has<00:06:27.080> horrible<00:06:27.500> we

think this thing has horrible we

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.589 
think this thing has horrible we
arranged<00:06:27.979> so<00:06:28.219> spotting<00:06:28.669> is<00:06:28.789> not<00:06:28.969> an<00:06:29.089> option

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
arranged so spotting is not an option

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.719 
arranged so spotting is not an option
you<00:06:29.990> just<00:06:30.289> go<00:06:30.529> close<00:06:30.830> range<00:06:31.129> and<00:06:31.400> shoot<00:06:31.550> people

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
that's my thoughts of the is-6 you might

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.320 
that's my thoughts of the is-6 you might
disagree<00:07:03.319> my<00:07:03.650> they<00:07:04.159> say<00:07:04.460> that<00:07:04.490> the<00:07:04.729> 112<00:07:05.180> is

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
disagree my they say that the 112 is

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.700 
disagree my they say that the 112 is
much<00:07:05.509> better<00:07:05.749> but<00:07:05.990> I<00:07:06.259> think<00:07:06.469> if<00:07:06.589> you're

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
much better but I think if you're

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.079 
much better but I think if you're
running<00:07:06.949> Russian<00:07:07.400> crew<00:07:07.550> it<00:07:07.639> would<00:07:07.789> be<00:07:07.909> pretty

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:08.089 
running Russian crew it would be pretty

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:11.980 
running Russian crew it would be pretty
stupid<00:07:08.419> to<00:07:08.629> buy<00:07:08.839> a<00:07:08.870> 112<00:07:09.379> oh<00:07:10.389> yeah<00:07:11.389> now<00:07:11.599> for<00:07:11.809> some

stupid to buy a 112 oh yeah now for some

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.309 
stupid to buy a 112 oh yeah now for some
