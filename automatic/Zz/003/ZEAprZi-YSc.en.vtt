there just be careful everything is
plastic

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:52.920 

you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.380 

once<00:01:53.930> it's<00:01:54.110> in<00:01:54.230> there<00:01:54.550> make<00:01:55.550> sure<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:55.910> put<00:01:56.210> the

once it's in there make sure you put the
spring<00:01:56.720> back<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.470> there's<00:01:57.680> pressure<00:01:58.010> on<00:01:58.220> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
spring back so there's pressure on the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.830 
spring back so there's pressure on the
lever<00:01:59.410> and<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:01.700> shoot<00:02:02.000> has<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.360> go<00:02:02.480> back<00:02:02.630> in

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
lever and I shoot has to go back in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.770 
lever and I shoot has to go back in
there<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.170> again<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.860> snaps<00:02:04.850> in<00:02:05.150> with<00:02:05.540> those

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
there and again it snaps in with those

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:31.580 
there and again it snaps in with those
little<00:02:06.740> tabs

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.730 

this<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.739> what<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> switch<00:02:33.250> looks<00:02:33.459> like

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.800 

you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.430> see<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:41.940> one<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.330> terminals

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
you can see here one of the terminals

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.060 
you can see here one of the terminals
started<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.290> corrode<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.930> reconnect<00:02:46.530> all<00:02:46.800> the
