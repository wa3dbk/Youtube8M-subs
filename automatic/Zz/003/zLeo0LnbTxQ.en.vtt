00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 the usual great environment at the Olympic 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.410
 75,000 spectators rained just before 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.340
 of the beginning of the game the Rome must 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.130
 do without totti and delvecchio e 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.190
 hair sends aliens into the field seeks a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.250
 montella there's del piero in juventus e 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.020
 the tactical drawing of hair and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.019
 undermine the juventus on the wings 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.000
 side but juve presidi in turn 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.800
 very well with the corridors above all 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 with the excellent start of zambrotta that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.059
 holds apprehension candle 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.800
 forcing him backwards and the same 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.570
 zambrotta that goes the first conclusion 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.460
 dangerous with the ball ending 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.059
 out of little 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.280
 rome is very well placed in the field 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.920
 it shows itself only with this conclusion 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.829
 from the distance of absence or easily 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.360
 parade by van der sar on punishment 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.160
 instead very dangerous to the piero 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.860
 wonderful intervention in football 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.510
 corner by antonioli 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.190
 the game is very tactical you see 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.890
 hair that tries to give more order 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.660
 his team still lights up one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.659
 melee on corner action in area 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.180
 Romanist at the end of the beat and replies 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 there is the Iuliano shooting that catches 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 the crossing of the poles practically in a blow 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.689
 safe very dangerous candle on 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.680
 free kick here van der sar 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.240
 reflexively refuses with the foot and little 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.140
 after still candle at the first post 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.770
 the Dutch goalkeeper a 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.720
 answer back 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.040
 it goes on however with the game 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.270
 mainly developed on 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.700
 midfield always very active 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.229
 zambrotta cuts into pre but people though 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 is not collected by anyone and 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.939
 piero and tonic excellent in closing 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.130
 first time its work the conclusion 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.060
 however it is closed in a corner kick 0 0 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.130
 at the end of the first half 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.040
 start shooting with the Rome that is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.540
 brings forward and there is the possibility for 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.600
 you still have friends and meditate 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.670
 good goalkeeper van der sar then 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.590
 counter-attack of juventus inzaghi comes 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.780
 set down to the limit of the zago area 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.990
 the Roma players protest but the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.460
 punishment is ridiculed 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.930
 on the first post nothing to do for 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.090
 antonioli you see that starts with a moment 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.890
 of late juve in advantage 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.720
 hair tries to give more weight 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.670
 attack by sending faber into the field 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.640
 junior out of francesco than not 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.530
 like Rome with a force of nerves 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.420
 forward beautiful the conclusion of 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.810
 still standing with his foot in the corner a 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.810
 van der sar 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.760
 obviously the game now becomes a bit 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.890
 different the juve has many spaces in 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.410
 here the piero's counter-attack widens 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.420
 too after skipping also antonioli 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.989
 but it is the roma that naturally attacks 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.790
 albeit with few fruits of a 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.450
 cross with the header is 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.850
 carried out by montella actually yes 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.550
 feels very much the absence of totti e 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.380
 the juve is still ahead of you 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.130
 present in two in front of antonioli 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.209
 that solves with a good exit enters 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.130
 in Rome also the cultured Greek if it comes out 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.600
 inzaghi and enter kovacevic and juve 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.600
 then also tudors will enter 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.190
 birindelli still a parade by 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.220
 van der sar 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.460
 Rome is generous but forward 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.590
 frankly his attack is a bit 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.360
 light van der sar has the opportunity 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.700
 yet to show us in some 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.920
 occasions expired is warned 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.230
 for double zidane simulation 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.760
 admonition for the French champion of the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.970
 world and expulsion but it does not happen 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.370
 nothing else ends with victory 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.370
 of juve for 1 to 0
