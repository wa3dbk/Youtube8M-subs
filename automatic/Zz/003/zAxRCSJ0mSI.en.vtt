00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
that he probably didn't expect at the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.520 
that he probably didn't expect at the
start<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.210> week<00:00:40.390> but<00:00:40.989> what<00:00:41.110> about<00:00:41.290> in<00:00:41.440> the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
start of the week but what about in the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.619 
start of the week but what about in the
latter<00:00:41.710> stages<00:00:42.070> as<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.610> Mexican<00:00:43.510> was

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
latter stages as the Mexican was

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.889 
latter stages as the Mexican was
catching<00:00:43.989> it<00:00:44.140> yeah<00:00:44.920> definitely<00:00:45.899> surprised

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
catching it yeah definitely surprised

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.729 
catching it yeah definitely surprised
today<00:00:47.200> I<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:49.300> we<00:00:49.780> were<00:00:49.899> not<00:00:49.930> competitive

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
today I think we were not competitive

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.700 
today I think we were not competitive
we<00:00:51.730> were<00:00:51.850> not<00:00:52.000> competitive<00:00:52.239> here<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.960> our

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
we were not competitive here and our

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.799 
we were not competitive here and our
goal<00:00:54.070> for<00:00:54.280> this<00:00:54.430> first<00:00:54.969> race<00:00:55.120> is<00:00:55.329> to<00:00:55.480> score<00:00:55.690> as

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
goal for this first race is to score as

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.360 
goal for this first race is to score as
many<00:00:55.840> points<00:00:56.020> as<00:00:56.260> possible<00:00:56.350> but<00:00:56.770> today<00:00:57.039> we<00:00:57.219> did

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
many points as possible but today we did

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.670 
many points as possible but today we did
the<00:00:57.489> 25<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.270> it's<00:00:58.600> a<00:01:00.809> from<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.960> from<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.469> team

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
the 25 so it's a from the from the team

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.890 
the 25 so it's a from the from the team
on<00:01:03.059> trackside<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.119> think<00:01:04.420> we<00:01:04.510> maximize<00:01:04.869> the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
on trackside I think we maximize the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.420 
on trackside I think we maximize the
potential<00:01:05.229> we<00:01:05.439> have<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:05.710> our<00:01:05.799> hands<00:01:06.100> at<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
potential we have in our hands at the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.700 
potential we have in our hands at the
moment<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:07.630> qualifying<00:01:08.140> yesterday<00:01:08.260> going

some<00:01:12.100> extreme<00:01:12.670> conditions<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.689> think<00:01:13.930> at<00:01:14.049> the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
some extreme conditions I think at the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.780 
some extreme conditions I think at the
beginning<00:01:14.229> with<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.740> Inter's<00:01:15.159> with<00:01:15.490> lot<00:01:15.640> of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
sponsor win the Filipinos I think so I

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.130 
sponsor win the Filipinos I think so I
really<00:01:42.579> definitely<00:01:42.909> think<00:01:43.329> so<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.540> mean<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.930> was

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
really definitely think so I mean I was

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.440 
really definitely think so I mean I was
catching<00:01:44.500> Fernando<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.790> was<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.090> end<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.299> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
catching Fernando so was the end of the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.350 
catching Fernando so was the end of the
race<00:01:47.049> I<00:01:47.290> knew<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.560> had<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.950> go<00:01:48.670> get<00:01:48.850> him<00:01:49.149> soon

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
race I knew I had to go get him soon

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.770 
race I knew I had to go get him soon
because<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:51.000> sectors<00:01:52.000> with<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.390> high<00:01:52.540> speed

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
because all sectors with the high speed

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
because all sectors with the high speed
I<00:01:52.840> was<00:01:52.990> losing<00:01:53.350> already<00:01:53.890> my<00:01:54.280> front<00:01:54.549> tires

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.650 

decide<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.729> completely<00:02:09.120> weight<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.600> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
decide it was completely weight and I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.460 
decide it was completely weight and I
was<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.920> wind<00:02:11.520> probably<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:13.050> was<00:02:13.230> very

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
was the wind probably it was very

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.110 
was the wind probably it was very

the goal was to not to lose many points
with<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.700> leaders<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.150> think<00:04:00.540> we<00:04:00.870> did<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.110> job

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
with the leaders I think we did the job

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.440 
with the leaders I think we did the job
and<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> track<00:04:01.860> site<00:04:02.070> as<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.370> said<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.850> we

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
and the track site as I said and we

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.050 
and the track site as I said and we
didn't<00:04:03.720> lose<00:04:03.900> maybe<00:04:04.890> any<00:04:05.190> point<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
didn't lose maybe any point to to the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.380 
didn't lose maybe any point to to the
leaders<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:07.350> this<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.739> positive

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390
