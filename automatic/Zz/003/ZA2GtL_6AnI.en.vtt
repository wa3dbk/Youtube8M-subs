00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.710
Hello everyone, I’m Jakesteramma with BroCo
Gaming.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.180
I’m going to show you how I farm Doc Mercy.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.910
We’ll be going after Doc Mercy’s only
prize, the Infinity Pistol.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.380
The Infinity pistol is certainly not something
you’d be using for damage purposes but it

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.450
can still come in handy in certain situations.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.250
In order to farm Doc Mercy, you’ll need
to complete and turn in the mission “Medical

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.080
Mystery” that you get from Dr. Zed in Sanctuary.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.500
Now that we’ve turned in the mission, let’s
head to Three Horns Valley and take him out.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.770
Since we’re farming, we’ll want to take
him out as quick as possible.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.700
So I’m going to use the geyser to quickly
get to him.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.350
You’ll want to wait until the geyser has
gone off and quick run up to the geyser and

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.930
look down.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.820
You want to position yourself directly over
this spot.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.210
Next, wait until the geyser goes off and as
soon as it does run forward and aim for this

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.890
spot on the wall.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.000
If you don’t push forward soon enough, you
won’t reach this spot and you’ll fall

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
down.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.390
As soon as you’re up here, I like to take
a lobbed singularity grenade like a Quasar

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.180
and place it right here on the jawbone.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.150
Most of the time, this will pull Doc Mercy
off the ramp and it’ll expose his back to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.470
you allowing you to do a lot of damage without
his shield in the way because that shield

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.290
is frickin annoying.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.220
Make sure get him slagged and then take him
out.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.180
If you’re using Maya, you have the added
ability to phase lock him either before or

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.650
after you use the grenade if you even use
the grenade.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.430
With Axton, you can distract him with your
turrets and Zero can deception and Kunai for

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.430
added damage.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.720
And if you ever find yourself in Fight for
Your Life when battling Doc Mercy, it’s

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.790
a good idea to have a Nukem with you.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.310
You can shoot a round over the edge and hopefully
you’ll kill a Skag for Second Wind.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.619
After you kill Doc Mercy, make sure you thoroughly
check the area for the Infinity.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.940
Doc Mercy tends to fling his loot all over
the place and there are a lot of nooks and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.570
crannies where weapons can hide.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.409
And finally, the last thing to do after killing
Doc Mercy, is go back to where the Skags are

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.579
and check for Tubby Skags.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.739
Every once in a while you’ll find one and
you can score some sweet loot from them.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.950
Doc will drop normal versions of the pistol
and elemental versions except for slag.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.159
This is definitely not a powerful pistol but
it can do some decent damage when it’s combined

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.010
with The Bee Shield, the Sheriff’s Badge
Relic, and the right class mod and skill tree

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.219
to increase gun damage and fire rate as much
as possible.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.319
Also, it’s the best to have a fire rate
of at least 9.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.329
Now one of the best uses for the Infinity
is to conserve ammo during extensive battles

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.519
such as farming Vermivorous.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.569
It works great for agitating Varkids while
leveling them up.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.180
If you want to see how my bro Oxmonkey does
that, just click this link for his Farming

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.739
Vermivorous video.

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.040
It’s also useful when farming Voracidous
with the under the arena glitch.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.779
So that’s how I farm Doc Mercy and use the
Infinty Pistol.

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.459
Thanks for watching everyone!
