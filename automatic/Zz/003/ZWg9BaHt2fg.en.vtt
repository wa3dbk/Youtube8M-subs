00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
broken and I was doing some research the

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.980 
broken and I was doing some research the
other<00:00:20.860> day<00:00:21.100> on<00:00:21.280> on<00:00:21.520> muscles<00:00:22.180> the<00:00:22.450> way<00:00:22.600> that<00:00:22.840> you

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
other day on on muscles the way that you

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.160 
other day on on muscles the way that you
build<00:00:23.260> more<00:00:23.980> muscle<00:00:24.010> in<00:00:24.610> that<00:00:25.330> research<00:00:25.600> I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
build more muscle in that research I

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.090 
build more muscle in that research I
found<00:00:26.500> that<00:00:27.250> a<00:00:27.760> lot<00:00:28.060> of<00:00:28.090> doctors<00:00:28.570> proved<00:00:29.200> that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
found that a lot of doctors proved that

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.910 
found that a lot of doctors proved that
in<00:00:30.400> order<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:30.910> grow<00:00:31.180> a<00:00:31.210> muscle<00:00:31.720> that<00:00:31.960> muscle

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
in order to grow a muscle that muscle

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.400 
in order to grow a muscle that muscle
must<00:00:33.129> first<00:00:33.399> be<00:00:33.610> broken<00:00:34.239> down<00:00:34.270> as<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:34.719> matter<00:00:35.260> of

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
must first be broken down as a matter of

must first be broken down as a matter of
fact<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.579> exact<00:00:37.000> verbiage<00:00:37.450> was<00:00:37.510> your<00:00:38.079> muscles

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
fact the exact verbiage was your muscles

experienced<00:00:39.190> trauma<00:00:40.120> in<00:00:40.600> order<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.739> build<00:00:41.950> and

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
experienced trauma in order to build and

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.810 
experienced trauma in order to build and
grow<00:00:42.960> that's<00:00:43.960> what<00:00:44.260> makes<00:00:44.470> you<00:00:44.649> sore<00:00:45.010> after

that's what makes you store after your
