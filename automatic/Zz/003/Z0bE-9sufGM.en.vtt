another<00:02:36.080> topic<00:02:37.450> personally<00:02:38.450> honestly<00:02:39.290> I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
another topic personally honestly I

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.430 
another topic personally honestly I
think<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:40.070> cog<00:02:40.460> is<00:02:40.960> ok<00:02:42.190> for<00:02:43.190> Wii<00:02:43.310> Remote<00:02:43.610> players

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
think a cog is ok for Wii Remote players

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.430 
think a cog is ok for Wii Remote players
for<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.090> zooming<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.960> with<00:02:48.200> Wii

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
for the for the zooming in with Wii

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.130 
for the for the zooming in with Wii
Remote<00:02:48.740> like<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:49.850> soon<00:02:50.240> as<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.480> zoom<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.870> then

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
Remote like as soon as you zoom in then

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.470 
Remote like as soon as you zoom in then
that<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.890> as<00:02:52.460> soon<00:02:52.670> as<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.880> move<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.300> wii

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
that like as soon as you move the wii

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.990 
that like as soon as you move the wii
nunchuk<00:02:54.410> or<00:02:54.650> not<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.250> nunchuck<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.880> wii

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
nunchuk or not the nunchuck but the wii

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.890 
nunchuk or not the nunchuck but the wii
remote<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:56.750> just<00:02:57.020> goes<00:02:57.170> crazy<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:58.720> that's<00:02:59.720> why

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
remote it just goes crazy and that's why

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.620 
remote it just goes crazy and that's why
i<00:02:59.930> think<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.320> cog<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.710> ok<00:03:01.070> for<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.490> because<00:03:02.420> you

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
i think a cog is ok for it because you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.150 
i think a cog is ok for it because you
can<00:03:02.780> see<00:03:02.960> pretty<00:03:03.140> much<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.410> lot<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.920> it's

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
can see pretty much a lot and it's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.150 
can see pretty much a lot and it's
basically<00:03:04.670> just<00:03:04.790> straight<00:03:05.270> up<00:03:05.300> aiming<00:03:06.160> but

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
basically just straight up aiming but

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.490 
basically just straight up aiming but
with<00:03:07.460> wii<00:03:07.730> remote<00:03:08.060> or<00:03:08.270> not<00:03:08.540> not<00:03:08.840> we<00:03:08.960> remote<00:03:09.230> say

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500

changed<00:04:09.530> my<00:04:09.620> killstreaks<00:04:09.860> from<00:04:10.430> one<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:11.510> the

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
changed my killstreaks from one of the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.890 
changed my killstreaks from one of the
other<00:04:11.780> copy<00:04:12.170> cat<00:04:12.530> games<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.450> was<00:04:14.570> I<00:04:14.690> was<00:04:14.810> a

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
other copy cat games so that was I was a

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.130 
other copy cat games so that was I was a
total<00:04:15.050> accident<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:17.630> would<00:04:17.720> have<00:04:17.810> been<00:04:17.840> I

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
total accident it would have been I

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.330 
total accident it would have been I
think<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.530> would<00:04:18.620> have<00:04:18.650> been<00:04:18.770> a<00:04:18.830> lot<00:04:18.890> nicer

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340
