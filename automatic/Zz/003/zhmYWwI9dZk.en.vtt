can put water into what you do is create
a<00:00:40.920> small<00:00:41.550> fire<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.090> base<00:00:42.950> drop<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.130> on<00:00:44.250> top

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
a small fire in the base drop it on top

a small fire in the base drop it on top
of<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.790> and<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> chimney

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
of that and what you get is a chimney

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.930 
of that and what you get is a chimney
effect<00:00:46.140> coming<00:00:47.100> through<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
effect coming through you can see the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180 
effect coming through you can see the
flames<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.480> beginning<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.890> flick<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.040> of

flames just beginning to flick out of
the<00:00:50.280> top<00:00:50.490> there<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.660> get<00:00:51.810> the<00:00:51.900> heat<00:00:52.080> that's

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
the top there so you get the heat that's

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.640 
the top there so you get the heat that's
rising<00:00:52.560> and<00:00:53.400> also<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.970> smoke<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.450> rises

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
heating the outer skin which your waters

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.450 
heating the outer skin which your waters
in<00:00:59.030> you<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.210> drop<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.830> bits<00:01:01.830> of<00:01:02.010> twigs<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
in you just drop down bits of twigs and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that they're very easy to use in a in a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.020 
that they're very easy to use in a in a
storm<00:01:19.440> because<00:01:20.130> you've<00:01:20.430> got<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.670> kind<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
storm because you've got that kind of

storm because you've got that kind of
protection<00:01:21.570> around<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.080> your<00:01:22.380> fire<00:01:22.850> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
protection around you your fire the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
protection around you your fire the
chimney<00:01:24.210> effect<00:01:24.300> draws<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.960> heat<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.350> through

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
chimney effect draws the heat up through

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.600 
chimney effect draws the heat up through
it<00:01:25.800> so<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.220> very<00:01:26.990> effective<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.500> needs<00:01:29.490> very

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it so it's very effective and needs very

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.780 
it so it's very effective and needs very
little<00:01:30.090> fuel<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.170> actually<00:01:31.530> keep<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.920> keep<00:01:32.610> it
