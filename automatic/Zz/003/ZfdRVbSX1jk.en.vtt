master minute repeater this is an

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.230 
master minute repeater this is an
amazing<00:00:07.440> minute<00:00:08.309> repeater<00:00:08.580> it's<00:00:08.880> one<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.179> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
amazing minute repeater it's one of the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.000 
amazing minute repeater it's one of the
nicest<00:00:09.809> ones<00:00:09.900> I've<00:00:10.230> ever<00:00:10.260> seen<00:00:10.710> I'm<00:00:10.860> just

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
nicest ones I've ever seen I'm just

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.060 
nicest ones I've ever seen I'm just
going<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.190> activate<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.480> can<00:00:12.630> see

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
going to activate it here so you can see

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.850 
going to activate it here so you can see
just<00:00:14.070> how<00:00:14.219> amazing<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.269> sounds

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:36.300 

[Music]

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.670 

you<00:00:36.850> can<00:00:36.970> see<00:00:37.150> that<00:00:37.300> while<00:00:37.450> the<00:00:37.690> watch<00:00:38.320> was<00:00:38.560> on

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
you can see that while the watch was on

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.500 
you can see that while the watch was on
this<00:00:38.800> wooden<00:00:39.190> table<00:00:39.430> here<00:00:39.820> there<00:00:40.210> was<00:00:40.300> a<00:00:40.330> lot

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
this wooden table here there was a lot

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.750 
this wooden table here there was a lot
more<00:00:40.540> resonance<00:00:41.170> but<00:00:41.350> alone<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:42.310> watch<00:00:42.520> is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
more resonance but alone the watch is

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.000 
more resonance but alone the watch is
rated<00:00:43.120> to<00:00:43.240> something<00:00:43.570> like<00:00:43.690> over<00:00:43.930> 60<00:00:44.470> decibels

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
rated to something like over 60 decibels

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.280 
rated to something like over 60 decibels
which<00:00:45.220> is<00:00:45.400> actually<00:00:46.120> quite<00:00:46.330> loud<00:00:46.660> for<00:00:47.260> a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
which is actually quite loud for a

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.080 
which is actually quite loud for a
minute<00:00:47.560> repeater<00:00:47.740> watch<00:00:48.040> on<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.430> dial<00:00:48.730> you

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
minute repeater watch on the dial you

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.790 
minute repeater watch on the dial you
have<00:00:49.450> something<00:00:49.720> interesting<00:00:49.870> here<00:00:50.410> you<00:00:50.710> have

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
have something interesting here you have

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.050 
have something interesting here you have
these<00:00:50.890> two<00:00:51.160> hands<00:00:51.430> here<00:00:51.640> these<00:00:51.790> have<00:00:51.910> nothing

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
these two hands here these have nothing

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.160 
these two hands here these have nothing
to<00:00:52.240> do<00:00:52.330> with<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.510> minute<00:00:52.720> repeater<00:00:52.900> their

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
to do with the minute repeater their

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.280 
to do with the minute repeater their
special<00:00:53.670> functions<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:54.820> you<00:00:54.880> see<00:00:55.290> almost

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
special functions that you see almost

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.690 
special functions that you see almost
never<00:00:56.650> in<00:00:56.830> these<00:00:56.950> watches<00:00:57.370> when<00:00:57.490> does<00:00:57.610> the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
never in these watches when does the

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.890 
never in these watches when does the
power<00:00:57.910> is<00:00:58.030> herb<00:00:58.180> indicator<00:00:58.510> which<00:00:58.690> is<00:00:58.780> not

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
power is herb indicator which is not

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.620 
power is herb indicator which is not
that<00:00:59.440> uncommon<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.880> course<00:01:01.150> and<00:01:01.360> then<00:01:01.600> you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
that uncommon of course and then you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.270 
that uncommon of course and then you
have<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:01.870> torque<00:01:02.260> indicator<00:01:02.800> usually<00:01:03.160> have

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
have a torque indicator usually have

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.680 
have a torque indicator usually have
like<00:01:03.400> sport<00:01:03.910> watches<00:01:04.089> have<00:01:04.420> torque

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
like sport watches have torque

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.240 
like sport watches have torque
indicators<00:01:05.170> this<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.710> very<00:01:05.920> interesting

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
indicators this is a very interesting

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.520 
indicators this is a very interesting
type<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.810> mechanism<00:01:07.810> really<00:01:07.930> for<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.290> gear

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
type of mechanism really for the gear

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.280 
type of mechanism really for the gear
heads<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:10.150> you<00:01:10.240> can<00:01:10.390> tell<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:10.660> the<00:01:10.840> torque<00:01:11.140> is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
heads and you can tell you the torque is

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.719 
heads and you can tell you the torque is
all<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.560> way<00:01:11.710> up<00:01:11.860> and<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.100> power<00:01:12.280> serve<00:01:12.610> is

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
all the way up and the power serve is

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.430 
all the way up and the power serve is
all<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.970> way<00:01:13.060> up<00:01:13.180> but<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:13.690> torque<00:01:13.930> indicator

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
all the way up but the torque indicator

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.280 
all the way up but the torque indicator
does<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:15.220> tell<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.000> how<00:01:16.030> much<00:01:16.390> power<00:01:16.780> is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
does is tell you how much power is

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.890 
does is tell you how much power is
coming<00:01:18.100> from<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.610> movement<00:01:18.880> at<00:01:19.270> any<00:01:19.630> given

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
coming from the movement at any given

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.140 
coming from the movement at any given
time<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.500> when<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.010> torque<00:01:21.340> is<00:01:21.550> all<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:22.030> way

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
time so when the torque is all the way

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.090 
time so when the torque is all the way
up<00:01:22.330> theoretically<00:01:23.050> speaking<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.680> mainspring

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
up theoretically speaking the mainspring

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.740 
up theoretically speaking the mainspring
is<00:01:24.280> pushing<00:01:24.670> more<00:01:24.850> power<00:01:25.119> out<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.570> it's<00:01:25.660> all

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
is pushing more power out and it's all

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.870 
is pushing more power out and it's all
the<00:01:25.810> way<00:01:25.900> down<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.740> less<00:01:26.950> power<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:27.490> want

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
the way down it's less power you want

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.910 
the way down it's less power you want
the<00:01:28.030> torque<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.479> be<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.869> middle<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.560> using

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
the torque to be in the middle so using

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.210 
the torque to be in the middle so using
the<00:01:30.040> torque<00:01:30.310> indicator<00:01:30.759> as<00:01:31.440> well<00:01:32.440> as<00:01:32.680> the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
the torque indicator as well as the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.749 
the torque indicator as well as the
powers<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.790> indicator<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:34.810> can<00:01:35.110> basically

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
powers of indicator you can basically

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.249 
powers of indicator you can basically
make<00:01:36.759> sure<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.330> watch<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.810> running<00:01:37.990> at

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
make sure that the watch is running at

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.919 
make sure that the watch is running at
its<00:01:38.320> most<00:01:38.560> accurate<00:01:39.190> and<00:01:39.369> that's<00:01:40.060> again<00:01:40.899> a

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
its most accurate and that's again a

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.660 
its most accurate and that's again a
super<00:01:41.350> kind<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.679> watching<00:01:42.070> our<00:01:42.160> type<00:01:42.340> of<00:01:42.369> thing

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
super kind of watching our type of thing

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.219 
super kind of watching our type of thing
but<00:01:42.789> is<00:01:42.970> is<00:01:43.300> very<00:01:43.479> very<00:01:43.720> cool<00:01:43.840> so<00:01:43.929> you<00:01:43.990> can<00:01:44.080> see

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
but is is very very cool so you can see

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.900 
but is is very very cool so you can see
here<00:01:44.350> as<00:01:44.410> I'm<00:01:44.530> turning<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.860> crown<00:01:45.100> because

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
here as I'm turning the crown because

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.820 
here as I'm turning the crown because
it's<00:01:46.179> disengaging<00:01:46.869> part<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.289> you<00:01:47.590> can<00:01:47.710> see

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
it's disengaging part of it you can see

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.620 
it's disengaging part of it you can see
the<00:01:47.950> torque<00:01:48.190> indicator<00:01:48.610> moving<00:01:49.240> up<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.479> down

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
the torque indicator moving up and down

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.540 
the torque indicator moving up and down
like<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:50.020> very<00:01:50.440> very<00:01:50.590> cool<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.220> rear<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.460> the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
like that very very cool the rear of the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.600 
like that very very cool the rear of the
watch<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:52.030> very<00:01:52.780> very<00:01:52.990> beautiful<00:01:53.259> but<00:01:54.250> since

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
watch is very very beautiful but since
