00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.880
 sony offers a new milestone in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.110
 the digital photography sees the alpha 7 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.630
 at first glance like one 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.710
 classic max system camera me too 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.570
 the novum 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.430
 that is behind the objective that is 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.050
 namely this enormous image sensor 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.300
 We are talking about a buyer's market here 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.760
 bild sensor and so far has been found 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.990
 such only in professional 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.240
 mirror cameras know the whole 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.090
 now from nicole and guido model from 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.850
 sony gave a mirrorless system camera 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.770
 it such a big sensor still in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.140
 sony does not just offer a new model 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.190
 even two new models we have the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.379
 alpha 7 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.140
 which offers 24 megapixels on this 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.690
 Big sensor will be the alpha 7R this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.329
 something more expensive but also offers 36 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.300
 megapixel at the same sensor size and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.770
 also dispenses with the low-pass filter 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.690
 the remaining details and almost all 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.649
 we're going to go from one very same here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.840
 lightweight housing 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.719
 it's just over 400 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.969
 gram heavy is very handy and that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.840
 is by this concept also very good 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.600
 to keep 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.970
 At the objective ballet sony sat up 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 the e mount we already know from max 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.470
 system cameras and so a little bit 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.770
 confusing because sony calls these 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.920
 So cameras alfalfa because I saw what 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.110
 we can from the nlv 57 or simply 990 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.790
 but there we see each other objectively 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.650
 connect with these objectives here 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.270
 adjust there is an adapter of the cost 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.329
 between three and four euros 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.970
 or there are new ones specifically 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.280
 Full format and mount brings to the start 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.189
 sony five lenses out more 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.490
 should follow the roadmap says for 2014 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.790
 A total of 10 objectives by 2015, it should 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.229
 then 15 lenses are on Berlin 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.770
 The camera offers elements 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.390
 everything I want from a high quality 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.710
 professional camera to use I am waiting 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.930
 I have a robust housing 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.729
 made of a magnesium alloy and me 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.070
 have enough controls and 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.140
 distributed around and even upended 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.719
 grip is available that is the set 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.399
 I have one in here then one 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.079
 alternative attacked the camera to 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.500
 to keep this format and easy 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.000
 better shoot in front of three photos 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.340
 In total, there are nine of the controls 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.670
 individually configurable including 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.830
 the three racing wheels 14 in front another 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.810
 up here and a third one 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.530
 at the same time as daring navigations 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.900
 techteam at the display sets sony on 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.090
 folding screen goes 45 degrees 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.770
 down 90 degrees to the top 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.630
 there is a sharp and clear 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.290
 presentation as missing is the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.760
 touchscreen 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.410
 then staying times further consumer the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.850
 Stock reserved and not the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.370
 especially expensive devices 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.620
 next to the display we have a finder 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.989
 then replaced as well as on oled technology 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.239
 and a model like we already know from the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.270
 alpha 99 knows who over two million 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.340
 picture points and we have even better ones 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.550
 Contrast extent which the visitors 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.830
 use then fall on yourself 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.110
 movement he moves only slightly and he 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.540
 provides a very sharp picture overall 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.440
 So a successful combination of the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.690
 Use under difficult 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.890
 light conditions with the viewfinder so 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.730
 under other conditions with the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.350
 display allowed when using autofocus 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.110
 as well as classical contrast 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.600
 autofocus and the other at the alpha 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.940
 7 on live autofocus points 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.489
 these points are in the picture 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.320
 sensor are 117 in the number at the 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.430
 alpha 7 does not yield that 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.840
 saved in favor of a better one 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.799
 Image quality of 36 megapixels 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.950
 sony promises a very fast 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.019
 autofocus 35 faster than once again 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.580
 with conventional next system cameras 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.320
 and then I have to do a first test 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.870
 shown that is indeed the case 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.420
 autofocus is really fast 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.480
 sharp motive and with it I can too 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.799
 take snapshots with the camera 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.720
 only on the professional photographers 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.430
 Always toni still not be a 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.680
 mode dial while I on the one hand 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.090
 classic part manual manual 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.860
 program off but I can also contact the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.680
 go green mode or make the camera 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.660
 all attitude by yourself for the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.730
 I do not have a classic extension 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.310
 photo accessory shoe but the multi 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.680
 sony created the limited edition interface 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.420
 a number compatible devices but 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.640
 I should be quite extensive 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.799
 for example, there are repertoire to offer 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.200
 It also has a microphone adapter for XLR 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.790
 microphones from profi company one 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.760
 enlarged screen without flash light 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.010
 very exciting is the hdmi exit in 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.390
 this side over the hdmi-exit 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.040
 Finally, of course, a television 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.110
 and I am already in possession of one 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.630
 this very modern 4k tv for 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.460
 Ultra sharp presentation then I can 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.290
 via this interface also photos in 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.820
 give four chaos and have on the 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.850
 tv then the full quality for 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.850
 disposal 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.290
 for videos, it does not work 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.870
 camera films quite regularly in 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.940
 but full-hd-resolution at least with 60 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.790
 Full frame per second and that takes care of 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.170
 for a smooth motion presentation 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.060
 under the dash can be said sony 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.920
 revolutionizes digital photography 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.590
 far were goods full format sensor 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.790
 so far professional 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.250
 there are now mirror reflex cameras over there 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.600
 first a dslr with the big sensor 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.350
 that alone is a small one 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.720
 sensation 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.120
 to this comes the price which simply gives 7 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.480
 it already for 1500 euro if without 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.360
 objectively and thus undercuts sony dslr 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.370
 competition for several hundred euros in 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.610
 question comes the alpha 7 or even the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.110
 alfa 75 for weight-conscious photo 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.720
 let the body get a bit far 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.190
 small lenses this of course 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.010
 limited by the system itself 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.720
 stay a little bigger but the most special 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.000
 wants to be light and compact on the go 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.190
 to advantage modern mirrorless 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.230
 system cameras wants to use it on 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.700
 any case a potential buyer of 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.700
 alpha 7 or the liger r
