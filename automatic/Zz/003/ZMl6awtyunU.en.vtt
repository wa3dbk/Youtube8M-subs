00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.890
 good morning nuts and screws has 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.019
 ended the crisis and we do not know 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.330
 we have come to fuencarral a street nothing 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.169
 consumerist to see how they see them in the end 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.429
 of the tunnel 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.959
 I have great news to give guys 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.959
 we have come out of the crisis 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.000
 because I do not see that people have work 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.370
 There is no recovery I can not believe 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.190
 without work a recovery is already 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 because you do not believe because it is impossible 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.400
 before editions it's over that 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.810
 It is over and that a lie is over 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.280
 you go to take the opposite to the 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.900
 government and the media 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.740
 what I see on the street expressed on 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.740
 world without curro is 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.280
 although not if it says in the newspapers 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.540
 because they are misinformed I think that the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.040
 crisis you're talking about is a lot 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.110
 more conceptual and is based on a 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.520
 personal perception I think everything 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.400
 it's still in fact I think it's worse 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.120
 I promise seriously is not because of 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.910
 be a little disconnected from the world 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.020
 how that what a lie is all false I hope 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.780
 that you rely on to say that in which I am 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.060
 I of the attacked good I think that not 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.070
 because it 's a fictional thing I think that 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.930
 it does not even exist as such tell me that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.670
 as the crisis needs as such that 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.530
 you're throwing all the ground 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.540
 argumentario of the last years if not 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.550
 is that the other day ideal to this to which 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.740
 he was former president of cantabria and the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.930
 same says and says look is the pasiego 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.690
 has the cows has the river has everything 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.310
 and there the crisis does not exist if the premium of 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.460
 risks are on the floor as not 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.570
 you're going to notice the people on the street it shows 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.850
 I think something has noticed if I go out 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.830
 he invited people to drinks of all good 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.290
 not during all these years of government 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.140
 the government has done you cut it 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.060
 health has been reduced, health has 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.920
 reduced a public education that has 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.660
 reduced that you go out to the street has 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.060
 reduced the reproductive right of the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:06.220
 woman are measures for us a 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.350
 whole party is we have crisis I 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.060
 I think we are involuting in fact 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.190
 what you have to do is next year 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.300
 When there are elections, people who go 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.300
 to vote and all these people 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.230
 but you think that like all 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.620
 young people right now they have to emigrate and 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.160
 we are less or more we play more already but 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.410
 the sites hire fewer people and 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.970
 they pay salaries that are at least yes 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.920
 I've thought about it but now with the law of 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.460
 that if you spend three months out 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.160
 remove 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.020
 healing if they take all that away if it 's 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.340
 who wants to get it right let's see what 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.600
 are you telling me that these measures are 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.150
 a disaster that the government is 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.740
 doing badly if practically what 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.840
 has been doing for two years now 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.340
 everything is going worse Spain is going backwards in 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.690
 instead of forward we are not 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.730
 talking about the crisis is that what I 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.350
 you're saying there are people who are never 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.500
 in crisis is a woman are going out 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.080
 us not us no no 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.880
 thank you very much reddish to some 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.130
 clueless keep thinking that the crisis 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.140
 it is a spiritual state remain 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.190
