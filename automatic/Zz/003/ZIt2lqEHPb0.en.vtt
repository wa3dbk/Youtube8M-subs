00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
pretty simple equation but we don't

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.700 
pretty simple equation but we don't
always<00:01:17.670> realize<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.480> I'm<00:01:19.020> talking<00:01:19.620> about

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
always realize it I'm talking about

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.130

do-it-yourself<00:01:20.520> culture<00:01:20.940> these<00:01:21.480> workshops<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
do-it-yourself culture these workshops I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.010

think<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.520> good<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:24.390> pathways

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
think are really really good at pathways

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.960 
think are really really good at pathways
for<00:01:26.010> kids<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.340> learn<00:01:26.370> how<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> disempower

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
themselves in an essence nothing's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.710 
themselves in an essence nothing's
really<00:01:29.280> changed<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.180> getting<00:01:30.420> bigger

I'm super impressed by it we do these

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.430 
I'm super impressed by it we do these
but<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:56.520> battles<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:56.970> more<00:01:57.150> of<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:58.260> of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
but the battles is more of a way of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.859 
but the battles is more of a way of
young<00:01:58.950> artists<00:01:59.250> coming<00:01:59.520> together<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.150> just

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
young artists coming together and just

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.640 
young artists coming together and just

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.740 

I<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:06.220> that's<00:02:06.340> important<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:07.000> help<00:02:07.360> develop

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
I think that's important to help develop

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.590 
I think that's important to help develop
and<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:08.350> know<00:02:08.470> grow<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.550> confidence<00:02:10.030> at

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
and you know grow the confidence at

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.960 
and you know grow the confidence at
younger<00:02:11.230> age<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.680> try<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.160> push<00:02:12.400> them<00:02:12.610> on

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
younger age and try and push them on
