there's a hole in the bottom of the cup
but<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> key<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.580> making<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.360> work

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
but the key to making all of this work

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.920 
but the key to making all of this work
is<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.680> simple<00:01:08.670> magnet<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.659> when<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
is with this a simple magnet so when you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
is with this a simple magnet so when you
put<00:01:10.140> put<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.409> cup<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:12.030> magnet<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
put put the cup on here the magnet is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.450 
put put the cup on here the magnet is
suspended<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> liquid<00:01:13.890> comes<00:01:14.280> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
suspended and then the liquid comes in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
suspended and then the liquid comes in
and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> write<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> liquid<00:01:16.080> comes<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and then you write the liquid comes in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.679 
and then you write the liquid comes in
from<00:01:16.830> from<00:01:17.369> around<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.240> holes<00:01:18.450> are

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
from from around the holes are

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.300 
from from around the holes are
underneath<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> magnet<00:01:19.560> once<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> beer<00:01:20.280> is

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
underneath the magnet once the beer is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.730 
underneath the magnet once the beer is
filled<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.180> grab<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> cup<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> magnet
