 Y 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.730
 Sunday afternoon fortunately not 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.869
 there were lots of wind gusts but it was 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.850
 taking strength due to the great 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.600
 fuel that exist within what 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.279
 is the mountain and in a few hours it was seen that 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.840
 was uncontrollable with the media 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.480
 terrestrial above all by the orography 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.960
 also so strong that we have in this 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.960
 part of the island 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.550
 the actions with the helicopters do not 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.200
 were enough to stifle a 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.379
 fire that already on Monday had 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.690
 practically 15 kilometers in front and 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.710
 that devastated practically everything 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.840
 that he found in his path 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.300
 Manuel fumero mayor of the small 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.769
 Tenerife's usually vilaflor 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.900
 walk through the burned lands that 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.350
 surround a this beautiful town located 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.989
 to the skirts of the teide 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.729
 the afternoon of July 15 , 2012 will be 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.940
 remembered for a long time in the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.250
 municipality 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.950
 a terrible forest fire that 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.840
 untied that day forced one of the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.960
 more audacious interventions of the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.000
 aircraft that make up the 43rd group of 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.130
 army of the air the fire arrived 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.600
 practically 150 meters from the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.240
 housing is more there is a hotel a hotel 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.620
 rural four stars of great level the 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.800
 municipality that had a bottle of 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.780
 propane with ten thousand liters of propane 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.100
 the wave is passive from that bottle if 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.690
 comes to explode fortunately it was not 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.550
 so alive would it have ended then with everything 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.650
 the municipality because it surrounds them to the hotel 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.090
 fortunately as I say it did not arrive 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.040
 we had to evacuate the town by 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.390
 first time in the history of this 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.980
 municipality 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.050
 here the fire left patent again 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.159
 the ability of our devices in the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.189
 fight against fire 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.109
 the yellow rooms of our c-415 are 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.060
 they became the best reference for 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.560
 put an end to the hell that had 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.329
 result in those places 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.860
 when we see it appear we live the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.409
 effect that they had on fire when 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.540
 the fire came to the summits and as 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.819
 they attacked in a coordinated way the three 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.560
 seaplanes that were acting then 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.300
 we begin to see light at the end of the tunnel and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.410
 we started to see that it was possible 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.120
 control the fire because we already know 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.209
 was approaching in an imminent way 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.860
 to the helmet of the municipality the hard and 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.510
 heroic work of those seaplanes 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.880
 during those three interminable days 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.280
 managed to save a good part of the mass 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.170
 vilaflor manuel forest does not save 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.090
 words to express the gratitude of 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.069
 a whole town that watches hopefully 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.650
 the green shoots that re-emerge 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.870
 between these calcined woods a 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.630
 message of gratitude and also of 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.160
 approach so that they are thus 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.860
 they also happy with the performance 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.540
 that without proud of their work because 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.349
 our earth we are also proud 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.170
 of the professionals that we have 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.810
 financed his career and it was one more job 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.459

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.489
 Army of the outdoors against the people 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.110
 and yet each mission is unique as 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.610
 unique are the stories of their 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.530
 protagonists that we will continue 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.530
