00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.990
 when you talk to Jonathan what 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.710
 I feel is shy 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:17.340
 but when you hear him sing he has a 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.560
 incredible security is a great singer 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.200
 he has prepared us a theme of gilberto 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.270
 santarrosa live without her does not sing in the 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.840
 scene of the voice Mr. Jonathan 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.840
 ruiz 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.930
 that is, aimlessly take refuge as 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.640
 child 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.870
 in the arms of loneliness 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.850
 you come back and they are delirious 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.859
 we like a contrast 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.859
 already in the house I do not want to arrive 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.759
 in the hands full of her 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.990
 to your hips 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:13.659
 she is not 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:18.850
 how to sit and watch stars play under 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.570
 a new one through the window 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.290
 what if 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.290
 is this decade the water that body 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.890
 loneliness 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.890
 and follow 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:41.430
 on this side 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.430
 lets start 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.670
 this 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.800
 is to want to fly 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:58.050
 to where it is already 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:04.360
 it's like having your hands full of it 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:09.179
 she lists her careers and she was not 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:14.780
 how to sit to defoliate stars 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:21.430
 the new moon through the summer 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.430
 if I wanted to be chained to that port 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.170
 to loneliness 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.790
 from low 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.790
 to think 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.550
 she 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.129
 yes Mr. Jonathan Sanchez is to live without 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.629

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.040
 but I could sleep in sanchez ruiz 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.989

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.340
 actually we are used to 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.299
 listen to gilberto santarrosa but I think 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.120

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.640
