 Drinking milk and doing something like this 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:28.820
 It's like eating something like that on gold . 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.660
 Recommended foods Buddha is a little bit different in the United States, Korea and each country. 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.820
 different 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:39.920
 It can now be handled by the environment or the ethnic constitution 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:44.239
 However, the food composition of the United States 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.390
 Places like eight times in Korea, I get a lot of preparation is the difference 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.250
 So I 'm going to go to the ball. 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.690
 The big doctors group called the society of the responsible pc of the pc ram 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.820
 In there you can 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.930
 Control the food composition 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:05.930

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.540
 I came to see if I could be affected 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:27.050
 In 2011, the Department of Agriculture announced that the food composition 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:33.080
 Very similar to crm, saponin is cut 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:38.000
 There is a minimum of sharing and is called protein protein instead of beans 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.800
 Meat, fish, beans, and so on. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.990
 It's supposed to eat 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.149
 There is what we want our milk and usually is in the essential nutrients we 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.979
 I am missing you as an option 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:55.429
 And that's why we have to drink water from the exhibition hall . 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.940
 So, with the claims of pc a 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:04.549
 Oh, very much like him insist on foreign mubo 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:07.180
 Well 2010s balpyojang look at the announcement of our nutrition Korea architecture 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.180
 Shared 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.540
 Two- fifths are very much and then there is a minimum and work and then 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.239
 Meatless Win 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:24.180
 So beans , protein is put into the resurrection, 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:29.160
 More specifically, and that is followed by an explicit 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.850
 The oil is minimized and the next day the milk is now just doing otherwise 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.390
 It's 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:38.640
 There's something you've done, from there to another 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.959
 Very low to high fat but nutrients that weigh so much 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.220
 There is 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.260
 So , the composition of the food announced in the United States, 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.410
 I have a hard time . 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.310
 Of course, because that is the only research experts implying jegakgak 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:59.860
 Everything is child care 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:05.790
 It is different but because he insisted on both the bars that wonak 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.790
