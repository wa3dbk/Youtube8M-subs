00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.960
 This video explains how to set up your printer to 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.480
 Use ePrint services on your printer or the HP ePrintCenter. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.600
 ePrint is a free service that allows you 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.080
 documents and photos 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.440
 print from any mobile or network connected device 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.800
 to your HP printer with ePrint. 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.880
 In this step we show you how to enable web services. 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.200
 Web services must be enabled on your HP printer 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.320
 to use the ePrint service. 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.240
 Before you can enable web services, 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.560
 your printer must be connected to the internet 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.520
 via a wireless or non-wireless network connection. 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.600
 Because connecting your printer to a network one 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.640
 unique action for your system configuration, 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.840
 we will not give these instructions here. 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.040
 On the printer control panel 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.800
 press the Web Services icon. 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.080
 Select Settings. 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.520
 Press Enable Web Services. 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.120
 Press Accept to view the terms of use 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.880
 to accept and enable web services. 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.040
 Now the printer will check for available 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.200
 product updates for your printer. 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.800
 If there is a product update, 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680
 you must first perform that update to be sure 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.440
 that your printer is equipped with the latest functionalities. 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.270
 Select Yes to install the update if one is available. 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.160
 After your printer has applied all product updates, 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.000
 an info page is printed. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.680
 The info page contains the printer code that you need 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.400
 to register your printer with HP ePrintCenter. 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.280
 The final step is registration with HP ePrintCenter. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.400

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.240

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.760
 you will be asked to choose a different screen name. 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.800
