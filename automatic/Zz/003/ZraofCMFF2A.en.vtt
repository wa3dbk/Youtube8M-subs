 No 4.0.2 and it is very fluid thanks to 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.040
 your processor let's try a game 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.580
 which it is the temple room we will 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.580

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.770
 shocking on that phone 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:40.099
 with this version you can grab the rial 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.159
 francine 3 but how does he get a lot of memory 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.709
 I do not have enough I do not put it on 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.880

 web browsing is more good since 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.700

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.710
 the navigation that we can obtain and its 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.360
 processor of a gigahertz and so good
