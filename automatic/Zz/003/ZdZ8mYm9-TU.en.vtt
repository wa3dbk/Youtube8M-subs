the human so it's kind of strange I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.010 
the human so it's kind of strange I
can't<00:01:15.329> switch<00:01:15.630> back<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:15.929> the<00:01:16.140> humans<00:01:17.840> there<00:01:18.840> we

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
can't switch back to the humans there we

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.069 
can't switch back to the humans there we
go<00:01:19.670> let's<00:01:20.670> bring<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:20.969> the<00:01:21.030> other<00:01:22.340> dinosaur

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.449 
go let's bring up the other dinosaur
which<00:01:25.079> should<00:01:25.289> be<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.009> there<00:01:29.219> it<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.459 
which should be this one so there it is

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:30.770 
which should be this one so there it is
that's<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.969> difference

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that's the difference

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.349 
that's the difference
I<00:01:31.130> don't<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.189> depending<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.149> might

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.020 
like the this one or the other one I'm
not<00:01:35.880> sure<00:01:36.349> but<00:01:37.349> I<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.099> more<00:01:38.369> look

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
not sure but I like this one more look

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
not sure but I like this one more look
at<00:01:39.179> it<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.020> has<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.380> depth<00:01:40.739> has<00:01:41.039> more

at it this one has more depth has more

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.059 
at it this one has more depth has more
color<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.849> it<00:01:42.030> looks<00:01:42.209> better<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.780> opinion

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
color so it looks better in my opinion

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.789 
color so it looks better in my opinion
