00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello everyone we are on the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.550
 TV author tray to evoke 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.660
 together the quinté who argues this 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.549
 Tuesday in vincennes is the price of the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.260
 rock-posay a competition for horses 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 7 and 9 years old who did not win 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.279
 185 1000 euros disputed on the 2100 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 meters from the big track with a departure 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 to the autostart to talk about it I sing 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.590
 michel georgiou hi company 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.420
 michel hello guillaume then michel on 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.220
 go straight to the heart of the subject 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.750
 did you seem to release 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.349
 basics so it's true that cat and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.349
 relatively open 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.020
 I retained the number one who will be my 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
 favorite is sky quick it's a 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.559
 representative of the quick star team 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.789
 driven by castres payment one is 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.079
 all the assets are there for them 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.820
 perform very well 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.920
 he is very well committed to the ceiling of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.270
 nature and number one gains that's true 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 that it can be a small handicap but 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.020
 will be piloted by jean-michel bazire 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.250
 which is relatively rare and in two 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.750
 attempts with jean-michel not helped to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.789
 win the latest news on 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.329
 the hippodrome de soisy the horse is in 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.559
 cold 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.850
 unlike this is the last attempt 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.500
 he will evolve free of all four feet 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.299
 this time it's logically it's a 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.280
 must-have base in this event 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.840
 by the way so much will break made of 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.130
 this race a goal but it's true 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.110
 that it's true blue cat speed that's it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 exactly done on this course is the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.310
 competitor who trotted the fastest on 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.990
 its 2100 meters in a 12.8 so all 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.939
 the lights are green to make it a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 favorite agree and you do against 106 at 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.360
 number 2 sophora duriez concierge 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 I hope with that exactly it will be 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.630
 entrusted by jones was losing because it's 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070
 so rare so it's a sign of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.659
 confidence on the part of the entourage and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 I think that lucho nothing like that was 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.400
 not moving for purposes 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.590
 at its fall in August 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.509
 and finished 2nd of his proud girls to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.400
 Cagnes sur Mer on the mile which 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.990
 Shocked exposed here on horseback in full 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.820
 boom is exactly so always at it 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.680
 beat his world record 5 / naive 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.930
 she's in great shape and she's got 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.159
 this verdict is for me for there is 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.360
 rather well past the star she does 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.509
 part of the priorities of the projects 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.310
 okay I think you have who did 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.079
 Number 7 Sacha marboula favorite 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.049
 yes exactly I hold back on his 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.969
 third place at the corner wilson who gets 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.320
 pass is third of new wave riding 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.090
 we had to do well on our soil 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.280
 and know that last year at 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.590
 vincennes he beat at certain sam gibus 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.349
 on the ashy sam gibus 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.970
 I wanted a very good here are cities 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.950
 which are still relatively plateau 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.269
 and is logically they have to the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.860
 first a very good role in this 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.780
 john test of recipes rather 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.310
 moved is like a cat game 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.920
 still a lot of knuckle it was this 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.970
 has been worked hard there as you 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.049
 not scared are a little other race 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.540
 where I'm going to do footrests but 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.580
 because it's not the ca exceeding the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.290
 slope is supposed to leave a risk but 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.989
 given the opposition I still think 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.180
 who should have participated in 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.560
 a gay it's true that I'm saying of 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.940
 signal the holes but you have to clear 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.680
 some down to trust themselves to this 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.110
 show that offer some credits 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.470
 guaranteed so these choices there actually 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.519
 part 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.739
 so we keep it number 12 was 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.540
 restricted who think able to create 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.060
 surprise actually yes exactly so 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.989
 it is a horse that I like 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.549
 past and causes and big 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.500
 surprises early in the year excuse me 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.239
 adyns her by placing fourth in a 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.099
 quinté at the astronomical coast of 151 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.180
 against 1 it's true that will not be choice 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.200
 everyone from Shabbat people 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.329
 announces in an irreproachable form 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.010
 in our columns it will be unloaded from 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.720
 four feet which has only a few 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.790
 I believe since April 2012 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.859
 so if all goes well he pulled the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.299
 Office of the halls in high school and 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.220
 start if everything goes well and why 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.569
 not come spice up the reports to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.549
 concerter length for places 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.049
 why not a surprise this is 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.400
 not an impossibility to it's not a 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.660
 sure but for a torpedo we can 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.430
 possibly consider it 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.720
 okay there are ways that we can 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.180
 can spread without taking too much 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.190
 risks then there is that I eschew their 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.440
 four calmont press this is true 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.450
 that he could confirm at the trot riding and 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.680
 grit your teeth and nothing very 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.880
 seducing the beach to what I do not 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.880
 were not bad at the last but one 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.989
 the antepenultimate x and gamma graignes 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.180
 a good lot but that's not the choice 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.950
 speed 2005 m spirit speed but 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.239
 sooner or later he will be doing it again 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.349
 to take four in which place to 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.970
 big odds but long distance 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.639
 another time we can maintain it but 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.010
 it's true that it sounds complicated and 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:08.160
 the 15th at the cemetery to these but 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.329
 which complicated beforehand I made 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.829
 two points are to selection so you have 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.959
 placed at the top the sky quick 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.400
 then the 2 will be riads and between 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.260
 positions of 600 pretty park 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.039
 exactly that the choice because platform 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.209
 who stays on two very good 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.349
 performance on the grass 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.359
 know that last year she was 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.590
 ranked second of traffic dac be on 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.920
 the ash of vincennes is confirmed 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.420
 in this kind of confrontation 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.040
 and this time it will be deferré of the four 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.450
 feet and entrusted to leveque stone if 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.400
 their relatively rare assets 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.450
 logically he should play a very good 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.340
 role on arrival that's why it's 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.480
 retained in third position bio or 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.040
 Michel does not hide that I am very 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.060
 very hot with 70 of the park 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.000
 it's true that has just run very well 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.680
 by twice he just won at this 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.050
 that these 2nd division the previous time 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.430
 they had imposed themselves on durtal de brasov 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.660
 it's done too much jabba that comes from 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.340
 brilliantly confirmed to the sands-of 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.020
 the choice is not often made of 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.010
 four feet with case the bishop who 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.330
 believe immensely 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.620
 and then is absolutely right it's true 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.520
 that it is part of the priorities it is 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.940
 for that I ranked third 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.620
 position 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.940
 my only small guillaume reserve is 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.070
 true that he never ran on this 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.720
 course of attention failed since 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.070
 seven years meanwhile there he can 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.420
 transform the test and of course 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.710
 but it's true that it's good for everything 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.790
 more wrong but logically we 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.100
 would have first three be the first 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.110
 Site us and a boat michel agreement 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.660
 institute filed on October 9th from this 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.250
 weekend is ranked 4th in vincennes was 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.540
 sandwiched between santos du ried and 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.160
 lupine surprise that are not the 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.930
 first words of the wine even though he his 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.610
 rivals made him the distance he needed 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.260
 also do this time what 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.520
 is rare that they are both because 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.930
 that he was deferré the four tracks 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.160
 because it will be shod and by all in 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.180
 it's okay if it's true 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.990
 that there are traces he understood his 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.590
 task but it's true that in our 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.150
 columns his hamadi mentor that separates 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.190
 a big difference between the déferré 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.530
 hindquarters and deferré of the four 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.390
 feet agree in fifth position 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.250
 So the Sasha Marboula we talked about 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.440
 the three years eight rallies to pass in 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.090
 syria according to him the peculiarity of 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.140
 please on this course in three tries 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.730
 he always finished arriving two 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.150
 accessits a place excuse me is to 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.520
 take me back 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.240
 okay so passirac rally capes 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.460
 in sixth position 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.600
 then you have retained the 12th will remain so 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.400
 that you think that had created the surprise 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.170
 and finally who completes his show with the 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.330
 11 sun of the good of him here he has 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.820
 realized a very good summer why not 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.190
 to complete the combination of the quinté 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.790
 it's possible everyone is very good 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.350
 speed peak 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.910
 there he leaves in lima limit is almost 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.230
