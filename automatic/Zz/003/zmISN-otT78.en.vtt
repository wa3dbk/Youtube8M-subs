used a really sharp pair of scissors and
kind<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:20.560> poked<00:04:20.889> it<00:04:21.070> down<00:04:21.220> in<00:04:21.400> there<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.669> then

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
kind of poked it down in there and then

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.350 
kind of poked it down in there and then
cut<00:04:22.510> around<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:23.410> will<00:04:24.190> stamp<00:04:24.550> this<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:25.240> then

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
cut around and will stamp this and then

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.760 
cut around and will stamp this and then
I'm<00:04:25.449> going<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.630> cut<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.020> out<00:04:26.080> into<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.560> little

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
I'm going to cut that out into a little

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.040 
I'm going to cut that out into a little
banner<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.850> actually<00:04:28.150> let<00:04:28.630> this<00:04:28.780> dry

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
banner so I actually let this dry

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.409 
banner so I actually let this dry
overnight<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.860> did<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.550> this<00:04:31.120> one

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
overnight and I did to this one

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.510 
overnight and I did to this one
obviously<00:04:31.750> has<00:04:32.530> less<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.130> mica<00:04:33.310> flakes

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
obviously has less of the mica flakes

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.779 
obviously has less of the mica flakes
and<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.030> has<00:04:34.180> one<00:04:34.449> layer<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:36.070> transparent

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
and it has one layer of the transparent

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.740 
and it has one layer of the transparent
embossing<00:04:37.479> paste<00:04:37.780> this<00:04:38.410> one<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.919> did<00:04:39.520> more<00:04:40.419> mica

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
embossing paste this one I did more mica

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.469 
embossing paste this one I did more mica
flakes<00:04:40.990> did<00:04:41.650> one<00:04:41.860> layer<00:04:42.130> put<00:04:43.000> some<00:04:43.150> more<00:04:43.240> mica

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
flakes did one layer put some more mica

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.629 
flakes did one layer put some more mica
flakes<00:04:43.660> down<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.350> it<00:04:44.740> was<00:04:44.979> nice<00:04:45.190> because<00:04:45.400> they

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
flakes down and it was nice because they

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.460 
flakes down and it was nice because they
automatically<00:04:46.180> stuck<00:04:46.600> in<00:04:46.840> here<00:04:47.139> and<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.320> didn't

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
automatically stuck in here and I didn't

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.810 
automatically stuck in here and I didn't
have<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.710> glue<00:04:47.889> them<00:04:47.949> down<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.400> then<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.610> put

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
have to glue them down and then I put

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.879 
have to glue them down and then I put
another<00:04:49.030> layer<00:04:49.300> over<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.169> then<00:04:50.410> I<00:04:50.440> popped<00:04:50.740> a

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
another layer over and then I popped a

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.189 
another layer over and then I popped a
couple<00:04:51.070> more<00:04:51.400> mica<00:04:51.610> flakes<00:04:51.820> on<00:04:52.120> top<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:53.020> this

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
couple more mica flakes on top so this

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.520 
couple more mica flakes on top so this
one<00:04:53.380> is<00:04:53.500> way<00:04:53.680> more<00:04:53.889> layered<00:04:54.160> way<00:04:54.760> thicker<00:04:55.060> and

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
one is way more layered way thicker and

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.260 
one is way more layered way thicker and
after<00:04:56.530> overnight<00:04:57.070> still<00:04:57.669> isn't<00:04:58.090> 100-percent

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
after overnight still isn't 100-percent

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.219 
after overnight still isn't 100-percent
dry<00:04:59.200> so<00:04:59.800> you<00:05:00.220> can<00:05:00.400> be<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.639> judge<00:05:00.690> which<00:05:01.690> one<00:05:02.020> do

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
dry so you can be the judge which one do

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.650 
dry so you can be the judge which one do
you<00:05:02.320> like<00:05:02.349> better<00:05:02.880> this<00:05:03.880> one<00:05:04.090> is<00:05:04.210> more<00:05:04.360> blue

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
you like better this one is more blue

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.060 
you like better this one is more blue

it into my background I am not exactly

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.290 
it into my background I am not exactly
sure<00:05:23.770> I'm<00:05:23.979> going<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.190> love<00:05:24.400> this<00:05:24.550> though<00:05:24.820> so<00:05:25.120> if

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
sure I'm going to love this though so if

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.920 
sure I'm going to love this though so if
I<00:05:25.450> just<00:05:25.479> do<00:05:25.870> a<00:05:25.900> little<00:05:26.320> bit<00:05:26.560> down<00:05:26.740> in<00:05:26.800> here

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
I just do a little bit down in here

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.800 
I just do a little bit down in here
where<00:05:28.930> my<00:05:29.820> little<00:05:30.820> pieces<00:05:31.120> of<00:05:31.360> my<00:05:31.479> card<00:05:31.690> are

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
where my little pieces of my card are

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.330 
where my little pieces of my card are
going<00:05:31.930> to<00:05:31.990> go<00:05:32.080> on<00:05:32.169> top<00:05:32.380> then<00:05:32.710> if<00:05:32.979> I<00:05:33.070> don't<00:05:33.250> like

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
going to go on top then if I don't like

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.240 
going to go on top then if I don't like
it<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.550> can<00:05:33.580> just<00:05:33.849> cover<00:05:34.000> it<00:05:34.150> up<00:05:34.800> it's<00:05:35.800> really

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
it I can just cover it up it's really

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.770 
it I can just cover it up it's really
subtle<00:05:36.639> I<00:05:36.849> don't<00:05:37.030> even<00:05:37.120> know<00:05:37.300> if<00:05:37.389> you<00:05:37.419> can<00:05:37.510> see

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
subtle I don't even know if you can see

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.740 
subtle I don't even know if you can see
it<00:05:37.810> on<00:05:37.990> camera<00:05:38.020> but<00:05:38.680> I<00:05:38.740> do<00:05:38.830> like<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.430> so<00:05:39.729> I<00:05:40.060> still

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
it on camera but I do like it so I still

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.730 
it on camera but I do like it so I still
I'm<00:05:40.840> going<00:05:40.990> to<00:05:41.050> go<00:05:41.139> subtle<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.960> it<00:05:44.470> will<00:05:44.590> just

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
I'm going to go subtle and it will just

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.010 
I'm going to go subtle and it will just
add<00:05:44.919> some<00:05:44.950> really<00:05:45.580> fun<00:05:45.849> gold<00:05:46.210> texture<00:05:46.720> shine

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
add some really fun gold texture shine

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.920 
add some really fun gold texture shine
to<00:05:47.289> the<00:05:47.380> background<00:05:48.060> some<00:05:49.060> concentrating<00:05:49.810> in

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
to the background some concentrating in

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.360 
to the background some concentrating in
the<00:05:50.050> center<00:05:50.349> and<00:05:50.500> I'm<00:05:50.650> kind<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:50.889> rubbing<00:05:51.250> out

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
the center and I'm kind of rubbing out

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.850 
the center and I'm kind of rubbing out
so<00:05:51.610> it'll<00:05:51.729> go<00:05:51.880> lighter<00:05:52.150> as<00:05:52.599> it<00:05:53.500> gets<00:05:53.650> away<00:05:53.830> from

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
so it'll go lighter as it gets away from

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.670 
so it'll go lighter as it gets away from
the<00:05:54.130> center<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:55.690> this<00:05:55.960> is<00:05:56.110> a<00:05:56.139> really<00:05:56.470> delicate

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
the center and this is a really delicate

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.860 
the center and this is a really delicate
stencil<00:05:57.490> so<00:05:57.699> you<00:05:57.760> don't<00:05:58.000> want<00:05:58.180> to<00:05:58.360> just<00:05:58.539> you

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
stencil so you don't want to just you

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.399 
stencil so you don't want to just you
know<00:05:58.900> do<00:05:59.169> big<00:05:59.470> giant<00:05:59.919> rubbings<00:06:00.280> on<00:06:00.400> it<00:06:01.409> because

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
know do big giant rubbings on it because

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.469
