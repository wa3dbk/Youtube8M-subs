00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.450

 also because I 'm going to show you 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.860

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.360
 contributing data contributing 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.880

 the messages that you send me because here 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.560
 what we are going to do is always talk 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.050
 clearly of things without cheating 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.649
 nobody and without seeking to promote products 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.690
 that do not work or even talk about 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.519
 things that are fashionable but that 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.410
 really is not contrasted the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.710
 operation of them so 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.230
 so much 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.379
 I will always try to stick to what 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.680
 I really can serve you to improve 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.079
 in the objective that you propose in this 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.670
 case david rodrÃ­guez who is a student 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.960
 mine in this case that is preparing 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.390
 a young boy with a good structure 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.400
 that is preparing for the category 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.979
 of memphis and what is called here theory 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.600
 of Bermuda shorts and he's going to do it 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.159
 legs the leg voice because I never know 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.979
 know if he will later want to compete in 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.300
 classic is a note here because a lot 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.950
 people say it's not that bermuda is born in 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.530
 leg depends there are many who make subject 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.030
 also good at the moment says yes with the 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.729
 diet and I'm improving and 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.640
 marking the abdominal already quite 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.330
 I have a lot of anxiety, I feel like 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.509
 eat some candy and there's something for that 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.509
 or some sweet without fat hehehe laughs 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.540
 then talk coffee I can only 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.190
 for example before training eggs to 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.260
 the first question he asks me is what 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.630
 of the subject of sweet anxiety or 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.060
 take some food that gives us 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.840
 a feeling of sweetness and make us 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.590
 disappear that feeling of need 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.930
 of sweet that anxiety we say today 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.940
 We have many many products 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.940
 proteins, many proteins 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.539
 of brands of dietetics brands and 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.040
 sports nutrition that is advertised in 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.300
 our program that help us to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.770
 let's make the program and that I can 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.920
 serve this program to help you 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.430
 these proteins nowadays already have the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.620
 most 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.260
 most contain sucralose which is 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.210
 non-active sugar ie a sweetener 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.610
 which is sugar substitute being 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.900
 sugar base is chemically treated 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.790
 so that our body does not 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.200
 identify as such that caloric and know 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.200
 as sugar therefore a protein 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.220
 of any brand that we advertise 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.910
 have sucralose 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.790
 It is a great bet recommended brands 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.820
 for example from our program are for 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.060
 mega plus mega plus mega example 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.700
 brand that has entered from now 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.770
 sponsor and that really is a 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.690
 market reference mark one of 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.730
 a brand just that I started to 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.740
 work with her many years ago and that 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.680
 has improved a lot has products of 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.050
 a lot of quality and it also has proteins 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.410
 with sucralose look at the market 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.510
 perfect tritium we have a lot 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.580
 one tracks we have many brands that 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.230
 they really offer proteins that give 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.510
 flavor and a protein shake after 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.030
 of training with sucralose or 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.709
 Insolado micro filtered another by the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.170
 morning or between hours and you can eat it 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.520
 It's quite satisfying and you're taking something 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.660
 sweet after all those like the 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.220
 chocolate then chocolate with sugar 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.630
 although sugar will not be active it will be 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.230
 cocoa with sucralose 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.880
 another option would be sugar free gum 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.470
 candies without sugar I will not say 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.740
 brands because they do not sponsor us there 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.120
 many brands but you can eat and drink 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.290
 the chewing gum that you want chewing gum 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.200
 remember that they can give you a little 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.880
 acidity because they make gastric juices 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.320
 candies without sugar are a little less 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.720
 harmful to the stomach but you can 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.180
 take the ones you want are caloric and 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.280
 although there are videos out there circulating from 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.330
 they say they interrupt ketosis already 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.900
 we have demystified that hoax and we 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.400
 we do not believe in that maxim because there is no 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.400
 no proof that certifies 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.870
 then we talk about 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.729
 yes we can drink coffee coffees teas and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.739
 infusions any kind of them are 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.700
 recommended and there are many even the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.250
 coffee is also somewhat diuretic 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.960
 the red tea green tests are very 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.950
 critical ponytail the tooth of 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.710
 lion are 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.490
 plants plant extracts that are very 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:40.150
 criticisms and taken with sweeteners 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.529
 saccharine sucralose stevia 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.779
 aspartame what is to come to the flour 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:47.459
 that is caloric then you can take the 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.639
 that you want to the day and it will also help you 

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:52.649
 to eliminate liquids therefore tomatoes 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.839
 coffee or tea with sweetener the 

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:56.519
 what you want according to the anxiety you have 

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:59.009
 stomach or without sugar and chewing gum 

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:01.589
 sugar and also a good solution for 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.899
 the anxiety is to abuse the salads 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:06.649
 that is to say salad or vegetable all that are 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:12.650
 vegetables because they are onion tomato 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:17.310
 aubergines chub fas cucumber onions 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:20.130
 lettuce spinach asparagus and so on 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.050
 all are vegetables that are very little 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.940
 caloric and really contain a lot 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.980
 water and a lot of fiber a lot of cellulose that does not 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.070
 you can do the digestion and we do not 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:33.500
 fattening is the best option to eliminate 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.500
 the anxiety we continue in the program 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.130
