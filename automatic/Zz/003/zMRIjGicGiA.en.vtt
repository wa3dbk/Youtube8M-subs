00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
this in the absence of school captain

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.279 
this in the absence of school captain
only<00:00:49.640> makes<00:00:49.969> it<00:00:50.059> easier<00:00:50.480> for<00:00:50.690> students<00:00:51.230> to

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
only makes it easier for students to

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.779 
only makes it easier for students to
engage<00:00:51.559> in<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.980> power<00:00:52.160> struggle

engage in a power struggle

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.299 
engage in a power struggle

if legend chooses to sleep on all this

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.009 
if legend chooses to sleep on all this
then<00:00:56.300> maybe<00:00:56.629> he<00:00:56.899> needs<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:57.199> wake-up<00:00:57.410> call<00:00:57.559> I

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
then maybe he needs a wake-up call I

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.270 
then maybe he needs a wake-up call I
don't<00:01:00.019> recommend<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:00.949> try<00:01:01.190> and

don't recommend that you try and

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.119 
don't recommend that you try and

student has been able to get close

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.539 
student has been able to get close
enough<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.110> legend<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.680> even<00:01:07.009> think<00:01:07.310> of<00:01:07.430> a

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
enough to legend to even think of a

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.060 
enough to legend to even think of a
challenge<00:01:08.200> trying<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.380> do<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:09.740> would<00:01:09.860> be<00:01:10.040> a

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
challenge trying to do so would be a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.510 
challenge trying to do so would be a
waste<00:01:10.369> of<00:01:10.520> time<00:01:11.350> don't<00:01:12.350> worry<00:01:12.560> I<00:01:12.920> don't<00:01:13.189> plan

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
waste of time don't worry I don't plan

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.240 
waste of time don't worry I don't plan
on<00:01:13.579> going<00:01:13.880> after<00:01:14.150> legend<00:01:14.659> at<00:01:14.780> all<00:01:14.960> I'll<00:01:15.920> make

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
on going after legend at all I'll make

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.850 
on going after legend at all I'll make
him<00:01:16.430> come<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.700> me

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
him come to me

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.819 
him come to me
so<00:01:18.860> shins<00:01:19.250> little<00:01:19.549> rampage<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.240> 1368<00:01:20.899> was<00:01:21.560> just

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
so shins little rampage in 1368 was just

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.399 
so shins little rampage in 1368 was just
an<00:01:21.920> act<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.250> get<00:01:22.399> my<00:01:22.579> attention<00:01:22.750> his<00:01:23.750> targets

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
an act to get my attention his targets

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.380 
an act to get my attention his targets
may<00:01:24.560> have<00:01:24.680> been<00:01:24.829> more<00:01:24.979> intentional<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.240> his

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
may have been more intentional but his

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.240 
may have been more intentional but his
pattern<00:01:26.869> was<00:01:27.020> highly<00:01:27.350> reminiscent<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:28.040> your

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
pattern was highly reminiscent of your

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.179 
pattern was highly reminiscent of your
younger<00:01:28.610> days<00:01:29.140> that's<00:01:30.140> what<00:01:30.439> eventually<00:01:30.530> got

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
younger days that's what eventually got

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.090 
younger days that's what eventually got
to<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.549> wasn't<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.350> by<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.409> time<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:33.829> had

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
to you wasn't it by the time you had

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.920 
to you wasn't it by the time you had
decided<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.640> do<00:01:34.729> something<00:01:35.090> about<00:01:35.180> shit<00:01:35.630> you

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
decided to do something about shit you

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.959 
decided to do something about shit you
already<00:01:36.920> back<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.159> playing<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.729> role<00:01:37.939> of

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:37.969 
already back to playing the role of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.499 
already back to playing the role of
school<00:01:38.270> captain<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.790> it<00:01:40.939> seems

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
school captain so it seems

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.350 
school captain so it seems
but<00:01:42.259> I'd<00:01:42.409> ruined<00:01:42.890> my<00:01:43.040> entire<00:01:43.520> reputation<00:01:43.909> to

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
but I'd ruined my entire reputation to

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.120 
but I'd ruined my entire reputation to
keep<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:44.630> away<00:01:44.869> from<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.140> seat<00:01:45.469> legend

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
I couldn't let some newcomer simply

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.050 
I couldn't let some newcomer simply
bring<00:01:48.469> you<00:01:48.590> back<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.219> destroy<00:01:49.520> all<00:01:49.549> my<00:01:49.789> hard

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
endangering yourself and a school I

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.399 
endangering yourself and a school I
never<00:01:55.759> expected<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.509> school<00:01:56.810> will<00:01:56.990> be<00:01:57.020> closed

never expected the school will be closed

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.399 
never expected the school will be closed
down<00:01:57.710> but<00:01:58.369> at<00:01:58.549> that<00:01:58.759> point<00:01:59.119> I<00:01:59.479> really<00:02:00.140> didn't
