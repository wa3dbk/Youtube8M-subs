00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.309 
but yeah my other peppers are still
doing<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:11.970> fine<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.510> well<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
doing just fine and well I

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.110 
doing just fine and well I
I<00:02:13.379> waited<00:02:14.010> too<00:02:14.040> long<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.340> pick<00:02:14.579> a<00:02:14.609> couple<00:02:14.849> of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
I waited too long to pick a couple of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.410 
I waited too long to pick a couple of
these<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.299> got<00:02:16.079> some<00:02:16.260> holes<00:02:16.469> and<00:02:16.709> stuff<00:02:17.420> but

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
these and got some holes and stuff but

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.959 
these and got some holes and stuff but
but<00:02:19.019> they're<00:02:19.139> still<00:02:19.230> there<00:02:19.819> jalapenos<00:02:20.819> I

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969 
but they're still there jalapenos I

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.580 
but they're still there jalapenos I
think<00:02:21.269> those<00:02:21.450> are<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.749> those<00:02:21.959> are<00:02:22.260> done

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
think those are the those are done

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.170 
think those are the those are done
growing<00:02:22.859> I<00:02:23.099> picked<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> last<00:02:23.579> of<00:02:23.849> them<00:02:23.939> last

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
growing I picked the last of them last

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.670 
growing I picked the last of them last
week<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.719> again<00:02:25.109> with<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.319> cool<00:02:25.499> weather

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
week and again with the cool weather

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.470 
week and again with the cool weather
they're<00:02:25.889> not<00:02:25.980> growing<00:02:26.099> extremely<00:02:26.430> fast<00:02:27.030> um

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
they're not growing extremely fast um

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.940 
they're not growing extremely fast um

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
probably won't get any more of the rest

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.470 
probably won't get any more of the rest
of<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.159> year<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:29.969> can<00:02:30.030> see<00:02:30.209> still

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
of the year but as you can see still

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.459 
of the year but as you can see still

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
probably in about another two weeks we

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.899 
probably in about another two weeks we
may<00:02:36.840> get<00:02:36.989> our<00:02:37.139> first<00:02:37.379> we<00:02:38.340> may<00:02:38.459> get<00:02:38.579> our<00:02:38.730> first

lot of times until late october even

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.879 
lot of times until late october even
sometimes<00:02:44.150> november<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.680> completely<00:02:46.680> get<00:02:46.859> rid

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
sometimes november so completely get rid

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.849 
sometimes november so completely get rid

of the of the watermelon plants those

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.740 
of the of the watermelon plants those
were<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.370> hundred<00:02:50.549> percent<00:02:50.760> unsuccessful<00:02:51.719> i

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
were a hundred percent unsuccessful i

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.319 
were a hundred percent unsuccessful i

to<00:02:54.510> eat<00:02:54.750> at<00:02:55.469> also<00:02:55.859> may<00:02:55.980> try<00:02:56.189> it<00:02:56.250> again<00:02:56.340> next

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
year existing again experiment i

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.819 
year existing again experiment i
probably<00:02:59.840> wouldn't<00:03:00.840> have<00:03:00.959> eaten<00:03:01.079> too<00:03:01.439> many<00:03:01.620> of

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
probably wouldn't have eaten too many of

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.289 
probably wouldn't have eaten too many of
them<00:03:01.980> mostly<00:03:02.250> give<00:03:02.489> them<00:03:02.639> away<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:02.939> i<00:03:03.150> just

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
them mostly give them away so i just

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.369 
them mostly give them away so i just
wanted<00:03:03.389> to<00:03:03.599> see<00:03:03.689> how<00:03:03.810> well<00:03:03.989> they<00:03:04.139> would<00:03:04.260> grow

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
wanted to see how well they would grow

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.899 
wanted to see how well they would grow
in<00:03:04.560> containers<00:03:04.739> but<00:03:05.219> i<00:03:05.280> think<00:03:05.489> they<00:03:05.609> need<00:03:05.790> more

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
in containers but i think they need more

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.360 
in containers but i think they need more
room<00:03:06.150> than<00:03:07.049> just<00:03:07.260> putting<00:03:07.469> them<00:03:07.650> putting<00:03:08.250> them

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
room than just putting them putting them

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
grown and just exploded and actually

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.430 
grown and just exploded and actually
we've<00:04:21.090> got<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> few<00:04:21.419> clusters<00:04:21.690> down<00:04:22.049> here<00:04:22.289> these

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
we've got a few clusters down here these
