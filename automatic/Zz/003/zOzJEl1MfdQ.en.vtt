00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
if I had to drink it I could drink it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.199 
if I had to drink it I could drink it
but<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.319> wouldn't<00:02:14.130> recommend<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.640> no<00:02:14.730> way<00:02:14.760> so

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
but I wouldn't recommend it in no way so

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.910 
but I wouldn't recommend it in no way so
to<00:02:15.240> me<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.660> tastes<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.020> diet<00:02:16.620> coke<00:02:16.890> with

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
to me it tastes like a diet coke with

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.070 
to me it tastes like a diet coke with
bumped<00:02:17.459> up<00:02:17.580> sugar<00:02:17.880> which<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.569> guess<00:02:18.750> wouldn't

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
bumped up sugar which I guess wouldn't

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.390 
bumped up sugar which I guess wouldn't
make<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.200> diet<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:19.890> then<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.160> tastes<00:02:20.370> like

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
make it diet but then it tastes like

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220 
make it diet but then it tastes like
more<00:02:20.670> sugar<00:02:20.940> than<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.209> regular<00:02:21.420> coke<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:22.080> that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
more sugar than a regular coke if that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.680 
more sugar than a regular coke if that
makes<00:02:22.410> sense<00:02:22.560> plus<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:23.430> tad<00:02:23.880> bit<00:02:24.120> flags<00:02:24.420> this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
makes sense plus it's tad bit flags this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.320
