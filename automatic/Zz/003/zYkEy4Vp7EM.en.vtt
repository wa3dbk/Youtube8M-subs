00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 that there are people from youtube today I bring you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.470
 The sonic cd for portable pc good 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.799
 they copy the link of the description of the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.799
 video 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.639
 and it will take them to mediafire the file 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.890
 It's a bit heavy but it's worth it 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.480
 I do not download it because I already have it xd 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.029
 but you keep it 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.330
 once downloaded they extract it where 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.330
 want 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.700
 I wonder if my winrar can not 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.060
 be slower good relax with the 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.060
 song 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.160
 now there will be in the folder that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.190
 extracted and follow my steps at the foot of the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.190
 letter 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.649
 I'll put the big icons so that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.649
 see 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.880
 all this is important so do not go 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.820
 to erase anything if they do the game will 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:16.000
 It will alter so it depends on you 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.000
 [Music] 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.070
 I get it because I have already configured the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.910
 videos but I will show you how 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.910
 configure 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.320
 they select option if they trust they choose 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.320
 segade 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.840
 they select the god of europe japan and 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.840
 us, just do what I do 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.859
 [Music] 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.160
 and select file and the fourth option what 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.870
 do they do if they choose sonic cd 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.870
 [Music] 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.120
 the game runs me slow because I'm 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.190
 recording but you will run 

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:14.270
 normal or faster 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.270
 [Music] 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.380
 [Music] 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.240
 this game is about what sound has 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.190
 that travel to the past and destroy 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.530
 machines to save the future of 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.840
 each zone if one machine is missing 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.810
 destroy the future of zone 3 or the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:39.159
 boss area will be a future evil 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.159
 [Music] 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.129
 and the last case is to play the game 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.900
 game until death but the game is 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.450
 automatically saves so that 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.360
 have to start from the start good 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.190
 that's all I'll leave you some tricks in the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.130
 description of the video so that they see that 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:23.460
 I'm good vibes until the next video 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:23.460
