00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.769
 new things are coming and just like 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.019
 we are starting a year we want 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.090
 do it with firm footing in that really 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.029
 we can meet those goals these 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.480
 purposes this year because we 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.010
 we wanted to have a very guest 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.019
 special a friend also of this 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.070
 family will see what a pleasure to have you 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.779
 in this space 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.810
 He is a coach and we want good that we 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.309
 try to guide in relation to the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.820
 purposes and goals the other day with 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.160
 boys 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.000
 I do not know if you had the opportunity to see 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.979
 the program 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.420
 we made a collage just to stop 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:42.580
 talk about this that we all have 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.559
 goals and purposes of starting a new 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.540
 year for times passes the days we 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.820
 we submerge in the routine and everything goes 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.220
 as diluting what is happening that does not 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.900
 we manage to specify or fulfill 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.510
 the goals or purposes that we 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.939
 we propose because the first thing to be the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.339
 human being is linguistic is to say that a 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:03.460
 through the word is expressed and 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.950
 manifest if you have two men 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.070
 interns waiting for the car as you know 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.170
 you which is political and which is religious 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.909
 you can see it if you think that all 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.159
 they are executive or they are political or they are 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.350
 when you approach him he does not tell you vote for 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.030
 the 999 then those politicians the other 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.580
 He tells you to suffer is the religious 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.520
 until we do not speak we do not know that 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.110
 same is the word has power the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.150
 word has power because the first 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.430
 person who listens to you when you speak 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.280
 are you yourself then there are certain 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.710
 distinctions that we have and that 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.720
 it is important to clarify when it says is 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.670
 purpose is what people normally 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.670
 does at the end of the year and be my 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.500
 purpose for the 2014 purpose is what 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.420
 that in English is said wishful 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.890
 thinking a desire an intention and the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.260
 desires and intentions we already know to 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.320
 Where are they going 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.190
 the dog eats them and it's easy 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.650
 propose something for the following year 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.080
 just when you're at parties having tea 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.670
 parents eat the raise when you're 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.460
 eating all that is eating you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.040
 whole turkey and you say on January 2 in the 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.780
 gym this year is the one that I'm going to download 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.520
 of weight or this year in which I 'm going to 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.960
 put the company but it's because you're 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.600
 making a purpose is only 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.060
 intention and the other thing that is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.830
 important is that we have eaten the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.390
 story we have believed the story of 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.910
 that when you have a dream, I do not know 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.550
 tell anyone because if you tell them 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.210
 to how it is fulfilled that is a way of 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.400
 sell yourself 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.610
 you can make people team 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.070
 with you when you communicate to the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.340
 others to which the following commits you 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.350
 year 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.910
 it's not the same purpose as commitment 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.160
 would you say what are my 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.270
 commitments of 2014 there you are giving your 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.520
 word how much is your word worth that is 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.370
 something that people do not ask about 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.480
 acting pass 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.430
 we work on a stage something 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.500
 determined and the service if you do not have 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.510
 nerves this electro day has always 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.550
 goes up as long as a little while 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.440
 moment that you do not have nervous that no 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.050
 you're worried that you do not have a fear 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.730
 positive in some way or another because 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.570
 you are dead socially interested 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.570
 thanks to passion
