00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.559
 yes the second half for harmony 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.940
 starts in 2012 and thus as 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.070
 I love to greet you warmly 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 spectators here from mainz from the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.500
 bruchwegstadion to a new edition 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.269
 from 5 4 tv yes we remember the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 At the time round 2 0 stood for the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.380
 concord and still let the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.730
 team of roland seitz once again 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.929
 the butter from the bread take the game 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.090
 ended 2 2 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.130
 Whether his team today for a 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.420
 little could revenge that look 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.350
 Let's have a look and I wish you that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.910
 Of course they have a lot of fun, as always 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.219
 We still have to be close to the man 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.230
 leave the opponent little room and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.730
 be well on the defensive if that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.820
 The team is working right now 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.170
 necessary self-confidence in the 90 minutes 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.420
 to score a goal himself 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.699
 chess coach of the sv roland seitz on the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.949
 press conference before the match against the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.219
 team from the Rhineland-Palatinate 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.199
 landeshauptstadt 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.019
 and he is expecting one here in mainz 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.840
 pretty tight box for the first flag 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.810
 in front of bregas mario klinger steven lewerenz 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.670
 june papenburg steven kröner fabian 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.610
 Zittlau Maximilian Watzka Fahrudin 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.860
 kuduzovic thomas konrad and baldo di 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.420
 gregorio sends in the race and we 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.280
 Take a look at the numerous 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.049
 austria with arrived supporters of 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.930
 they want harmony for twelve minutes 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.720
 Here in the first break silence first 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.750
 a voice and their protest 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.369
 to give expression and we begin 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.619
 our game report with a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.840
 moment of fright for the mosel team 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 in the eighth game consists minute 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.070
 felix müller in duel against thomas 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.630
 Konrad flanks through on the left side 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 in the middle of the freestanding nico 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.220
 pfrengle but both his and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.310
 in the subsequent goal attempt is called the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.479
 winner stephan loboué of his box 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 to keep clean knows 14 minute what 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.350
 makes the entry steven lewerenz goes 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.240
 nice on the right outer lane leaves 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.009
 his opponent quite old 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.380
 look has the eye for the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.060
 run up max watzka this wants 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.979
 even the papenburg flanks 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.479
 the use of papenburg in this 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.360
 scene for referee measure 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.340
 creatively over motivated and we 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.340
 take a quick look at the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.769
 Fans of the SV now like you 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.959
 knows with a loud abroad 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.959
 support for your team in action 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.310
 37 minutes played when it comes from the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.620
 do not work out why not 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.660
 first with a standard situation first 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.030
 corner for the harmony of max 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.640
 watzka but also that here no 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.260
 means to success so far a nice 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.739
 the part of the two teams was bestowed 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.049
 Nothing 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.579
 But they are not able to do that here either 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.709
 to produce any highlights 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:52.379
 a minute before the end that would be 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.790
 Perfect timing been parked on castle 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.370
 Klinger sits down with the ball 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.590
 beautiful by looks draws in the penalty room 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.420
 the better standing watzka this one 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.549
 failed with his low shot 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.920
 short distance to heinz müller in the gate 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.900
 the mainzer playing in red this 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.549
 situation to date the most dangerous 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.549
 action of concord 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.240
 second minute of replay time the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.560
 first half steven lewerenz with one 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.230
 good shot in the ball 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.180
 fabian comes slowly 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.860
 but the ball can not do it right 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.590
 check or 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.510
 somehow create in the gate 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.410
 the men in red know it again 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.170
 to become master of the situation 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.070
 shortly thereafter, the first half is 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.290
 history and the last minutes 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.480
 These make us courage at this point 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.880
 for the second passage than the sv 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.090
 easy at the end of the first 45 minutes 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.090
 the more agile and active team and 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.430
 the team around drove pregas comes with the 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.040
 same attitude from the catacombs 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.420
 here in mainzer Bruchwegstadion back 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.130
 on the place because right after 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.950
 the captain of concord re-started 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.530
 with a fake ball at the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.450
 fuso witsch lands this gives up 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.760
 Maximilian Watzka's just out 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.770
 have to insert a short distance for what 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.780
 a start for the svg from the cabin 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.989
 out and how team-serving and 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.859
 Good with an overview played by fax 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.410
 this place 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.979
 bravo eintracht so it can here yet 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.600
 go on 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.580
 five minutes later again 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.080
 fake ball again one 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.479
 dangerous situation 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.370
 the leather lands at thun papenburg 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.180
 wagenburg gets the ball under 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.190
 control 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.010
 be injured in the penalty area 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.419
 Opponent everything perfect but his graduation 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.120
 look for yourself 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.120
 there probably a hole in the lawn must be 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.560
 the clock shows the 58 minute watzka leads 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.020
 an entry corner on patz briefly from the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.000
 sva 21 flanks in the middle klinger 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.039
 extends the ball dangerously on goal 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.620
 heinz müller already beaten for 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:07.050
 A field player helps him on the line 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.490
 out of dangerous history some want 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.060
 a hand-held game in defense 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.129
 to have 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.860
 but marcel göpferich decides here 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.050
 Everything was done in accordance with the rules 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.569
 of course check that again in 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.849
 the slow motion and that is really one 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.009
 tricky situation not completely on train 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.169
 teach from our position 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.060
 generally in dubio pro reo in 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.949
 doubt for the accused, however 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:35.639
 the whole movement and ball defense very much 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:37.979
 unnatural well and then it will be here 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.620
 really bitter only three minutes 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.440
 later the compensation strike for the fsv 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.050
 mainz 05 felix müller with a free kick 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.539
 25 meters before the goal his shot goes 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.969
 Friend and enemy over and beats 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.580
 next to the post ins tor 1 stephan 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.479
 loboué in this scene annoys powerless 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.860
 of course, excessive beyond the goal 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.690
 and the answer of concord ten 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.389
 minutes before the end directly at the 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.919
 penalty area is fouled the sve 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:07.469
 gets a free kick talked to 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.870
 this is a matter for Steven 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:12.650
 lewerenz what a shot of him but 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.419
 unfortunately he only meets aluminum 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.819
 we jump in the second minute of the 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.469
 additional time max watzka may still 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.389
 once a dormant ball in the 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.580
 but mainzer penal space bring this 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.969
 Gives your team nothing more countable 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.250
 on 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.469
 Shortly thereafter, it was then roland seitz 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.080
 should predict with his tight box 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.949
 right keep one point though 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.849
 kidnap his men from the 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.949
 landeshauptstadt 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.110
 the success story still holds 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.419
 and in 2012 you can only 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.279
 once extended namely in 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.349
 home match next friday under 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.180
 floodlight against sc freiburg too 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.490
 Of course, we will do that for you 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.900
 they transfer it until then 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.490
 Good, we wish you a nice week 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.490
 and stay true to us
