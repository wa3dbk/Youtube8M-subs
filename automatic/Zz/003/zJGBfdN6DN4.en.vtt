00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.190 
just look it up online like that would
be<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.130> short<00:03:23.459> video<00:03:23.640> I'm<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.930> 30

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
be a short video I'm going to be a 30

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.400 
be a short video I'm going to be a 30
second<00:03:25.470> video<00:03:25.579> so<00:03:26.579> yeah<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.000> next<00:03:27.030> step<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
second video so yeah the next step is to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.360 
second video so yeah the next step is to
put<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:29.370> in<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.730> oven<00:03:29.760> for<00:03:30.920> okay<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:31.980> we<00:03:32.340> just

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
put it in the oven for okay so we just

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.090 
put it in the oven for okay so we just
put<00:03:32.670> on<00:03:33.060> any<00:03:33.390> timer<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.350> put<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.799> for

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
put on any timer we just put it on for

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.270 
put on any timer we just put it on for
nine<00:03:35.549> minutes<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:36.720> put<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.350> um<00:03:37.650> our

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
nine minutes we put it in um our

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.880 
nine minutes we put it in um our
easy-bake<00:03:39.090> ultimate<00:03:39.299> oven<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.680> just

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
easy-bake ultimate oven and we just

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.759 
easy-bake ultimate oven and we just
stuck<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.519> there<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> little<00:03:42.180> 49<00:03:42.959> and

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
stuck it in there with a little 49 and

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.319 
stuck it in there with a little 49 and
guys<00:03:44.489> um<00:03:46.040> this<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.250> kind<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.549> hard<00:03:47.820> if<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.180> does

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
guys um this is kind of hard if it does

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.400 
guys um this is kind of hard if it does
turn<00:03:48.360> out<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.720> good<00:03:48.840> we're<00:03:49.079> probably<00:03:49.230> gonna

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
turn out that good we're probably gonna

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.620 
turn out that good we're probably gonna
say<00:03:49.650> put<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.160> in<00:03:50.250> for<00:03:50.430> another<00:03:50.579> minute<00:03:50.790> only

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
say put it in for another minute only

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.100 
say put it in for another minute only
because<00:03:52.519> um<00:03:53.660> we're<00:03:54.660> kind<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.870> guessing

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
because um we're kind of guessing

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.780 
because um we're kind of guessing
because<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.560> don't<00:03:55.709> have<00:03:55.769> instructions<00:03:56.549> but

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
because you don't have instructions but

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.670 
because you don't have instructions but
I<00:03:57.090> think<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.810> kind<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.019> got<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.500> come<00:03:58.650> out

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
I think it's kind of got to come out

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.800 
I think it's kind of got to come out
pretty<00:03:58.890> good<00:03:59.160> cuz<00:03:59.519> the<00:04:00.030> mix<00:04:00.269> already<00:04:00.600> looked

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
pretty good cuz the mix already looked

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.350 
pretty good cuz the mix already looked
good<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.620> already<00:04:01.860> turned<00:04:02.160> out<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.459> good<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.970> 1l

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
good it already turned out so good it 1l

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.539 
good it already turned out so good it 1l
good<00:04:03.660> yeah<00:04:04.019> its<00:04:04.230> smell<00:04:04.650> actually<00:04:05.100> really<00:04:05.430> good

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
good yeah its smell actually really good

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.060 
good yeah its smell actually really good
so<00:04:06.360> once<00:04:07.110> we<00:04:07.260> put<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:07.799> we're<00:04:07.920> going

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
so once we put it in there we're going

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.340 
so once we put it in there we're going
to<00:04:08.130> tell<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.609> and<00:04:08.880> say<00:04:09.600> if<00:04:09.840> he<00:04:09.989> needs<00:04:10.230> another

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
to tell you and say if he needs another

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.020 
to tell you and say if he needs another
minute

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
minute

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.690 
minute
so<00:04:11.660> we'll<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:11.900> see<00:04:12.170> how<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.500> turns<00:04:12.680> out<00:04:12.890> now

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.930 
really cool but I just think that it's
kind<00:06:09.140> of<00:06:09.320> looks<00:06:09.620> like<00:06:09.860> the<00:06:10.340> after<00:06:10.640> days<00:06:10.760> you

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
kind of looks like the after days you

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.510 
kind of looks like the after days you
can<00:06:11.060> really<00:06:11.300> taste<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.690> same<00:06:11.870> room<00:06:12.110> but<00:06:12.520> when

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
can really taste the same room but when

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.940 
can really taste the same room but when
you<00:06:13.610> bite<00:06:13.820> into<00:06:13.850> it<00:06:14.270> you<00:06:14.590> just<00:06:15.590> get<00:06:15.800> that

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
you bite into it you just get that

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.250 
you bite into it you just get that
doughy<00:06:16.340> texture<00:06:16.880> and<00:06:17.419> then<00:06:17.750> as<00:06:17.960> you<00:06:18.080> keep

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
doughy texture and then as you keep

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.300 
doughy texture and then as you keep
chewing<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:19.430> get<00:06:19.640> that<00:06:19.820> thin<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.830> did<00:06:21.830> all<00:06:21.979> give

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
chewing you get that thin I did all give

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.540 
chewing you get that thin I did all give
it<00:06:22.430> like<00:06:22.640> knee<00:06:23.450> alex-sama<00:06:23.990> 7

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
it like knee alex-sama 7

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.850 
it like knee alex-sama 7
