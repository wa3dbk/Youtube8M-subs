depending on what your story is about

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.600 
depending on what your story is about
and<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> twenty-five<00:01:07.740> percent<00:01:07.979> into<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and this is twenty-five percent into the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.660 
and this is twenty-five percent into the
story<00:01:09.470> then<00:01:10.470> you've<00:01:10.619> got<00:01:10.830> point<00:01:11.159> three<00:01:11.460> which

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
story then you've got point three which

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.050 
story then you've got point three which
is<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.060> midpoint<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.950> this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.250> there's<00:01:14.880> no

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is the midpoint and this is there's no

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.539 
is the midpoint and this is there's no
going<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.420> basically<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:17.070> decisions<00:01:17.490> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
going back basically the decisions that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.210 
going back basically the decisions that
your<00:01:17.729> characters<00:01:18.210> made<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.220> committing

and any unsuspected elements that you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
and any unsuspected elements that you
want<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.210> introduce<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> point<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
want to introduce this is the point that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
want to introduce this is the point that
they<00:01:28.710> are<00:01:28.890> revealed<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.240> fifty

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
they are revealed and we are fifty

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.560 
they are revealed and we are fifty
percent<00:01:30.990> into<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> story<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.390> then<00:01:33.390> we've

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
percent into the story and then we've

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.260 
percent into the story and then we've
got<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.960> point<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.950> which<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.060> low<00:01:36.240> point

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
got a point for which is the low point

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.190 
got a point for which is the low point
and<00:01:37.100> hope<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.340> gone<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.600> goal<00:01:39.840> seems

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and hope is gone and your goal seems

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.130 
and hope is gone and your goal seems
unachievable<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.790> always<00:01:42.570> think<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.079> as

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
unachievable I always think of this as

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.520 
unachievable I always think of this as
standing<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.280> protagonist<00:01:44.670> at<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:46.200> edge<00:01:46.380> of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
standing the protagonist at the edge of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.230 
standing the protagonist at the edge of
a<00:01:46.649> cliff<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.100> lobbying<00:01:47.670> stones<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.149> them

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
a cliff and lobbying stones at them

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
a cliff and lobbying stones at them
which<00:01:48.479> sounds<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.049> harsh<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.159> really

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
which sounds really harsh but you really

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
which sounds really harsh but you really
want<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> low<00:01:51.360> point<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
want this to be a low point so that you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.840 
want this to be a low point so that you
can<00:01:52.770> follow<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.189> struggle<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> your

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
can follow the struggle of your

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850 
can follow the struggle of your
character<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.899> them<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> reader

so you will then be able to put that

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.100 
so you will then be able to put that
into<00:03:36.470> your<00:03:36.590> own<00:03:36.830> work<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:38.480> other<00:03:38.600> thing<00:03:38.840> i<00:03:38.930> was

thinking about is something called a

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.920 
thinking about is something called a
logline<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:43.430> this<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:43.790> a<00:03:43.940> ten-second<00:03:44.540> summary

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
logline and this is a ten-second summary

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.900 
logline and this is a ten-second summary
which<00:03:45.410> if<00:03:45.709> you<00:03:45.829> are<00:03:45.950> stuck<00:03:46.190> in<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.400> lift<00:03:46.579> with
