you<00:00:47.129> could<00:00:47.280> say<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.180> stats<00:00:48.690> now

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
you could say but into the stats now

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
you could say but into the stats now
nidoking<00:00:49.980> stats<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.360> that

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
nidoking stats on actually all that

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.600 
nidoking stats on actually all that
they're<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.500> too<00:00:52.920> amazing<00:00:53.989> um<00:00:55.219> so<00:00:56.219> its

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
they're not all too amazing um so its

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.580 
they're not all too amazing um so its
attack<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> only<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> attack<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
attack is only what is attack is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.430 
attack is only what is attack is
actually<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> higher<00:00:59.399> stat<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.899> people<00:01:01.260> run

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
actually the higher stat but people run

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
actually the higher stat but people run
the<00:01:01.590> special<00:01:02.010> attacking<00:01:02.399> variant<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.210> he

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the special attacking variant because he

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.719 
the special attacking variant because he
gets<00:01:03.539> sheer<00:01:03.809> force<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> lot<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.890> moves

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
gets sheer force and a lot more moves

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.000 
gets sheer force and a lot more moves
that<00:01:06.240> fit<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.659> category<00:01:07.320> better<00:01:08.420> um<00:01:10.010> another

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that fit that category better um another

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.789 
that fit that category better um another
thing<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.510> his<00:01:13.020> special<00:01:13.380> tech<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
thing is that his special tech in the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.080 
thing is that his special tech in the
tech<00:01:13.979> aren't<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.610> high<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> begin

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
tech aren't really that high to begin

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.760 
tech aren't really that high to begin
with<00:01:15.330> his<00:01:15.479> attack<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.900> 102<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.470> special

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
with his attack is 102 is special

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
with his attack is 102 is special
techies<00:01:17.070> 85<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> thing<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
techies 85 the really the thing that

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.929 
techies 85 the really the thing that
makes<00:01:19.200> him<00:01:19.409> great<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:20.070> his<00:01:20.400> sheer<00:01:20.670> force

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
makes him great is his sheer force

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.490 
makes him great is his sheer force
ability<00:01:21.540> um<00:01:22.080> his<00:01:23.070> defenses<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.850> 77<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.750> 75

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and his speed is 85 so he's definitely

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.520 
and his speed is 85 so he's definitely
not<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.439> best<00:01:28.799> pokémon<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:30.000> he<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.600> nothing

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
to laugh at so him getting a mega

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.890 
to laugh at so him getting a mega
evolution<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:35.189> definitely<00:01:35.759> see<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.479> small

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
evolution I can definitely see a small

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.560 
evolution I can definitely see a small
boost<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.560> attack<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.579> pretty<00:01:38.820> large<00:01:39.180> boost

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.550 
that that's still a bit low for a male
Aleutians<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.970> abilities<00:01:51.570> will<00:01:51.990> help<00:01:52.380> a

looks<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.280> he'd<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.729> bulky<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.899> fast<00:02:04.320> he

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
looks like he'd be bulky but fast he

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.899 
looks like he'd be bulky but fast he
feels<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.100> mean<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.579> could<00:02:05.729> hit

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
feels like I mean like you could hit

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.510 
feels like I mean like you could hit
hard<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:07.049> fast<00:02:07.380> his<00:02:07.890> defenses

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
hard and be very very fast his defenses

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.080 
hard and be very very fast his defenses
that<00:02:08.550> only<00:02:08.940> put<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> 10<00:02:09.629> boost<00:02:09.959> into<00:02:10.289> each

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
that only put a 10 boost into each

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.759 
that only put a 10 boost into each
and<00:02:11.890> you'll<00:02:12.890> see<00:02:13.220> why<00:02:13.670> an<00:02:14.060> input<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.230> large

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
and you'll see why an input is a large

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.390 
and you'll see why an input is a large
boost<00:02:16.280> into<00:02:16.819> just<00:02:17.120> one<00:02:17.420> form<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.200> attack

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
boost into just one form of attack

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.949 
boost into just one form of attack
because<00:02:19.400> his<00:02:19.700> abilities<00:02:20.330> shear<00:02:20.599> force<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
because his abilities shear force and

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.110 
because his abilities shear force and
adaptability<00:02:21.530> affect<00:02:22.190> both<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.849> his<00:02:24.940> both<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
adaptability affect both of his both of

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.119 
adaptability affect both of his both of
his<00:02:26.209> attacks<00:02:26.690> special<00:02:27.200> attack<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.590> physicals

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
his attacks special attack and physicals

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.750 
his attacks special attack and physicals
so<00:02:29.200> shear<00:02:30.200> force<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.769> probably<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.640> more

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
so shear force is probably the more

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.789 
so shear force is probably the more
likely<00:02:32.150> one<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:32.569> adaptability<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.440> feel<00:02:33.650> like

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
likely one but adaptability I feel like

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.220 
likely one but adaptability I feel like
might<00:02:34.129> be<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> possibility<00:02:34.879> um<00:02:35.420> as<00:02:35.930> for<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
might be a possibility um as for the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.530 
might be a possibility um as for the
typing<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.400> typing<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.849> can<00:02:38.000> see<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.299> being

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
typing the typing I can see it being

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.289 
typing the typing I can see it being
ground<00:02:39.019> poison<00:02:39.680> still<00:02:40.069> but<00:02:40.670> now<00:02:40.819> looking<00:02:41.209> at

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
ground poison still but now looking at

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.569 
ground poison still but now looking at
this<00:02:41.420> design<00:02:41.810> more<00:02:42.110> closely<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.980> can<00:02:43.190> actually

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
this design more closely I can actually

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.420 
this design more closely I can actually
see<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.000> being<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.599> ground<00:02:45.260> I'm<00:02:45.799> not<00:02:45.950> around<00:02:46.220> a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
see it being a ground I'm not around a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.940 
see it being a ground I'm not around a
poison<00:02:46.880> steel<00:02:47.299> which<00:02:47.840> would<00:02:48.049> be<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.410> pretty

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
poison steel which would be a pretty

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.250 
poison steel which would be a pretty
cool<00:02:49.489> typing<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.120> my<00:02:50.150> mind<00:02:50.569> he'd<00:02:51.560> resist

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
cool typing in my mind he'd resist

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.580 
cool typing in my mind he'd resist
psychic<00:02:54.260> he<00:02:54.500> would<00:02:54.739> be<00:02:55.400> quad<00:02:55.849> to<00:02:56.360> go<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.989> ground

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
psychic he would be quad to go to ground

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.630 
psychic he would be quad to go to ground
that's<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.370> only<00:02:58.579> bad<00:02:58.730> part<00:02:58.790> but<00:02:59.660> he<00:03:00.079> would

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
that's the only bad part but he would

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.600 
that's the only bad part but he would
hmm<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:02.620> think<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:03.920> think<00:03:04.280> that'd<00:03:04.430> be<00:03:04.579> a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
hmm I think I just think that'd be a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.550 
hmm I think I just think that'd be a
really<00:03:04.879> creative<00:03:05.269> typing<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.049> don't<00:03:06.290> know<00:03:06.440> if

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
really creative typing I don't know if

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.559 
really creative typing I don't know if
he<00:03:06.650> gets<00:03:07.069> flash<00:03:07.640> cannon<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.269> will<00:03:08.420> actually

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
he gets flash cannon I will actually

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.080 
he gets flash cannon I will actually
search<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.349> up<00:03:09.560> right<00:03:09.920> now<00:03:10.340> i<00:03:10.579> have<00:03:10.819> opened

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
search that up right now i have opened

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.930 
search that up right now i have opened
on<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.480> show<00:03:11.810> down<00:03:11.959> on<00:03:12.200> my<00:03:12.709> luck<00:03:12.739> he<00:03:13.489> does<00:03:13.760> not

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
on the show down on my luck he does not

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.449 
on the show down on my luck he does not
get<00:03:14.150> flash<00:03:14.420> cannon<00:03:14.720> but<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.139> is<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.319> TM<00:03:15.859> so<00:03:16.250> they

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
get flash cannon but it is a TM so they

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.539 
get flash cannon but it is a TM so they
can't<00:03:16.730> make<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.060> available<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.630> him<00:03:17.840> via<00:03:18.139> TM<00:03:18.560> so

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
can't make it available to him via TM so

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.420 
can't make it available to him via TM so
now<00:03:20.030> looking<00:03:20.420> at<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.630> design<00:03:21.109> um<00:03:21.470> poison

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
now looking at this design um poison

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.759 
now looking at this design um poison
seal<00:03:22.670> could<00:03:22.910> be<00:03:23.030> possibility<00:03:23.690> um<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.620> will

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
seal could be possibility um and I will

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.490 
seal could be possibility um and I will
add<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.700> his<00:03:25.940> new<00:03:26.630> counterpart<00:03:27.700> Shh<00:03:29.500> like

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
add that to his new counterpart Shh like

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.120 
add that to his new counterpart Shh like
I<00:03:30.709> said<00:03:30.769> it's<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.400> secret<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.690> put<00:03:33.319> two<00:03:33.530> videos<00:03:33.920> in

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
does it get dragon tail that would be a

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.800 
does it get dragon tail that would be a
pretty<00:04:57.650> nice<00:04:58.010> move<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:59.120> doesn't<00:04:59.540> get<00:04:59.630> dry

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
pretty nice move it doesn't get dry

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.160 
pretty nice move it doesn't get dry
until<00:04:59.960> that<00:05:00.830> that's<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.430> pretty<00:05:01.970> good<00:05:02.180> move<00:05:02.390> so

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
until that that's a pretty good move so

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.810 
until that that's a pretty good move so
um<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:04.220> never<00:05:04.880> misses<00:05:05.090> toxic<00:05:06.050> um<00:05:06.800> abilities<00:05:07.580> I

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
um it never misses toxic um abilities I

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.450 
um it never misses toxic um abilities I

this time but poison steel could be a

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.600 
this time but poison steel could be a

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610

and<00:05:20.120> i<00:05:20.870> feel<00:05:21.140> like<00:05:21.320> it<00:05:21.440> would<00:05:21.530> be<00:05:21.650> cool<00:05:21.919> um<00:05:23.500> the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
only downfall to this is that no it

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.330 
only downfall to this is that no it
doesn't<00:05:28.640> get<00:05:29.060> any<00:05:29.390> form<00:05:30.380> of<00:05:30.500> stab<00:05:30.800> busting

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
doesn't get any form of stab busting

move<00:05:31.700> in<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.419> defensive<00:05:33.140> department<00:05:33.800> um<00:05:33.980> does

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
move in the defensive department um does

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.330 
move in the defensive department um does
it<00:05:34.880> get<00:05:34.970> stockpile<00:05:35.720> I<00:05:35.960> don't<00:05:36.380> think<00:05:36.470> so<00:05:36.800> but

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
it get stockpile I don't think so but

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.960 
it get stockpile I don't think so but
worth<00:05:37.669> a<00:05:37.880> shot<00:05:38.150> no<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:38.690> does<00:05:38.900> not<00:05:39.970> really

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
worth a shot no it does not really

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.090 
worth a shot no it does not really
nothing<00:05:41.690> but<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.560> guess<00:05:44.620> hmm<00:05:45.620> they're<00:05:45.800> really

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
nothing but I guess hmm they're really

nothing but I guess hmm they're really
really<00:05:46.460> isn't<00:05:47.000> much<00:05:47.120> you<00:05:47.300> could<00:05:47.450> do<00:05:47.630> it<00:05:47.720> with

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
really isn't much you could do it with

which is okay gets rock slide um yeah
not<00:06:15.830> honestly<00:06:16.340> not<00:06:16.910> that<00:06:16.970> great<00:06:17.479> gets<00:06:17.810> taught

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
not honestly not that great gets taught

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.020 
not honestly not that great gets taught
but<00:06:18.320> it's<00:06:18.470> not<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.770> fast<00:06:19.100> it<00:06:19.430> gets<00:06:19.490> toxic

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
but it's not that fast it gets toxic

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.030 
but it's not that fast it gets toxic
spikes<00:06:20.300> so<00:06:20.600> I<00:06:20.810> felt<00:06:21.470> like<00:06:21.530> this<00:06:21.710> thing<00:06:21.860> could

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
spikes so I felt like this thing could

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.219 
spikes so I felt like this thing could
be<00:06:22.190> a<00:06:22.220> hazard<00:06:22.460> set<00:06:22.850> her<00:06:22.970> up<00:06:23.000> guy<00:06:23.450> and<00:06:23.840> does<00:06:24.200> it

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
be a hazard set her up guy and does it
