hello guys and welcome today I want to
show<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.710> two<00:00:05.069> really<00:00:05.640> simple<00:00:06.299> glitches<00:00:06.779> I

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
show you two really simple glitches I

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.890 
show you two really simple glitches I
think<00:00:07.140> in<00:00:07.259> battlefield<00:00:08.250> 4<00:00:08.450> the<00:00:09.450> both<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.750> them

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
think in battlefield 4 the both of them

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.620 
think in battlefield 4 the both of them
are<00:00:09.960> on<00:00:09.990> siege<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.320> Shanghai<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.630> they

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
are on siege of Shanghai and they

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.490 
are on siege of Shanghai and they
probably<00:00:12.900> take<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> matter<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.590> seconds<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.340> do

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
probably take a matter of seconds to do

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.990 
probably take a matter of seconds to do
so<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.920> want<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.279> you're<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.609> spawn

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
so what you want to is you're to spawn

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.950 
so what you want to is you're to spawn
on<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> US<00:00:18.930> deployment<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.939> it<00:00:20.939> any<00:00:21.480> time<00:00:21.750> now

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
on the US deployment of it any time now

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.920 
on the US deployment of it any time now
I<00:00:22.430> this<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.660> pre-recorded<00:00:25.050> gameplay

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
I this is this is pre-recorded gameplay

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.269 
I this is this is pre-recorded gameplay
because<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.199> made<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.769> made<00:00:29.010> one<00:00:29.189> before

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
because I made I made one before

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.999 
because I made I made one before
commentary<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.240> game<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.619> commentary

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
commentary in game but the commentary

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.940 
commentary in game but the commentary
didn't<00:00:32.369> save<00:00:32.640> or<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.079> also<00:00:34.230> wasn't<00:00:34.530> really

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
underneath the mat that was a bit

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.630 
underneath the mat that was a bit
glitchy<00:01:46.740> dunno<00:01:47.070> why<00:01:47.280> things<00:01:47.579> feel<00:01:47.820> alike<00:01:48.439> but

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
glitchy dunno why things feel alike but

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.100 
glitchy dunno why things feel alike but
now<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.700> could<00:01:51.000> complete<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.600> first<00:01:51.840> glitch

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
now you could complete the first glitch

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.810 
now you could complete the first glitch
really<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.829> sort<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.040> stick<00:01:53.250> underneath<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
really just sort of stick underneath the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.420 
really just sort of stick underneath the
wrap<00:01:54.110> there<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.259> certain<00:01:55.649> locations<00:01:56.219> where

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
wrap there is certain locations where

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.289 
wrap there is certain locations where
you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:57.090> through<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:58.610> did<00:01:59.610> try<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.000> find

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you can see through I did try and find

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.209 
you can see through I did try and find
it<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.659> somewhere<00:02:00.899> by<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:02.130> boxes<00:02:02.640> area

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
it it's somewhere by the boxes area

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.469 
it it's somewhere by the boxes area
where<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.430> shoot<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> native<00:02:06.360> up

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
where you can shoot on the native up

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.410 
where you can shoot on the native up
onto<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> stairs<00:02:07.849> but<00:02:08.849> if<00:02:09.119> you're<00:02:09.349> someone

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
onto the stairs but if you're someone

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.470 
onto the stairs but if you're someone
who<00:02:10.509> wanted<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.530> glitch<00:02:11.860> more<00:02:12.480> probably

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
who wanted to glitch more probably

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.880 
who wanted to glitch more probably
wouldn't<00:02:13.720> recommend<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.319> because<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.650> can

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
wouldn't recommend it because you can

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.940 
wouldn't recommend it because you can
get<00:02:15.160> kicked<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.700> banned<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.830> someone<00:02:17.830> may

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
get kicked and banned and someone may

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.260 
get kicked and banned and someone may

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
time of doing this glitch first time I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.410 
time of doing this glitch first time I
will<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:59.310> dump<00:03:00.310> out<00:03:00.549> at<00:03:00.760> how<00:03:00.910> they<00:03:01.090> haven't

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
pretty easy to spawn on me okay see it's

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.860 
pretty easy to spawn on me okay see it's
just<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.190> corner<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.820> road<00:03:15.970> fall<00:03:16.570> through

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
and use these glitches before they get

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.739 
and use these glitches before they get
patched<00:03:52.000> really<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:52.870> see<00:03:53.620> ya
