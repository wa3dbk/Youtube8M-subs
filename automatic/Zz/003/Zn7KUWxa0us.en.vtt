00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.009 
of solar panel on the top and a flashing
LED<00:00:18.400> powered<00:00:19.400> by<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.550> solar<00:00:19.849> panel<00:00:20.269> and<00:00:20.510> an

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
LED powered by the solar panel and an

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.990 
LED powered by the solar panel and an
adjustable<00:00:21.439> arm<00:00:21.650> let's<00:00:22.369> take<00:00:22.519> a<00:00:22.550> look<00:00:22.759> at<00:00:22.880> it

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:28.669 
silver plastic I picked up this up for

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.430 
silver plastic I picked up this up for
$27<00:00:29.480> at<00:00:29.630> Fry's<00:00:29.949> but<00:00:30.949> it<00:00:31.789> seems<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.240> be<00:00:32.270> ok<00:00:32.689> it

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
$27 at Fry's but it seems to be ok it

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.110 
$27 at Fry's but it seems to be ok it
looks<00:00:33.500> pretty<00:00:33.890> good<00:00:34.040> I'm<00:00:34.670> gonna<00:00:34.850> put<00:00:35.030> the

looks pretty good I'm gonna put the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.790 
looks pretty good I'm gonna put the
solar<00:00:35.329> panel<00:00:35.390> up<00:00:35.750> towards<00:00:36.050> some<00:00:36.230> lights<00:00:36.469> and

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
solar panel up towards some lights and

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.700 
solar panel up towards some lights and
then<00:00:37.550> we<00:00:37.730> can<00:00:37.879> see<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.480> thing<00:00:38.750> flash<00:00:40.210> and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
then we can see the thing flash and

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
triple-a NiCad batteries is what happens

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.420 
triple-a NiCad batteries is what happens
is<00:01:05.449> you<00:01:05.630> unscrew<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:08.170> thing<00:01:09.170> back<00:01:09.320> here<00:01:09.619> and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
screw the screw this thing here and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.840 
screw the screw this thing here and
there's<00:01:14.780> place<00:01:14.990> for<00:01:15.200> two<00:01:15.409> NiCad<00:01:16.369> batteries

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
there's place for two NiCad batteries

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.060 
there's place for two NiCad batteries
and<00:01:17.540> that's<00:01:17.750> for<00:01:18.049> outdoor<00:01:18.409> use<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.829> way<00:01:18.920> that

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
and that's for outdoor use the way that

charge and and then at night you'll have
your<00:01:24.590> flashing<00:01:26.350> LED<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:29.270> installation<00:01:29.810> it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
your flashing LED so the installation it

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.380 
your flashing LED so the installation it
comes<00:01:30.860> with<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.130> box<00:01:31.340> comes<00:01:31.970> with<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.210> camera

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
comes with the box comes with the camera

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.980 
comes with the box comes with the camera
and<00:01:32.869> then<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.710> comes<00:01:33.979> with<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.990> Simonian

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
and then it comes with the Simonian

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.960 
and then it comes with the Simonian
hardware<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:36.860> these<00:01:37.369> are<00:01:37.549> some<00:01:37.729> plastic

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
hardware and these are some plastic

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.840 
hardware and these are some plastic
anchors<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.899> some<00:01:39.170> screws<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.549> way<00:01:40.670> this

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
anchors and some screws and the way this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.139 
anchors and some screws and the way this
works<00:01:41.149> I<00:01:41.890> already<00:01:42.890> installed<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.399> here<00:01:43.610> but

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
works I already installed it here but

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.590 
works I already installed it here but
you<00:01:44.299> know<00:01:44.420> basically<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.469> unscrew<00:01:46.329> down<00:01:47.329> here

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
you know basically the unscrew down here

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.280 
you know basically the unscrew down here
you<00:01:47.719> unscrew<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.170> knurled<00:01:48.770> knob<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
you unscrew this knurled knob and the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.649 
you unscrew this knurled knob and the
camera<00:01:51.290> comes<00:01:51.500> off<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:53.210> take<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.420> look<00:01:53.479> the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
camera comes off and you take a look the

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.539 
camera comes off and you take a look the
whole<00:01:53.990> pad<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.439> can<00:01:54.590> see<00:01:54.740> there's<00:01:54.920> three

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
whole pad you can see there's three

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.510 
whole pad you can see there's three
holes<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:56.840> line<00:01:57.350> them<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.799> then<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:58.310> take<00:01:58.490> a

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
holes you line them and then you take a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.779 
holes you line them and then you take a
pen<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:59.439> pen<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.680> then<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.920> mark<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.579> three

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
pen a pen and then you mark the three

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.920 
pen a pen and then you mark the three
holes<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.350> then<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.649> get<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.979> quarter<00:02:04.460> inch

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
holes and then you get a quarter inch

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.899 
holes and then you get a quarter inch
masonry<00:02:05.930> bit<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.039> I<00:02:07.070> got<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.310> drill<00:02:07.670> with<00:02:07.880> a

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
masonry bit so I got a drill with a

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.210 
masonry bit so I got a drill with a
quarters<00:02:08.390> masonry<00:02:08.869> bit<00:02:09.080> I<00:02:09.320> went<00:02:09.710> through<00:02:10.070> this

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
quarters masonry bit I went through this

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.480 
quarters masonry bit I went through this
stucco<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.790> then<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:13.250> take<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.460> small

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
stucco and then you take a small
