00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.699 

well<00:00:00.179> that's<00:00:00.359> actually<00:00:00.539> consistent<00:00:01.230> with<00:00:01.439> my

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
well that's actually consistent with my

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.379 
well that's actually consistent with my
expectations<00:00:02.429> as<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.639> when<00:00:02.909> they<00:00:03.000> might<00:00:03.149> pull

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
expectations as to when they might pull

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.180 
expectations as to when they might pull
back<00:00:03.629> some<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.110> quantitative<00:00:04.620> easing<00:00:04.859> I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
back some of the quantitative easing I

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.650 
back some of the quantitative easing I
thought<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.759> was<00:00:05.850> really<00:00:06.089> notable<00:00:06.420> that

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
thought that it was really notable that

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.390 
thought that it was really notable that
in<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.899> minutes<00:00:07.170> only<00:00:07.379> one<00:00:07.620> member<00:00:07.859> said<00:00:08.250> that

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
in the minutes only one member said that

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.209 
in the minutes only one member said that
they<00:00:08.519> should<00:00:08.700> really<00:00:08.970> begin<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:09.510> immediately

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
they should really begin it immediately

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.530 
they should really begin it immediately
but<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.639> seemed<00:00:11.880> as<00:00:12.000> though<00:00:12.059> there<00:00:12.330> was

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
but it seemed as though there was

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.330 
but it seemed as though there was
somewhat<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> consensus<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:13.889> they<00:00:14.160> could

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
somewhat of a consensus that they could

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.660 
somewhat of a consensus that they could
moderate<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.420> pace<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:16.430> tapering<00:00:17.430> if<00:00:17.580> you

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
moderate the pace of tapering if you

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.980 
moderate the pace of tapering if you
want<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> put<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.270> way<00:00:18.330> as<00:00:18.570> far<00:00:18.750> as<00:00:18.869> that

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
want to put it that way as far as that

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.779 
want to put it that way as far as that
they<00:00:19.140> could<00:00:19.410> increase<00:00:20.039> their<00:00:20.400> asset

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
they could increase their asset

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.359 
they could increase their asset
purchases<00:00:21.270> if<00:00:21.390> economic<00:00:22.260> conditions<00:00:22.710> worn<00:00:23.039> so

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
purchases if economic conditions worn so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.670 
purchases if economic conditions worn so
it's<00:00:24.060> actually<00:00:24.330> fairly<00:00:24.720> consistent<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.529> my

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
it's actually fairly consistent with my

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.050 
it's actually fairly consistent with my
expectations<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:26.670> would<00:00:26.789> begin

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
expectations that they would begin

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.730 
expectations that they would begin
moderating<00:00:27.689> around<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> middle<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.500> year

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
moderating around the middle of the year

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.880 
moderating around the middle of the year
and<00:00:28.980> perhaps<00:00:29.630> stop<00:00:30.630> purchasing<00:00:31.380> by<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> end

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
and perhaps stop purchasing by the end

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.709 
and perhaps stop purchasing by the end
of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> year<00:00:32.430> well<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.000> question<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
of the year well the question is of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.490 
of the year well the question is of
course<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.530> was<00:00:34.710> before<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.329> job<00:00:37.170> March

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
course this was before the the job March

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.930 
course this was before the the job March
jobs<00:00:37.770> report<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.280> released<00:00:38.489> does<00:00:38.820> that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
jobs report was released does that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.729 
jobs report was released does that
change<00:00:39.239> anybody's<00:00:39.750> thoughts<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:40.260> how<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
change anybody's thoughts about how the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.290 
change anybody's thoughts about how the
fed<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> react<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.790> maybe<00:00:42.000> think

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
fed is going to react and maybe think

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.270 
fed is going to react and maybe think
that<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:43.200> were<00:00:43.260> more<00:00:43.469> hawkish<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:44.129> these

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that they were more hawkish in these

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.450 
that they were more hawkish in these
minutes<00:00:44.670> than<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:44.969> are<00:00:45.120> today<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:47.250> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
minutes than they are today it is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.819 
minutes than they are today it is
possible<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.360> has<00:00:48.570> changed<00:00:49.020> since<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
possible that it has changed since the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.529 
possible that it has changed since the
meeting<00:00:50.100> actually<00:00:50.340> took<00:00:50.730> place<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.180> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
meeting actually took place because of

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
meeting actually took place because of
how<00:00:51.690> bad<00:00:51.989> those<00:00:52.230> job<00:00:52.530> numbers<00:00:52.920> work<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.489> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
how bad those job numbers work but I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.680 
how bad those job numbers work but I
would<00:00:53.730> point<00:00:53.940> out<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.510> were<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
would point out that they were I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.959 
would point out that they were I
actually<00:00:54.960> pointing<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:56.219> those<00:00:56.520> minutes

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
actually pointing out in those minutes

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.760 
actually pointing out in those minutes
themselves<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> lot<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> strength

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
themselves that a lot of the strength

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.799 
themselves that a lot of the strength
was<00:00:58.980> coming<00:00:59.280> coming<00:00:59.879> from<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.390> basically

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
was coming coming from a basically

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.720 
was coming coming from a basically
sustained<00:01:01.530> consumer<00:01:02.160> spending<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
sustained consumer spending and the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.359 
sustained consumer spending and the
prospect<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.960> continued<00:01:04.559> business<00:01:04.830> spending

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
prospect for continued business spending

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.520 
prospect for continued business spending
so<00:01:05.850> obviously<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.630> were<00:01:06.689> making<00:01:07.049> mention<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
so obviously they were making mention of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.620 
so obviously they were making mention of
the<00:01:07.890> labour<00:01:08.100> market<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> minutes<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the labour market in the minutes but I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.200 
the labour market in the minutes but I
don't<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:11.159> jobs<00:01:11.670> report<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
don't think that that one jobs report is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
don't think that that one jobs report is
really<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> change<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.290> if

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
really going to change anything if

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.100 
really going to change anything if
anything<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> will<00:01:14.159> maybe<00:01:14.970> delay<00:01:15.450> by<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> month

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
anything it will maybe delay by a month

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
anything it will maybe delay by a month
or<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> meeting<00:01:16.890> perhaps<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.299> they

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
or a meeting perhaps as to when they

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.420 
or a meeting perhaps as to when they
actually<00:01:18.570> begin<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.590> taper<00:01:19.799> their<00:01:20.100> asset

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
actually begin to taper their asset

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
actually begin to taper their asset
purchases<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.060> nothing<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.540> all<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
purchases but nothing really all that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
purchases but nothing really all that
dramatic<00:01:22.590> now<00:01:23.189> Brian<00:01:23.490> does<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> alter

future<00:01:40.560> Brian<00:01:41.240> well<00:01:42.240> thankfully<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.869> me<00:01:43.049> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
future Brian well thankfully for me it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.569 
future Brian well thankfully for me it
doesn't<00:01:43.470> actually<00:01:43.560> change<00:01:43.770> anything<00:01:44.340> because

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
doesn't actually change anything because

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.600 
doesn't actually change anything because
was<00:01:44.909> consistent<00:01:45.840> with<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.200> expectations<00:01:47.009> but

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
was consistent with my expectations but

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.100 
was consistent with my expectations but
I<00:01:47.670> could<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.119> how<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:48.600> people<00:01:48.930> might<00:01:49.049> view

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I could see how some people might view

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
I could see how some people might view
these<00:01:49.530> minutes<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> saying<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.610> Fed

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
these minutes is saying that the Fed

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.550 
these minutes is saying that the Fed
might<00:01:51.090> actually<00:01:51.360> continue<00:01:52.079> their<00:01:52.229> asset

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
might actually continue their asset

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830 
might actually continue their asset
purchases<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.399> bit<00:01:53.549> longer<00:01:53.880> than

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
purchases for a little bit longer than

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.450 
purchases for a little bit longer than
what<00:01:55.049> was<00:01:55.170> originally<00:01:55.320> anticipated<00:01:55.829> if

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
what was originally anticipated if

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
what was originally anticipated if
people<00:01:57.000> were<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.540> expecting<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.439> they

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
people were going in expecting that they

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.899 
people were going in expecting that they
were<00:01:58.619> going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> begin<00:01:59.070> tapering<00:01:59.369> at<00:01:59.700> around

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
were going to begin tapering at around

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.459 
were going to begin tapering at around
let's<00:02:00.149> say<00:02:00.270> June<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:01.079> might<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.409> be

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
let's say June they might now be

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.929 
let's say June they might now be
thinking<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.009> well<00:02:02.250> maybe<00:02:02.460> they'll<00:02:02.670> begin

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
thinking that well maybe they'll begin

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.450 
thinking that well maybe they'll begin
around<00:02:03.390> july<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.680> those<00:02:04.829> bad<00:02:05.070> jobs

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
around july because of those bad jobs

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
around july because of those bad jobs
numbers<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.969> also<00:02:06.240> since<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> money<00:02:06.810> they

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
numbers and also since the money they

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.010 
numbers and also since the money they
begin<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:08.190> try<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.690> substantiate<00:02:09.690> or

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
begin to actually try to substantiate or

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.630 
begin to actually try to substantiate or
put<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.410> little<00:02:10.619> bit<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.860> meat<00:02:11.160> around<00:02:11.340> what

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
put a little bit of meat around what

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.900 
put a little bit of meat around what
they

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
they

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.120 
they
by<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.600> substantial<00:02:13.170> improvement<00:02:14.070> in

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
by what is a substantial improvement in

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.440 
by what is a substantial improvement in
labor<00:02:14.340> market<00:02:14.730> conditions<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.330> we're

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
labor market conditions and we're

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.270 
labor market conditions and we're
nowhere<00:02:15.690> close<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.140> being<00:02:16.320> there<00:02:16.590> yet<00:02:16.830> well

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
nowhere close to being there yet well

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.860 
nowhere close to being there yet well
and<00:02:17.430> then<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.670> wonder<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.480> know<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.810> know

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and then you wonder you know and I know

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.680 
and then you wonder you know and I know
Brian<00:02:19.230> you've<00:02:19.470> talked<00:02:19.710> about<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.220> about<00:02:21.120> you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
Brian you've talked about this about you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.570 
Brian you've talked about this about you
know<00:02:21.780> when<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.170> happens<00:02:22.710> if<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.280> means

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
know when that happens if that means

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.360 
know when that happens if that means
this<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.240> so-called<00:02:24.510> bond<00:02:25.050> bubble<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.740> going

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
this the so-called bond bubble is going

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.010 
this the so-called bond bubble is going
to<00:02:26.490> burst<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.090> wonder<00:02:27.390> how<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.630> could

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
to burst and I wonder how you could

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.840 
to burst and I wonder how you could
actually<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:29.340> know<00:02:29.370> what<00:02:29.670> are<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
actually see you know what are the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.490 
actually see you know what are the
indications<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.900> actually<00:02:31.260> might

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
indications of that that actually might

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.230 
indications of that that actually might
happen<00:02:32.100> if<00:02:32.370> we're<00:02:32.520> getting<00:02:32.790> these<00:02:32.880> early

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
happen if we're getting these early

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.170 
happen if we're getting these early
indications<00:02:33.780> from<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.050> Fed<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:35.030> think<00:02:36.030> that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
indications from the Fed I think that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.150 
indications from the Fed I think that
what<00:02:36.450> we<00:02:36.660> might<00:02:36.900> see<00:02:36.960> is<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.530> Fed<00:02:37.740> begin<00:02:38.040> to

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
what we might see is the Fed begin to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.100 
what we might see is the Fed begin to
tapering<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.760> actually<00:02:39.330> markets<00:02:39.750> beginning

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
tapering and actually markets beginning

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.590 
tapering and actually markets beginning
to<00:02:40.260> move<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.680> anticipation<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:42.030> let's<00:02:42.450> say

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
to move in anticipation of let's say

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.510 
to move in anticipation of let's say
around<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.500> summary<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.010> economic

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
around what the summary of economic

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.010 
around what the summary of economic
projections<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:45.420> when<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.690> federal

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
projections are so when the federal

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.080 
projections are so when the federal
reserve<00:02:46.320> releases<00:02:46.530> those<00:02:47.130> at<00:02:47.340> every<00:02:47.970> other

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
reserve releases those at every other

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.360 
reserve releases those at every other
meeting<00:02:48.540> people<00:02:49.020> might<00:02:49.200> key<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.130> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
meeting people might key in on that and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.090 
meeting people might key in on that and
say<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.500> possibility<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.890> fed

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
say is the possibility of the fed

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.280 
say is the possibility of the fed
tightening<00:02:53.430> coming<00:02:54.240> sooner<00:02:54.630> or<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.140> going

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
tightening coming sooner or is it going

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.590 
tightening coming sooner or is it going
to<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.410> coming<00:02:55.590> later<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.610> could<00:02:56.640> create

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
to be coming later and that could create

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.210 
to be coming later and that could create
a<00:02:57.690> little<00:02:57.930> bit<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.170> volatility<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.830> terms<00:02:59.070> of

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
a little bit of volatility in terms of

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.650 
a little bit of volatility in terms of
yields<00:02:59.640> but<00:02:59.940> I<00:02:59.970> don't<00:03:00.210> think<00:03:00.300> we're<00:03:00.480> actually

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
yields but I don't think we're actually

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.260 
yields but I don't think we're actually
going<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.020> see<00:03:01.140> any<00:03:01.350> sustained<00:03:02.070> increase<00:03:03.030> in

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
going to see any sustained increase in

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.050 
going to see any sustained increase in
yields<00:03:04.230> across<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.740> board<00:03:04.980> until<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.850> Fed

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
yields across the board until the Fed

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.760 
yields across the board until the Fed
actually<00:03:06.300> begins<00:03:06.900> raising<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.410> federal

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
actually begins raising that federal

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.830 
actually begins raising that federal
funds<00:03:08.010> rate<00:03:08.130> it's<00:03:08.760> basically<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.390> we<00:03:09.510> saw<00:03:09.690> in

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
funds rate it's basically what we saw in

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.710 
funds rate it's basically what we saw in
2004<00:03:10.710> is<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.760> Fed<00:03:12.030> they<00:03:12.360> were<00:03:12.420> so

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
2004 is that the Fed they were so

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.690 
2004 is that the Fed they were so
transparent<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:13.620> what<00:03:13.800> they<00:03:13.920> were<00:03:13.980> doing<00:03:14.280> it

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
transparent with what they were doing it

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.340 
transparent with what they were doing it
didn't<00:03:15.030> really<00:03:15.120> take<00:03:15.360> anybody<00:03:15.750> by<00:03:15.900> surprise

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
didn't really take anybody by surprise

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.230 
didn't really take anybody by surprise
so<00:03:16.770> as<00:03:16.980> long<00:03:17.220> as<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.580> Fed<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:17.850> very

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
so as long as the Fed is very

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.000 
so as long as the Fed is very
transparent<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.140> they<00:03:19.350> haven't<00:03:19.709> really

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
transparent and they haven't really

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.310 
transparent and they haven't really
begun<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.490> sustainably<00:03:21.330> increase<00:03:22.140> the

but the Fed Funds rate is going to be

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.290 
but the Fed Funds rate is going to be
higher<00:03:43.890> with<00:03:44.130> one<00:03:44.280> person<00:03:44.459> thinking<00:03:44.910> it's

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
going to be a 2.75 percent then when you

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.600 
going to be a 2.75 percent then when you
get<00:03:48.300> into<00:03:48.709> 2015<00:03:49.709> which<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.220> year<00:03:50.430> they've

and a half percent unemployment rate

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.600 
and a half percent unemployment rate
you've<00:03:55.860> got<00:03:56.100> all<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:57.120> them<00:03:57.330> but<00:03:57.690> one

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
you've got all of them but one

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.470 
you've got all of them but one
suggesting<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.820> interest<00:04:00.150> rates<00:04:00.209> are<00:04:00.420> going

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480

four and a half percent Wow so they

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.229 
four and a half percent Wow so they
think<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.430> could<00:04:08.610> go<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.000> course

was<00:04:19.350> going<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.650> be<00:04:19.739> gradual<00:04:20.370> if<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.669> look<00:04:20.880> at

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
was going to be gradual if you look at

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.850 
was going to be gradual if you look at
that<00:04:21.210> maybe<00:04:22.109> there's<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.410> chance<00:04:22.440> that's<00:04:22.740> not

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
that maybe there's a chance that's not

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.469 
that maybe there's a chance that's not
going<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.100> be<00:04:23.160> great<00:04:23.340> certainly<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.060> yeah

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
going to be great certainly is it yeah

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.640 
going to be great certainly is it yeah
but<00:04:24.720> what<00:04:24.840> if<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.020> don't<00:04:25.140> see<00:04:25.320> them<00:04:25.440> but<00:04:25.560> what

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
but what if I don't see them but what

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.000 
but what if I don't see them but what
about<00:04:25.830> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
about the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.500 
about the
transparency<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.730> this<00:04:26.940> i<00:04:27.060> mean<00:04:27.210> we're

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
transparency of this i mean we're

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.240 
transparency of this i mean we're
putting<00:04:27.810> all<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.320> out<00:04:28.470> right<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.950> is<00:04:29.070> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
putting all of this out right it is the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.430 
putting all of this out right it is the
idea<00:04:29.670> that<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.420> Fed<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.690> telling<00:04:31.200> us<00:04:31.290> all

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
idea that that the Fed is telling us all

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.530 
idea that that the Fed is telling us all
of<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.800> stuff<00:04:32.010> just<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:32.700> that<00:04:32.850> we<00:04:32.940> can<00:04:33.090> temper

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
of this stuff just so that we can temper

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.540 
of this stuff just so that we can temper
our<00:04:33.690> expectations<00:04:34.560> or<00:04:34.680> get<00:04:35.010> used<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.430> this

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
our expectations or get used to this

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.580 
our expectations or get used to this
idea<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:36.210> we<00:04:36.540> could<00:04:36.570> have<00:04:36.930> higher<00:04:37.170> interest

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
idea that we could have higher interest

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.260 
idea that we could have higher interest
rates<00:04:37.740> sometime<00:04:38.100> soon<00:04:38.280> without<00:04:38.670> there<00:04:39.240> being

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
rates sometime soon without there being

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.780 
rates sometime soon without there being
a<00:04:39.690> shock<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.710> overall<00:04:41.130> market<00:04:41.310> can<00:04:41.640> they

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
a shock to the overall market can they

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.220 
a shock to the overall market can they
do<00:04:41.850> that<00:04:41.970> Brian<00:04:42.300> that's<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.750> question<00:04:42.900> can

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
do that Brian that's the question can

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.960 
do that Brian that's the question can
they<00:04:43.380> can<00:04:44.070> they<00:04:44.100> manipulate<00:04:44.790> what<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.270> do<00:04:46.970> yes

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
they can they manipulate what you do yes

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.760 
they can they manipulate what you do yes
well<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.360> honestly<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.290> think<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.620> they<00:04:49.710> can

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
well I honestly I think that they can

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.560 
well I honestly I think that they can
and<00:04:50.070> it's<00:04:50.220> actually<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.640> lesson<00:04:51.030> if<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.450> you

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
and it's actually the lesson if that you

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.780 
and it's actually the lesson if that you
can<00:04:51.720> draw<00:04:51.960> from<00:04:51.990> say<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.530> 1994<00:04:53.310> experience

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
can draw from say the 1994 experience

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.690 
can draw from say the 1994 experience
versus<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.150> 2004<00:04:54.930> experience<00:04:55.380> 1994<00:04:56.100> februari

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
versus the 2004 experience 1994 februari

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.970 
versus the 2004 experience 1994 februari
forth<00:04:56.910> 1994<00:04:57.660> first<00:04:58.170> time<00:04:58.410> they<00:04:58.530> released<00:04:58.890> a

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
forth 1994 first time they released a

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.350 
forth 1994 first time they released a
policy<00:04:59.340> statement<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.790> was<00:04:59.880> so<00:05:00.060> vague<00:05:00.300> and

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
policy statement it was so vague and

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.880 
policy statement it was so vague and
opaque<00:05:00.810> nobody<00:05:01.200> really<00:05:01.470> knew<00:05:01.590> what<00:05:01.680> they<00:05:01.830> were

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
opaque nobody really knew what they were

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.940 
opaque nobody really knew what they were
doing<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.520> couldn't<00:05:03.380> everybody<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:04.560> sort<00:05:04.830> of

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
doing it couldn't everybody is sort of

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.830 
doing it couldn't everybody is sort of
in<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.490> tizzy<00:05:05.850> as<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.120> what's<00:05:06.270> going<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:06.570> in<00:05:06.630> the

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
in a tizzy as to what's going on in the

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.540 
in a tizzy as to what's going on in the
fixed<00:05:07.080> income<00:05:07.200> market<00:05:07.710> everything<00:05:08.370> really

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
fixed income market everything really

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.820 
fixed income market everything really
sold<00:05:08.880> off<00:05:09.060> at<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.450> point<00:05:09.750> 2004<00:05:10.560> there<00:05:10.740> were

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
sold off at that point 2004 there were

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.910 
sold off at that point 2004 there were
much<00:05:11.070> more<00:05:11.250> transparent<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:12.240> maybe<00:05:12.570> 2014<00:05:13.320> it's

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
much more transparent so maybe 2014 it's

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.320 
much more transparent so maybe 2014 it's
going<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.160> be<00:05:14.220> even<00:05:14.340> more<00:05:14.670> transparent

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
going to be even more transparent

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.580 
going to be even more transparent
they're<00:05:15.450> practicing<00:05:16.020> what<00:05:16.170> i<00:05:16.230> would<00:05:16.440> call

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
they're practicing what i would call

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.200 
they're practicing what i would call
like<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:16.830> wikileaks<00:05:17.430> approach<00:05:17.820> to

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
like a wikileaks approach to

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.940 
like a wikileaks approach to
transparency<00:05:18.960> where<00:05:19.140> it's<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.410> radical

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
transparency where it's a radical

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.220 
transparency where it's a radical
transparency<00:05:20.450> they<00:05:21.450> effectively<00:05:21.960> want

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
transparency they effectively want

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.330 
transparency they effectively want
people<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.620> know<00:05:22.740> what<00:05:22.920> they've<00:05:23.040> been<00:05:23.190> having

for breakfast in order to make some of
these<00:05:25.860> decisions<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.520> see<00:05:27.450> how<00:05:27.510> those<00:05:27.690> changes

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
these decisions to see how those changes

200,000 jobs reported March we would be

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.190 
200,000 jobs reported March we would be
seeing<00:05:56.640> a<00:05:56.700> massive<00:05:57.060> sell-off<00:05:57.300> right<00:05:57.540> now<00:05:57.690> that

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
seeing a massive sell-off right now that

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.720 
seeing a massive sell-off right now that
is<00:05:58.350> yet<00:05:58.530> one<00:05:58.650> thing<00:05:59.100> I<00:05:59.190> would<00:05:59.250> point<00:05:59.430> out

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
is yet one thing I would point out

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.840 
is yet one thing I would point out
though<00:05:59.970> is<00:06:00.180> you<00:06:00.630> have<00:06:00.810> to<00:06:00.930> remember<00:06:01.170> that<00:06:01.470> the
