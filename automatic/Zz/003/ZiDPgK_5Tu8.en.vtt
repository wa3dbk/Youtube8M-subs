00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.450
 hello there is time for 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 rest I went to the country, but of course not 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 empty-handed we have another 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.350
 testing this time for testing 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.140
 not a camera and not even a camcorder 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.990
 and the device that allows you to produce 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
 special types of shooting this is rail 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.730
 which camera moves creating 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.790
 motion effect when shooting video as well 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.250
 when shooting timelaps moving this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.129
 the carriage along the rail happens by 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.450
 manual force either by the engine in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.760
 I currently have a motor 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.660
 installed and control is in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.110
 hands if i move the iron only 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.989
 rarely goes there or here with more oh 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.989
 oh or less speed 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.330
 Of course, absolutely amazing effect 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.150
 volume in the frame that is created by 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.910
 smooth motion is hard to describe but you 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.640
 see it with your own eyes 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.770
 amazingly beautiful though it is ordinary 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.400
 weed chamomile note that in 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.020
 sound channel you hear the sound 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.540
 engine so if you write sound 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.450
 straight from the camera then clean write it down 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.740
 perhaps it will not be possible to find out how 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.509
 all this beauty slider works 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.759
 is pretty simple 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.220
 the design is a metal rail on 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.490
 which the carriage is located on 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.090
 bearings moving along the rail can 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.560
 moving a hand can move a motor 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.210
 level allows you to set the slider 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.850
 horizontal plane and eat on 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.690
 leg ends that allow 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.320
 adjust this plane exposing so 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.670
 as you need it but it seems to me 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.369
 what a very interesting option 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.159
 using a slider is setting it 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.670
 not on the ground or on the table or on some 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.070
 thing 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.340
 and setting it on a tripod level 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.560
 man so that you can shoot something 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.600
 higher for that here is 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.940
 mount under the tripod they are with 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.640
 bottom side one mount is located 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.100
 in the center and 2 mounts are on 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.680
 the ends of the slider note that 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.510
 This large mount is not under 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.730
 standard tripod so you need to have 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.810
 Adapters here are either special 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.600
 massive tripods 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.220
 but under a standard tripod for some reason I 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.590
 Found only one mount which 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.209
 Located in the heart here is a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.280
 additional hole 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.750
 since i don't have a tripod with big 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.519
 connector and no adapter to me 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.200
 have to put a tripod here 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.780
 imagine I put here 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.549
 standard tripod and what lever I have 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.650
 occurs when one and a half or two 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.079
 kilogram camera moves to the edge 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.260
 slider without pressure very seriously and 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.040
 even the slider bends a little tripod 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.840
 need to mount 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.549
 I do not know something extra either 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.310
 put some extra racks 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.600
 supports under the side slider in 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.990
 overall it seemed to me 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.750
 problems since i have my tripod though 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.750
 he intended for heavy cameras he for 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.640
 this slider hardly came up well here 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.560
 a little wary there is him 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.120
 I was able to take something off also I'm sure that 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.790
 here you must purchase 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.570
 additionally tripod head because 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:40.240
 that at least there is such a one 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:43.250
 simple pin on which you can oh 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.780
 It was a simple pin simple 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.480
 pin that can be attached 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.880
 but the camera in the first place it is a very yes what 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.740
 is in the first place is very uncomfortable 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.840
 wind the camera here you understand yes 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.120
 how so how will it look in 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.250
 second, well , I think it's just not very 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.470
 technologically so here of course need 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.150
 I have a good tripod head and 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.770
 again there were no separate heads 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.540
 so from some little old 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.510
 tripod I twisted such a head 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.570
 small entrenched here she told me 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.570
 allowed at least in some way 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.920
 install the camera and at least somehow 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.640
 put it in space as well 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.290
 it says the needy for invention is cunning 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.420
 as for the control panel it 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.330
 intuitive it has two pens 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.280
 1 sets the speed left or right 2 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:32.990
 pilica switches video mode this when 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.300
 the slider carriage moves continuously and 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.610
 second mode is time lapse mode 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.040
 when you can ask some 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.450
 minimum ranges of movement 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.770
 slider for a certain amount 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.090
 time and for a certain segment 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.850
 the minimum distance that you can 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.970
 I can slide the slider 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.760
 set the remote control to 0.2 millimeter 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:01.880
 for example, I can move the slider by 0.2 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:04.520
 millimeter every three hundred seconds during 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.860
 shooting data the camera shifted each 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.470
 times a centimeter and so 200 times 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.910
 contract 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.860
 returning to the control unit thanks 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.510
 who made this shot I want 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.510
 say that he has enough food 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.630
 for a while the device works from three 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:24.440
 finger batteries on top 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.129
 connector and one of the connectors under control 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.889
 slider 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:31.569
 the connector does not know why probably need 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:34.939
 for powered by 3 connector to control 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:37.669
 a camera, that is, a cable 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:41.449
 which allows the camera to turn on 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:44.239
 remote control shooting mode 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.149
 but the connector doesn't fit my camera 

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:49.039
 so I'm shooting timelaps since 

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:51.139
 there are no timelaps function in my camera 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.479
 I use this remote control here 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.559
 connects to my camera and activates 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.659
 in it the possibility of interval shooting 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:02.479
 despite all the beauty of videotaping with 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:04.759
 ground level by I mean specific 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.159
 panorama of tulips I wanted 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:09.409
 try slider to shoot a man 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:11.779
 to set it at the level of growth 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.969
 person and shoot for example a fragment 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:18.469
 some interview that I carried out 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.449
 My control panel is in 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.309
 hands and the camera is installed slider 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.800
 which in turn stands on a tripod 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:26.989
 so I can control the movement 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.139
 cameras from here it will move 

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:34.099
 along the line of the frame creating a feeling 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:36.229
 speakers of course that speed i can 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:39.639
 change to a higher or even 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.639
 send the camera to the other side 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.090
 be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be be 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.870
 I decided to choose some kind of abstract 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.620
 picture so that you carefully 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.690
 listened to the sound of the camera motor by the way if 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.550
 a slight twitching occurs in the frame 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.070
 it arises from the blade of grass 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.870
 get under the electric motor and 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:09.450
 the slider twitches a little so 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.450
 grass needs to be cut before shooting 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.920
 I will honestly impress me from 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.230
 interactions with this aggregate are plague 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.480
 I would like to have this in my arsenal 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.640
 video devices to shoot 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.680
 crazy things then post them in 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.940
 reviews hope you succeed too 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.940
 try it sometime
