many<00:00:00.659> of<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:01.050> carbohydrate<00:00:01.920> molecules<00:00:02.580> that

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
many of the carbohydrate molecules that

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.090 
many of the carbohydrate molecules that
we<00:00:02.939> discussed<00:00:03.419> so<00:00:03.629> far<00:00:03.659> are<00:00:04.200> capable<00:00:04.890> when

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
we discussed so far are capable when

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.430 
we discussed so far are capable when
they're<00:00:05.250> going<00:00:05.690> reducing<00:00:06.690> reactions

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
they're going reducing reactions

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.850 
they're going reducing reactions
reduction<00:00:08.360> reactions<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.540> such<00:00:10.050> sugars<00:00:10.590> are

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
reduction reactions and such sugars are

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.570 
reduction reactions and such sugars are
known<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.429> reducing<00:00:12.240> sugars<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.559> when<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.309> have

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
known as reducing sugars so when we have

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.390 
known as reducing sugars so when we have
a<00:00:14.610> sugar<00:00:15.030> molecule<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.199> sugar<00:00:16.500> molecule<00:00:17.130> can

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
a sugar molecule the sugar molecule can

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.300 
a sugar molecule the sugar molecule can

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.730 
dynamic equilibrium between the cyclic
and<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> cyclic<00:00:30.000> form<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.560> we

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
and the a cyclic form and to see what we

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.069 
and the a cyclic form and to see what we
mean<00:00:31.980> let's<00:00:32.340> take<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.850> an<00:00:33.000> example<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
mean let's take as an example the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.370 
mean let's take as an example the
glucose<00:00:34.590> molecule<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> glucose<00:00:36.480> exists<00:00:37.260> in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
glucose molecule so glucose exists in

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.560 
glucose molecule so glucose exists in
the<00:00:37.590> cyclic<00:00:38.100> form<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.030> two<00:00:39.329> Anna

glucopyranose<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.770> well<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.610> our<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.539> cyclic

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
glucopyranose as well as our a cyclic

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.340 
glucopyranose as well as our a cyclic
form<00:00:46.739> our<00:00:47.070> open<00:00:47.940> straight<00:00:48.270> chain<00:00:48.660> glucose

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
form our open straight chain glucose

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.090 
form our open straight chain glucose

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
molecules simply known as d glucose so

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.430 
molecules simply known as d glucose so
basically<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.149> an<00:00:54.329> inter<00:00:54.780> conversion

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
basically we have an inter conversion

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.010 
basically we have an inter conversion

case<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.380> well<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.830> many<00:01:20.729> other<00:01:21.030> hybrid

case as well as many other hybrid

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
case as well as many other hybrid
carbohydrate<00:01:22.619> molecules<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:24.030> cyclic<00:01:24.720> is

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
carbohydrate molecules this cyclic is

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.070 
carbohydrate molecules this cyclic is
the<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.939> predominates<00:01:27.080> specifically

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the one that predominates specifically

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.010 
the one that predominates specifically
for<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.530> case<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:30.060> ninety<00:01:30.840> nine

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
for this case we have about ninety nine

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.399 
for this case we have about ninety nine
point<00:01:31.439> ninety<00:01:31.799> five<00:01:32.220> percent<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.840> cyclic

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
point ninety five percent of this cyclic

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.660 
point ninety five percent of this cyclic
molecule<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.340> equilibrium<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.329> only<00:01:36.960> about

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
molecule at equilibrium and only about

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.350 
molecule at equilibrium and only about
0.05<00:01:38.670> percent<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> cyclic<00:01:40.950> gid<00:01:41.820> glucose

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
0.05 percent of the a cyclic gid glucose

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560 
0.05 percent of the a cyclic gid glucose
so<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.259> only<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.070> very<00:01:44.579> very<00:01:44.939> tiny<00:01:45.299> amount

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
so we only have a very very tiny amount

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.830 
so we only have a very very tiny amount
of<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.770> molecule<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.729> cyclic<00:01:48.390> version

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
of this molecule that a cyclic version

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.010 
of this molecule that a cyclic version
actually<00:01:49.320> present<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.240> equilibrium<00:01:51.240> now<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
actually present at equilibrium now the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.310 
actually present at equilibrium now the
question<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.040> which<00:01:53.759> one<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> these<00:01:54.540> versions

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
question is which one of these versions

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.010 
question is which one of these versions
the<00:01:55.500> cyclic<00:01:56.040> or<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> cyclic<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.450> actually

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the cyclic or the a cyclic can actually

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.130 
the cyclic or the a cyclic can actually
undergo<00:01:58.560> our<00:01:59.000> reduction<00:02:00.000> reaction<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.930> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
undergo our reduction reaction so it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.969 
undergo our reduction reaction so it
turns<00:02:01.439> out<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.610> more<00:02:03.079> dominant<00:02:04.079> cyclic

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
turns out that the more dominant cyclic

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.670 
turns out that the more dominant cyclic
version<00:02:05.549> cannot<00:02:05.969> undergo<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.840> reduction

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
version cannot undergo a reduction

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.609 
version cannot undergo a reduction
reaction<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.520> will<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.300> reduced<00:02:09.479> by<00:02:10.289> any

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
reaction it will not be reduced by any

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.540 
reaction it will not be reduced by any
reducing<00:02:11.160> agent<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.390> this<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:13.020> cyclic<00:02:14.010> version

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
reducing agent but this a cyclic version

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.910 
reducing agent but this a cyclic version
the<00:02:14.700> open<00:02:15.120> straight<00:02:15.510> chain<00:02:15.870> molecule<00:02:16.560> will<00:02:16.890> be

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the open straight chain molecule will be

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.059 
the open straight chain molecule will be
reduced<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.940> that's<00:02:18.540> because<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.530> this

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
reduced and that's because on this

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.449 
reduced and that's because on this
molecule<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:21.810> have<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.349> carbon<00:02:22.680> oxygen

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
molecule we have the carbon oxygen

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.210 
molecule we have the carbon oxygen
double<00:02:23.640> bond<00:02:24.239> while<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.230> case<00:02:25.590> this

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
double bond while in this case this

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.270 
double bond while in this case this
carbon<00:02:26.849> oxygen<00:02:27.060> double<00:02:27.480> bond<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.319> basically

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
carbon oxygen double bond is basically

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.259 
carbon oxygen double bond is basically
transformed<00:02:30.269> into<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.750> hemiacetal<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:33.000> is

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
transformed into a hemiacetal so this is

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.949 
transformed into a hemiacetal so this is
the<00:02:33.450> hemiacetal<00:02:34.129> version<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.280> this<00:02:36.150> molecule

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
the hemiacetal version of this molecule

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.380 
the hemiacetal version of this molecule
here<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.590> recall<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.209> hemiacetals

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
here and recall that hemiacetals

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.770 
here and recall that hemiacetals
do<00:02:39.750> not<00:02:39.930> undergo<00:02:40.640> reduction<00:02:41.640> reactions<00:02:42.629> so

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
do not undergo reduction reactions so

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.350 
do not undergo reduction reactions so
basically<00:02:43.379> if<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.739> want<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.340> protect<00:02:44.700> our

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
basically if we want to protect our

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.020 
basically if we want to protect our
sugar<00:02:45.959> molecule<00:02:46.739> from<00:02:47.010> undergoing<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.410 
sugar molecule from undergoing a
reduction<00:02:48.540> reaction<00:02:49.010> we<00:02:50.010> transform<00:02:50.879> it<00:02:51.180> into

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
reduction reaction we transform it into

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.530 
reduction reaction we transform it into
the<00:02:51.840> cyclic<00:02:52.489> hemiacetal<00:02:53.489> version<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:54.060> our

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the cyclic hemiacetal version of our

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.250 
the cyclic hemiacetal version of our
sugar<00:02:55.260> molecule<00:02:55.980> now<00:02:56.610> even<00:02:57.209> though<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.659> have<00:02:57.930> a

of a reducing agent such as sodium

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.229 
of a reducing agent such as sodium
borohydrate<00:03:09.450> will<00:03:10.110> be<00:03:10.440> reduced<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:11.760> this

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
borohydrate will be reduced and as this

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.990 
borohydrate will be reduced and as this
is<00:03:12.540> depleted<00:03:13.409> as<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.159> reduced<00:03:14.640> our

cyclic<00:03:15.840> version<00:03:16.379> will<00:03:16.650> begin<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.540> transform

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
cyclic version will begin to transform

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.350 
cyclic version will begin to transform
into<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.349> version<00:03:20.069> so<00:03:20.250> by<00:03:20.489> legitly<00:03:21.060> ours

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
will be shifted to this side so at

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.080 
will be shifted to this side so at
equilibrium<00:03:31.019> our<00:03:31.440> equilibrium<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.849> this

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
equilibrium our equilibrium of this

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.990 
equilibrium our equilibrium of this
reaction<00:03:33.620> interconversion<00:03:34.760> basically<00:03:35.760> lies

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
reaction interconversion basically lies

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.380 
reaction interconversion basically lies
very<00:03:36.720> far<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.709> left<00:03:37.739> side<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:38.790> as<00:03:39.030> we

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
very far to the left side but as we

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.960 
very far to the left side but as we
deplete<00:03:39.930> this<00:03:40.230> as<00:03:40.409> we<00:03:40.650> use<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.099> up<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:41.580> the

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
deplete this as we use it up in the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.600 
deplete this as we use it up in the
presence<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.720> let's<00:03:42.989> say<00:03:43.200> sodium<00:03:43.739> borohydrate

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
presence of let's say sodium borohydrate

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.390 
presence of let's say sodium borohydrate
this<00:03:45.420> will<00:03:45.690> basically<00:03:45.959> shift<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.129> right

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
this will basically shift to the right

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.509 
this will basically shift to the right
side<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.420> will<00:03:48.659> interconvert<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.890> to

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
side and this will interconvert in to

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.179 
side and this will interconvert in to
this<00:03:51.060> open<00:03:51.720> straight<00:03:52.080> chain<00:03:52.409> a<00:03:52.650> cyclic

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
this open straight chain a cyclic

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.820 
this open straight chain a cyclic
version<00:03:53.640> eventually<00:03:54.330> we're<00:03:54.780> going<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.260> use<00:03:55.530> up

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
version eventually we're going to use up

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.830 
version eventually we're going to use up
all<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.099> this<00:03:56.400> cyclic<00:03:56.909> because<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.480> will<00:03:57.629> all

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
all of this cyclic because it will all

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.610 
all of this cyclic because it will all
convert<00:03:58.349> into<00:03:59.189> our<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.700> cyclic<00:04:00.299> form<00:04:00.629> now<00:04:01.200> what

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
convert into our a cyclic form now what

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.429 
convert into our a cyclic form now what
exactly<00:04:01.769> is<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.909> reaction<00:04:03.540> mechanism<00:04:03.750> by

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
exactly is the reaction mechanism by

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.670 
exactly is the reaction mechanism by
which<00:04:04.470> our<00:04:05.180> open<00:04:06.180> molecule<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.019> cyclic

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
which our open molecule the a cyclic

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.490 
which our open molecule the a cyclic
version<00:04:08.189> undergoes<00:04:09.000> our<00:04:09.500> reduction

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
version undergoes our reduction

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.070 
version undergoes our reduction
reactions<00:04:11.189> so<00:04:11.370> let's<00:04:11.610> use<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.540> sodium

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
reactions so let's use the sodium

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.789 
reactions so let's use the sodium
borohydrate<00:04:13.950> as<00:04:14.129> our<00:04:14.790> example<00:04:15.269> so<00:04:16.109> sodium

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
borohydrate as our example so sodium

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.129 
borohydrate as our example so sodium
borohydrate<00:04:17.609> looks<00:04:17.940> something<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.900> we

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
borohydrate looks something like this we

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.920 
borohydrate looks something like this we
have<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.530> boron<00:04:20.100> attached

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
have the boron attached

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.950 
have the boron attached
so<00:04:21.290> for<00:04:21.590> H<00:04:21.859> Adams<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.669> so<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:23.150> contains<00:04:23.630> a

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
so for H Adams and so it contains a

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.530 
so for H Adams and so it contains a
negative<00:04:24.590> charge<00:04:24.889> and<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.669> sodium<00:04:26.210> which

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
negative charge and the sodium which

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.570 
negative charge and the sodium which
contains<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.229> positive<00:04:27.710> charge<00:04:27.949> will

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
contains a positive charge will

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.020 
contains a positive charge will
basically<00:04:28.910> be<00:04:29.539> found<00:04:29.870> in<00:04:30.169> close<00:04:30.470> proximity

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
basically be found in close proximity

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.480 
basically be found in close proximity
because<00:04:32.030> we<00:04:32.300> have<00:04:32.770> electrostatic<00:04:33.770> attraction

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
because we have electrostatic attraction

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.909 
because we have electrostatic attraction
between<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:35.360> negative<00:04:35.900> charge<00:04:36.169> on<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.620> boron

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
between the negative charge on the boron

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.830 
between the negative charge on the boron
and<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.850> positive<00:04:38.360> charge<00:04:38.690> on<00:04:38.990> our<00:04:39.320> sodium<00:04:40.039> so

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
and the positive charge on our sodium so

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.810 
and the positive charge on our sodium so
basically<00:04:41.840> in<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.169> first<00:04:42.380> step<00:04:42.830> because<00:04:43.580> we

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
basically in the first step because we

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.390 
basically in the first step because we
have<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:44.419> D<00:04:44.690> glucose<00:04:45.199> that<00:04:45.500> contains<00:04:46.100> the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
have this D glucose that contains the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.210 
have this D glucose that contains the
aldehyde<00:04:47.060> group<00:04:47.419> we<00:04:47.570> have<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.410> carbon<00:04:48.979> oxygen

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
aldehyde group we have the carbon oxygen

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.350 
aldehyde group we have the carbon oxygen
double<00:04:49.610> bond<00:04:50.240> one<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.169> these<00:04:51.470> H<00:04:51.919> molecules<00:04:52.880> one

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
double bond one of these H molecules one

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.110 
double bond one of these H molecules one
of<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:53.720> hydride<00:04:54.590> atoms<00:04:55.250> will<00:04:55.760> basically

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120

water molecule in close proximity to

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.950 
water molecule in close proximity to
this<00:05:36.380> this<00:05:37.130> will<00:05:37.520> basically<00:05:37.760> act<00:05:38.300> as<00:05:38.599> the<00:05:38.750> base

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
this this will basically act as the base

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.010 
this this will basically act as the base
Lewis<00:05:39.470> base<00:05:39.880> deprotonating<00:05:40.880> our<00:05:41.090> water

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020

molecule<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:43.250> form<00:05:43.280> this<00:05:44.180> final<00:05:45.139> reduced

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
molecule to form this final reduced

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.120 
molecule to form this final reduced
sugar<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:46.940> basically<00:05:47.449> we<00:05:47.750> take<00:05:47.780> our<00:05:48.349> reducing

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
sugar so basically we take our reducing

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.240 
sugar so basically we take our reducing
sugar<00:05:49.460> we<00:05:50.030> mix<00:05:50.360> it<00:05:50.570> with<00:05:50.599> sodium<00:05:51.320> borohydride

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
sugar we mix it with sodium borohydride

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.210 
sugar we mix it with sodium borohydride
and<00:05:52.580> we<00:05:53.120> produce<00:05:53.449> our<00:05:53.960> reduced<00:05:54.470> product<00:05:55.070> in

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
and we produce our reduced product in

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.510 
and we produce our reduced product in
which<00:05:55.520> this<00:05:56.210> carbon<00:05:56.960> oxygen<00:05:57.560> double<00:05:57.710> bond<00:05:58.310> the

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
which this carbon oxygen double bond the

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.180 
which this carbon oxygen double bond the
carbonyl<00:05:59.120> group<00:05:59.150> has<00:05:59.840> been<00:06:00.169> transformed<00:06:00.979> into

carbonyl group has been transformed into
our<00:06:01.729> alcohol<00:06:02.510> so<00:06:03.199> we<00:06:03.349> see<00:06:03.650> that<00:06:04.190> when<00:06:04.669> we

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.450

reduce<00:06:05.360> sugar<00:06:05.659> molecules<00:06:06.530> we<00:06:06.800> basically

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
reduce sugar molecules we basically

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.839 
reduce sugar molecules we basically
transform<00:06:08.240> an<00:06:08.449> aldehyde<00:06:09.229> or<00:06:09.470> a<00:06:09.919> ketone<00:06:09.949> group

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
transform an aldehyde or a ketone group

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.980 
transform an aldehyde or a ketone group
in<00:06:11.389> the<00:06:11.539> case<00:06:11.810> of<00:06:12.080> ketosis<00:06:12.979> into<00:06:13.789> an<00:06:14.000> alcohol

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
in the case of ketosis into an alcohol

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.339 
in the case of ketosis into an alcohol

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:21.070 
group now any sugar that exists
predominantly<00:06:19.250> in<00:06:19.460> its<00:06:19.699> cyclic<00:06:20.150> form<00:06:20.479> will

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
predominantly in its cyclic form will

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.219 
predominantly in its cyclic form will
form<00:06:21.530> a<00:06:21.680> small<00:06:22.039> amount<00:06:22.430> of<00:06:22.669> a<00:06:22.880> cyclic

carbonyl group it can be reduced and

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.330

such reducible sugars are known as
juicing<00:06:33.760> sugars<00:06:34.270> so<00:06:34.990> most<00:06:35.590> sugars<00:06:36.160> can<00:06:36.460> in
