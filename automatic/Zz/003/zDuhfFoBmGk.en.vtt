00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.370
 well we are all here mission believe and 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.000
 we are here with new characters that 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.140
 It was 3 I do not know that as you can see it seems like a 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 sweetie 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:17.570
 how to dry and get off site we are not going to 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.570
 teach the dance since we are 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.810
 and well, this guy what he does is 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.310
 attacking distance in theories an email 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.400
 it's all scaled ap 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.710
 and let's explain your skills worth 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.530
 good passively appear souls for 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.809
 here when the minions die or 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.270
 champions die minion do not come out 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.650
 always but if he dies for example this 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.020
 child in the big middle if it always comes out 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.320
 you are going to see who goes out 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.220
 the soul comes out 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.829
 gordon 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.809
 we see how the soul has come out 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 and good the soul what it does is give you 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.260
 magic resistance armor and power of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.260
 skill passively as you see here 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.320
 but also 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.129
 let's explain it 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 and also will open them and see that the q 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.520
 basically what it does is that the ones 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.200
 auto-attack remove more unconditional damage 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 based on how many souls you have 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.880
 collected and in your beams with which 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.260
 that's why I have thinking about 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.300
 make us this type of voucher 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.680
 between that and that the other skills do not 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.240
 is that they seem too much to me 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.689
 good 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.210
 well then we have the active that what 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.220
 does it 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.760
 Well, to see you can come because it's worth 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.210
 I want to say hi what do you see and what 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.710
 I bring option 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.340
 but I can also go if he's worth 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.740
 there we are as you have seen perfect 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.070
 well we have come here to 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.070
 explain us the w and the w as you see 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.470
 It is an area where area drops of a 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.990
 shield worth 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.180
 and I'm going to throw you the area and go to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.820
 appear a pretty big aura me 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.950
 I can push up that stop 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.200
 as you see here and if you use the value and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.210
 is going towards me as you see that is 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.610
 totally ope and give me the shield to me 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.730
 also because it has gone towards me 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.790
 has much the w range the spot ea 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.400
 lawns and those things and that is for 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.870
 protect that is pretty bestial worth 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.790
 that I already have here 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.489
 you see that I just throw at him and he gives him a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.180
 shield and now he wants to stop here 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:40.200
 maximum is worth 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.819
 I was quite curious very curious yes 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.510
 but it will be worth comunitat also serves 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.450
 much 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.569
 well here on the island we will explain and 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.879
 we can basically push it like you see 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.430
 here or we can if we want to attract what 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.590
 does more and we bring it as you see the range 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.800
 It's not very big or the auto-tanks 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.890
 not at all just the cv 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.750
 and here we have the last t is like a 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.480
 kind of jail come but only you 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.170
 can pull like this in plan focused towards 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.630
 the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.880
 I would say that a defensive measure for 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.770
 when they are going to go the strip and what 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.890
 does the ultimate is to get enough damage 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.170
 escalated to one of ape and let slow down 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.430
 to people 99 percent during the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.430
 seconds worth 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.250
 then you can 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.110
 that has to be used as a defensive measure 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.500
 and as you can see, it has a pretty lace 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.060
 big 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.890
 you also have to keep in mind that the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.130
 last t well 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.870
 As you can see, when someone has 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.460
 Caught a wall the other walls 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.420
 they take less life 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.410
 well, good 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.290
 I you character I'm going to try to ride 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.750
 because the q 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.780
 makes it have a passive damage look how 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.109
 I hurt him magically that's not taught 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.609
 you see that it has left magical more 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.519
 late if you want to go you have money and already 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.950
 publish it does not give us the same as good 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.280
 that's why most tried to ride 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.290
 but we'll see how it is because good 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.560
 such and what I hope you liked 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.530
 this character 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.370
 has a potential has strange things 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.019
 the truth and nothing quite strange because 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.450
 there are favorites to subscribe what you want 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.450
 see you soon and now
