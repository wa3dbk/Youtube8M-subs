more than myself but the bottom line is
that<00:02:30.459> there's<00:02:31.030> something<00:02:31.630> going<00:02:31.900> on<00:02:32.020> here<00:02:32.080> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that there's something going on here and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.350 
that there's something going on here and
there's<00:02:33.280> definitely<00:02:33.820> something<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.330> be

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
there's definitely something to be

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.070 
there's definitely something to be
concerned<00:02:34.870> with<00:02:35.080> no<00:02:35.980> matter<00:02:36.630> no<00:02:37.630> matter<00:02:37.660> what

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
concerned with no matter no matter what

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.060 
concerned with no matter no matter what
you<00:02:38.170> think<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.500> bees<00:02:38.770> because<00:02:39.070> these<00:02:39.610> these

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
you think of bees because these these

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.699 
you think of bees because these these
crops<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.370> we<00:02:42.550> rely<00:02:42.880> on<00:02:43.060> our<00:02:43.090> are<00:02:43.709> definitely

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
crops that we rely on our are definitely

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.229 
crops that we rely on our are definitely
going<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.980> be<00:02:45.070> affected<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:48.760> I

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
going to be affected and we and we I

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.479 
going to be affected and we and we I
mean<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.780> feel<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:50.590> whole<00:02:51.100> thing<00:02:51.340> with
