00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.710
 Carl Jung and the computer 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.779
 turns on 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.869
 but I had no idea what I could 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.910
 see in the big box that brought dad 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.170
 thought that maybe it was a gift 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.170
 special for him 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:35.620
 it's a surprise, hey, you're not going to give me a 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:39.060
 I embrace rather not to the best is a 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.060
 giant dinosaur egg 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.830
 true dad do not listen to dad 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.800
 let's take it to the little room to see 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.440
 what's in the box 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.680
 and I was very curious to see what 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.460
 what was inside the box 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.070
 this is a computer that I was very 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.530
 disappointed and I expected the surprise 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.930
 just for him I'll show you how 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.790
 works as soon as I plugged it in 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.790
 brought a drawing program for you 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.480
 in the poop there is a cat that you look at 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.480
 final it was true that there was a dinosaur 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.520
 in the box what you can draw in 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.450
 the computer and print your drawing 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.240
 I have my colors 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.750
 look at you draw moving this is called 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.750
 mouse 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.840

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.830
 So Liu wanted to draw with him 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.120
 computer I want to draw with the mouse is 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.120
 a little complicated 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.280
 play with the mouse 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.380
 let's print it and paint it with 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.689
 colors by hand seems to you later 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.819

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.890
 fado wanted to continue playing with the 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:04.170
 computer although the truth is that it was 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.170
 much easier to paint with colorines 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.420
 no gilbert comes down from there darling where 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.550
 are the pink diapers and I wanted 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.099
 print another dinosaur to go back to 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.590
 Coloring had seen him as a mom 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.980
 he hit a button and he wanted to do what 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.980
 same 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:26.280

 Touch it when you are with dad and with mom 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.660
 I was relieved to know 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.090
 that he had not broken the computer and not 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.190
 It took him a while to discover explain with the box 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.900
 it was more fun than playing with 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.830
 computer 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.950
