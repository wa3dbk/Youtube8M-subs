00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
can still snipe from far away not too

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.519 
can still snipe from far away not too
far<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.430> Nate<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:27.599> sometimes<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
far and Nate because sometimes the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.250 
far and Nate because sometimes the
accuracy<00:00:29.340> seems<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> little<00:00:30.449> bit<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
accuracy seems to be a little bit of and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.790 
accuracy seems to be a little bit of and
also<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.790> close<00:00:33.120> range<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.870> recoil<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.649> so

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
also on close range the recoil it's so

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
also on close range the recoil it's so
hard<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> manage<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.880> sometimes<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.750> will

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
hard to manage and sometimes you will

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.720 
hard to manage and sometimes you will
miss<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> shots<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.860> wish<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.399> had<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
miss all the shots you wish you had to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.690 
miss all the shots you wish you had to
make<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:40.079> sometimes<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.649> will<00:00:40.770> perform<00:00:41.250> very

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
make a so sometimes it will perform very

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.779 
make a so sometimes it will perform very
well<00:00:41.850> sometime<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.200> would<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.620> throw<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> on

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
well sometime you would just throw it on

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.540 
well sometime you would just throw it on
the<00:00:44.940> ground<00:00:45.149> maybe<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.350> my<00:00:46.590> experience<00:00:46.860> but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the ground maybe just my experience but

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
the ground maybe just my experience but
that's<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> experienced<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.829> let's

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that's what I experienced and now let's

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
that's what I experienced and now let's
take<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> look<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.700> weapon<00:00:51.120> against

zoom but the Noma red dot and I should
the<00:01:47.570> first<00:01:47.870> shot<00:01:48.110> at<00:01:48.140> didn't<00:01:48.530> know<00:01:48.590> if<00:01:48.650> I<00:01:48.800> hit

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
the first shot at didn't know if I hit

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.790 
the first shot at didn't know if I hit
him<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:49.400> equipped<00:01:49.729> Boston<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:50.570> as<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:51.260> went<00:01:51.620> on

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
him and equipped Boston but as a went on

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.000 
him and equipped Boston but as a went on
Barston<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.760> recoil<00:01:53.300> was<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:53.840> bad<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.470> I'm

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
Barston the recoil was so bad and I'm

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.010 
Barston the recoil was so bad and I'm
telling<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.940> result<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.479> control<00:01:56.869> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
telling you the result to control the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.609 
telling you the result to control the
recoil<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:58.430> parent<00:01:59.150> of<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.330> recoil<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.229> very

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
recoil the parent of the recoil is very

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.710 
recoil the parent of the recoil is very
weird<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.280> it's<00:02:01.520> hard<00:02:01.729> to<00:02:01.820> control<00:02:02.330> not

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
weird so it's hard to control not

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.770 
weird so it's hard to control not
because<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.229> recoil<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:03.950> too<00:02:04.369> high<00:02:04.580> so<00:02:05.420> was<00:02:05.750> a

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
because the recoil is too high so was a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.719 
because the recoil is too high so was a
really<00:02:06.290> strange<00:02:06.619> pattern<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.220> couldn't<00:02:07.610> seem

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
really strange pattern I couldn't seem

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.669 
really strange pattern I couldn't seem
to<00:02:07.790> control<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.390> gun<00:02:08.630> i<00:02:08.660> miss<00:02:09.020> all<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.410> shots

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
to control the gun i miss all the shots

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.910 
to control the gun i miss all the shots
and<00:02:10.040> he<00:02:10.280> managed<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.760> run<00:02:10.910> away<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:12.680> was

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and he managed to run away so this was

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.910

you have the option on going snipers you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.920

have the option of going on clothes and
media<00:03:03.200> ranging<00:03:03.590> engagements<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:05.030> not

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
media ranging engagements but it's not

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.080 
media ranging engagements but it's not
the<00:03:05.540> best<00:03:05.810> on<00:03:06.170> each<00:03:06.530> one<00:03:06.800> yes<00:03:07.459> it's<00:03:07.790> better

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
the best on each one yes it's better

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.300 
the best on each one yes it's better
because<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:09.019> have<00:03:09.170> more<00:03:09.380> damage<00:03:09.799> maybe<00:03:10.010> then

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
because you have more damage maybe then

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.780 
because you have more damage maybe then
AK<00:03:10.910> but<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.330> K<00:03:11.600> has<00:03:11.900> more<00:03:12.320> ammunition<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
AK but the K has more ammunition on the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.000 
AK but the K has more ammunition on the
magazine<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:14.630> easier<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.260> control<00:03:15.470> it's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
magazine and it's easier to control it's

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.250 
magazine and it's easier to control it's
easier<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.519> get<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.730> hash

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
easier to get a hash

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.380 
easier to get a hash
not<00:03:17.349> because<00:03:18.099> you<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.400> more<00:03:18.640> bullets<00:03:19.120> maybe

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
not because you have more bullets maybe

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.360 
not because you have more bullets maybe
higher<00:03:19.780> rate<00:03:20.019> of<00:03:20.049> fire<00:03:20.409> so<00:03:20.769> depends<00:03:21.129> on<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
higher rate of fire so depends on the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.089 
higher rate of fire so depends on the
situation<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:23.019> my<00:03:23.230> advice<00:03:23.260> if<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.829> want<00:03:24.010> to

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
situation so my advice if you want to

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.610 
situation so my advice if you want to
use<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.430> weapon<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.480> need<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.780> be<00:03:26.319> able

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
use this weapon is you need to be able

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.880 
use this weapon is you need to be able
to<00:03:27.129> feel<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.000> gun<00:03:28.360> especially<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.290> recoil<00:03:29.799> if

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
to feel the gun especially the recoil if

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.080 
to feel the gun especially the recoil if
you<00:03:30.010> want<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.340> warm<00:03:30.519> medium<00:03:30.730> range

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
you want to warm medium range

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.350 
you want to warm medium range
engagements<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:32.010> not<00:03:33.010> trying<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.549> shoot<00:03:34.060> too

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
engagements and not trying to shoot too

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.479 
engagements and not trying to shoot too

fast because you're gonna lose track of

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.550 
fast because you're gonna lose track of
where<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.269> bullets<00:03:37.599> are<00:03:37.750> going<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.260> you're

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
distance like the holder 762 rifles I

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.640 
distance like the holder 762 rifles I
will<00:06:02.920> recommend<00:06:03.360> finding<00:06:04.360> a<00:06:04.690> green<00:06:05.050> tape<00:06:05.440> if

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
will recommend finding a green tape if

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.110 
will recommend finding a green tape if
you<00:06:05.770> plan<00:06:06.040> on<00:06:06.190> sniping<00:06:06.610> with<00:06:06.790> this<00:06:06.940> weapon

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
you plan on sniping with this weapon

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.440 
you plan on sniping with this weapon
because<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:08.470> the<00:06:09.190> more<00:06:09.520> velocity<00:06:09.940> of<00:06:10.330> the

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
because the the more velocity of the

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.510 
because the the more velocity of the
higher<00:06:11.080> velocity<00:06:11.590> of<00:06:11.680> the<00:06:11.770> bullet<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.340> the

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
higher velocity of the bullet and the

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.790 
higher velocity of the bullet and the
more<00:06:12.730> accuracy<00:06:13.300> will<00:06:13.990> really<00:06:14.410> boost<00:06:14.590> the

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
more accuracy will really boost the

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.550 
more accuracy will really boost the
performance<00:06:15.010> of<00:06:15.580> this<00:06:15.760> rifle<00:06:16.170> we<00:06:17.170> have<00:06:17.290> also

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
performance of this rifle we have also

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.790 
performance of this rifle we have also
medium<00:06:18.550> recoil<00:06:19.030> in<00:06:19.270> medium<00:06:19.600> weight<00:06:19.840> the

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
medium recoil in medium weight the

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.050 
medium recoil in medium weight the
recoil<00:06:21.190> is<00:06:21.370> not<00:06:21.670> that<00:06:22.060> I<00:06:22.240> but<00:06:22.780> considering<00:06:24.060> the

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
recoil is not that I but considering the

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.600 
recoil is not that I but considering the
pattern<00:06:25.600> of<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:25.990> recoil<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.680> may<00:06:26.830> be<00:06:26.890> really

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
pattern of the recoil it may be really

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.240 
pattern of the recoil it may be really
hard<00:06:27.880> to<00:06:28.120> control<00:06:28.660> if<00:06:28.960> you<00:06:29.140> spend<00:06:29.560> the<00:06:29.830> trigger

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
hard to control if you spend the trigger

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.600 
hard to control if you spend the trigger
too<00:06:30.640> fast<00:06:31.290> also<00:06:32.290> you<00:06:32.350> can<00:06:32.440> put<00:06:32.740> a<00:06:32.770> lot<00:06:33.130> of<00:06:33.160> optic

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
too fast also you can put a lot of optic

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.640 
too fast also you can put a lot of optic
the<00:06:33.730> sniper<00:06:33.970> optics<00:06:34.630> you<00:06:34.930> could<00:06:35.110> close<00:06:35.350> range

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
the sniper optics you could close range

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.830 
the sniper optics you could close range
hop<00:06:35.890> tix<00:06:36.250> you<00:06:36.550> can<00:06:36.760> just<00:06:37.210> put<00:06:37.420> whatever<00:06:37.630> you

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
hop tix you can just put whatever you

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.620 
hop tix you can just put whatever you
want<00:06:37.960> on<00:06:38.320> this<00:06:38.470> weapon<00:06:38.680> I<00:06:39.300> recommend<00:06:40.300> coming

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.500 
reason so that's it guys for this weapon
I<00:06:59.440> had<00:06:59.950> some<00:07:00.190> bad<00:07:00.370> experience<00:07:00.970> with<00:07:01.120> it<00:07:01.270> but

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
I had some bad experience with it but

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.530 
I had some bad experience with it but
because<00:07:01.660> I<00:07:01.900> didn't<00:07:02.500> know<00:07:02.530> the<00:07:02.740> weapon<00:07:03.070> yet<00:07:03.280> I

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
because I didn't know the weapon yet I

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.650 
because I didn't know the weapon yet I
expected<00:07:04.540> like<00:07:05.260> a<00:07:06.190> really<00:07:06.760> good<00:07:06.940> sniper<00:07:07.180> rifle

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.660 
expected like a really good sniper rifle

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.450 
expected like a really good sniper rifle
a<00:07:07.690> really<00:07:07.990> good<00:07:08.140> battle<00:07:08.470> rifle<00:07:08.920> but<00:07:09.340> I<00:07:09.370> think

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
a really good battle rifle but I think

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.750 
a really good battle rifle but I think
it's<00:07:09.760> a<00:07:09.910> really<00:07:09.940> balanced<00:07:10.750> 762<00:07:11.530> rifle<00:07:11.980> so

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
it's a really balanced 762 rifle so

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.580 
it's a really balanced 762 rifle so
that's<00:07:13.270> it<00:07:13.390> guys<00:07:13.480> thank<00:07:14.170> you<00:07:14.230> for<00:07:14.380> watching
