have tried the lemon line just out of a
packet<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.219> decided<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.880> switch<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.570> up

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
packet but I decided to switch it up

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
kind but the lemon line sounded

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.380 
kind but the lemon line sounded
appealing<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> decided<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.390> yeah

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this stuff is awesome I use this all the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.189 
this stuff is awesome I use this all the
time<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:29.429> actually<00:00:30.210> use<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.779> kind<00:00:31.080> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
time I actually use this kind of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.959 
time I actually use this kind of
filtering<00:00:31.590> off<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.160> pre<00:00:32.460> workouts

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
filtering off and on pre workouts

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.729 
filtering off and on pre workouts
I<00:00:33.030> know<00:00:33.090> people<00:00:33.540> usually<00:00:33.960> consider<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
I know people usually consider this a

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.850 
I know people usually consider this a
pre-workout<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.940> don't<00:00:36.590> I'll<00:00:37.590> use

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
pre-workout but I don't I'll use

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.080 
pre-workout but I don't I'll use
something<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.190> lot<00:00:38.309> stronger<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:39.000> my

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
something a lot stronger for my

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.569 
something a lot stronger for my
pre-workout<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:40.219> when<00:00:41.219> I'm<00:00:41.340> cycling

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
pre-workout and then when I'm cycling

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.880 
pre-workout and then when I'm cycling
off<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.629> switch<00:00:43.170> over<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.620> stuff

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
off I will switch over to this stuff

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.790 
off I will switch over to this stuff
because<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.850> go<00:00:45.030> sit<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:46.050> only<00:00:46.170> use<00:00:46.500> like

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
because I can go sit I can only use like

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.139 
because I can go sit I can only use like
so<00:00:47.039> let's<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.579> serving<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.300> two<00:00:49.140> scoops

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
so let's see one serving is two scoops

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.680 
so let's see one serving is two scoops
which<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:52.579> 100<00:00:53.579> milligrams<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.239> caffeine<00:00:54.390> so

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
which is a 100 milligrams of caffeine so

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
which is a 100 milligrams of caffeine so
that's<00:00:54.840> not<00:00:55.020> even<00:00:55.379> very<00:00:56.190> much<00:00:56.489> compared<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that's not even very much compared to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.590 
that's not even very much compared to
most<00:00:57.899> other<00:00:58.850> pre-workouts<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.359> everything

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
most other pre-workouts and everything

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.680 
most other pre-workouts and everything
in<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.140> human<00:01:01.260> body<00:01:01.590> typically<00:01:02.359> allows<00:01:03.359> like

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
in the human body typically allows like

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.620 
in the human body typically allows like
400<00:01:04.290> grams<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.830> something<00:01:05.159> -<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.790> caffeine<00:01:06.570> per

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
400 grams or something - of caffeine per

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.520 
400 grams or something - of caffeine per
day<00:01:07.520> but<00:01:08.520> yeah<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.000> isn't<00:01:09.299> bad<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
day but yeah so this isn't bad at all I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.969 
day but yeah so this isn't bad at all I
actually<00:01:11.630> like<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.869> flavor<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.290> lot<00:01:13.560> it's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
actually like this flavor a lot it's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.920 
actually like this flavor a lot it's
pretty<00:01:14.460> sour<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.720> looks<00:01:15.869> like

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
pretty sour this is what it looks like

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.359 
pretty sour this is what it looks like
in<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> shaker<00:01:16.380> I'm<00:01:16.680> getting<00:01:16.890> ready<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
in a shaker I'm getting ready to go the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.850 
in a shaker I'm getting ready to go the
gym<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.360> looks<00:01:18.540> pretty<00:01:19.110> gross<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
gym so it looks pretty gross but it

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
gym so it looks pretty gross but it
looks<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> whole<00:01:20.460> compete<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> cop<00:01:21.299> or

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
looks like the whole compete in a cop or

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.679 
looks like the whole compete in a cop or
something<00:01:21.920> but<00:01:22.920> yeah<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> two

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
something but yeah so I like the two

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.420 
something but yeah so I like the two
scoops<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> higher<00:01:26.040> grams<00:01:26.280> of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
scoops is just the higher grams of

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
scoops is just the higher grams of
caffeine<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:27.060> pretty<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.720> very<00:01:27.810> mild

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
caffeine it's pretty it's very mild

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.840 
caffeine it's pretty it's very mild
actually<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.829> even<00:01:29.130> tell<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.579> right<00:01:29.790> here

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
actually they even tell you right here

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.580 
actually they even tell you right here
you<00:01:30.659> probably<00:01:30.930> won't<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.170> able<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> too

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
you probably won't be able to see it too

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
you probably won't be able to see it too
much<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.549> tell<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.850> how<00:01:32.970> many<00:01:33.030> scoops

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
much but they tell you how many scoops

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.510 
much but they tell you how many scoops
so<00:01:33.840> two<00:01:33.900> scoops<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.740> old<00:01:35.009> four<00:01:35.310> scoops

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
so two scoops is my old four scoops

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.789 
so two scoops is my old four scoops
would<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.790> moderate<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.390> six<00:01:37.350> scoops<00:01:37.590> would

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
would be moderate and six scoops would

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.010 
would be moderate and six scoops would
be<00:01:37.920> intense

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
be intense

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.690 
be intense
I've<00:01:40.020> never<00:01:40.200> taken<00:01:40.439> six<00:01:40.829> scoops<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.310> I
