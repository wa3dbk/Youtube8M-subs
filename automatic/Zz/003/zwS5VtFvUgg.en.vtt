different of different phrases so

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.249

technically<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:25.000> mandarin<00:01:25.570> speaker<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.200> a

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
technically a mandarin speaker and a

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.020 
technically a mandarin speaker and a
Cantonese<00:01:26.740> speaker<00:01:27.100> would<00:01:27.310> not<00:01:27.550> really<00:01:27.880> be

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
Cantonese speaker would not really be

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.240 
Cantonese speaker would not really be
able<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.390> speak<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.750> one<00:01:29.080> another<00:01:29.110> but<00:01:30.070> we

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
able to speak to one another but we

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.240 
able to speak to one another but we
write<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.550> same<00:01:30.700> way<00:01:31.380> right<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.650> same<00:01:32.860> so<00:01:33.130> the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
write the same way right the same so the

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.399 
write the same way right the same so the
same<00:01:33.460> word<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:34.210> same<00:01:34.240> characters<00:01:34.960> are<00:01:35.110> used

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
same word the same characters are used

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.039 
same word the same characters are used
however<00:01:36.340> there<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:36.939> simplified<00:01:37.479> script<00:01:37.869> now

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
however there is simplified script now

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.410 
however there is simplified script now
so<00:01:38.409> it's<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.460> little<00:01:39.670> bit<00:01:39.759> confusing<00:01:39.909> but<00:01:40.270> all
