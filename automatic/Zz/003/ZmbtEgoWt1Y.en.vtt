00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.220
This is the LG G4.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.631
It sports a sweet camera, slightly curved
new design, and an awesome 2k display.

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:06.631
But before we get into this video I’d like
to know what kind of content you all are interested

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:07.631
in.

00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:09.430
Comparisons with the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, or
other phones?

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.410
Make sure your specific and leave a like and
comment down below.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.900
Anyway, let’s get into it.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.350
Starting things off with pricing and availability
the G4 will cost you $199 with a two year

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.030
contract for a 32GB device which is the same
as just about every other high end phone on

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.030
the market like the Galaxy S6 and iPhone 6
and it’s available from all of the four

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.829
major us carriers.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.670
As far as color options go, the G4 can be
bought with a leather or plastic back.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.389
Plastic color options include ceramic white,
titanium gray, and gold.

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:50.719
The leather options vary from a dark maroon
to a nice tan.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.290
And as soon as the links to the backs go live
i’ll be sure to link you all to them in

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.079
the description as soon as they become available

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.019
Getting into the unboxing, the G4 can be found
on top, and underneath is the 3000mAh removable

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.130
battery which does support Qualcomm Quick
Charge 2.0, however the charging port and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.250
cable on the other hand is only 1.8 amps compared
to the standard 2.1 found with the Galaxy

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.409
S6 but it’s still plenty fast for charging.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.409
The first thing I noticed upon picking up
the G4 was that, physically, it doesn’t

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.510
feel like a $700 phone.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.799
Its plastic back and metallic shiny edges
are okay, but they aren’t what I was expecting.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.570
For me a case is absolutely neccessary with
this phone because it’s incredibly slippery

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.920
and at least for me, a drop waiting to happen.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.090
However the build of the device isn’t all
negative, I’m a huge fan of the rear facing

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.710
buttons as LG has certainly made improvements.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.530
But even though the buttons are improved the
speaker isn’t.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.290
It’s moderately loud and inconveniently
placed on the back, an ideal place to be covered

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.979
up.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.569
Moving over to the front of the G4 we have
that beautiful 5.5 inch quad hd 2560x1440

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.859
display which looks pretty awesome.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.570
Stacked up next to 1080p displays like the
Moto X or HTC One (M8) I wasn’t able to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.540
notice a huge difference when scrolling through
app drawers and whatnot, but once I pulled

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.350
up some 4k video on YouTube the difference
was incredible.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.590
Of course the camera I’m using here doesn’t
do this phone justice but anyone coming from

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.280
a 1080p display will be very impressed.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.570
The only thing I wish LG would have changed
with the display is the bezels.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.730
I feel like LG definitely could’ve given
us a little bit more screen real estate and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.440
in the process made the phone look a bit sharper,
but it’s not that big of a deal.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.610
Performance wise the G4 performs right up
there with the M9 and GS6 as it packs a Snapdragon

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.340
808 hexa core processor clocked in at 1.8GHz.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.530
That combined with 3GB of ram makes multi
tasking through dozens of apps at time a breeze.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.410
Unlike most other devices I’ve tested there’s
been very few hiccups or stutters.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.690
As far as gaming goes it’s safe to say the
G4 powers through everything I’ve thrown

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.870
at it, but if anyone wants a more in depth
video going over benchmarks and how the G4

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.260
stacks up compared to the Galaxy S6, iPhone
6, or S6 Edge, be sure to let me know by leaving

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.570
a comment down below.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.660
Software is an area that relies mostly on
personal preference so don’t take too much

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.280
of what I’m about to say as fact.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.030
I feel that LG almost always seems to try
too hard in its software.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.120
For example, to me, the icons and wallpapers
don’t seem to go well at all with the look

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.870
Google’s moving towards.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.480
When compared to stock Android on the Nexus
5 I do cringe a bit at how LG has butchered

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.100
the whole layout.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.150
For example, the box icons just don’t look
good next to the stock google icons like play

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.070
store or any others like reddit or soundcloud.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.930
While this probably won’t bother most, it
does kinda annoy me.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.750
However, the great thing about Android is
that the software can be completely customized

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.840
by the user so if anyone does end up purchasing
the G4 be sure to check out my video that

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.710
goes over improving the visual looks of the
software and essentially making it a nexus.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.790
Anyway, there are some things LG added that
are pretty cool.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.220
For example, smart actions automatically turns
on wifi as soon as I get home, and it also

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.510
toggles it off when I leave home.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.280
Another awesome feature is Smart cleaning
which is great for people that don’t know

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.100
how or just don’t have the time to go through
and unclutter their device of unwanted files.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.560
Smart cleaning can be set up to remind you
to clean up your device every week, month,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.880
or not at all, so that’s pretty sweet.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.690
Moving on to the battery life, like I mentioned
earlier the G4 has a 3,000mAh battery but

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.510
this time around the latest G device is much
more energy efficient.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.250
Considering the display has 2k resolution
and is 5.5 inches I’ve been very impressed

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.710
with battery life.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.100
A typical example of battery life would be
today I unlocked my phone at 5:30 in the morning

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.320
at 100%.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.879
It’s now 8:00 pm and I have 20% left with
3 hours and 13 minutes of screen on time.

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.740
Throughout this day the majority of the screen
on time was spent watching video and I also

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.490
streamed a lot of music while the device was
locked.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.810
So it’s definitely safe to say battery life
shouldn’t be an issue for the vast majority

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:10.370
of people, but hey even if it is you can just
purchase a couple extra replacement batteries.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.389
As far as the camera goes, the G4 really takes
some great shots.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.520
I’m not camera pro, but I can definitely
say the G4 takes much better pics than my

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.460
old Moto X and just barely edges out the Samsung
Galaxy S6.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.400
Pictures are extremely sharp and not too saturated
or overexposed like on the S6.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.960
The rear facing camera isn’t something I
ever really use but it’s nice to see LG

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.090
being innovative.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.500
Gesture shutter allows the user to hold up
a fist which triggers a timer and take four

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.940
selfies in a row by open and closing your
first twice in a row.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.260
While I probably won’t ever use this feature,
it’s still something work mentioning.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.750
For only $199 the LG G4 is one of the best
devices on the market.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.030
It has fantastic battery life, stellar camera,
and killer specs.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.030
Is it worth it?

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.030
I would say it’s a definite yes, for more
information be sure to check out the link

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.030
in the description for the most up to date
pricing and availability on the G4.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.400
Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed this unboxing
and review, if you did be sure to give it

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.590
a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.550
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you all
next time.
