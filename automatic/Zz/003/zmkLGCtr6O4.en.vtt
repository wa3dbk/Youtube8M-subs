00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.230 
okay let's talk about what it takes to

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.789 
okay let's talk about what it takes to
make<00:00:04.230> our<00:00:04.410> own<00:00:04.589> bonsai<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:06.379> also<00:00:07.379> be<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.560> very

make our own bonsai and also be a very

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.040 
make our own bonsai and also be a very
simple<00:00:08.189> checklist<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.849> what<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.690> should<00:00:09.870> have

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
simple checklist of what you should have

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.480 
simple checklist of what you should have
before<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.530> get<00:00:10.740> started<00:00:12.559> first<00:00:13.559> course<00:00:14.190> need

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
before you get started first course need

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.380 
before you get started first course need
three<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:16.010> whichever<00:00:17.010> tree<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.490> choose<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
three and whichever tree you choose to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.060 
three and whichever tree you choose to
start<00:00:18.690> with<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:20.990> it'll<00:00:21.990> be<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> good<00:00:22.439> idea<00:00:22.800> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
start with and it'll be a good idea to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.429 
start with and it'll be a good idea to
do<00:00:23.279> some<00:00:23.609> pruning<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.630> tree<00:00:24.960> before<00:00:27.439> if

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
do some pruning on this tree before if

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.910 
do some pruning on this tree before if
we<00:00:28.710> put<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> pot<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.320> this

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
we put it in the in the pot so in this

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.600 
we put it in the in the pot so in this
case<00:00:32.570> we're<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.250> make<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> tree<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
case we're going to make the tree a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.940 
case we're going to make the tree a
little<00:00:35.790> shorter<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:38.850> need<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.120> once<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.480> pot

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
little shorter we need to once I pot

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.410 
little shorter we need to once I pot
course<00:00:41.390> bonsai<00:00:42.390> pots<00:00:43.280> come<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.489> holes<00:00:45.000> in

ceramic<00:00:58.140> pot<00:00:58.320> our<00:00:58.920> bonsai<00:00:59.340> soil<00:00:59.609> is<00:01:00.000> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
ceramic pot our bonsai soil is is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.910 
ceramic pot our bonsai soil is is
actually<00:01:01.520> flat<00:01:02.520> enough<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.449> don't

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
actually flat enough that if we don't

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.090 
actually flat enough that if we don't
put<00:01:04.920> something<00:01:05.280> over<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:05.700> holes<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.990> will

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
put something over these holes it will

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.810 
put something over these holes it will
run<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.640> bottom<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:10.490> what<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.640> do

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
run right out the bottom so what we do

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.530 
run right out the bottom so what we do
is<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:13.680> cut<00:01:14.580> ourselves<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
fall out of the pot in the first few

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.720 
fall out of the pot in the first few
weeks<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.530> its<00:02:41.830> new<00:02:42.160> life<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:43.300> we<00:02:44.370> put<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.430> wire

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
weeks of its new life is we put a wire

00:02:45.730 --> 00:03:01.130 
weeks of its new life is we put a wire
through<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.610> points<00:02:49.120> like<00:02:50.050> this

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:11.550 

this<00:03:09.510> kind<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.569> bend<00:03:10.810> those<00:03:10.989> out<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.409> way

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
this kind of bend those out of the way

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.400 
this kind of bend those out of the way
for<00:03:11.620> now<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.890> you're<00:03:14.890> ready<00:03:15.099> to<00:03:15.400> put<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.700> tree

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
for now so you're ready to put the tree

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.280 
for now so you're ready to put the tree
into<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.709> pot<00:03:18.090> we<00:03:19.090> will<00:03:19.120> Bend<00:03:19.599> these<00:03:19.840> wires

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
into the pot we will Bend these wires

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.930 
into the pot we will Bend these wires
across<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:21.489> root<00:03:21.700> ball<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:23.019> very<00:03:23.319> carefully

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
across the root ball and very carefully

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.789 
across the root ball and very carefully
twist<00:03:24.940> them<00:03:25.299> in<00:03:25.480> trim<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.290> way<00:03:26.440> extra

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
twist them in trim that the way extra

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.819 
twist them in trim that the way extra
