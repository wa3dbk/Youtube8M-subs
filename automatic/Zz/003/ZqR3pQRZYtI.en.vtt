00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.290
 fire and flame for this for this 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.380
 program I think I'll take a look 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.510
 Old follow only it was for a good three 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 from hate and let that be instagram there 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.610
 Mask great on hipster instagram 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.170
 photographers so if that's right 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.480
 understand then you actually have 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.700
 Instagram still in this video are few 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.590
 material how can you complete that 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.540
 Turn 0 80 degrees and into the other 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.950
 direction is full of bows I have to 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.050
 Quote different 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.510
 Times change times change you 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.950
 do you have for me instagram subway 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.630
 at instagram there can be so many 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.220
 still select different things so it 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.350
 it's too much of a choice already 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.270
 with filters and in all so easy 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.160
 here you are tricking here for a short time 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.839
 screen is ready is also funds 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.400
 at instagram you had to somehow on 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.870
 press the small button what is real 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.400
 annoying is because of course show how 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.420
 yourself or wenders films then meet 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.979
 you do not live the button yourself 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.360
 Alone is just that you have got 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.490
 not many options and then will 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.320
 so set as in the subway 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.210

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.979

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.470
 want to do 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.720
 you really have a lot of potential 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.030
 but unfortunately it never really happened 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.340
 in Germany not completely against 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.420
 instagram parents of the last episode of 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.770

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.780

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.520
 The shitty wine sounds like how 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.869
 wine and wine taste like me 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.090

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.140
 emphasis 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.940
 Does it really want someone else? 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.009
 is negative is right is saying to you 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.660
 once you do not think so too 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.740
 I should produce a video but 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.330
 do the villa think about the mourning? 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.440
 happens and you do not die 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.080
 just as if I had this 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.700
 all these spiritual effusions 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.480
 you do not own the absolutely none 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.770
 make sense 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.300
 but what in any case warned them too 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.540
 people with intellectual property too 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.400
 flood 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.410

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.890
 this function just that you can film 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060
 someday you push it and then later 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.769
 maybe I'll push it again 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.209
 goes with instagram but you can do it 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.130
 yes, even so much as you could 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.570

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.760
 always with these trends is always the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.470
 very beautiful women you are already 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.690
 times at instagram you can really with 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.060
 You can turn off at instagram 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.739
 different filters from a picture 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.630
 generate different emotions 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.050
 Look, that's the one I'm happy 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.050
 filter 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.280
 Now we take exactly the same picture 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:19.280
 and put black and white filter on it 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.739
 okay you see that's a picture though 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.750

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.019
