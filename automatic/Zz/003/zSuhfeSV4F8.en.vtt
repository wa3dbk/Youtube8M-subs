00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and black ops 1 and the caption they put

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.730

is every story has a beginning and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.480 
is every story has a beginning and
obviously<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.829> not<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.100> beginning<00:01:08.340> of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
obviously that's not the beginning of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
obviously that's not the beginning of
zombies<00:01:08.850> there's<00:01:09.060> way<00:01:09.509> more<00:01:09.539> story<00:01:09.960> line<00:01:10.109> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
zombies there's way more story line that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840 
zombies there's way more story line that
goes<00:01:10.259> on<00:01:10.469> before<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:10.950> those<00:01:11.250> maps<00:01:11.460> come<00:01:11.729> in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
goes on before those those maps come in

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.599 
goes on before those those maps come in
to<00:01:12.329> play<00:01:12.509> but<00:01:13.079> this<00:01:13.770> might<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.219> us<00:01:14.280> think

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
to play but this might make us think

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:17.209 
to play but this might make us think
that<00:01:14.759> there<00:01:14.909> could<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.299> map<00:01:16.070> coming<00:01:17.070> out

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
have time to do that to actually

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.970 
have time to do that to actually
Photoshop<00:02:20.230> off<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.620> put<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.830> together

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
Photoshop off and put it together

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.710 
Photoshop off and put it together
because<00:02:21.700> i'm<00:02:21.910> actually<00:02:22.090> at<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.390> beach<00:02:22.540> right

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
because i'm actually at the beach right

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.140 
because i'm actually at the beach right
now<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:22.870> vacation<00:02:23.380> but<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:24.670> interesting

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
now on vacation but that is interesting

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.050 
now on vacation but that is interesting
and<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.420> think<00:02:25.530> those<00:02:26.530> could<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:26.860> some<00:02:27.580> relation

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and I think those could be some relation

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.390 
and I think those could be some relation
to<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.480> notes<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.140> said<00:02:29.290> about<00:02:29.320> Metal<00:02:29.950> Men<00:02:30.130> I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
to the notes that said about Metal Men I

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.280 
to the notes that said about Metal Men I
think<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.300> nmap<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.020> going<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.200> have

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
think this nmap is going to have

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.900 
think this nmap is going to have
something<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.530> do<00:02:32.590> with<00:02:32.620> Metal<00:02:32.950> Men<00:02:33.100> some<00:02:33.700> kind

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
something to do with Metal Men some kind

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.900 
something to do with Metal Men some kind
of<00:02:34.000> maybe<00:02:34.270> robot<00:02:34.870> zombies<00:02:35.590> things<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.250> honestly

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
of maybe robot zombies things I honestly

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:37.950 
of maybe robot zombies things I honestly
couldn't<00:02:37.180> even<00:02:37.390> tell<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.570> right<00:02:37.720> now<00:02:37.750> they're

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
couldn't even tell you right now they're

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.540 
couldn't even tell you right now they're
they're<00:02:38.200> just<00:02:38.440> blowing<00:02:38.770> my<00:02:39.070> mind<00:02:39.100> with<00:02:39.460> these

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
they're just blowing my mind with these

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.610 
they're just blowing my mind with these
teasers<00:02:39.790> they're<00:02:40.600> all<00:02:40.810> over<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.110> place<00:02:41.140> but

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
teasers they're all over the place but

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.560 
teasers they're all over the place but
it's<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.860> lot<00:02:42.010> about<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.340> story<00:02:42.640> coming<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.480> an

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
it's a lot about the story coming to an

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.930 
it's a lot about the story coming to an
end<00:02:43.660> beginning<00:02:44.110> coming<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.710> end<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:45.490> lot

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
end beginning coming to the end a lot

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.000 
end beginning coming to the end a lot
about<00:02:46.030> before<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> whole<00:02:47.110> storyline<00:02:47.410> started

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
about before the whole storyline started

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.320 
about before the whole storyline started
so<00:02:48.460> I'm<00:02:48.550> thinking<00:02:48.610> they're<00:02:48.970> going<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.150> wrap<00:02:49.300> it

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
so I'm thinking they're going to wrap it

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.880 
so I'm thinking they're going to wrap it
all<00:02:49.660> up<00:02:49.690> with<00:02:49.960> his<00:02:50.050> final<00:02:50.320> deal<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:50.740> you're

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
all up with his final deal see you're

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.960 
all up with his final deal see you're
going<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.070> end<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> story<00:02:51.520> line<00:02:51.760> they're

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
going to end the story line they're

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.700 
going to end the story line they're
going<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.150> end<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.450> whole<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.930> whole<00:02:53.290> thing

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
going to end the whole the whole thing

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.380 
going to end the whole the whole thing
as<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:54.070> know<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.520> far<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.760> it's<00:02:55.060> really

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
as we know it so far and it's really

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.430 
as we know it so far and it's really
going<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.570> be<00:02:55.630> interesting<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.050> see<00:02:56.200> how<00:02:56.320> they
