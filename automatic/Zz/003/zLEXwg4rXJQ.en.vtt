00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 do not 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.129
 if the last weeks we brought 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.139
 our channel a small unboxing of the nh 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.300
 of 15 from the Austrian manufacturer noctua 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.009
 this time we have caught his predecessor 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.270
 so you can see the differences that 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.759
 the brand has entered into his vessel 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.380
 badge after a couple of years in the 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.939
 market it was foreseeable that the manufacturer 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.800
 launch an update of your 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.360
 star heatsink and although it keeps the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.489
 Design with double tower has seen 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.309
 modified its fans by the ene 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.980
 efe to 15 which have pw m 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.930
 for speed adjustment 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.670
 compatibility with all sockets 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.230
 current intel and amd of ones 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.480
 dimensions that although with fans 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.489
 included exceed its predecessor this 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.329
 it also happens with the weight that also 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.329
 it has been increased 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.080
 as we saw in the unboxing its packaging 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.850
 and presentation of accessories present 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.590
 a premium finish replacing the 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.250
 bags that were used in the nokia of 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.930
 14 per individual boxes 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.839
 amd intel mounting kit 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.030
 wm cable screwdriver and duplicator with 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.670
 the same function cables for reduction 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.880
 noise or thermal paste noctua nth 1 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.160
 they will come included with the product but 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.560
 They especially highlight the ene efe a 15 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.260
 these 2 140 mm fans 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.300
 they rotate from 300 to 1,500 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.190
 revolutions per minute and thanks to its 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.790
 limiter we can reduce it to the 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.590
 1200 using the wiring that includes 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.210
 some fans that at levels of 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.370
 low performance medium emit a sound 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.840
 practically inaudible but that at 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.530
 maximum performance yes they see 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.360
 increased this aspect 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.159
 If we consider the design of the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.500
 dissipator we see that it is traversed in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.270
 its two parts for a total of 67 pipe 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.150
 all of them copper with a coverage 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.210
 of nickel with respect to the 14-pass 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.990
 140 to 150 millimeters 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.850
 favoring the best way 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.850
 heat dissipation thanks to increased 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.560
 separation between your head pipes a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.640
 improvement that we liked is that despite 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.140
 that the size increases 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.090
 fans have larger dimensions 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.370
 that the aluminum block what 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.350
 will favor the flow of air 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.900
 and although we show your installation 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.210
 it's really simple besides 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.040
 having this large size and weight includes 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.860
 a metallic black plate that improves the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.090
 Fastening it to our motherboard 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.100
 we have found that at least 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.800
 accessories for intel match the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.840
 of the previous model with respect to its 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.180
 performance we have carried out several tests 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.460
 both with temperatures in stock and with 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.990
 temperature performing overclock we have 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.900
 performed the tests with a temperature 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.150
 22 degree environment with test like full 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.150
 mark burning test and prime 95 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.950
 we see how the temperatures at rest 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.150
 they are really low looking 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.310
 Increased gradually 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.210
 as we increase the voltage and the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.590
 overclocking level of 47 70 k that of 15 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.030
 has not only meant a mere 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.950
 update but in addition to 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.230
 modify the design by compatibilizing 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.390
 this with memories of high profile also 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.319
 has modified its performance being this 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.000
 superior to that of its successful predecessor 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.620
 the 15 is a heatsink that has 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.900
 a design that emits a great sensation 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.000
 of quality and with premium finishes 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.030
 is suitable for any type of task 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.040
 from gaming to overclock thanks to 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.900
 the inclusion of the ene efe to 15 the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.150
 Noise level at low and medium load is 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.099
 practically imperceptible something that 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.500
 high levels of it if it looks 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.329
 increased compatibility with all 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.670
 the current sockets great compatibility 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.530
 with memories of great height crowd of 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.800
 Accessories or ease of assembly 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.050
 they also stand out in the 15 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.790
 even so we believe that the color chosen in 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.440
 your ventilation is not the most successful anymore 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.500
 that does not match the current design of 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.580
 manufacturers to solve this does not act 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.290
 has launched a new range of 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.600
 fans modifying the color of the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.030
 but this will mean an increase in 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.320
 Spending its price seems somewhat elevated 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.510
 even being one of the best 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.790
 air heatsinks from the market and 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.410
 also something no less important its great 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.310
 size will prevent us from installing it 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.310
 in a large number of chassis 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.520
 does not act continuously in its upline 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.740
 and it brings us a very attractive product and 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.550
 with excellent performance despite 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.560
 some cons 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.610
 from pc components we recommend the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.610
 purchase of this product 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.079
 ah
