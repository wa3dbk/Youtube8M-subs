 the joinville price of six years 2700 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.410
 big track meters 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 we'll say it's a lot with ve 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.900
 and quality and some aliens a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.400
 very open race 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 we are going to file because I made you 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.340
 I have no group and coffee this week 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.960
 but it's a little bread because a little 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.540
 poisoned gift oumma effect quinté 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 very open but a quinté a very beautiful 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.300
 quinté a beautiful plateau 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 but as I repeat a race 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 pretty open 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.899
 and precisely we needed a 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.610
 specialist you are the specialist of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.620
 your selection we try to do for 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.890
 the best so my 8 year old guild favorite 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.160
 ac the 5 vino until the vanilla chf 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.110
 the 17 volcano du gard at low 12 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.829
 award winning balloon wins e3 a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.129
 brazza 18 flights 10 and the cdh wenger at 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.410
 low 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.840
 ok regarding your favorite number 8 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.239
 his build ac I have the cam very quickly s 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.229
 is held in scandinavia it started in 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.330
 France by a victory it was at 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.560
 marseille the other day unfortunate faulty 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.890
 while he was racing for a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.520
 square 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.500
 we buy with confidence we buy them from 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.060
 marseille he has he address this commitment 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.420
 or late wins the martens brothers 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.310
 have the top the pif as we say for 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 acquire horses from classes and at 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.520
 gains like like this one last 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.350
 it's a pretty cold horse 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.670
 is being seek but it 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.380
 still had resources I do not think 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.450
 for the win but for the places the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.100
 lot was already quality day there so 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.410
 there it will be déferré of the later ones the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 2700 meters from the big track do not go 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.690
 not disturb him 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.530
 good with him need the masks and 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.210
 the effort as long as possible 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.229
 still do the 3,400 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.420
 last meters no more 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.550
 so I think we can buy it back in 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.170
 confidence he is still evolving late from 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.520
 good earnings it seems to be a solid foundation 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.830
 we will have understood it wanted to oppose fire 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.300
 but the number five faces case then 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.729
 very very wrong at the beginning of a career 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.560
 she has since been fine and already not 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.759
 less than eleven successes this year so a 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.200
 on the course it's our race 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.930
 reference it was on May 15th at 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.610
 vincennes the price already will not see it 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.590
 the circles and she is leading 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.670
 she will resist the horse to the end 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.500
 outside especially that the field 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.910
 outside is going to gallop this is what 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.709
 day there she was really exciting to 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.030
 what had it countered to this crisis 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.650
 and that they make a mistake for 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.350
 finish but there had been a mano to mano 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.850
 for almost a kilometer and they 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.070
 did not give their part to dogs as 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.450
 it says in jargon is pushed back 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.950
 brilliantly all the attacks 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.750
 it's really a mare of great 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.070
 held this city ​​hauschka on it 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.959
 condemns especially not on his recent 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.190
 failure to capella is there the overcoats 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.900
 glaucous years ago she escaped the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.549
 vigilance of franck ouvrie in the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.650
 last turn she will have aligned again 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.420
 a stick that day as you have it 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.070
 said she has already won on the course 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.360
 certainly there were only females 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.220
 but she was really doing with the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.360
 way there go wrong but I think 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.310
 that she can really watch them right 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.510
 in the eyes if learns quickly the 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.070
 orders in the test one should the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.510
 necessary attention would be able to 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.739
 realize a lamb and keen 12th win 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.690
 this year that I think the aura will be strong 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.310
 understood behind the number 16 valley 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.630
 heaters that have just reconnected with the 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.790
 success on the small track 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.650
 it also has losses on 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.600
 great tracks we are wary of it 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.640
 michel lenoir has always felt 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.959
 warmed him up this morale 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.940
 year in the races for for 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.980
 hobbyists and find out largely off to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.049
 his scope and he has he fully 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.640
 convinced to dance in these waters 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.650
 so he had 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.240
 he approaches the 2700 meters of the great 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.530
 track this with full confidence they get 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.480
 transcend free of all four feet 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.020
 he is a horse with his manners in a 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.610
 course 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.470
 hey he does not have an exceptional margin 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.330
 but I make a pretty solid foundation 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.890
 to conclude in the quinté we will see 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.569
 what michel lenoir thinks about it since 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.100
 christophe meyer was to meet 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.080
 michel loy who speaks to us about this issue 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.450
 16 van hove and especially of this very beautiful 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.900
 commitment that we listen to them and I will be 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.190
 sure good races 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.110
 the last time it's not such a 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.459
 task that very easy because he has 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.140
 they have to walk anyway 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.640
 average 14 to win so the race a 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.300
 blamed a little bit but then he has 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.280
 well recovered 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.550
 this is often seen in amateur here 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.220
 it's a quinté yes it's a good one 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.950
 commitment there it is almost 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.450
 earnings ceiling 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.239
 long time we had a bubble built 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.830
 as good we talked about the ceiling of 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.660
 gains we will go directly number 17 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.580
 dugas rabbi volcano that comes from 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.980
 polish your shape in the province to win 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.940
 at this level and on this course in 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.530
 December 2014 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.850
 there too we pay attention here I do 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.560
 I really like it that have been 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.880
 regard to the donati family 20 takes its 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.650
 time with him we really present him to 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.360
 wise as you said it has 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.400
 brilliantly won his quinté this 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.880
 winter on the 2700 meters of the great 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.770
 track 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.750
 it is a horse of holding with him one 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.669
 can send to the kilometer he is not going 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.260
 let go of the piece to finish the last 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.550
 time unfortunately not blush his second 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.500
 place in the province he was beaten by 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.330
 lowering by yachvili late from 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.340
 gains driven by franck anne so he 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.860
 addresses this commitment in its best form 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.750
 his 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.879
 my partner uses it to perfection 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.060
 so before the shot all fires are at 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.379
 green 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.180
 all lights are green we will see 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:51.819
 with the number 12 your fifth choice 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.050
 pimbo victory a female she did 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.370
 not really corner is tighter 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.449
 now being on what she showed 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.580
 in the past 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.229
 be careful not to neglect it 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.599
 must not take into account his 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.759
 music there halftone outputs 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.139
 but will be deferré all four feet 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.939
 really transforms free of the four 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.530
 feet we could see this winter where she 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.110
 made the same arrival of a quinté 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.729
 more so mathieu mottier to does not have his 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.949
 like to wait in a course and 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.840
 come and have them finish me off of 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.219
 four feet that really transcends me 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.659
 think alice in a wise race 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:21.129
 of waiting can come spice up the 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.270
 very low reports we will learn 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.400
 maybe a little bit more with them 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.590
 rajak pardon rajalu since bruno ranc 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.849
 ur joy a phone jacques rajalu 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.590
 who will speak to us especially his last 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:35.920
 attempt to thouars one listens would have 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.530
 may be but good why 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.400
 stone emmerdes not know where not 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.340
 too much his cup of tea 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.560
 and then n 1 can arrive quickly in the 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.270
 back of others in the turns here 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.340
 so l after a small mistake and then 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.530
 okay finish which I agree it's 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.430
 a nice race for again déferré 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.680
 four feet and more 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.740
 yeah bah I worked in account and 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.410
 when I was not working against 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.670
 always with cadets then mathieu 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.490
 mottier so we try to put all 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.990
 the chances of lending it all is said 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.910
 or almost an emotional match of 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.980
 four the mare is fit one can there 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.870
 believe this is his recent failure it's a 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.310
 pretty big mare the small 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.740
 tracks in the province then in post in 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.210
 wood that was aird there on the 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.100
 great track can really fully 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.270
 to express what is a tractor 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.250
 as they say she needs to put me there 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.070
 to balance herself after she is able 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.050
 also to wind up as to finish so 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.330
 no no I buy them well 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.530
 willingly hockey mathieu thanks for 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.690
 all the information we will leave with 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.120
 a little nugget in the meeting on the 7th 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.500
 will I think the 706 cool trail we do not 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.200
 ignore his last 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.420
 6th performance on paper but he 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.100
 still had obvious resources in 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.930
 the final turning point when he showed himself 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.310
 faulty in another quality there I 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.890
 find that water a little bit a 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.140
 little less good so it's a choice 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.760
 there is fish since his debut if he 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.710
 must reconnect with success I think 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.010
 it is, however, everything is said to him or 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.810
 almost 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.160
 there's more to go to the cashier mathieu 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.320

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.400
