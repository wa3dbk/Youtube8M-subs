of<00:00:39.310> um<00:00:41.010> technique<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:43.000> don't<00:00:43.180> have<00:00:43.329> to

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
of um technique that you don't have to

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.229 
of um technique that you don't have to
use<00:00:43.630> an<00:00:43.780> outline<00:00:44.110> on<00:00:44.380> everything<00:00:45.070> but<00:00:45.370> on<00:00:45.550> this

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
use an outline on everything but on this
