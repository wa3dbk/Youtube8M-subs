00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
okay so I have most of the parts for the

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.140 
okay so I have most of the parts for the
top<00:00:37.030> roughed<00:00:37.960> out<00:00:38.140> ripped<00:00:38.770> and<00:00:39.040> some<00:00:39.940> of<00:00:40.030> them

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
top roughed out ripped and some of them

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.799 
top roughed out ripped and some of them
crosscut<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:41.290> I<00:00:41.950> have<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.430> all<00:00:43.000> four

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
crosscut and I have the all four

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.830 
crosscut and I have the all four
sections<00:00:44.710> roughed<00:00:45.340> out<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:45.790> length<00:00:46.450> and<00:00:46.629> width

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
sections roughed out in length and width

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.160 
sections roughed out in length and width
for<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.059> two<00:00:49.390> sawhorses<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:50.110> the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
for the for the two sawhorses of the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.740 
for the for the two sawhorses of the
four<00:00:50.410> sides<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:52.030> I'm<00:00:52.120> going<00:00:52.269> to<00:00:52.330> do<00:00:52.449> now<00:00:52.600> is

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
four sides what I'm going to do now is

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.450 
four sides what I'm going to do now is
take<00:00:52.900> one<00:00:53.199> of<00:00:53.230> those<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:54.150> lay<00:00:55.150> out<00:00:55.330> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
take one of those and lay out the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.710 
take one of those and lay out the
sawhorse<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.970> I'm<00:00:58.030> going<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.239> cut<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.600> out

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
sawhorse and I'm going to cut it out

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.170 
sawhorse and I'm going to cut it out
with<00:00:59.309> combination<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.430> tools<00:01:00.670> I'm<00:01:00.970> going<00:01:01.000> to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
with combination of tools I'm going to

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.210 
with combination of tools I'm going to
use<00:01:01.330> a<00:01:03.510> hole<00:01:04.510> saw<00:01:04.540> a<00:01:05.049> large<00:01:05.379> one<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.950> make<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
use a hole saw a large one to make the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.860 
use a hole saw a large one to make the
big<00:01:06.370> radius<00:01:06.760> as<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:06.970> small<00:01:07.360> one<00:01:07.510> to<00:01:07.630> make<00:01:07.780> you

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
big radius as a small one to make you

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.230 
big radius as a small one to make you
small<00:01:08.170> radiuses<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:09.130> Festool<00:01:09.670> track<00:01:09.880> saw

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
small radiuses the Festool track saw

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.860 
small radiuses the Festool track saw
with<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.479> small<00:01:10.750> track<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:12.030> connect<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.690> dots

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
with a small track to connect the dots

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.950 
with a small track to connect the dots
basically<00:01:14.260> if<00:01:15.190> necessary<00:01:15.850> I'll<00:01:16.150> use<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.510> jig

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
basically if necessary I'll use a jig

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.020 
basically if necessary I'll use a jig
saw<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.440> kind<00:01:18.130> of<00:01:18.159> finish<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.580> up<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.909> then

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
saw to kind of finish it up and then

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.690 
saw to kind of finish it up and then
I'll<00:01:19.180> sand<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.720> edges<00:01:19.960> my<00:01:20.290> plan<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.159> make

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
I'll sand the edges my plan is to make

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.899 
I'll sand the edges my plan is to make
one<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.869> hard<00:01:23.080> way<00:01:23.140> this<00:01:23.530> way<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:23.950> then<00:01:24.670> use

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
one the hard way this way and then use

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.180 
one the hard way this way and then use
that<00:01:24.940> as<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.450> template<00:01:26.049> so<00:01:26.409> I'll<00:01:26.530> use<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.799> router

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
that as a template so I'll use a router

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.940 
that as a template so I'll use a router
with<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.689> I'll<00:01:28.689> leave<00:01:28.930> you<00:01:29.049> use<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.229> pattern<00:01:29.560> bit

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
with a I'll leave you use a pattern bit

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.670 
with a I'll leave you use a pattern bit
or<00:01:30.430> I'll<00:01:30.760> use<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:30.970> template<00:01:31.570> with<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.229> straight

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
or I'll use a template with a straight

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.130 
or I'll use a template with a straight
cutter<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.840> take<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:36.510> one<00:01:37.510> that<00:01:37.660> I<00:01:37.720> cut<00:01:37.900> out<00:01:38.020> as

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
cutter to take the one that I cut out as

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.920 
cutter to take the one that I cut out as
a<00:01:38.200> template<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.800> make<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.610> other<00:01:39.760> three<00:01:40.240> so

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
a template and make the other three so

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.570 
a template and make the other three so
that'll<00:01:41.260> save<00:01:41.470> some<00:01:41.710> time<00:01:41.980> and<00:01:42.010> it<00:01:42.340> will<00:01:42.430> make

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
that'll save some time and it will make

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.920 
that'll save some time and it will make
them<00:01:42.730> all<00:01:42.790> uniform<00:01:43.060> they'll<00:01:43.660> all<00:01:43.780> be

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
them all uniform they'll all be

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.770 
them all uniform they'll all be
identical<00:01:44.530> if<00:01:44.830> I<00:01:45.400> if<00:01:45.730> I<00:01:45.880> use<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.120> pattern<00:01:46.450> bit

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
identical if I if I use a pattern bit

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.310 
identical if I if I use a pattern bit
the<00:01:47.620> other<00:01:47.920> three<00:01:48.280> will<00:01:48.400> be<00:01:48.520> exactly<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:50.110> same

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
the other three will be exactly the same

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.910 
the other three will be exactly the same
size<00:01:50.560> as<00:01:50.830> this<00:01:50.980> one<00:01:51.220> if<00:01:51.400> I<00:01:52.030> use<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:52.900> template<00:01:53.710> a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
size as this one if I use a template a

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.080 
size as this one if I use a template a
guide<00:01:54.250> on<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.660> router<00:01:56.050> then<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.730> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
guide on the router then because the the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.050 
guide on the router then because the the
guide<00:01:58.390> will<00:01:58.630> add<00:01:58.780> about<00:01:59.080> 1/16<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.880> other

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
guide will add about 1/16 the other

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.060 
guide will add about 1/16 the other
three<00:02:01.750> will<00:02:02.050> be<00:02:02.080> slightly<00:02:02.530> different<00:02:02.680> but

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
three will be slightly different but

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.649 
three will be slightly different but
they'll<00:02:03.220> be<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.520> close<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:03.850> in<00:02:04.540> this

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
they'll be so close and in this

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.850 
they'll be so close and in this
situation<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:06.190> not<00:02:06.280> like<00:02:06.580> I'm<00:02:06.760> doing<00:02:06.970> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
situation it's not like I'm doing a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.139 
situation it's not like I'm doing a
positive<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:09.009> negative<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.640> have<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:10.000> fit

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
positive and a negative that have to fit

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.440 
positive and a negative that have to fit
together<00:02:10.509> so<00:02:11.310> whichever<00:02:12.310> one<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.940> decide<00:02:13.420> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
together so whichever one I I decide to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.290 
together so whichever one I I decide to
do<00:02:13.720> will<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:14.110> will<00:02:14.530> be<00:02:14.560> fine<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.129> this

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
do will be will be fine in this

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.240 
do will be will be fine in this
application<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.739> first<00:02:17.920> thing<00:02:18.069> I'm<00:02:18.129> gonna

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
application so the first thing I'm gonna

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.940 
application so the first thing I'm gonna
do<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.459> take<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.760> plans<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.540> just<00:02:20.140> layout

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
do is take the plans and and just layout

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.430 
do is take the plans and and just layout
with<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.550> pencil<00:02:21.819> tape<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.690> straightedge

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
with a pencil tape and a straightedge

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.040 
with a pencil tape and a straightedge
here<00:02:23.830> lay<00:02:24.040> out<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.940> cuts<00:02:25.180> I'll<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.480> making<00:02:25.900> and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
here lay out the cuts I'll be making and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.940 
here lay out the cuts I'll be making and
plywood<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.610> use<00:02:27.970> for<00:02:28.299> this<00:02:28.680> some<00:02:29.680> some

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
plywood that I use for this some some

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.949 
plywood that I use for this some some
guys<00:02:30.099> who've<00:02:30.280> built<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:31.120> bench<00:02:31.390> have<00:02:31.659> used

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
guys who've built the bench have used

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.550 
guys who've built the bench have used
really<00:02:32.830> pretty<00:02:33.069> ply<00:02:33.310> woods<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.819> a

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
really pretty ply woods like a

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.589

using a C plywood and as I symbol the
bench

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
bench

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.490 
bench
I'll<00:02:41.950> put<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.670> seaside<00:02:43.450> inward<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.410> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
I'll put the seaside inward so on the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.280 
I'll put the seaside inward so on the
sawhorses<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.220> will<00:02:45.310> be<00:02:45.400> inside<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.290> since

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
sawhorses it will be inside and since

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.440 
sawhorses it will be inside and since
I'll<00:02:47.770> be<00:02:47.800> using<00:02:48.070> this<00:02:48.670> one<00:02:48.850> as<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> template

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
I'll be using this one as a template

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.260 
I'll be using this one as a template
I'll<00:02:49.720> be<00:02:49.840> cutting<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.350> out<00:02:50.580> with<00:02:51.580> saws<00:02:51.850> and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
I'll be cutting it out with saws and

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.540 
I'll be cutting it out with saws and
drills<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.810> think<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.920> know<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.040> may<00:02:54.160> not<00:02:54.310> get<00:02:54.460> it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
drills I think you know I may not get it

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.060 
drills I think you know I may not get it
exactly<00:02:55.120> perfect<00:02:55.630> as<00:02:55.870> as<00:02:56.140> what<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.740> ones<00:02:56.920> I

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
exactly perfect as as what the ones I

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.540 
exactly perfect as as what the ones I
cut<00:02:57.310> out<00:02:57.340> with<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.380> router<00:02:59.380> will<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.340> there

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
cut out with the router will be so there

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.430 
cut out with the router will be so there
might<00:03:00.700> be<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.880> slight<00:03:01.060> over<00:03:01.510> cut<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:01.930> I'll<00:03:02.080> do<00:03:02.290> it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
might be a slight over cut so I'll do it

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.140 
might be a slight over cut so I'll do it
is<00:03:02.530> I'll<00:03:02.680> lay<00:03:03.160> out<00:03:03.190> everything<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.790> cut<00:03:04.000> it

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
is I'll lay out everything and cut it

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.960 
is I'll lay out everything and cut it
from<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.500> seaside<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.800> then<00:03:06.400> if<00:03:06.610> there<00:03:06.820> is

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
from the seaside and then if there is

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.860 
from the seaside and then if there is
any<00:03:07.300> over<00:03:07.630> cuts<00:03:07.870> or<00:03:08.110> any<00:03:08.260> minor<00:03:08.890> mistakes<00:03:09.870> it

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
any over cuts or any minor mistakes it

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.360 
any over cuts or any minor mistakes it
won't<00:03:11.140> show<00:03:11.350> as<00:03:11.500> much<00:03:11.710> because<00:03:11.860> it'll<00:03:12.070> be<00:03:12.190> to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
won't show as much because it'll be to

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.120 
won't show as much because it'll be to
the<00:03:12.490> inside<00:03:12.910> when<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.420> sources<00:03:14.260> are<00:03:14.440> opened

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
around you could clamp the board down as

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.850 
around you could clamp the board down as
well<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:34.660> I've<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:35.140> good<00:03:35.320> enough<00:03:35.500> with<00:03:35.710> me

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
kind of hugging the drill just for a

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.880 
kind of hugging the drill just for a
little<00:03:39.400> extra<00:03:39.550> safety<00:03:40.180> without<00:03:40.780> this<00:03:41.260> you'll

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
little extra safety without this you'll

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.980 
little extra safety without this you'll
find<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.250> when<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.490> grabs<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.180> really<00:03:43.480> rip

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
find it when it grabs it can really rip

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.690 
find it when it grabs it can really rip
it<00:03:44.170> rip<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.590> out<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.800> your<00:03:44.890> hand<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.340> hurt<00:03:45.550> your

wrist or cut you so on the other side
I've<00:03:53.260> got<00:03:53.290> where<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.640> pilot<00:03:55.030> bit<00:03:55.240> came

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
I've got where the the pilot bit came

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.500 
I've got where the the pilot bit came
through<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.030> have<00:03:58.210> to<00:03:58.300> worry<00:03:58.420> about

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
through and so I have to worry about

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.390 
through and so I have to worry about
layout<00:03:58.810> I'll<00:03:59.080> just<00:03:59.290> drop<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.740> pilot<00:04:00.070> bit<00:04:00.220> in

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
layout I'll just drop the pilot bit in

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:13.100 
layout I'll just drop the pilot bit in
the<00:04:00.490> same<00:04:00.700> hole<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.180> just<00:04:01.750> finish<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:02.200> cut

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.760 

okay<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.090> big<00:04:16.270> holes<00:04:16.510> cut<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:20.530> where

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
okay so the big holes cut this is where

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.320 
okay so the big holes cut this is where
I<00:04:22.530> see<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.560> lot<00:04:23.620> of<00:04:23.710> finished<00:04:24.010> Carpenters<00:04:24.490> spend

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
I see a lot of finished Carpenters spend

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.180 
I see a lot of finished Carpenters spend
a<00:04:25.450> lot<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.660> time<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.110> energy<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.590> try<00:04:26.890> to<00:04:26.950> make

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
a lot of time and energy to try to make

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.010 
a lot of time and energy to try to make
things<00:04:27.430> perfect<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:28.000> I've<00:04:28.480> been<00:04:28.690> there<00:04:28.840> myself

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
laid out precisely where I want them but

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.420 
laid out precisely where I want them but
sometimes<00:04:38.290> things<00:04:38.500> drift<00:04:38.740> off<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.040> little<00:04:39.280> bit

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
sometimes things drift off a little bit

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.870 
sometimes things drift off a little bit
so<00:04:39.510> my<00:04:40.510> catch<00:04:40.840> up<00:04:41.020> here<00:04:41.230> will<00:04:41.350> be<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.800> if<00:04:42.040> one

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
so my catch up here will be that if one

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.220 
so my catch up here will be that if one
of<00:04:43.000> these<00:04:43.090> holes<00:04:43.360> has<00:04:43.570> slipped<00:04:43.810> a<00:04:43.960> little<00:04:44.080> bit

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
of these holes has slipped a little bit

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.020 
of these holes has slipped a little bit
off<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.470> line<00:04:44.770> like<00:04:45.010> this<00:04:45.160> one's<00:04:45.400> gone<00:04:45.640> over

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
off the line like this one's gone over

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.490 
off the line like this one's gone over
you<00:04:46.450> know<00:04:46.570> 1/32<00:04:47.460> I'll<00:04:48.460> just<00:04:49.230> actually<00:04:50.230> make

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
you know 1/32 I'll just actually make

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.940 
you know 1/32 I'll just actually make
the<00:04:50.710> cut<00:04:51.010> right<00:04:51.790> on<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.030> radius<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:53.470> being<00:04:53.770> off

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
the cut right on the radius so being off

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.400 
the cut right on the radius so being off
that<00:04:54.220> little<00:04:54.490> bit<00:04:54.930> you're<00:04:55.930> never<00:04:56.140> going<00:04:56.380> to

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
that little bit you're never going to

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.000 
that little bit you're never going to
notice<00:04:56.770> it<00:04:57.180> unless<00:04:58.180> I<00:04:58.600> cut<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.650> know<00:04:59.770> right

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
notice it unless I cut it you know right

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.970 
notice it unless I cut it you know right
to<00:05:00.220> where<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:01.060> line<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.630> then<00:05:02.290> you'd<00:05:02.470> see<00:05:02.740> the

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
to where the line is then you'd see the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.580 
to where the line is then you'd see the
radius<00:05:03.370> cutting<00:05:03.700> in<00:05:03.850> into<00:05:04.300> your<00:05:04.450> line<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:05.020> this

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
radius cutting in into your line so this

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.060 
radius cutting in into your line so this
is<00:05:05.770> where<00:05:05.980> you<00:05:06.070> can<00:05:06.220> just<00:05:06.460> sort<00:05:06.640> of<00:05:06.760> perfect<00:05:07.720> it

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
is where you can just sort of perfect it

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.700 
is where you can just sort of perfect it
just<00:05:09.070> by<00:05:09.220> eye<00:05:09.250> lining<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.060> up<00:05:10.180> right<00:05:10.590> to<00:05:11.590> the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
just by eye lining it up right to the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.010 
just by eye lining it up right to the
radiuses<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.430> you<00:05:13.030> have<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.210> be<00:05:13.300> careful<00:05:13.750> here

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
radiuses and you have to be careful here

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.770 
radiuses and you have to be careful here
because<00:05:14.700> you<00:05:15.700> know<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:15.880> get<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.150> saw<00:05:16.330> set<00:05:16.600> up

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
because you know you get the saw set up

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.870 
because you know you get the saw set up
and<00:05:16.930> you<00:05:16.990> start<00:05:17.200> cutting<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.740> forget<00:05:18.520> and<00:05:18.669> cut

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
and you start cutting and forget and cut

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.580 
and you start cutting and forget and cut
all<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> way<00:05:19.240> through<00:05:19.270> when<00:05:20.050> really<00:05:20.320> what<00:05:20.530> I

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
all the way through when really what I

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.460 
all the way through when really what I
need<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:20.979> do<00:05:21.130> is<00:05:21.340> cut<00:05:21.610> just<00:05:22.570> into<00:05:22.990> this<00:05:23.169> hole

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
need to do is cut just into this hole

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.219 
need to do is cut just into this hole
and<00:05:23.710> then<00:05:24.340> I<00:05:24.400> have<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.669> cut<00:05:24.910> from<00:05:25.479> this<00:05:25.720> one<00:05:25.930> to

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
and then I have to cut from this one to

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.700 
and then I have to cut from this one to
this<00:05:26.440> one<00:05:26.820> so<00:05:27.820> mistakes<00:05:28.540> I<00:05:28.690> have<00:05:28.900> made<00:05:29.020> in<00:05:29.440> the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
this one so mistakes I have made in the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.969 
this one so mistakes I have made in the
past<00:05:30.000> just<00:05:31.000> be<00:05:31.180> attentive<00:05:31.540> and<00:05:31.930> make<00:05:32.500> marks

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
past just be attentive and make marks

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:36.210 
past just be attentive and make marks
where<00:05:33.970> you<00:05:34.780> want<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.110> cut<00:05:35.320> and<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:35.860> don't<00:05:36.040> want

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
where you want to cut and you don't want

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.300 
where you want to cut and you don't want
to<00:05:36.310> cut<00:05:36.490> so<00:05:37.360> I<00:05:37.390> want<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:37.840> cut<00:05:38.020> here<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.590> don't

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
to cut so I want to cut here I don't

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.760 
to cut so I want to cut here I don't
want<00:05:39.640> to<00:05:39.729> cut<00:05:39.910> there<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:40.390> I<00:05:41.350> want<00:05:41.530> to<00:05:41.590> cut

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
want to cut there and I want to cut

00:05:41.770 --> 00:06:00.540 
want to cut there and I want to cut
there<00:05:42.070> so<00:05:42.970> I'll<00:05:43.090> know<00:05:43.330> two<00:05:43.390> there<00:05:44.290> and<00:05:45.210> here

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.620 

that's<00:06:01.550> where<00:06:01.730> I'll<00:06:01.820> have<00:06:01.850> to<00:06:02.060> finish<00:06:02.210> up<00:06:02.480> a

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
that's where I'll have to finish up a

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.940 
that's where I'll have to finish up a
little<00:06:02.810> bit<00:06:02.960> with<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.170> jigsaw<00:06:03.560> just<00:06:03.800> because

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
little bit with the jigsaw just because

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.640 
little bit with the jigsaw just because
I<00:06:04.070> can't<00:06:04.340> complete<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.330> cut<00:06:05.570> without<00:06:05.810> going

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
I can't complete the cut without going

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:45.410 
I can't complete the cut without going
further<00:06:06.890> into<00:06:07.960> my<00:06:08.960> finish<00:06:09.290> board<00:06:09.830> that<00:06:10.010> I<00:06:10.100> want

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.910 

now<00:06:46.420> with<00:06:46.540> the<00:06:46.630> smaller<00:06:46.960> holes<00:06:47.260> I<00:06:47.470> can't<00:06:47.710> cut

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
now with the smaller holes I can't cut

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.670 
now with the smaller holes I can't cut
as<00:06:48.070> far<00:06:48.310> into<00:06:48.520> them<00:06:48.940> so<00:06:49.330> I<00:06:49.360> will<00:06:49.540> have<00:06:50.500> to

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
as far into them so I will have to

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.240 
as far into them so I will have to
finish<00:06:50.830> up<00:06:51.100> more<00:06:51.430> with<00:06:51.670> the<00:06:51.730> jigsaw<00:06:53.100> by<00:06:54.100> using

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
finish up more with the jigsaw by using

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.030 
finish up more with the jigsaw by using
one<00:06:54.670> long<00:06:54.910> straight<00:06:55.330> edge<00:06:55.360> I'm<00:06:55.780> able<00:06:56.110> to<00:06:56.380> make

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
one long straight edge I'm able to make

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.460 
one long straight edge I'm able to make
sure<00:06:57.220> that<00:06:57.400> I<00:06:57.430> have<00:06:57.580> a<00:06:57.610> nice<00:06:57.880> straight<00:06:58.240> line

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
sure that I have a nice straight line

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.600 
sure that I have a nice straight line
this<00:06:59.470> would<00:06:59.590> be<00:06:59.710> the<00:06:59.830> top<00:07:00.100> of<00:07:00.130> the<00:07:00.640> of<00:07:01.480> the

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
this would be the top of the of the

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.520 
this would be the top of the of the
sawhorse<00:07:03.610> where<00:07:04.090> the<00:07:04.210> bench<00:07:04.420> rests<00:07:05.110> on<00:07:05.230> it<00:07:05.380> so

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
sawhorse where the bench rests on it so

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.440 
sawhorse where the bench rests on it so
I<00:07:05.590> want<00:07:05.800> to<00:07:05.830> make<00:07:06.010> sure<00:07:06.160> this<00:07:06.400> is<00:07:06.640> you<00:07:07.330> know

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
I want to make sure this is you know

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.020 
I want to make sure this is you know
nice<00:07:07.630> and<00:07:08.080> parallel<00:07:08.590> all<00:07:08.980> the<00:07:09.070> way<00:07:09.160> across<00:07:09.400> and

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
nice and parallel all the way across and

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.440 
nice and parallel all the way across and
these<00:07:11.020> Festool<00:07:11.770> tracks<00:07:12.130> just<00:07:12.400> don't<00:07:12.670> move<00:07:12.910> I<00:07:13.180> I

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.450 
these Festool tracks just don't move I I

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.730 
these Festool tracks just don't move I I
put<00:07:14.170> my<00:07:15.570> hands<00:07:16.570> on<00:07:16.660> hold<00:07:16.960> them<00:07:17.110> down<00:07:17.260> but<00:07:17.560> they

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 
put my hands on hold them down but they

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.210 
put my hands on hold them down but they
really<00:07:18.100> don't<00:07:18.250> slip<00:07:18.880> at<00:07:19.030> all
