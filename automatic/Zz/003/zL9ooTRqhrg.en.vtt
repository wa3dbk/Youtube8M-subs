00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.680
 we work this reason we go 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.700
 use the 100% cotton line so leftover 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.080
 made of 100% cotton in orange and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.710
 green color and we'll use it 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.310
 crochet hook 1.75mm 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.670
 you will start with an orange and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.260
 you will make 12 little chains then al 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:43.500
 initial assad to start and the 12 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:46.230
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.870
 You will close with very low point. 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.250
 in the first chain made forming 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 a circle 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.500
 inside this circle you will make 20 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.750
 then you will go up two 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.530
 already equivalent to the first 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.460
 point and you will make another 19 points 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.299
 within this circle 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.700
 we already have four in total 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.400
 made the 20 low points you go 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.009
 close with a low point to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.549
 career and now you go to work the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:27.509
 The next way you will go up 3 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:30.299
 to the height of the point and 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.780
 You're going to make three high points here. 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.930
 closed together at the first point of the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.720
 base 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.680
 so you're going to make three high points 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.680
 half 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.439
 then you will close all together 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.159
 Now you're going to make two chains. 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:02.880
 my space a low on 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:05.970
 next point two streams of space and 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.750
 in the next point you will repeat three 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.819
 high points closed together 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
 if you have questions about how to do it 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.500
 point closed together first you 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.300
 watch the video next to the dot in the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.269
 category types of site two points 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:31.080
 I had a low current in 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:33.900
 next point two chains my three 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.220
 high points closed together in the next 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.220
 base point 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.250
 and in this way you are repeating the 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.530
 petals for all career points 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.540
 three high points closed together two 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.640
 currents a low on the next 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.860
 point two chains 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.950
 after you finish aspects of your 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.489
 flower it will stay that way to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.500
 florzinha she has 10 petals in total 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.549
 now it's you end up with two chains 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.579
 my space and a very low point 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.109
 in the first one on the first 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.109
 Did you do it at the beginning of your career? 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.459
 and now you win 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.340
 the firing line 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.640
 you bring some dots 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.700
 on the back of the job you 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.769
 hides behind the petal with needle 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.750
 crochet or with a tapestry needle 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:03.170
 you bring back the petal 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:05.209
 for you only to cut that thread in the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.239
 At the beginning you can also cut 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.120
 now we'll change the color now you 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.269
 will mend the green yarn you work on 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.359
 work the way you do in the 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:21.199
 two streams of space that you 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.000
 left between each petal and you go 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.400
 patch the wire 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.630
 you will be able to attach the wire can be with a 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:33.280
 and forgiveness because we 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.280
 Let's work on the chains. 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.409
 in that same space you will make three 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:45.409
 business 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.730
 low in the next two 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.730
 my chains 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:05.669
 of the base three chains a low 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.669
 in the two currents of space 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:14.380
 3 strings a low on both 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.380
 space currents 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.560
 3 strings a low on both 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.650
 space currents 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.530
 Then there are three 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.280
 tightening and 3 chains between each 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.530
 petal gets that way later 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.340
 you finish the outline in green 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.750
 your flower 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.240
 She'll stay that way now you go. 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.490
 close with low point after 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.690
 make the last three chains of 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.470
 space 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:53.440
 You close in the first run 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.440
 with a low point and you win 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.510
 If you want to continue you can 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.000
 working.com reid over network point or 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:05.690
 You make more motives and tie the motifs. 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.440
 between each other with chains 3 chains 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.440
 a low 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.550
 this wire you can the end you 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.650
 can do our good from the beginning because 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:24.700
 they can not hide the 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.700
 wire and then you cut wire 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.259
 ah 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.820
 so there's a super delicate little flower 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:45.000
 mainly for you to make paths 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.000
 washcloth centrinhos table O 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.030
 So, congratulations, you just learned. 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:56.510
 How do you make a little flower model of 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.510
 crochet
