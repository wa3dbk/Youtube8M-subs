00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
evaluate that our first batch of repair

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.640 
evaluate that our first batch of repair
material<00:03:22.709> didn't<00:03:23.160> hold<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.380> was<00:03:25.620> a

material didn't hold and and that was a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.190 
material didn't hold and and that was a

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
mistake on our part we probably used the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.819 
mistake on our part we probably used the

wrong type of material and and it didn't

first delay i'm talking about so we

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.449
