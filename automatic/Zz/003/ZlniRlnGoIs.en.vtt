vision puck now the hockey vision puck

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.310 
vision puck now the hockey vision puck
is<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.429> neat<00:00:08.580> idea<00:00:08.610> it's<00:00:09.330> basically<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.929> white

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
is a neat idea it's basically a white

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.290 
is a neat idea it's basically a white
hockey<00:00:10.620> puck<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> black<00:00:11.880> dot<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
hockey puck with a black dot in the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.640 
hockey puck with a black dot in the
middle<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.900> there<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.080> different<00:00:13.349> sizes

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
middle and there are different sizes

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.499 
middle and there are different sizes
there's<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> large<00:00:14.700> black<00:00:15.000> dot<00:00:15.210> this

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
there's this is the large black dot this

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.689 
there's this is the large black dot this
is<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.780> medium<00:00:16.139> size<00:00:16.170> black<00:00:16.650> dot<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.070> then

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
is the medium size black dot and then

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.580 
is the medium size black dot and then
this<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.480> small<00:00:18.900> black<00:00:19.109> dot<00:00:19.350> and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
this one here is the small black dot and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
this one here is the small black dot and
you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.010> see<00:00:20.130> they<00:00:20.250> get<00:00:20.340> smaller<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> smaller

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
you can see they get smaller and smaller

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.179 
you can see they get smaller and smaller
and<00:00:21.359> basically<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> idea<00:00:22.140> behind<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.920> you

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and basically the idea behind it is you

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.070 
and basically the idea behind it is you
get<00:00:23.340> used<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> seeing<00:00:23.789> less<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.449> less<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
get used to seeing less and less of the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
get used to seeing less and less of the
puck<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.560> then<00:00:26.160> when<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.789> go<00:00:26.880> back<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
puck and then when you go back to the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.029 
puck and then when you go back to the
regular<00:00:27.359> full-size<00:00:27.779> puck<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.650> feels<00:00:28.920> like

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
regular full-size puck it feels like

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.410 
regular full-size puck it feels like
your<00:00:29.160> stick<00:00:29.340> handling<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> beach<00:00:29.880> ball<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.300> it's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
your stick handling a beach ball so it's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.179 
your stick handling a beach ball so it's
really<00:00:30.570> easy<00:00:30.660> really<00:00:31.080> easy<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.439> see<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.769> your

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
really easy really easy to see it your

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.709 
really easy really easy to see it your
peripheral<00:00:32.579> vision<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.940> dialed<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
peripheral vision is dialed in on the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.720 
peripheral vision is dialed in on the
smaller<00:00:34.050> size<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.100> when<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.430> back<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
smaller size and so when you get back to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.910 
smaller size and so when you get back to
that<00:00:35.820> full<00:00:36.030> size<00:00:36.180> puck<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.200> lot<00:00:37.530> easier<00:00:37.710> to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that full size puck it's a lot easier to

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.319 
that full size puck it's a lot easier to
handle<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> puck<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.940> where<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.180> puck

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
handle the puck and see where the puck

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
handle the puck and see where the puck
is<00:00:39.360> without<00:00:39.780> looking<00:00:40.170> down<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:40.950> with

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
is without looking down at it now with

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.200 
is without looking down at it now with
the<00:00:41.160> hockey<00:00:41.309> vision<00:00:41.610> training<00:00:41.730> pucks<00:00:42.030> there's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the hockey vision training pucks there's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.400 
the hockey vision training pucks there's
actually<00:00:42.450> two<00:00:42.629> versions<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.140> them<00:00:43.230> there's

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
actually two versions of them there's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.840 
actually two versions of them there's
the<00:00:43.530> office<00:00:43.950> version<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.579> made<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the office version which is made of a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150 
the office version which is made of a
high-density<00:00:45.600> plastic<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.260> think<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.559> HDPE<00:00:47.010> D

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
high-density plastic I think it's HDPE D

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.150 
high-density plastic I think it's HDPE D
if<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:47.789> mistaken<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.829> obviously

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
if I'm not mistaken and it's obviously

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.740 
if I'm not mistaken and it's obviously
designed<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.760> slide<00:00:51.090> really<00:00:51.390> well<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> be

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
designed to slide really well and be

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.529 
designed to slide really well and be
durable<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:53.100> sorts<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.460> office<00:00:53.789> surfaces

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
durable on all sorts of office surfaces

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.540 
durable on all sorts of office surfaces
then<00:00:55.079> you've<00:00:55.199> got<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.739> ice<00:00:55.920> version<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
then you've got your on ice version and

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.069 
then you've got your on ice version and
the<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.030> nice<00:00:57.149> version<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.660> made<00:00:57.899> out<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the out nice version is made out of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.869 
the out nice version is made out of
rubber<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.340> main<00:00:59.520> difference<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
rubber and the one main difference you

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.760 
rubber and the one main difference you
can<00:01:00.000> see<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:01.050> only<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
can see with this is that not only is it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.160 
can see with this is that not only is it
the<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.340> black<00:01:02.520> dot<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.940> top<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.809> there's<00:01:03.989> are

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the the black dot on top but there's are

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.640 
the the black dot on top but there's are
actually<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> black<00:01:05.189> stripe<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> side<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
actually a black stripe on the side and

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.679 
actually a black stripe on the side and
for<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> medium<00:01:08.010> size<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.850> stripe<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> also<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
for the medium size the stripe is also a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.020 
for the medium size the stripe is also a
medium<00:01:10.200> size<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> puck<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> white<00:01:11.490> but

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
medium size so the puck is white but

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
medium size so the puck is white but
then<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> black<00:01:12.630> stripe<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
then it's got the black stripe and the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.380 
then it's got the black stripe and the
black<00:01:13.770> dot<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.310> then<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> small<00:01:15.210> one

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
black dot and then with the small one

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.090 
black dot and then with the small one
you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> really<00:01:16.619> skinny<00:01:16.920> one

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
you can see it's a a really skinny one

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.609 
you can see it's a a really skinny one
so<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:18.299> tiny<00:01:18.479> dot<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.200> skinny<00:01:19.439> black

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
so a little tiny dot and a skinny black

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.320 
so a little tiny dot and a skinny black
stripe<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> comes<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.150> handy

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
stripe so this kind of comes in handy

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.090 
stripe so this kind of comes in handy
for<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.990> only<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:22.170> stick<00:01:22.560> handling<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:22.950> also

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
for not only for stick handling but also

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.710 
for not only for stick handling but also
for<00:01:23.430> goalie<00:01:23.640> work<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.119> mean<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.630> think

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
for goalie work I mean if you think

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.450 
for goalie work I mean if you think
about<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> goalies<00:01:25.350> point<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.710> view<00:01:25.830> seeing<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
about the goalies point of view seeing a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.940 
about the goalies point of view seeing a
little<00:01:26.790> tiny<00:01:27.090> sliver<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.500> black<00:01:28.710> line

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
little tiny sliver of a black line

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.649 
little tiny sliver of a black line
coming<00:01:29.280> at<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.549> versus<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> full<00:01:30.240> size<00:01:30.420> black

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
coming at you versus the full size black

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.140 
coming at you versus the full size black
puck<00:01:31.250> obviously<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.640> training

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
puck obviously it's going to be training

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.359 
puck obviously it's going to be training
your<00:01:33.390> eye<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.900> less<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.170> less<00:01:34.380> black<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
your eye to see less and less black and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.710 
your eye to see less and less black and
then<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.579> get<00:01:35.759> back<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> full-size<00:01:36.450> puck

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
then we get back to the full-size puck

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.780 
then we get back to the full-size puck
it'll<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> lot<00:01:37.979> easier<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> track

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
it'll be a lot easier for you to track

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
it'll be a lot easier for you to track
it<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.450> make<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> save<00:01:40.049> okay<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.680> here's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it see it make the save okay so here's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.200 
it see it make the save okay so here's
what<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.130> pucks<00:01:41.310> look<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.790> action<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
what these pucks look like in action you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.429 
what these pucks look like in action you
can<00:01:42.329> see<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.509> using<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> X<00:01:43.229> tile

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
can see I'm using them on the X tile

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.069 
can see I'm using them on the X tile
setup<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> 16<00:01:44.640> tile<00:01:44.850> setup<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.780> it's

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
setup this is the 16 tile setup so it's

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.740 
setup this is the 16 tile setup so it's
a<00:01:46.259> 2<00:01:46.619> by<00:01:46.770> 6<00:01:46.799> setup<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.759> 4<00:01:48.090> across<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.540> top

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
a 2 by 6 setup with 4 across the top

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050 
a 2 by 6 setup with 4 across the top
here<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.200> I've<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.740> my<00:01:49.860> 2<00:01:49.920> X<00:01:50.280> pastors<00:01:50.759> set<00:01:50.970> up

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
here and I've got my 2 X pastors set up

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.639 
here and I've got my 2 X pastors set up
as<00:01:51.210> well<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.570> just<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> kind<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.380> give<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.530> an

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
as well so just to kind of give you an

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
as well so just to kind of give you an
idea<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:53.549> slide<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.299> well

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
idea you can see they slide really well

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.249 
idea you can see they slide really well
and<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:56.189> idea<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.729> obviously<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.570> handle<00:01:58.170> with

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and the idea is obviously to handle with

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.370 
and the idea is obviously to handle with
your<00:01:58.409> head<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.890> much<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.729> possible<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.390> get

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
your head up as much as possible and get

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.810 
your head up as much as possible and get
used<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:02.040> saying<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> little<00:02:02.610> bit<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
used to just saying that a little bit of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.090 
used to just saying that a little bit of
a<00:02:02.880> black<00:02:03.030> dot<00:02:03.299> down<00:02:03.570> there<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.990> as<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.890> work

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
a black dot down there and as you work

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
a black dot down there and as you work
down<00:02:05.130> towards<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> smaller<00:02:06.149> smaller<00:02:06.570> dot

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
down towards the smaller smaller dot

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.109 
down towards the smaller smaller dot
then<00:02:07.140> your<00:02:07.259> eye<00:02:07.290> gets<00:02:07.590> used<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> sing<00:02:08.129> less<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
then your eye gets used to sing less and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.150 
then your eye gets used to sing less and
less<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
less of it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.890 
less of it
move<00:02:10.490> back<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.970> full-size<00:02:11.300> puck<00:02:11.630> and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
move back to the full-size puck and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.260 
move back to the full-size puck and
obviously<00:02:12.830> it's<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.340> big<00:02:13.670> difference<00:02:13.880> in

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
obviously it's it's a big difference in

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.940 
obviously it's it's a big difference in
what<00:02:14.330> your<00:02:14.780> eyes<00:02:14.960> are<00:02:14.990> used<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.530> seeing<00:02:15.740> so

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
what your eyes are used to seeing so

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.700 
what your eyes are used to seeing so
that's<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.900> that's<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.020> hockey<00:02:18.290> vision

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
that's the that's the hockey vision

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.150 
that's the that's the hockey vision
training<00:02:19.190> puck<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.990> great<00:02:20.990> puck<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.890> in<00:02:22.040> and

training puck and great puck just in and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.890 
training puck and great puck just in and
of<00:02:22.190> itself<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.210> see<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.450> slides<00:02:23.630> really

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
of itself you can see it slides really

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.770 
of itself you can see it slides really
well<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.910> factor<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.600> vision

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
well and factor in the the vision

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.960 
well and factor in the the vision
quality<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.740> it's<00:02:28.100> even<00:02:28.370> better<00:02:28.490> so

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
quality of it and it's even better so

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.250 
quality of it and it's even better so
