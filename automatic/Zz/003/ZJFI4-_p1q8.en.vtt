00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
but you get a hint of the Dijon it's not

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.690 
but you get a hint of the Dijon it's not
overwhelming<00:02:26.709> no<00:02:26.860> not<00:02:27.160> at<00:02:27.310> all

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
overwhelming no not at all

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.400 
overwhelming no not at all
not<00:02:28.090> at<00:02:28.209> all<00:02:28.300> but<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.660> makes<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.170> like<00:02:29.380> a

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
not at all but that makes that like a

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.370 
not at all but that makes that like a
song<00:02:34.140> okay<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.070> pretzel<00:02:36.489> yes<00:02:36.790> I

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
song okay so that's the pretzel yes I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.199 
song okay so that's the pretzel yes I
think<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.560> should<00:02:38.590> do<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.920> slice<00:02:39.220> next<00:02:39.700> slide

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
think we should do the slice next slide

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.810 
think we should do the slice next slide
so<00:02:40.660> it's<00:02:40.870> topped<00:02:41.230> with<00:02:41.380> mozzarella<00:02:42.160> cheese

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
so it's topped with mozzarella cheese
