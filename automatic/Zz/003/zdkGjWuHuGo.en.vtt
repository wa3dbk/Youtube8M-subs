bit of a clean but before the sick of
the<00:00:13.799> video<00:00:15.209> we'll<00:00:16.209> just<00:00:16.480> crack<00:00:16.869> on<00:00:16.900> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
the video we'll just crack on and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.420 
the video we'll just crack on and
there's<00:00:19.750> a<00:00:19.810> little<00:00:19.990> notch<00:00:21.690> their<00:00:23.430> effects

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
there's a little notch their effects

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.050 
there's a little notch their effects
over<00:00:25.060> there<00:00:25.300> that<00:00:25.750> aligns<00:00:26.080> it<00:00:26.320> properly<00:00:26.740> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
over there that aligns it properly and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.590

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
click it over okay no I tested the myth

click it over okay no I tested the myth
the<00:04:44.720> motherboard<00:04:45.720> working<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:47.480> for<00:04:48.480> speed<00:04:49.230> I

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
the motherboard working and for speed I

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.640 
the motherboard working and for speed I
don't<00:04:51.270> need<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.630> connect<00:04:51.990> everything<00:04:52.350> up

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
don't need to connect everything up

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.180 
don't need to connect everything up
again<00:04:52.830> no<00:04:53.610> that's<00:04:54.440> probably<00:04:55.440> probably<00:04:56.430> enough

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
again no that's probably probably enough

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:09.110 
again no that's probably probably enough
so<00:05:03.080> just<00:05:04.080> reconnect<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.800> power<00:05:07.940> make<00:05:08.940> sure

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
so just reconnect the power make sure

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.620 
so just reconnect the power make sure
the<00:05:09.210> switches<00:05:09.660> off<00:05:09.840> under<00:05:10.770> then<00:05:11.300> switch<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.480> on

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
the switches off under then switch it on

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
the red lights come up there see that

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.130 
the red lights come up there see that

only thing that's left to do now is to
switch<00:05:34.230> over<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.890> logic<00:05:35.220> boards<00:05:35.640> on<00:05:36.360> the<00:05:39.440> on

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
switch over the logic boards on the on

the<00:05:40.500> blu-ray<00:05:41.070> that<00:05:41.460> we<00:05:41.580> took<00:05:41.790> guide<00:05:42.030> this<00:05:42.450> is

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
the blu-ray that we took guide this is

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.540 
the blu-ray that we took guide this is
the<00:05:42.780> old<00:05:42.930> one<00:05:43.280> we've<00:05:44.280> got<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.520> put<00:05:44.880> this<00:05:46.280> new<00:05:47.280> on

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
the old one we've got to put this new on

the old one we've got to put this new on
back<00:05:48.300> on<00:05:48.330> so<00:05:49.260> we<00:05:49.590> replace<00:05:49.979> that<00:05:50.250> that<00:05:50.870> because

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
back on so we replace that that because

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.420 
back on so we replace that that because
this<00:05:52.110> board<00:05:52.440> is<00:05:52.560> matched<00:05:52.860> with<00:05:53.100> this

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
this board is matched with this

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.150 
this board is matched with this
motherboard
