00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello people she comes to my review 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.950
 to the long-range colors I suggest 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.490
 a few weeks on my hair 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.710
 As you can see, they are applied 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.820
 now pretty much out in the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.000
 camera looks even a bit 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.189
 better than they actually are 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.420
 So they are already on blue 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.859
 and green 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.349
 but as you can see already 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.700
 meanwhile pretty horrible and glass 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.079
 out and so and yes so I start with that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.500
 blue tone on 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.290
 I have to say I already have it 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.950
 used to have one expected that the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.660
 is not really nice clear blue 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.190
 but a bit ugly because of me 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.120
 on to the ordinary yellow in 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.360
 My hair was and I have 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.640
 have to say that is really very very 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.520
 So become very turquoise actually 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.510
 no more than blue at all 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.880
 have been designated 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.270
 yes, you have to definitely with 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.340
 if you look at the hair in 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.119
 this tone sounds and also in the yellow stroke 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.729
 it's just not getting so blue in there 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.159
 that Turkish has just become turquoise 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.110
 and I have that green for myself 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.579
 mixed together from flores and blue 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.229
 and turquoise and I can say that 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.770
 the corridor and low really only then 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.479
 florist your way if you as a pure 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 because as I said I have it 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.740
 had a mixed relationship and was 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.820
 then under blacklight and it has 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.700
 not really lit up 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.770
 but well then I will 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:53.399
 at some point apply pure and times 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.479
 look how it works then yes yes 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.920
 what else can you say about it then how 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.579
 you look pretty shitty now i 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.700
 I'll probably get it now 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.020
 next week or so remove and times 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.750
 look like the color then so 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.890
 finally go out completely 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.480
 I now have the experience so 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.099
 really made it happen 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:27.159
 it is best if you really fit 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:28.780
 white blonde hair advice because so yes it is 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.120
 shut up, it was a real one 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.370
 a bit annoying because just when you are 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.129
 then blue, for example, used or green 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.500
 and you have a bit like me 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.620
 orange peel hair then that's just the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.920
 complementary colors which means there comes 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.109
 then somehow something horribly brownish 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.700
 similar house at the end 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.040
 and yes, and you should really 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.590
 Be careful that you really all 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.489
 parts of the hair really nice and thick 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.379
 with the driver a blacksmith because I have 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.359
 I was given trouble but I was one 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.209
 a bit at one and that had to follow 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:13.470
 because in the back I have one somewhere 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:17.109
 StrÃ¤hne yes exactly there for example the 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.799
 really got pretty little color 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:25.660
 right in the middle and then always 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.069
 I stupid from behind so I see something 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.970
 now in luck but not others 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.190
 people just that you can see that in the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.349
 middle somehow the color at the transition 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.290
 did not really feel that way 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.760
 So I would really pay attention 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.699
 your place if you do that 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.639
 want to try with the directions 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:48.750
 that you really hope so carefully 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.799
 sticks out and your hair as bright as possible 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.870
 trying to get 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.090
 I mean the color is natural 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.250
 still nice and clear at the beginning 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.590
 so only when washing out there's the persistent 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.319
 problems as you see now 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.799
 I think that too, I really would 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.389
 I could have had those blonde hair 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.949
 hair is probably still so 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.199
 leave because then they would 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:14.440
 probably me so outside 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:22.210
 but never an ice blue or something like that 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:25.389
 Maybe yes it is of course stupid 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.490
 You can take me under the so in the 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.830
 Write comments if we like to 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.740
 every direction I have in now 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.419
 future would use a review or 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.120
 so where do I detail on that 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.000
 driving characteristics and just like them 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.400
 Wash yourself out and if I try 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.580
 if they let themselves be bleached out and 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.889
 I do not know if that 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.780
 interest there is so great times to look 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.919
 but I think I will with the colors 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.740
 definitely with the 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.030
 directions can favor first 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.710
 to get a plan because there I have 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.330
 again like it on a normal 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.979
 people have and yes maybe then comes 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.470
 again what is possible I still remember 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.389
 not exactly but as I said you write 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.130
 just in the comments if you are there 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.800
 I'm really interested in that 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.180
 I do something like that because I'm personal 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.530
 think that's really good if you know before 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.990
 like what you get from the colors too 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.300
 has expected and so and I have too 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.090
 already heard that there are colors 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.580
 in some cases not at all 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.889
 let wash out completely and so and 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.419
 If I have this experience, it is 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.270
 Really good if I can talk to you then 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.780
 So you can share these mistakes 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.520
 then not happen too 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.990
 but as I said all in all I am 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.849
 Still satisfied with the colors 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.699
 blond so pale blond one is the more 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.190
 better to say is the result 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.380
 what to expect 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.919
 and yes, I would say that's it too 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.630
 beautiful 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.630
 See you in the next video
