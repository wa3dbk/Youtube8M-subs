00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:39.819 
side here is gonna flop down a little

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.709 
side here is gonna flop down a little
bit<00:00:39.999> so<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:41.739> gonna<00:00:42.449> take<00:00:43.449> a<00:00:43.479> couple

bit so I'm gonna take a couple

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.319 
bit so I'm gonna take a couple
screwdrivers<00:00:44.649> I'm<00:00:45.609> just<00:00:45.789> gonna<00:00:45.879> lift<00:00:46.149> this

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
screwdrivers I'm just gonna lift this

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.619 
screwdrivers I'm just gonna lift this
end<00:00:46.390> up<00:00:46.809> just<00:00:47.109> just<00:00:47.530> so<00:00:47.649> it's<00:00:47.800> got<00:00:47.979> a<00:00:48.449> place<00:00:49.449> so

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
end up just just so it's got a place so

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.829 
end up just just so it's got a place so
it's<00:00:49.780> flat<00:00:50.109> right<00:00:50.440> there<00:00:51.479> because<00:00:52.479> I<00:00:52.569> want<00:00:52.780> to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
it's flat right there because I want to

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.430 
it's flat right there because I want to
want<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.559> keep<00:00:53.679> this<00:00:53.859> at<00:00:54.069> a<00:00:54.100> good<00:00:54.339> angle<00:00:55.260> okay

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
want to keep this at a good angle okay

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.099 
want to keep this at a good angle okay
I've<00:00:56.530> already<00:00:56.859> measured<00:00:57.239> make<00:00:58.239> sure<00:00:58.449> that<00:00:58.870> I

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
I've already measured make sure that I

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.279 
I've already measured make sure that I
can<00:00:59.170> cut<00:00:59.499> right<00:00:59.530> here<00:00:59.739> which<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.280> fine<00:01:01.229> okay<00:01:02.229> so

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
can cut right here which is fine okay so

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.369 
can cut right here which is fine okay so
hang<00:01:02.709> on<00:01:02.859> to<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.239> just<00:01:04.320> start<00:01:05.320> cutting

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
hang on to it and just start cutting

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.310 
hang on to it and just start cutting
cutting<00:01:06.159> away<00:01:06.400> little<00:01:06.850> strokes<00:01:10.110> got<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.140> ways

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
cutting away little strokes got a ways

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.870 
cutting away little strokes got a ways
to<00:01:11.350> go<00:01:11.680> because<00:01:11.890> I<00:01:11.979> got<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.219> cut<00:01:12.399> an<00:01:12.520> inch<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.850> a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
to go because I got to cut an inch and a

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.249 
to go because I got to cut an inch and a
half<00:01:12.909> usually<00:01:13.600> you're<00:01:13.719> just<00:01:13.750> going<00:01:14.229> through

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
half usually you're just going through

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.660 
half usually you're just going through
trim<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:14.920> that's<00:01:15.070> going<00:01:15.159> to<00:01:15.219> take<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:15.460> little

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
trim so that's going to take a little

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:26.350 
trim so that's going to take a little
while<00:01:15.909> longer

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.120 

fine<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.050> go<00:01:28.170> down<00:01:28.410> low<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
fine when you go if you go down low and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
fine when you go if you go down low and
then<00:01:29.280> over<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:29.940> top<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> back<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
then over to the top like that back and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.560 
then over to the top like that back and
forth<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.520> cut<00:01:32.730> a<00:01:32.760> little<00:01:33.030> bit<00:01:33.180> easier

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
forth you can cut a little bit easier

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.700 
forth you can cut a little bit easier
with<00:01:33.900> thicker<00:01:34.200> wood

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710

across it and clean up the edges all

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.710 
across it and clean up the edges all
you're<00:02:57.580> going<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> do<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:01.300> it's<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.510> nice

finished edge all the way around don't

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.720 
finished edge all the way around don't
go<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.650> way<00:03:05.920> because<00:03:06.069> you<00:03:06.220> may<00:03:06.430> chip

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
go this way because you may chip

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.070 
go this way because you may chip
something<00:03:07.000> off<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.420> always<00:03:07.569> want<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:07.930> go

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
something off you always want to go

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.870 
something off you always want to go
downwards<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:08.980> if<00:03:09.069> you're<00:03:09.220> on<00:03:09.280> this<00:03:09.430> side<00:03:09.670> you
