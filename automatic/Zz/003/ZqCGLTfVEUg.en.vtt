supposed to apply it directly to the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
trunk there is a correct way a

trunk there is a correct way a
recommended<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.779> I<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> citrus<00:00:31.560> tree

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
recommended way and I have a citrus tree

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.370 
recommended way and I have a citrus tree
that<00:00:32.219> ants<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.759> crawling<00:00:33.270> up<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.960> trunk<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that ants are crawling up the trunk and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.190 
that ants are crawling up the trunk and
seem<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.280> farming<00:00:35.790> or<00:00:36.570> reading<00:00:36.930> some<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
seem to be farming or reading some of

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.190 
seem to be farming or reading some of
the<00:00:37.530> citrus<00:00:38.489> flowers<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.450> buds<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> tree

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the citrus flowers of buds on the tree

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.400 
the citrus flowers of buds on the tree
so<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.190> want<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> properly<00:00:42.510> apply<00:00:43.020> some

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

to prevent them from crawling up the

to prevent them from crawling up the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
tree so let's get started on that this

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.889 
tree so let's get started on that this
is<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> citrus<00:00:51.059> tree<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> ant<00:00:51.660> problem

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is the citrus tree with the ant problem

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.139 
is the citrus tree with the ant problem
it's<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.379> those<00:00:52.620> black<00:00:52.980> ants<00:00:53.489> surprisingly

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it's not those black ants surprisingly

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.170 
it's not those black ants surprisingly
it's<00:00:54.329> those<00:00:54.570> small<00:00:55.789> ants<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.910> creep

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it's those small ants that creep

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.639 
it's those small ants that creep
those'll<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:58.050> Sandhills<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> even<00:01:01.500> though<00:01:01.620> I

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
those'll of Sandhills and even though I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.549 
those'll of Sandhills and even though I
move<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.370> I've<00:01:03.120> been<00:01:03.420> moving<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.960> pot<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
move this I've been moving this pot and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.450 
move this I've been moving this pot and
disrupting<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:06.600> ants<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.350> seem<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.830> keep<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
disrupting the ants they seem to keep on

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
disrupting the ants they seem to keep on
finding<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.360> creating<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.229> path

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
finding it and creating this little path

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.969 
finding it and creating this little path
I<00:01:10.799> put<00:01:11.070> down<00:01:11.220> their<00:01:11.430> scent<00:01:12.530> but<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.740> was

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
I put down their scent but I was

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
I put down their scent but I was
surprised<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.720> they're

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
surprised to see I think they're

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.880 
surprised to see I think they're
actually<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.409> pot<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.890> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
actually in the pot and this is the the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.340 
actually in the pot and this is the the
tree<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.340> has<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:21.000> problem<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.080> know

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
tree that has the problem I don't know

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
tree that has the problem I don't know
if<00:01:22.409> that's<00:01:23.420> frost<00:01:24.420> damage<00:01:25.490> or<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.759> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
if that's frost damage or if it's a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
if that's frost damage or if it's a
fungus<00:01:27.240> I'm<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.409> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
fungus I'm going to get some of that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.179 
fungus I'm going to get some of that
diatomaceous<00:01:29.040> earth<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:31.070> spread<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
diatomaceous earth and spread that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.910 
diatomaceous earth and spread that
around<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:33.540> some

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
around and have some

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.149 
around and have some
fungicide<00:01:34.920> powder<00:01:35.280> I'm<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> spray<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
fungicide powder I'm going to spray that

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.990 
fungicide powder I'm going to spray that
in<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.430> location<00:01:38.850> too<00:01:39.560> but<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.159> ants

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
in that location too but the ants

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.850 
in that location too but the ants
I<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.600> I've<00:01:42.810> hosed<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.229> off<00:01:43.409> several<00:01:43.740> times

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
I know I've hosed this off several times

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.740 
I know I've hosed this off several times
and<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.579> seem<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
and they seem to be just going to this

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.859 
and they seem to be just going to this
one<00:01:46.020> cluster<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.619> flowers<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:48.720> almost

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
one cluster of flowers and it almost

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.510 
one cluster of flowers and it almost
looks<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.259> they're<00:01:49.530> chewing<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.250> I

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
looks like they're chewing on them I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.990 
looks like they're chewing on them I
don't<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.540> any<00:01:51.720> aphids<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.759> here

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
don't see any aphids so you can see here

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.190 
don't see any aphids so you can see here
they're<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.479> little<00:01:54.659> cluster<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
they're on this little cluster of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.490 
they're on this little cluster of
flowers<00:01:56.509> doing<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.659> ants<00:01:57.960> do

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.250 

so<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.100> want<00:02:01.550> to<00:02:01.640> prevent<00:02:02.210> them<00:02:02.450> from<00:02:02.510> being

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
so I want to prevent them from being

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.990 
so I want to prevent them from being
able<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.620> crawl<00:02:03.860> up<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.190> bark<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.640> into<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
able to crawl up the bark and into the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.590 
able to crawl up the bark and into the
tree<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:07.400> tanglefoot<00:02:07.850> will<00:02:08.240> prevent

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
tree and the tanglefoot will prevent

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:16.000 
tree and the tanglefoot will prevent
that<00:02:09.220> if<00:02:10.220> applied<00:02:11.120> properly<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.830> see

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
that if applied properly so you can see

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.980 
that if applied properly so you can see
the<00:02:16.160> ants<00:02:16.340> they're<00:02:16.700> around<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.420> base<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.630> the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
the ants they're around the base of the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.890 
the ants they're around the base of the
trunk<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:19.150> looks<00:02:20.150> like<00:02:20.330> they<00:02:20.450> actually<00:02:20.810> have

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
trunk and looks like they actually have

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.570 
trunk and looks like they actually have
a<00:02:20.960> hole<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:23.420> they're<00:02:23.690> coming<00:02:24.020> out<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.520> I

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
a hole that they're coming out of so I

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.960 
a hole that they're coming out of so I
think<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.090> diatomaceous<00:02:26.510> earth<00:02:27.640> will<00:02:28.640> kill

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
think the diatomaceous earth will kill

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.720 
think the diatomaceous earth will kill
them<00:02:29.800> so<00:02:30.800> I'm<00:02:30.860> going<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.100> order<00:02:31.310> some<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.580> that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
them so I'm going to order some of that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.480 
them so I'm going to order some of that
I<00:02:32.120> see<00:02:32.300> Amazon<00:02:32.780> has<00:02:33.050> like<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> 10<00:02:33.560> pound<00:02:33.860> bag<00:02:33.980> for

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
I see Amazon has like a 10 pound bag for

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.810 
I see Amazon has like a 10 pound bag for
$18<00:02:35.420> that's<00:02:35.660> probably<00:02:35.900> enough<00:02:36.140> for<00:02:36.170> a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
$18 that's probably enough for a

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.550 
$18 that's probably enough for a
lifetime<00:02:37.820> for<00:02:38.120> me<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:40.400> I'll<00:02:40.459> give<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.820> try

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
lifetime for me so I'll give that a try

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.900 
lifetime for me so I'll give that a try
but<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:42.800> now<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.950> want<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.430> prevent<00:02:43.640> them<00:02:43.850> from

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
but for now I want to prevent them from

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.240 
but for now I want to prevent them from
getting<00:02:44.600> up<00:02:44.870> into<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.170> tree<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.740> I'm<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.220> to

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
getting up into the tree so I'm going to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.320 
getting up into the tree so I'm going to
apply<00:02:46.640> some<00:02:46.700> tanglefoot<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.970> if<00:02:50.090> you're<00:02:50.209> not

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
apply some tanglefoot so if you're not

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.690 
apply some tanglefoot so if you're not
familiar<00:02:50.480> with<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.959> product

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
familiar with the product

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.980 
familiar with the product
this<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.910> tanglefoot<00:02:55.570> that's<00:02:56.570> what<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.810> looks

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
this is tanglefoot that's what it looks

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.940 
this is tanglefoot that's what it looks
like<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.810> sticky<00:03:00.110> substance<00:03:00.440> that

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
like and it's the sticky substance that

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.240 
like and it's the sticky substance that
insects<00:03:01.370> don't<00:03:01.520> like<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:02.000> or<00:03:02.390> can't<00:03:03.250> crawl

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
insects don't like to or can't crawl

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.860 
insects don't like to or can't crawl
over<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:07.280> instead<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.640> applying<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.480> directly

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
over so instead of applying it directly

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.540 
over so instead of applying it directly
to<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.170> trunk<00:03:09.500> which<00:03:09.920> again<00:03:10.160> you're<00:03:10.430> not

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
to the trunk which again you're not

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.680 
to the trunk which again you're not
supposed<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.090> do<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:12.290> use<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:13.420> tangle<00:03:14.420> guard

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
supposed to do you use this tangle guard

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.160 
supposed to do you use this tangle guard
this<00:03:15.380> banding<00:03:15.950> material<00:03:16.489> which<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.630> also<00:03:17.810> used

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
this banding material which is also used

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.400 
this banding material which is also used
to<00:03:18.350> prevent<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.220> trunks<00:03:19.670> from<00:03:20.410> getting

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
to prevent the trunks from getting

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.330 
to prevent the trunks from getting
bruised<00:03:21.769> or<00:03:22.220> chewed<00:03:22.519> on<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.260> wrap<00:03:24.590> you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
bruised or chewed on and so you wrap you

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.710 
bruised or chewed on and so you wrap you
wrap<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.760> trunk<00:03:26.590> with<00:03:27.590> some<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:29.570> I'm

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
wrap the trunk with some of this and I'm

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.080 
wrap the trunk with some of this and I'm
going<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.989> use<00:03:30.080> some<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.320> this<00:03:30.530> painters

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
going to use some of this painters

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.570 
going to use some of this painters
masking<00:03:32.090> tape<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:32.989> then<00:03:33.560> underneath<00:03:34.040> because

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
masking tape and then underneath because

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.250 
masking tape and then underneath because
you<00:03:34.700> because<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.299> ant<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.840> ants<00:03:36.019> in

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
you because the ant the ants in

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.140 
you because the ant the ants in
particular<00:03:36.530> these<00:03:36.890> smaller<00:03:37.280> ones<00:03:37.400> can

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
particular these smaller ones can

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.110 
particular these smaller ones can
probably<00:03:38.420> easily<00:03:38.930> get<00:03:39.489> between<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.640> bark<00:03:40.910> and

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
probably easily get between the bark and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.020 
probably easily get between the bark and
the<00:03:41.480> spanning<00:03:41.900> material<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:43.760> pack<00:03:44.000> some

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
the spanning material you pack some

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.400 
the spanning material you pack some
cotton<00:03:44.600> underneath<00:03:46.090> try<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.170> create<00:03:48.170> a

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
cotton underneath try to create a

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.970 
cotton underneath try to create a
barrier<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.250> they<00:03:49.640> won't<00:03:49.850> be<00:03:49.970> able<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.980> get

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
barrier that they won't be able to get

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.759 
barrier that they won't be able to get
across<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.780> let<00:03:53.930> me<00:03:54.019> apply<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.350> and

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
across so let me apply this and

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.080 
across so let me apply this and
hopefully<00:03:54.890> prevent<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.610> ants<00:03:55.760> from<00:03:55.940> crawling

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
hopefully prevent the ants from crawling

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.650 
hopefully prevent the ants from crawling
up<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.630> trunk<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:56.959> into<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.620> tree<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:59.540> it's

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
up the trunk and into the tree so it's

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.479 
up the trunk and into the tree so it's
not<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.810> very<00:03:59.870> big<00:04:00.200> trunk<00:04:00.560> -<00:04:00.830> maybe<00:04:00.980> an<00:04:01.190> inch<00:04:01.340> in

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
not a very big trunk - maybe an inch in

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:09.930 
not a very big trunk - maybe an inch in
diameter<00:04:03.400> I'll<00:04:04.400> wrap<00:04:04.760> this<00:04:05.090> around<00:04:05.680> here

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.449 

and<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:11.060> have<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.239> put<00:04:11.420> some<00:04:11.659> of<00:04:11.810> that<00:04:12.459> cotton

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
and I have to put some of that cotton

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.140 
and I have to put some of that cotton
underneath<00:04:13.849> their<00:04:14.060> packet<00:04:14.540> underneath<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:20.120> I

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
underneath their packet underneath so I

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.949 
underneath their packet underneath so I
need<00:04:20.389> to<00:04:20.570> Oh

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
need to Oh

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:30.730 
need to Oh
that's<00:04:21.199> sort<00:04:21.380> of<00:04:21.470> easy<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:22.010> unwraps<00:04:29.350> now<00:04:30.350> my

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
that's sort of easy that unwraps now my

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.629 
that's sort of easy that unwraps now my
only<00:04:30.889> concern<00:04:30.979> is<00:04:31.550> if<00:04:31.729> this<00:04:31.880> stay<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.210> wet<00:04:32.690> I

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
only concern is if this stay is wet I

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.310 
only concern is if this stay is wet I
don't<00:04:34.639> know<00:04:34.930> if<00:04:35.930> that's<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:36.919> good<00:04:37.040> idea<00:04:37.100> or<00:04:37.550> not

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
don't know if that's a good idea or not

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.600 
don't know if that's a good idea or not
so<00:04:39.320> I'll<00:04:39.410> put<00:04:39.590> some<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:39.860> this<00:04:40.419> under<00:04:41.419> here<00:04:42.610> just

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
so I'll put some of this under here just

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.830 
so I'll put some of this under here just
need<00:04:43.789> to<00:04:44.030> have<00:04:44.210> that<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.240> bottom<00:04:47.600> portion

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
need to have that on the bottom portion
