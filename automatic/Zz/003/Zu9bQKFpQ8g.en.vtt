because the objective really is kind of

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.399 
because the objective really is kind of
your<00:02:43.799> KD<00:02:44.069> in<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:45.030> certain<00:02:45.209> way<00:02:45.359> that<00:02:45.450> I'm<00:02:45.900> of

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
doesn't matter most game modes which is

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.670 
doesn't matter most game modes which is
kind<00:02:50.159> of<00:02:50.220> true<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.909> team<00:02:51.090> deathmatch<00:02:51.680> you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680

know<00:02:52.769> your<00:02:52.980> KD<00:02:53.220> actually<00:02:53.730> does<00:02:53.970> matter

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
know your KD actually does matter

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.330 
know your KD actually does matter
because<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.870> know<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.019> can<00:02:55.230> get<00:02:55.379> like<00:02:55.590> 40

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340

kills but you could also died you know
60<00:02:58.469> times<00:02:58.709> even<00:02:59.010> though<00:02:59.159> it's<00:02:59.310> kind<00:02:59.430> of

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
60 times even though it's kind of

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.470 
60 times even though it's kind of
drastic<00:02:59.849> numbers<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.750> still<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.799> possible

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
drastic numbers but still it is possible

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.789 
drastic numbers but still it is possible
so<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> kind<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:03.989> team<00:03:04.200> deathmatch<00:03:04.560> for

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
so I kind of like team deathmatch for

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.429 
so I kind of like team deathmatch for
that<00:03:04.919> because<00:03:05.129> you<00:03:05.879> know<00:03:05.909> for<00:03:06.750> me<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.989> win<00:03:07.169> all

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
that because you know for me to win all

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.629 
that because you know for me to win all
I<00:03:07.469> have<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.709> do<00:03:07.829> is<00:03:07.950> kind<00:03:08.069> of<00:03:08.189> worried<00:03:08.370> about<00:03:08.400> my

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
I have to do is kind of worried about my

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.159 
I have to do is kind of worried about my
KD<00:03:08.909> and<00:03:09.150> getting<00:03:09.359> kills<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:09.840> stuff<00:03:09.989> like<00:03:10.109> that

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
KD and getting kills and stuff like that

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:15.110 
KD and getting kills and stuff like that
which<00:03:10.409> is<00:03:10.560> kind<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.769> cool<00:03:13.280> 143<00:03:14.280> CDM<00:03:14.669> definitely

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
which is kind of cool 143 CDM definitely

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.030 
which is kind of cool 143 CDM definitely
works<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.540> bit<00:03:15.840> different<00:03:16.230> than<00:03:16.349> black<00:03:16.590> ops<00:03:16.859> i

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
works a bit different than black ops i

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.469 
works a bit different than black ops i
don't<00:03:17.159> think<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.370> spawns<00:03:17.699> are<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.090> good<00:03:18.269> and

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:18.479 
don't think the spawns are as good and

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.259 
don't think the spawns are as good and
they're<00:03:19.049> not<00:03:19.260> as<00:03:19.470> predictable<00:03:20.040> they<00:03:21.030> kind<00:03:21.239> of

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
they're not as predictable they kind of

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.110 
they're not as predictable they kind of
have<00:03:21.419> some<00:03:21.599> random<00:03:21.959> spawns<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.769> yeah<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
have some random spawns so yeah for the
