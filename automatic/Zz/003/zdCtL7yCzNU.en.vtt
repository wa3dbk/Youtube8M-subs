some<00:01:30.340> way<00:01:30.549> they<00:01:30.940> won't<00:01:31.210> just<00:01:31.420> hit<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.720> turf

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
some way they won't just hit the turf

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.950 
some way they won't just hit the turf
and<00:01:32.170> break<00:01:33.119> decides<00:01:34.119> to<00:01:34.240> cut<00:01:34.420> away<00:01:34.540> for<00:01:34.900> all

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
and break decides to cut away for all
