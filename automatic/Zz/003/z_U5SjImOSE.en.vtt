00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.980
 You can paste it quickly and easily when changing the brow 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.980
 Ex iron is still on 2 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:23.080
 The adhesion is improved compared to the conventional iron rally bran paper and it is easier to stick 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:31.230
 bx iron Barry Fusumashi is pasted in dry iron as well as a steam iron 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.560
 It became 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.800
 And even cordless iron ok 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:43.190
 It can be stuck as it is without removing the frame 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.190
 It can also be peeled off with an iron when peeled 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:52.150
 Necessary tools are iron extension cord 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:55.900
 Masking tape scissors for cutting paper 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.989

 Pulling nails of a wooden shoal 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.070
 Or is Ponko 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:11.590
 It is the procedure of how to paste , but first prepares 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:17.280
 Use the interior crowbar and lift the bracket 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.280
 Pull out the nail that came out in seconds and remove the puller 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.270
 Wipe off the dust and dirt that was attached to the surface of the bran that is stuck 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.270
 I will repair the lost part 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:37.490
 And I do not put iron paper in the frame of bran 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.490
 The sliding doors Gas King tape for paper You have put the entire frame 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.240
 I will put on the iron when the preparation is complete 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:54.950
 Please wipe off the dirt on the bottom of the iron well 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:59.770
 Iron sets to high-temperature dry or high-temperature steam 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.770
 Connect the extension cord if necessary 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:12.560
 Lay the east horizontally and lay out the iron on it and decide the position to spread and paste the bran paper 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.560
 Let's check the upper and lower ones with the handle 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:22.920
 Next , be careful not to shift the position of the paper 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:32.120
 I slowly door to the back from the front of the sma iron 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:32.120
 Now we rely on ironing a sliding door from the center from the center to the left to the right 4 to equal parts 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.650
 If you are using a cordless iron, the temperature is likely to fall while charging at a low rate 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.650
 Please paste it 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.980
 Next I will apply the theory from the part of a 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.580
 From the center of bran to the outside 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:04.140
 Go against the order so that there is no stiffness of the applied before the frame 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:11.510
 bcd We will continue to rely on from the center to the outside in the same way 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.510
 Once you hit all over, please apply iron around the entire area . 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.250
 After putting the bran on the front like this 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.250
 Make a notch at the four corners of the paper 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.239
 And use the edge of the iron to determine the surroundings 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:39.290
 Next cut the extra part while hitting the top cut etc. 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.290
 We talk while relying on iron 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.750
 Place the iron around again to finish 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:04:01.830
 And Install the gold part been put in a cut with a cutter to pull part 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.830
 At this time, let's make the position of the nail eat in the habit of the eyebrow 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.370
 Please remove the masking tape at the end 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.100
 The replacement is now complete The beautiful bran is completed 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.100
