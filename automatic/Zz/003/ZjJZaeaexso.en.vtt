00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.700
 i 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.310
 2016 channel exercise on roller and 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.150
 famous the first review of the keyboard 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.779
 genesis 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.580
 rx 22 and well this review I have a 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.930
 new sonar camera and noticing what am I going to 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.609
 say the anticipations because I do not 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.359
 I want in network I just have to stay and 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:36.040
 30 fps and it's good the keyboard is very 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:39.070
 economic is very, very economic 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.100
 I could take it for about 20 a kind of 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.469
 10 on pc component I do not usually arrest 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.860
 the other seven of the world to start 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.640
 per component state at the price of 25 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.059
 euros 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:58.100
 with a little juice so I did not achieve 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:01.350
 nothing but if it 's better that way 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.379
 It is worth 25 euros 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.250
 the opinions are very good and yes yes yes 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.250
 6 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.969
 the truth 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.000
 I do not see photos cheating is like here 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.920
 we said so I can assure you 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.120
 clear a body that the keys are a 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.400
 little different because this one feels 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.790
 America 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.730
 for example the calcium of this water and 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.550
 occasional 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.550
 but I want to tell you that it has 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.520
 to eat means that you have three 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.890
 illuminations these posts are 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.420
 using the type of deal 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.190
 these are the ones that are medicines the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.760
 first is red the first is grace 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.990
 seconds blue the third the red and blue 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.180
 that is put you put and I take it 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.330
 I think it is a special entity of inah and 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.840
 It is done 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.650
 then this mouse and this keyboard by 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.350
 two beginner failures 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.160
 it's called genesis x 22 in case it's not 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.900
 you know that program and the keyboard is 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.250
 note that it's new because it's 30 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.650
 seconds of eight bacon systems 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.780
 potter and has less yielding to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.340
 beginning of 2010 or at the end with double 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.010
 do not listen to me 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.069
 then do so fast now let's go 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.310
 speak a little slower the keyboard what 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.560
 Most good parts Extra them 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.180
 Very comfortable design or very good 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.060
 the design is very very portable style 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.430
 but more not exist I am very rare but 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.040
 it feels great to be pulling the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.760
 first d at least it happened to me that a 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.470
 not exquisite day 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.480
 of seconds 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.730
 very economic so clear 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.310
 Now I'm going to say a couple of bad points 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.640
 which is that it moves a lot but to me it is 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:03.069
 a little demanding already knows how to handle a good 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.900
 key no I do not think this is what there 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.269
 people that if good people me for me 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:13.680
 case nothing totally happens to me 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.680
 sideburns after these two of the world 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.200
 I do not like to use normal ones and this 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.010
 and good 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.780
 the very economic price very much of this and os 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.520
 I recommend it one hundred percent 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.730
 and well I hope you liked this 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.319
 first back very short very well two 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.230
 of them won and a little bit because 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.290
 before he had done a 10 minute and 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.380
 such but good things in life that the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.140
 camera 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.870
 and good but you liked this video 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.010

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.010

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.980
 I'm going
