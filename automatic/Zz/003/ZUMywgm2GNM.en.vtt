00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.600
 very good to everyone with you is the 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.529
 final already has official video clip and that 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.529
 video clip please 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.939
 I do not know if you have had the opportunity to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
 watch the video but if not quiet 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.449
 because at the end of the video and leave a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
 link so you can see it and it's 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.619
 really good the truth I have to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 to say that I did not expect this kind of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.879
 videos because it's normal in Spain 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.489
 we usually take the very simple video very 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:35.190
 simple even sometimes q3 and wrong 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.500
 edited but this year not this year I do not know 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.940
 what happened as you are seeing in the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.860
 images that I'm putting here next 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 I can not put in pictures of the video 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 It's good to leave a photo. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.530
 photography that is pretty good that is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.790
 what catches the attention of the video and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.950
 I think he has really come out 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.430
 all the potential that the song had 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.350
 with respect to visual and in this case what 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.239
 You have very well congratulated me on 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.640
 photographic director and director of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.739
 video clip that by the way I think is the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030
 Rosary radio couple that shows 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.729
 What is the couple because they wanted 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 his girlfriend is perfect that a 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.030
 video clip because he has 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.829
 I got the truth that I am very 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 delighted with the video I think 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.759
 lovely I did not expect it so nice a 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.619
 video that means we get better 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.270
 Well, it does not have to be in a video clip 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.060
 simply the promotion of the song 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.399
 but yes 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.259
 the promotion is already good enough because 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.770
 the video clip is very good I'll return it to 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.630
 repeat 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.939
 I think that with that we can win some 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.039
 that another point is never known of all the 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.899
 mode not only the video clip but the 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.820
 song has been fixed a bit and they have 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.070
 several different touches to start 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.869
 the tones used by which at 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.220
 singing are a little different it seems that 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.049
 is that they have risen 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.329
 both the stanzas and the chorus has 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.770
 improved the final part a bit though 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.479
 For my taste they could have gotten it 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.189
 little bit of more cane but good inside 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.740
 that every time is fine and in conclusion 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.720
 has improved it saying could have done 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.970
 some tweaks are worse will do but to the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.520
 less have improved it now what remains 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.610
 is that live sounds just as good 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.500
 that as you hear in the video clip that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.689
 they are the difficult thing and I hope that it does and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.759
 Of course I hope that Rachel has 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.220
 that strength and this life that you see in 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.899
 the video clip because on stage in 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.299
 Spanish television was seen a little 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.310
 but I think that in Eurovision and 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.410
 the final in malmÃ¶ comes up and 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.360
 take out all the energy you have and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.300
 You can make a staging and 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.160
 performance of 10 flew less and I by my 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.680
 part I think at the beginning of April 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.770
 I will make a video saying more or less seen 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.110
 5 of favorite and I will do as always 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.360
 the years this channel not in my previous 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.910
 channel but I'll put the videos too 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.220
 here in a link my top 10 of each 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.990
 semifinal but before finishing well 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.000
 send a little treat to one of my 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.040
 followers because this morning he told me 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.600
 that was going to record a video send a 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.330
 I say today is my birthday so 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.100
 I send a kiss to Tadeo Rpp that his 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.080
 birthday so happy birthday 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.770

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.900
 premiering a kind of austro that 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.980
 I'm doing here to put everything that 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.420
 I've seen that everyone has given it 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.310
 well I'm going to do it thanks 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.200

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.090
