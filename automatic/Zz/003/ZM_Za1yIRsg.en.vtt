 cool attitude very simple the only one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:21.680
 problem or difficulty is 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.680
 english of the switch of the mechanical 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.420
 I developed two different 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.590

 12 volt car builder 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.610
 I have to say it really works 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.800
 Great I took the second step I got

 Marz decided to stop here 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.879
 works fine but I guess 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.989
 spare was in the case 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.430
 maybe paper clip or something 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.869
 maybe nice if someone still few 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.619
 could throw in ideas like me 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.180
 mechanical pen best because too 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.610
 right, I do not have it anymore as it is now 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.610

 a gauge covered the forces 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.170
 used a mechanical damage eight 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:35.540
 Men from the problem otherwise fast 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.810
 I found myself assembled 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.030
 I'm cool you're really up for it 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.200
 the best entry-level model for the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.739
 People are for the operator 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.000
 interested because the constant attitude 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:53.480
 a little bit complicated I have a long time 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.730
