00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.890
 on this show geneva 2013 it's a 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.650
 real festival of supercars because 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.450
 after ferrari who presented the ferrari 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.360
 it's mclaren's turn to make a 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.950
 big impression with peace 1,916 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.080
 horses that's the maximum power of 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.140
 this mclaren p1 for that she does 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.640
 use a v8 7135 horses but 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.520
 is completed by an electric motor 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.290
 so this is a hybrid car a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.170
 rechargeable hybrid car that can 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.960
 ride all electric up to 50 km 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.129
 hour and this on 20 km so that can 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.350
 look a little curious this kind of 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.780
 functionality on a supercar but that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.120
 significantly reduces 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.150
 average CO2 emissions since 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.229
 goes to 200 grams per kilometer that's 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.879
 a little bit like a password 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.839
 but in fact this hybrid engine is there 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.690
 also to act as a system kers 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.580
 that is to say boost acceleration 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.010
 his acceleration precisely which are 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.740
 completely crazy the car 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.950
 reaches 300 km / h in 17 seconds 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.780
 the top speed it is 350 km 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.610
 1 and at this speed we imagine that he 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.649
 still need aerodynamics very 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.930
 worked it shows on his body 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.170
 we have this particular reign which is 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.289
 deployable it unfolds behind the wheel with 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.260
 this little blue button that you see 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.680
 the small town bluefin him 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.720
 and serves to activate the system kers it's 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 to say a reserve of power at 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.220
 when we want to double for example 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.230
 the interior is very bare there is 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.540
 Carbon by all and for the people a 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.580
 little more mclaren removed buttons 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.980
 and transferred them to a screen 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.730
 touch all this implies consequent 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.990
 mclaren will be producing 3,175 copies sold 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.990
 1 million euros each 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.950
