that I played it and ultimately I had a
hard<00:00:21.720> time<00:00:21.810> deciding<00:00:22.350> whether<00:00:22.650> or<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:22.890> I

shouldn't put included in my actual top

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.140 
shouldn't put included in my actual top
10<00:00:25.260> or<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.590> because<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> deciding<00:00:26.939> factor

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and that factor was that the game is

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.299 
and that factor was that the game is
almost<00:00:29.609> identical<00:00:30.470> gameplay<00:00:31.470> wise<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.160> its

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.619 
and it actually really becomes like
there's<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.370> nemesis<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.090> are<00:03:23.180> trying<00:03:23.510> to

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
there's a nemesis that you are trying to

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.390 
there's a nemesis that you are trying to
kill<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.169> you<00:03:24.229> might<00:03:24.409> go<00:03:24.590> multiple<00:03:25.159> times

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
kill and you might go multiple times

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.979 
kill and you might go multiple times
trying<00:03:25.669> to<00:03:25.729> take<00:03:25.940> out<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.209> certain<00:03:26.540> guy<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
trying to take out the certain guy and

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.170 
trying to take out the certain guy and
it<00:03:27.349> adds<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.709> really<00:03:27.919> awesome<00:03:28.220> element<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.060> the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
it adds a really awesome element to the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.809 
it adds a really awesome element to the
game<00:03:29.209> outside<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.590> yeah<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.579> a<00:03:31.609> little

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
game outside of that yeah it is a little

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.969 
game outside of that yeah it is a little
bit<00:03:32.000> more<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.329> generic<00:03:32.629> combat<00:03:33.409> game<00:03:33.680> but

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:33.979 
bit more of a generic combat game but

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.080 
bit more of a generic combat game but
the<00:03:34.069> game<00:03:34.099> was<00:03:34.370> fun<00:03:34.639> enough<00:03:34.849> with<00:03:35.060> enough

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
the game was fun enough with enough

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.599 
the game was fun enough with enough
environments<00:03:35.930> enough<00:03:36.439> to<00:03:36.620> do<00:03:36.829> that<00:03:37.040> it<00:03:37.400> really

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
environments enough to do that it really

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.819 
environments enough to do that it really
was<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.879> cool<00:03:38.209> unique<00:03:38.780> game<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:39.349> especially

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
was a cool unique game and especially

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.619 
was a cool unique game and especially
you<00:03:40.189> have<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.579> play<00:03:40.729> the<00:03:40.879> next-gen<00:03:41.269> version

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
you have to play the next-gen version

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.030 
you have to play the next-gen version
because<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.019> increased<00:03:42.409> graphics<00:03:42.889> and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
because of the increased graphics and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.439 
because of the increased graphics and
the<00:03:43.069> improvements<00:03:43.579> to<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.759> Nemesis<00:03:44.120> system

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
the improvements to the Nemesis system

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.210 
the improvements to the Nemesis system
over<00:03:44.689> the<00:03:44.810> last<00:03:45.019> gen<00:03:45.290> version<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:46.069> was

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
over the last gen version it was

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.369 
over the last gen version it was
refreshing<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:47.030> was<00:03:47.389> different<00:03:47.689> it<00:03:48.199> was<00:03:48.349> a

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
refreshing it was different it was a

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.719 
refreshing it was different it was a
great<00:03:48.620> entry<00:03:49.099> into<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.400> land<00:03:49.609> of

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
great entry into the land of

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.249 
great entry into the land of
middle-earth<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.329> hope<00:03:50.689> that<00:03:50.810> they<00:03:50.900> can<00:03:51.079> keep

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:51.259 
middle-earth I hope that they can keep

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:53.409 
middle-earth I hope that they can keep
up<00:03:51.470> with<00:03:51.799> this<00:03:51.949> and<00:03:52.220> possibly<00:03:52.459> even<00:03:52.849> improve

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
up with this and possibly even improve

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.449 
up with this and possibly even improve
upon<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.019> really<00:03:54.290> feel<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.620> if<00:03:54.709> they<00:03:54.859> tweak

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
upon it I really feel that if they tweak

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.099 
upon it I really feel that if they tweak
it<00:03:55.609> a<00:03:55.669> little<00:03:55.879> bit<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.359> add<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.780> little<00:03:56.959> bit

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
it a little bit and add a little bit

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.960 
it a little bit and add a little bit
more<00:03:57.290> story<00:03:57.769> element<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.519> than<00:03:58.669> they<00:03:58.759> had

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
more story element to it than they had

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.460 
more story element to it than they had
in<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.239> game<00:03:59.479> that<00:03:59.989> this<00:04:00.169> could<00:04:00.319> be

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
in this game that this could be

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.199 
in this game that this could be
excellent<00:04:00.859> and<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.159> could<00:04:01.280> even<00:04:01.489> become<00:04:01.759> a

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
excellent and this could even become a

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.449 
excellent and this could even become a
game<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.720> Year<00:04:02.840> contender<00:04:03.049> later<00:04:04.009> on<00:04:04.220> but
