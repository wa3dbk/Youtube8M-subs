00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
late to the campground and it takes an

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.569 
late to the campground and it takes an
hour<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.650> get<00:00:38.800> there<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.100> we're<00:00:39.190> gonna<00:00:39.280> be<00:00:39.430> at

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579
