greenhouse or humid environment and this
is<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.640> prevent<00:00:26.880> botrytis<00:00:27.330> or<00:00:27.810> gray<00:00:28.050> mold

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
is to prevent botrytis or gray mold

starting on the dead growth and getting

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.389 
starting on the dead growth and getting
into<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> living<00:00:31.470> plants<00:00:32.360> so<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> do

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
into the living plants so what I do

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.360 
into the living plants so what I do
first<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.610> all<00:00:35.989> move<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> flower<00:00:37.320> stalks<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
first of all move the flower stalks you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.560 
first of all move the flower stalks you
could<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.730> little<00:00:38.879> pair<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.270> scissors<00:00:39.540> for

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
could use little pair of scissors for

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
could use little pair of scissors for
this<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.309> pull<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
this but I actually just like to pull it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.400 
this but I actually just like to pull it
off<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> give<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.020> little<00:00:43.140> bit<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
off and if you give it a little bit of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.680 
off and if you give it a little bit of
flex<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.460> little<00:00:44.640> tug<00:00:45.770> you'll<00:00:46.770> find<00:00:47.160> that

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
flex and a little tug you'll find that

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.850 
flex and a little tug you'll find that
it<00:00:48.690> breaks<00:00:48.989> off<00:00:51.710> quite<00:00:52.710> cleanly<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:55.620> takes<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
it breaks off quite cleanly it takes a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
it breaks off quite cleanly it takes a
bit<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> practice<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.600> do

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
bit of practice and you really got to do

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.910 
bit of practice and you really got to do
it<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.079> some<00:00:58.289> confidence

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it with some confidence

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
it with some confidence
if<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.340> can't<00:00:59.579> half-heartedly<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.870> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
if you can't half-heartedly do it the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
if you can't half-heartedly do it the
danger<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> you'll<00:01:01.739> pull<00:01:01.980> half<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.430> plants

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
danger is you'll pull half your plants

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.950 
danger is you'll pull half your plants
out<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> pots<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:06.210> other<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> go

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.640 

then<00:01:12.560> I<00:01:12.650> proceeded<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.070> go<00:01:13.310> along<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:14.119> pull<00:01:15.049> or

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
then I proceeded to go along to pull or

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.060 
then I proceeded to go along to pull or
cut<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:17.119> old<00:01:17.240> leaves<00:01:17.450> off<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:20.360> can<00:01:20.540> see<00:01:21.070> these

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
cut the old leaves off you can see these

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.730 
cut the old leaves off you can see these
are<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.400> older<00:01:22.790> ones<00:01:23.710> really<00:01:24.710> dry<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.430> brown

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
are the older ones really dry and brown

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.410 
are the older ones really dry and brown
they<00:01:27.740> just<00:01:27.979> pull<00:01:28.220> off<00:01:28.780> quite<00:01:29.780> easily<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:31.420> be

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
they just pull off quite easily to be

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.630 
they just pull off quite easily to be
sure<00:01:32.750> that<00:01:33.020> you're<00:01:33.200> not<00:01:33.350> actually<00:01:33.560> get<00:01:34.520> to

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
sure that you're not actually get to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.160 
sure that you're not actually get to
pull<00:01:34.820> your<00:01:35.000> plant<00:01:35.360> out<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.810> pot<00:01:35.869> while

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
pull your plant out of the pot while

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.910 
pull your plant out of the pot while
you're<00:01:36.320> doing<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:38.060> can<00:01:38.090> actually<00:01:38.570> use

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
you're doing it you can actually use

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.100 
you're doing it you can actually use
thumb<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.070> forefinger<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.600> put<00:01:42.080> some

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
thumb and forefinger just to put some

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.529 
thumb and forefinger just to put some
downward<00:01:42.500> pressure<00:01:42.680> on<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.970> plant<00:01:44.240> at<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
downward pressure on the plant at the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.609 
downward pressure on the plant at the
same<00:01:44.720> time<00:01:45.200> as<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:45.619> just<00:01:45.830> cut<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.420> trap<00:01:47.619> with

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
same time as you just cut the trap with

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.249 
same time as you just cut the trap with
your<00:01:48.770> fingernails<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:50.270> way<00:01:50.450> you're<00:01:51.229> not

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
your fingernails that way you're not

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.719 
your fingernails that way you're not
going<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.619> be<00:01:51.710> pulling<00:01:52.039> your<00:01:52.130> plant<00:01:52.429> has<00:01:52.520> of

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
going to be pulling your plant has of

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.370 
going to be pulling your plant has of
the<00:01:52.789> pot<00:01:55.570> something<00:01:56.570> come<00:01:56.720> away<00:01:56.990> really

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
the pot something come away really

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.290 
the pot something come away really
easily<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:59.710> tend<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.800> remove<00:02:01.160> anything<00:02:01.940> at<00:02:02.210> this

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
easily I tend to remove anything at this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.700 
easily I tend to remove anything at this
time<00:02:02.539> of<00:02:02.630> year<00:02:02.780> that's<00:02:02.899> got<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.170> little<00:02:03.440> bit<00:02:03.590> of

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
time of year that's got a little bit of

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.080 
time of year that's got a little bit of
vermin<00:02:04.539> die<00:02:05.539> back<00:02:05.780> in<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:06.050> because<00:02:07.090> certainly

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
vermin die back in it because certainly

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.969 
vermin die back in it because certainly
next<00:02:08.390> week<00:02:08.570> I'd<00:02:08.840> have<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.320> go<00:02:09.470> around<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:09.860> do

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
next week I'd have to go around and do

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.309 
next week I'd have to go around and do
it<00:02:10.009> again<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:11.030> really<00:02:11.180> depends<00:02:11.630> on<00:02:11.750> how<00:02:11.959> often

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
it again it really depends on how often

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.000 
it again it really depends on how often
you<00:02:12.500> want<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.130> do<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:15.110> there<00:02:15.290> we<00:02:15.410> are<00:02:15.440> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
you want to do this so there we are the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.039 
you want to do this so there we are the
after<00:02:16.430> all<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.299> old<00:02:17.450> leaves<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:17.900> been

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
after all the old leaves have been

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.890 
after all the old leaves have been
removed<00:02:18.380> I'll<00:02:19.120> find<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.269> come<00:02:20.540> December

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
removed I'll find that come December

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.979 
removed I'll find that come December
I'll<00:02:21.260> have<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.890> go<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.040> do<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.370> again<00:02:22.549> and<00:02:23.030> I

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
I'll have to go and do that again and I

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.610 
I'll have to go and do that again and I
would<00:02:24.049> expect<00:02:24.650> all<00:02:24.970> these<00:02:25.970> longer<00:02:26.510> leaves<00:02:26.780> to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
would expect all these longer leaves to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.069 
would expect all these longer leaves to
have<00:02:27.739> died<00:02:27.980> off<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.480> shorter<00:02:29.870> ones

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
have died off and just the shorter ones

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.920 
have died off and just the shorter ones
to<00:02:30.380> be<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:31.190> remain<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.970> all<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.660> goodness

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
to be to remain and all the goodness

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.930 
to be to remain and all the goodness
from<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.440> older<00:02:33.709> leaves<00:02:33.829> will<00:02:34.280> be<00:02:34.400> stored<00:02:34.760> in

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
from the older leaves will be stored in

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.709 
from the older leaves will be stored in
the<00:02:35.060> bulb<00:02:35.440> under<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.530> ground
