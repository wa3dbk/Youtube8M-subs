colors the best way to work with these I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.600 
colors the best way to work with these I
found<00:00:43.640> is<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.810> put<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.380> colors<00:00:45.710> into<00:00:45.980> a

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
comfortable to use it's not heavy this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.620 
comfortable to use it's not heavy this
is<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.060> good<00:00:53.390> way<00:00:53.960> of<00:00:54.260> carrying<00:00:54.950> a<00:00:55.130> brushes<00:00:55.630> and

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
is a good way of carrying a brushes and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.360 
is a good way of carrying a brushes and
I've<00:00:56.720> got<00:00:56.900> a<00:00:56.930> selection<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.740> things<00:00:57.980> here<00:00:58.220> but

you're looking for a brush that has a

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.209 
you're looking for a brush that has a
fat<00:01:10.729> belly<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:11.509> it<00:01:11.600> will<00:01:11.719> hold<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.950> carry

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
fat belly so it will hold and carry

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.270 
fat belly so it will hold and carry
plenty<00:01:13.579> of<00:01:13.909> color<00:01:14.210> but<00:01:14.479> it<00:01:15.259> also<00:01:15.439> comes<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.250> a

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
plenty of color but it also comes to a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.669 
plenty of color but it also comes to a
fine<00:01:16.579> point<00:01:17.020> water<00:01:18.020> soluble<00:01:18.530> graphite

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
fine point water soluble graphite

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.389 
fine point water soluble graphite
pencils<00:01:19.520> very<00:01:19.850> useful<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.679> also<00:01:21.679> propelling

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
pencils very useful and also propelling

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.840 
pencils very useful and also propelling
pencils<00:01:22.880> with<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.450> reasonably<00:01:24.079> soft<00:01:24.380> lead<00:01:24.850> so

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
pencils with a reasonably soft lead so

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.370 
pencils with a reasonably soft lead so
painting<00:01:26.509> on<00:01:27.070> surfaces<00:01:28.149> it's<00:01:29.149> always<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:30.079> good

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
painting on surfaces it's always a good

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.459 
painting on surfaces it's always a good
idea<00:01:30.439> to<00:01:30.829> have<00:01:31.520> sketchbooks<00:01:32.329> perhaps<00:01:33.200> more

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
idea to have sketchbooks perhaps more

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.370 
idea to have sketchbooks perhaps more
useful<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.189> have<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:35.030> sketchbook<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.020> is

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
useful is to have a sketchbook that is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.160 
useful is to have a sketchbook that is
spiral-bound<00:01:37.009> these<00:01:37.759> are<00:01:37.999> far<00:01:38.299> easier<00:01:38.329> to<00:01:38.899> use

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
spiral-bound these are far easier to use

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.429 
spiral-bound these are far easier to use
you<00:01:39.710> can<00:01:39.890> open<00:01:40.009> them<00:01:40.280> out<00:01:40.399> flat<00:01:41.170> up<00:01:42.170> to

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
you can open them out flat up to

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.379 
you can open them out flat up to
different<00:01:42.619> sizes<00:01:43.340> different<00:01:43.369> qualities<00:01:44.359> of
