silos that are essentially useless I'm

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.400 
silos that are essentially useless I'm
serious<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.260> don't<00:02:16.379> know<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:16.560> these<00:02:16.650> dude

it's<00:02:19.410> like<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.800> feel<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.129> they<00:02:20.450> tried

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it's like I feel like they tried

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.910 
it's like I feel like they tried
programming<00:02:22.080> into<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.349> game<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.650> they<00:02:22.739> just

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
programming into the game if they just

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.600 
programming into the game if they just
really<00:02:23.540> or<00:02:24.540> something<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.069> kind<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.280> spaz

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
really or something it just kind of spaz

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:41.770 
really or something it just kind of spaz
out<00:02:29.000> anybody<00:02:30.000> knows<00:02:30.299> what<00:02:30.450> those<00:02:30.569> things

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.809 

it's<00:02:42.290> actually<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.590> specific<00:02:43.130> building<00:02:43.640> in

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
it's actually a specific building in

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.160 
it's actually a specific building in
space<00:02:44.030> were<00:02:44.240> supposed<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.569> be<00:02:44.630> strapped<00:02:44.959> think

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
space were supposed to be strapped think

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.960 
space were supposed to be strapped think
I<00:02:45.200> think<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.680> actually<00:02:48.819> interact<00:02:49.819> ship

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
I think it's actually interact ship

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.990 
I think it's actually interact ship
destroy<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.360> whole<00:02:50.450> base<00:02:50.660> but<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:52.760> more<00:02:52.940> fun

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
destroy the whole base but it's more fun

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.090 
destroy the whole base but it's more fun
to<00:02:53.209> do<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.830> I'm<00:02:54.830> out<00:02:54.950> of<00:02:54.980> napalm<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:57.069> okay<00:02:58.069> so
