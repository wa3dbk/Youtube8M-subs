00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.230
 very good friends and friends, I am aldo 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.630
 barely and this time I bring you the 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:13.130
 review about a laser swords mode 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.130
 so let's go to it 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.650
 how you will have realized the mode of 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.830
 laser swords is basically the swords 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.829
 star wars laser and I'll show you how 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.100
 make your own lightsaber and 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.020
 we will start in parts 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.030
 and the first thing we are going to build is the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.500
 bottom of our laser sword 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.750
 to build it 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.900
 we need two blocks of obsidian 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.440
 three iron ingots and in the center 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.140
 we will indicate a closing dust that we 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.750
 going to hit the bottom of our 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.570
 nasser sword later we would have to 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.090
 build the top that 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.600
 we would need six iron ingots 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.620
 a powder the rest and in the center a bucket 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.010
 crystal 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.049
 then we will need to build the 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.330
 crystal that was going to give power to our 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.450
 woods make four diamonds and in the 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.190
 dye mode center in this case would be 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.920
 yellow to be given the shovels to 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.770
 the yellow then we put in the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.960
 lower part the glass and the part 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.810
 superior in this way on our table 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.329
 crafter and also a button in this part 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.189
 that is going to give us this piece of sword 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.250
 we just have to click 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.150
 right and the sword is not going to appear 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.580
 To be 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.630
 there are also five other colors 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.250
 apart from the yellow being the blue the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 Red 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.979
 and the purple 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.460
 the green and the white all these are 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.970
 laser swords we can build 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 they are basically what adds that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.730
 extra that they also have the movie of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.100
 hardware 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.450
 we are going to have I do not know if you can 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.880
 listen but each laser sword 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.160
 when we do it right click takes out the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.590
 same sound of the laser sword which 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.330
 comes very very father and probably not 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.970
 be heard since my program of 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.920
 recording is not very good and that would not be 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.990
 a big mistake but at the moment 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.550
 you go down in this mode and try it 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.190
 in your world in sant realize that you are 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.980
 very very cool apart that they will have given 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.020
 account on our left screen or 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.660
 at the top of the screen in 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.510
 the left side 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.600
 they will realize that there are two words or 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.410
 two phrases 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.560
 what they say light force and light jong the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.080
 fort is changing depending on the 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.600
 sword that we have in the brothers and is 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.970
 basically the level of effort 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.069
 and what is this we also have 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.760
 skills and 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.159
 one of them baby doing the jump 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.840
 to make the jump if you look at the 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.730
 forum bar you see we have 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.939
 We have to maintain tension 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.370
 pressed and the space bar and it 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.500
 automatically loads the entire bar of 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.159
 jong at the moment it's charged and 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.739
 let's go we give a super jump and neither 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.540
 we have damage because there goes always and 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.090
 when we have our words in 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.489
 our hands are not going to suffer damage 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.099
 because it helps even if we fall from a 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.069
 mountain to a precipice we are not going to 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.200
 suffer no harm from falling another 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.500
 skill that we have would be the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.480
 run faster for an equal time 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.639
 that the city to do that we will have 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.400
 have to be running and press the 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:39.010
 key if you set yourself introduce yourself class and 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.920
 it moved a little faster but 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.080
 force is also consumed 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.270
 hit me so I could recharge the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.110
 force we have to make him shift with 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.110
 Left chip and it is fully charged 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.240
 we again do 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.040
 we grab a little bit faster shift 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.040
 it is believed that left everything false 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.050
 we have another skill that would come 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.310
 being the one to dodge the arrows of the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.380
 archers 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.680
 to be able to dodge the arrows of the 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.470
 archers or the skeletons simply 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.530
 we have to find the letter x and if 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.480
 they fix the sword it goes forward 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.480
 but it's also consuming what's coming 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.470
 being force this requires a 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.700
 little bit of practice is a little bit 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.460
 difficult to go 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.320
 to detect or dodge all the arrows 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.750
 of the archers but it's a skill 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.700
 very cool 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.530
 so I said I prepare something for 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.530
 show them how this would work 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.900
 today we are here again and I have 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.770
 prepared a device that is going to 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.639
 allow to test the laser sword 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.270
 now we are going to 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.270
 click him 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.440
 if they are fixed let's keep and left 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.200
 in click 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.000
 the x pressed 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.540
 Y 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.540
 it is done 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.440
 if it is fixed 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.750
 when talking to him ends with him is 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.290
 perfect 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.840
 and this is coming very father the trick 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.320
 is would be keeping the chip 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.310
 pressed at the same time that we are him 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.820
 with the x for from flex to see 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.530
 and reflect them the arrows so that 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.900
 load immediately and do not have to 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.680
 be concerned about the level of strength 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.500
 that we have or not 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.500
 well this would be everything that we 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.849
 offers this mode gives us the ability to 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.129
 run as it already gives us the ability to 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.709
 and jump as high as the old ones and 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:54.610
 without suffering harm because it helps and in addition to 

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:56.180
 reflect or reflect all the arrows in 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.699
 our enemies 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.979
 If you liked this mode, I'm going to leave you 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.560
 the description the link where they will be able to 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.539
 download it as well as the link 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.610
 for the map that this is a map of 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.580
 developments that are very very cool and 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.590
 also the textures pack is said to 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.930
 they will have stuck there are things that do not 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.699
 They look like what I said they were but it 's 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.680
 simply by the father of detectors 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.870
 to make it look a little bit more more 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.800
 nice all this presentation the way 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.780
 that I think he deserves this came 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.759
 being all for this video by this mode

 video is bringing reviews of this 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:58.420
 style would also be bringing maps 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.490
 maps to downloads
