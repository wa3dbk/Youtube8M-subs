00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello friends with you Anton 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.100
 Dyachenko 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:12.090
 and in this video we will connect 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:21.150
 laptop to tv on hdmi cable here 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:23.900
 such a cable 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.349
 so what do we need we need to find 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:37.680
 plug with dima on the laptop and stick 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:44.460
 there either end of cable 1 and then the second 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 end of the cable we plug into any of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:01:06.990
 TV connectors want this want 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:01:10.189
 here in this one like this then turn on then 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.189
 turn on the TV 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.220
 can be connected and hot that is not 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.230
 be sure to turn off completely 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.680
 computer completely turn off the TV 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:31.160
 possible in principle and on the go so then 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.120
 button or input or he and there is 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:39.330
 winter button choose the signal 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:53.520
 our winter part 1 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:57.060
 and look goes data retrieval so no 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:03.840
 signal for some reason if this happens 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:07.410
 then press the fn key on the laptop 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.360
 functions and I have it on her f4 key 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.590
 monitor you can be drawn 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.040
 it is different that is, we press it and on the screen 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.220
 there is such a little thing we can then 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.760
 there is a choice of viewing mode we can 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.040
 to expand 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.700
 we can only include projects then 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.530
 I mean our TV is only a computer or 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.760
 duplicate for example we want 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.230
 duplicate here in this case on 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.940
 TV and it appears exactly the same 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.730
 image so well, in principle, you can 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.370
 different options can be expanded 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:52.709
 then the TV will be a continuation 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:57.930
 computer screen computer how else 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:02.130
 can manage we can manage 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:06.140
 as follows we can press right 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.980
 mouse button select the screen resolution and 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.730
 here if we have chosen to expand these 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.160
 screens 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.090
 then we can change such places 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.910
 location that is, we carry the first screen 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.520
 here and we have the first screen tus tap 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:28.260
 laptop will mean 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.140
 on the left and the TV screen on the right that is 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.260
 if we pinch the window and transfer 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:41.090
 right then left and apply need 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:45.440
 let's apply now take the window and 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.440
 drag it to the right on the screen 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:55.380
 TV here just as you can here 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.960
 adjust resolution but in principle she 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:05.720
 automatically permission on this that is she 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:09.450
 In principle, everything is automatically normal 1 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:19.130
 0 and now you can, in principle 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:26.820
 run the movie in good quality on 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:29.210
 the TV then there is not so movies 90s roshe 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.210
 film 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.509
 so here it is the film we take it and 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:52.199
 We transfer we press twice and you can watch 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:55.860
 we close the laptop and everything disappears for 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:05:01.490
 so that nothing is lost 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:09.360
 enable only project using keys 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:11.969
 fnaf4 we only include projects and have 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.409
 us the laptop screen goes blank and here goes 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:21.930
 the film is great but the sound goes 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:27.979
 through the speakers by a computer to this 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.979
 can be solved as follows 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:37.250
 sound settings 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:37.250
 write open start control panel 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:42.169
 there must be a sound somewhere 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:06:01.110
 category 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:06:05.190
 equipment sound and now here to us 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:13.560
 need to turn on our TV here and 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:19.770
 turn off the speakers here and now because 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:27.210
 you can now customize the sound using 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:34.550
 dick remote so lost sound no key 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:37.260
 tuned and watched by the whole family 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.930
