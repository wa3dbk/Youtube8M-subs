here all hardwired smoke alarms are

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.030 
here all hardwired smoke alarms are
going<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.450> have<00:00:44.630> a<00:00:44.660> battery<00:00:45.050> backup<00:00:45.260> because

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
going to have a battery backup because

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.430 
going to have a battery backup because
if<00:00:46.190> your<00:00:46.340> power<00:00:46.579> goes<00:00:46.730> out<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:47.720> need<00:00:47.960> another

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
if your power goes out you need another

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.780 
if your power goes out you need another
system<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:48.950> power<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.610> smoke<00:00:49.880> alarm<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.980> when

system to power the smoke alarm so when
the<00:00:52.969> power<00:00:53.210> goes<00:00:53.510> out<00:00:53.719> you're<00:00:54.050> going<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.260> just

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
the power goes out you're going to just

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.100 
the power goes out you're going to just
detach<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:55.370> from<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.730> ceiling<00:00:56.149> open<00:00:56.870> the

get<00:00:59.930> a<00:00:59.960> new<00:01:00.200> battery<00:01:00.440> in<00:01:00.680> your<00:01:00.950> places<00:01:01.219> you

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
get a new battery in your places you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.149 
get a new battery in your places you
should<00:01:02.420> do<00:01:02.629> this<00:01:02.870> twice<00:01:03.230> a<00:01:03.440> year<00:01:03.649> don't<00:01:03.860> just

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
should do this twice a year don't just

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.300 
should do this twice a year don't just
wait<00:01:04.430> for<00:01:04.850> for<00:01:05.719> the<00:01:05.840> power<00:01:06.049> to<00:01:06.170> go<00:01:06.439> out<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:06.920> to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
wait for for the power to go out and to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.800 
wait for for the power to go out and to
find<00:01:07.340> out<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.729> it's<00:01:08.030> not<00:01:08.209> working<00:01:08.479> change

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
find out that it's not working change

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.919 
find out that it's not working change
the<00:01:09.530> battery<00:01:09.829> regularly<00:01:10.759> even<00:01:11.539> though<00:01:11.689> your

early detection is one of the best ways
to<00:01:19.639> survive<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.509> fire<00:01:20.920> remember<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.069> want<00:01:22.369> to

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
to survive a fire remember you want to

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.609 
to survive a fire remember you want to
check<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.179> change<00:01:23.569> the<00:01:23.869> batteries<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.380> your

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
check and change the batteries in your

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.709 
check and change the batteries in your
smoke<00:01:24.740> alarm<00:01:25.279> twice<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.939> year<00:01:26.329> when<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.689> change

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
smoke alarm twice a year when you change

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.649 
smoke alarm twice a year when you change
your<00:01:27.229> clocks<00:01:27.560> change<00:01:28.310> your<00:01:28.520> battery<00:01:28.969> just

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
your clocks change your battery just

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.300 
your clocks change your battery just
because<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:30.200> hardwired<00:01:30.709> into<00:01:30.979> your<00:01:31.130> house

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
because it's hardwired into your house

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.399 
because it's hardwired into your house
doesn't<00:01:31.729> mean<00:01:31.909> that<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.359> can<00:01:32.539> neglect<00:01:32.929> this

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
doesn't mean that you can neglect this

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.499 
doesn't mean that you can neglect this
you<00:01:33.709> still<00:01:34.069> need<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.520> put<00:01:34.700> new<00:01:34.969> batteries<00:01:35.149> in

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
you still need to put new batteries in

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.529 
you still need to put new batteries in
there<00:01:35.899> twice<00:01:36.499> a<00:01:36.709> year<00:01:36.979> if<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.819> smoke<00:01:38.029> alarm<00:01:38.329> is

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
there twice a year if the smoke alarm is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.169 
there twice a year if the smoke alarm is
chirping<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:39.829> time<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.279> change<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.789> battery

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
chirping it's time to change the battery

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.239 
chirping it's time to change the battery
sometimes<00:01:41.929> it<00:01:42.109> may<00:01:42.349> not<00:01:42.380> do<00:01:42.829> that<00:01:43.009> because

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
sometimes it may not do that because

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.580 
sometimes it may not do that because
it's<00:01:43.639> hardwired<00:01:44.179> but<00:01:44.749> it<00:01:44.869> should<00:01:45.079> have<00:01:45.319> some

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
it's hardwired but it should have some

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.679 
it's hardwired but it should have some
type<00:01:45.799> of<00:01:45.979> indicator<00:01:46.459> to<00:01:46.819> let<00:01:46.849> you<00:01:47.149> know<00:01:47.329> you
