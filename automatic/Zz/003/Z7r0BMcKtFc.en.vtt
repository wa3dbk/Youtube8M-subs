00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.040 
that I feel is playing out in real time
just<00:01:56.430> want<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> part<00:01:57.480> of<00:01:57.570> something<00:01:57.780> that

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
just want to be a part of something that

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.830 
just want to be a part of something that
makes<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.590> ponder<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.670> human<00:02:00.390> interaction

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
makes you ponder about human interaction

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.140 
makes you ponder about human interaction
that<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.950> takes<00:02:02.220> your<00:02:02.340> breath<00:02:02.520> away

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
that just takes your breath away

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.770 
that just takes your breath away
this<00:02:03.360> isn't<00:02:03.750> about<00:02:03.930> black<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.620> white<00:02:05.720> this<00:02:06.720> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
this isn't about black and white this is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.710 
this isn't about black and white this is
about<00:02:07.170> Eloise
