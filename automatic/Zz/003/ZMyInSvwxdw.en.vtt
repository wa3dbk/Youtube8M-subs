00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
because when I turn this on it's going

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.930 
because when I turn this on it's going
to<00:04:53.430> basically<00:04:54.680> stop<00:04:55.680> once<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.580> turn<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:56.910> on

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
to basically stop once I turn it on

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.200 
to basically stop once I turn it on
because<00:04:57.180> it's<00:04:57.570> going<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.520> be<00:04:59.520> really<00:04:59.880> really

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
because it's going to be really really

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:11.640 
because it's going to be really really
thick

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.700 

this<00:05:12.650> is<00:05:12.830> where<00:05:13.009> it<00:05:13.220> gets<00:05:13.280> a<00:05:13.669> little<00:05:13.970> bit<00:05:14.710> on

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
this is where it gets a little bit on

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.950 
this is where it gets a little bit on
the<00:05:16.129> difficult<00:05:16.610> side<00:05:16.849> it's<00:05:17.629> really<00:05:17.840> not

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
the difficult side it's really not

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.290 
the difficult side it's really not
difficult<00:05:18.020> but<00:05:18.729> it's<00:05:19.729> a<00:05:19.849> little<00:05:20.000> tedious

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
difficult but it's a little tedious

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.920 
difficult but it's a little tedious
because<00:05:20.659> you<00:05:21.020> have<00:05:21.229> to<00:05:21.379> continue<00:05:21.919> to<00:05:22.930> start

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
because you have to continue to start

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.059 
because you have to continue to start
and<00:05:24.139> stop<00:05:24.470> and<00:05:25.720> basically<00:05:26.770> just<00:05:27.770> push

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
and stop and basically just push

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.610 
and stop and basically just push
everything<00:05:28.400> down<00:05:28.639> so<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:32.409> blade<00:05:33.409> of<00:05:33.440> the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
everything down so the blade of the

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:44.770 
everything down so the blade of the
blender<00:05:35.259> gets<00:05:36.259> all<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:36.560> ingredients<00:05:43.780> looks

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
blender gets all the ingredients looks

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.200 
blender gets all the ingredients looks
like<00:05:44.960> we're<00:05:45.139> all<00:05:45.199> done<00:05:45.520> can't<00:05:46.520> wait<00:05:46.669> it<00:05:46.909> looked

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
like we're all done can't wait it looked

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.740
