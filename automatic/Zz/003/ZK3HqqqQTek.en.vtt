00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
bad probably and for some reason in the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.700 
bad probably and for some reason in the
sky<00:02:26.340> doesn't<00:02:26.550> look<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:26.970> good<00:02:27.500> at<00:02:28.500> night

extreme is oh very top limit 128 200 is
ISO<00:02:46.340> just<00:02:47.340> checking<00:02:47.730> out<00:02:47.940> what<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.690> looks<00:02:48.960> like

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
ISO just checking out what it looks like

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.430 
ISO just checking out what it looks like
in<00:02:49.890> my<00:02:50.250> room<00:02:50.790> getting<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.750> buffer<00:02:52.140> thing

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
in my room getting the buffer thing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.360 
in my room getting the buffer thing
coming<00:02:52.860> up<00:02:53.930> cuz<00:02:54.930> I've<00:02:55.050> been<00:02:55.170> all<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> so

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
coming up cuz I've been all I so

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.360 
coming up cuz I've been all I so
hopefully<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.760> doesn't<00:02:57.090> stop<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:59.070> card

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
hopefully it doesn't stop the card

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.360 
hopefully it doesn't stop the card
should<00:02:59.610> be<00:02:59.670> fast<00:03:00.030> enough
