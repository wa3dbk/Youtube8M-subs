00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.509
 thanks to the beautiful vending machine a little further east than many is in the building 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.039
 held ajax has settled for the return against demolition of 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.999
 in the capital of slovakia italy 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.470
 the thirty year old 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.810
 Ajax defends a 5 0 lead in 2006 staring at a market share 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 of light shone on the coming game 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.510
 probably anyway 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.930
 the renowned clubs 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 it's not losing 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.930
 it is of course difficult 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.630
 personally I think 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.510
 probably also important for the Netherlands 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.420
 the selection gets acquainted with the atmosphere of the stadium but on Thursday such 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
 fifteen hundred of his own supporters will populate the stands 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.640
 we will be convinced that this will happen in the beginning 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.740
 the same their death 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 the head of knowing 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 Of course they know that we would be making this number two 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.340
 Wesley also been here last year 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.660
 and I have to say 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.740
 the competent authorities 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.790
 the problem lies 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.130
 use the town hall 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.040
 the tax authorities 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040
 the Swedish government is the vote 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.420
 view of the terrain 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.580
 the muldersweg is 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.900
 same margin again on two 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 they underestimate the percentage to 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.250
 give people 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.450
 I think if we continue 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.180
 hours are equal
