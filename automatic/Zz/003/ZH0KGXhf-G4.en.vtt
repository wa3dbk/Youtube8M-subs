00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
safety-checked and we are pointing a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.080 
safety-checked and we are pointing a
weapon<00:01:17.180> downrange<00:01:17.840> when<00:01:17.990> we<00:01:18.080> drive<00:01:18.290> fired<00:01:19.090> so

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
weapon downrange when we drive fired so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.090 
weapon downrange when we drive fired so
double<00:01:20.420> action<00:01:20.780> those<00:01:20.960> two<00:01:21.200> things<00:01:21.470> as<00:01:21.649> I<00:01:21.800> said

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
double action those two things as I said

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.820 
double action those two things as I said
the<00:01:22.460> first<00:01:22.880> action<00:01:23.540> is<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:24.110> cocks<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.800> hammer

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the first action is it cocks the hammer

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.310 
the first action is it cocks the hammer
and<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.880> second<00:01:26.300> actions<00:01:26.660> it<00:01:26.810> drops<00:01:27.170> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
and the second actions it drops the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.600 
and the second actions it drops the
hammer<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:27.800> we're<00:01:27.920> going<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.070> do<00:01:28.190> that<00:01:28.369> again

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
hammer so we're going to do that again

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.249 
hammer so we're going to do that again
just<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:29.060> little<00:01:29.090> bit<00:01:29.390> slower<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.110> could

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
just a little bit slower so you could

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.710 
just a little bit slower so you could
check<00:01:30.470> it<00:01:30.619> out<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.640> first<00:01:31.940> action<00:01:32.540> the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
check it out the first action the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.639 
check it out the first action the
Hammers<00:01:33.440> getting<00:01:33.800> cocked<00:01:34.720> second<00:01:35.720> action<00:01:35.899> it

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
Hammers getting cocked second action it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.250 
Hammers getting cocked second action it
fires<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.869> firearm<00:01:38.869> now<00:01:39.799> double<00:01:40.520> action<00:01:40.970> is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
fires the firearm now double action is

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.930 
fires the firearm now double action is
your<00:01:42.260> trigger<00:01:42.590> pull<00:01:42.890> on<00:01:43.070> this<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:43.490> going<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.820> be

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
your trigger pull on this is going to be

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.390 
your trigger pull on this is going to be
kind<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:44.450> significant<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.530> again<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.010> reason

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
kind of significant and again the reason

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.280 
kind of significant and again the reason
for<00:01:46.580> that<00:01:46.760> is<00:01:47.030> because<00:01:47.210> you're<00:01:47.780> doing<00:01:47.900> two

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
for that is because you're doing two

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.500 
for that is because you're doing two
actions<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.760> what<00:01:49.909> we're<00:01:50.030> going<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.210> do<00:01:50.360> is

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
actions so what we're going to do is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.789 
actions so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:50.600> going<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.750> take<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:50.990> few<00:01:51.260> shots<00:01:51.560> with

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
we're going to take a few shots with

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.330 
we're going to take a few shots with
this<00:01:52.070> firearm<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:52.700> double<00:01:53.000> action<00:01:53.360> only<00:01:54.340> load

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
this firearm and double action only load

worlds<00:02:38.849> so<00:02:38.909> now<00:02:39.090> we're<00:02:39.209> going<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.360> take<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.599> few

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
worlds so now we're going to take a few

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.229 
worlds so now we're going to take a few
shots<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.290> single<00:02:40.620> action<00:02:40.769> only<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:42.120> what

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
shots in single action only so what

single action only means is it only does
one<00:02:45.629> single<00:02:46.049> action

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
one single action

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.259 
one single action
so<00:02:46.950> our<00:02:47.099> firearm<00:02:47.519> has<00:02:47.670> been<00:02:47.879> safety-checked

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
so our firearm has been safety-checked

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.449 
so our firearm has been safety-checked
we're<00:02:49.049> going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.319> single<00:02:49.709> action<00:02:50.069> a<00:02:50.129> single

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
we're going to a single action a single

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.800 
we're going to a single action a single
action<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.910> hammer<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.329> already<00:02:51.599> cocked

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
action as the hammer is already cocked

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.650 
action as the hammer is already cocked
back<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.069> trigger<00:02:53.310> only<00:02:53.700> does<00:02:53.879> one<00:02:54.180> action

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
back so the trigger only does one action

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.170 
back so the trigger only does one action
drops<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.590> hammer<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.069> as<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.640> could<00:02:56.790> see<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
drops to hammer and as you could see the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.940 
drops to hammer and as you could see the
difference<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.810> mean<00:02:58.049> you're<00:02:58.200> barely<00:02:58.709> barely

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
difference I mean you're barely barely

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.339 
difference I mean you're barely barely
even<00:02:59.310> touching<00:02:59.819> this<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:00.690> firearms

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
even touching this and then firearms

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.250 
even touching this and then firearms
dropping<00:03:01.829> so<00:03:02.040> we'll<00:03:02.190> go<00:03:02.340> both<00:03:02.579> double<00:03:04.370> single

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
dropping so we'll go both double single

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.539 
dropping so we'll go both double single
so<00:03:07.260> let's<00:03:07.409> take<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> few<00:03:07.769> shots<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.220> single

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
so let's take a few shots in single

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:44.650 
so let's take a few shots in single
action
