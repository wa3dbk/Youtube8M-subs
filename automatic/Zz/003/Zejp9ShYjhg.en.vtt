00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
again water test had oil used on it

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.440 
again water test had oil used on it
which<00:00:12.360> sure<00:00:12.630> isn't<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.969> good<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.179> stone

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
which sure isn't that good for the stone

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.310 
which sure isn't that good for the stone
and<00:00:15.630> again<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:17.119> nice<00:00:18.119> round<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.140> round

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
and again a nice round and round

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.660 
and again a nice round and round

and after a little while just ticket the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
back now this is how a carpenter's

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.490 
back now this is how a carpenter's
sharpen<00:00:33.600> their<00:00:33.719> tools<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.110> has<00:00:34.230> been<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
sharpen their tools this has been the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.319 
sharpen their tools this has been the
traditional<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> very<00:00:35.850> good<00:00:36.120> way

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
traditional way it is a very good way

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.530 
traditional way it is a very good way
it's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.200> very<00:00:37.380> useful<00:00:37.530> way<00:00:38.149> if<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> are<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it's a very useful way if you are to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.950 
it's a very useful way if you are to
show<00:00:39.719> up<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.960> gouges<00:00:40.350> however<00:00:41.780> you<00:00:42.780> need<00:00:42.899> a

show up and gouges however you need a

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
show up and gouges however you need a
little<00:00:43.200> bit<00:00:43.410> more<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.980> need<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:45.390> where

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
little bit more you need to know where

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.700 
little bit more you need to know where
the<00:00:45.600> angle<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:48.260> sector<00:00:49.260> action<00:00:49.559> it's

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the angle is and this sector action it's

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.090 
the angle is and this sector action it's
just<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:51.260> little<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.350> awkward<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.860> check

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
just a little bit awkward you can check

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
just a little bit awkward you can check
from<00:00:53.640> time<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.940> time<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.510> you're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
from time to time to see what you're

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.200 
from time to time to see what you're
doing<00:00:55.039> but<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.190> easy<00:00:56.579> enough<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> make<00:00:57.059> an

air<00:00:57.360> raid<00:00:57.480> snob<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.109> feel<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.460> quite<00:01:00.059> as

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
air raid snob I feel it's not quite as

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.030 
air raid snob I feel it's not quite as
in<00:01:00.420> control<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.020> would<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:03.860> these<00:01:04.860> are

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
in control as I would like these are

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.160 
in control as I would like these are
water<00:01:05.159> stones<00:01:05.640> now<00:01:06.299> kept<00:01:06.540> permanently<00:01:06.810> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
water stones now kept permanently in

water stones now kept permanently in
water<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> result<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:12.030> ready<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.570> use

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
water and as a result are ready to use

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:23.480 
water and as a result are ready to use
whenever<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.170> need<00:01:13.439> them<00:01:20.330> as<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.570> see

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
whenever I need them as you can see

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.539 
whenever I need them as you can see
everything<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:25.560> nice<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:25.950> visible<00:01:28.549> we'll

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
everything is nice and visible we'll

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.100 
everything is nice and visible we'll
take<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> tool<00:01:30.170> nicely<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.750> then<00:01:33.750> just<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
take the tool nicely and then just to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.560 
take the tool nicely and then just to
finish<00:01:34.140> with<00:01:34.549> just<00:01:35.549> tickly<00:01:35.909> inside<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.390> this

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
finish with just tickly inside like this

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.749 
finish with just tickly inside like this
that's<00:01:37.530> probably<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.130> bad<00:01:38.220> idea<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that's probably not a bad idea to a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.800 
that's probably not a bad idea to a
little<00:01:39.000> bit<00:01:39.149> more<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:41.240> end<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.479> battle

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
little bit more to end up with a battle

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
little bit more to end up with a battle
at<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:42.960> slightly<00:01:43.289> different<00:01:43.560> angle<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:47.250> is

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
at a slightly different angle this is

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.100 
at a slightly different angle this is
the<00:01:47.460> course<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.850> rather<00:01:48.030> now<00:01:48.689> we're<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the course one rather now we're going to

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.010 
the course one rather now we're going to
define<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.929> again<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.780> angle

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
define one and again I can see the angle

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.690 
define one and again I can see the angle
of<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.140> tool<00:01:58.380> quite<00:01:58.649> happily<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.220> again

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
of the tool quite happily and again

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.510 
of the tool quite happily and again
tickly<00:02:00.119> inside<00:02:01.399> if<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.580> needs<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.740> okay<00:02:04.740> now

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
tickly inside if it needs it okay now

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.430 
tickly inside if it needs it okay now
i'm<00:02:05.580> not<00:02:05.729> entirely<00:02:06.090> happy<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:07.020> angle<00:02:07.229> of

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
i'm not entirely happy with the angle of

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.180 
i'm not entirely happy with the angle of
this<00:02:07.590> tool<00:02:08.509> here<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> little<00:02:10.709> bit<00:02:10.830> steep

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
this tool here it's a little bit steep

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.910 
this tool here it's a little bit steep
so<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.060> gotta<00:02:12.239> grind<00:02:12.540> off<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:13.049> little<00:02:13.769> bit

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
so we gotta grind off a little bit

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:27.649 
so we gotta grind off a little bit
across<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.340> back<00:02:14.489> here<00:02:16.280> again

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.710 

it's<00:02:28.659> taking<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.230> flat<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.739> there

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.820 

look<00:02:33.720> down<00:02:33.990> on<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.560> blade<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:34.830> see<00:02:37.850> and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
look down on the blade and see and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.280 
look down on the blade and see and
coming<00:02:40.830> from<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.160> other<00:02:41.190> side<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:42.050> can<00:02:43.050> do<00:02:43.200> it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
coming from the other side I can do it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.850 
coming from the other side I can do it
the<00:02:43.650> same<00:02:43.860> again<00:02:44.390> nothing<00:02:45.390> quite<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:45.740> quite<00:02:46.740> as

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the same again nothing quite as quite as

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.500 
the same again nothing quite as quite as
good<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.040> facility<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.880> see<00:02:48.270> what's

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
good a facility that I can see what's

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.990 
good a facility that I can see what's
going<00:02:48.570> on<00:02:48.900> all<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.830> time<00:02:50.130> unlike<00:02:50.820> with

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
going on all the time unlike with

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.060 
going on all the time unlike with
carpentry<00:02:51.420> tools<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:52.440> don't<00:02:52.740> actually<00:02:52.890> need

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
carpentry tools you don't actually need

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.500 
carpentry tools you don't actually need
to<00:02:53.160> see<00:02:53.430> what's<00:02:53.610> going<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.330> need<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
to see what's going on you just need the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.030 
to see what's going on you just need the
angle<00:02:54.900> right<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:57.450> angle<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:58.140> erm<00:02:58.530> can<00:02:58.950> be

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
angle right the angle is it's erm can be

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.940 
angle right the angle is it's erm can be
critical<00:02:59.340> here<00:02:59.730> too<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.210> i<00:03:00.300> think<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
critical here too and i think that the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.830 
critical here too and i think that the
angle<00:03:02.220> on<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> end<00:03:02.580> here<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.450> little<00:03:03.720> bit

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
angle on the end here is a little bit

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.520 
angle on the end here is a little bit
too<00:03:04.020> steep<00:03:08.540> well<00:03:09.540> let's<00:03:09.690> carefully<00:03:09.930> i<00:03:10.110> can<00:03:10.320> see

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
too steep well let's carefully i can see

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.590 
too steep well let's carefully i can see
the<00:03:10.680> edge<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.070> tool<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:11.790> not<00:03:12.210> actually

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
the edge of the tool here not actually

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.250 
the edge of the tool here not actually
cut<00:03:13.440> from<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.650> right<00:03:13.920> thing<00:03:14.990> what<00:03:15.990> I'm<00:03:16.110> aiming

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
cut from the right thing what I'm aiming

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.090 
cut from the right thing what I'm aiming
for

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.110 

yeah<00:03:20.640> just<00:03:21.180> see<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.540> rough<00:03:21.690> age<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:23.850> should<00:03:24.090> be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
yeah just see the rough age it should be

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.940 
yeah just see the rough age it should be
because<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.900> wood<00:03:25.140> here<00:03:25.380> is<00:03:25.500> crumbling<00:03:25.860> a

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
because this wood here is crumbling a

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.580 
because this wood here is crumbling a
bit<00:03:26.120> rather<00:03:27.120> than<00:03:27.240> slicing<00:03:27.630> neatly<00:03:27.990> so<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.440> put

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
bit rather than slicing neatly so we put

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.860 
bit rather than slicing neatly so we put
an<00:03:28.680> edge<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.760> quite<00:03:30.030> thin<00:03:30.390> quite<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
an edge on that it's quite thin quite a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.220 
an edge on that it's quite thin quite a
delicate<00:03:31.260> edge<00:03:31.410> there<00:03:32.300> again<00:03:33.300> because<00:03:34.080> I'm

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
delicate edge there again because I'm

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.860 
delicate edge there again because I'm
holding<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:35.190> front<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.820> me<00:03:35.910> rather<00:03:36.600> than<00:03:36.720> on

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
holding it in front of me rather than on

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.630 
holding it in front of me rather than on
a<00:03:36.900> bench<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.290> can<00:03:37.440> see<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.710> precise<00:03:38.100> angle<00:03:40.640> they

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
a bench I can see the precise angle they

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.470 
a bench I can see the precise angle they
are<00:03:41.790> now<00:03:42.000> more<00:03:42.240> of<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.510> p4<00:03:43.080> pork<00:03:43.290> there<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:45.210> our

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
are now more of the p4 pork there is our

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.900 
are now more of the p4 pork there is our
gag<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.960> our<00:03:48.260> pairing<00:03:49.260> chisel<00:03:49.670> yeah<00:03:50.670> that's

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
gag is our pairing chisel yeah that's

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.250 
gag is our pairing chisel yeah that's
better<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:53.340> feel<00:03:53.490> though<00:03:53.670> that<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.600> angle

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
better I can feel though that the angle

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.350 
better I can feel though that the angle
which<00:03:55.800> I'm<00:03:56.040> cutting<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.850> now<00:03:57.000> has<00:03:57.150> made<00:03:57.330> a

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
which I'm cutting it now has made a

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.960 
which I'm cutting it now has made a
difference<00:03:58.400> coming<00:03:59.400> from<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.580> other<00:03:59.700> ways

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
difference coming from the other ways

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.760 
difference coming from the other ways
make<00:04:00.300> out<00:04:00.480> where<00:04:00.780> I've<00:04:00.930> chipped<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.440> end<00:04:01.560> of

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
make out where I've chipped the end of

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.110 
make out where I've chipped the end of
the<00:04:01.890> tool<00:04:02.130> here<00:04:03.350> this<00:04:04.350> is<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> rather<00:04:04.710> elderly

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the tool here this is a rather elderly

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.310 
the tool here this is a rather elderly
haning<00:04:07.820> wet<00:04:08.820> grindstone<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.600> should<00:04:10.050> do<00:04:10.200> the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
haning wet grindstone I should do the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.670 
haning wet grindstone I should do the
job<00:04:11.240> we're<00:04:12.240> using<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.600> wet<00:04:12.750> grindstone<00:04:13.350> because

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
job we're using a wet grindstone because

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.810 
job we're using a wet grindstone because
it<00:04:13.770> doesn't<00:04:14.010> take<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.280> temper<00:04:14.580> out<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.760> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
it doesn't take the temper out of the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.080 
it doesn't take the temper out of the
tool<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.240> doesn't<00:04:15.660> eat<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.960> get<00:04:16.290> rich<00:04:17.090> they

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
tool it doesn't eat the a get rich they

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.949 
tool it doesn't eat the a get rich they
show<00:04:18.480> down<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:20.450> don't<00:04:21.450> if<00:04:21.540> you<00:04:21.600> can<00:04:21.780> make

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
show down I don't if you can make

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.660 
show down I don't if you can make
outgoing<00:04:22.170> right<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:22.980> the<00:04:23.070> very<00:04:23.190> edge<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.610> that

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
outgoing right on the very edge of that

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.400 
outgoing right on the very edge of that
tool<00:04:24.140> just<00:04:25.140> here's<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.860> tiniest<00:04:26.550> tiniest<00:04:26.760> dip

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
tool just here's a tiniest tiniest dip

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.930 
tool just here's a tiniest tiniest dip
so<00:04:28.410> it's<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.920> little<00:04:29.160> bit<00:04:29.400> more<00:04:29.550> standing

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
so it's just a little bit more standing

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:39.800 
so it's just a little bit more standing
on<00:04:30.030> edge<00:04:30.180> on<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.480> stove<00:04:32.060> straighten<00:04:33.060> again

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.350 

you<00:04:40.810> can<00:04:41.020> see<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:42.010> very<00:04:42.220> edge<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:43.150> tool

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
you can see the very edge of the tool

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.170 
you can see the very edge of the tool
then<00:04:43.570> it's<00:04:43.720> not<00:04:43.870> sharp<00:04:44.170> enough<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.580> we<00:04:45.910> got<00:04:46.090> to

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
then it's not sharp enough so we got to

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.460 
then it's not sharp enough so we got to
take<00:04:46.440> all<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:47.620> material<00:04:47.860> back<00:04:48.310> here<00:04:48.580> until

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
take all this material back here until

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.230 
take all this material back here until
it's<00:04:50.470> virtually<00:04:51.280> invisible<00:04:51.550> just<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.030> very

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
it's virtually invisible just a very

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.990 
it's virtually invisible just a very
fine<00:04:53.170> line<00:04:53.400> then<00:04:54.400> we<00:04:54.580> use<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.760> hand<00:04:55.030> state<00:04:57.000> it

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
fine line then we use the hand state it

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:11.320 
fine line then we use the hand state it
will<00:04:58.150> take<00:04:58.300> like<00:04:58.510> fun<00:04:58.720> fun

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.629 

first<00:05:12.330> where<00:05:12.750> we<00:05:12.840> need<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.349> start<00:05:13.680> shopping<00:05:14.430> a

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
first where we need to start shopping a

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.029 
first where we need to start shopping a
tool<00:05:14.849> by<00:05:15.030> hand<00:05:15.360> and<00:05:16.259> if<00:05:16.409> you<00:05:16.500> can<00:05:16.680> make<00:05:16.830> out<00:05:17.009> a

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
tool by hand and if you can make out a

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.659 
tool by hand and if you can make out a
very<00:05:17.580> very<00:05:17.909> fine<00:05:18.270> line<00:05:18.629> there<00:05:19.370> now<00:05:20.370> we're

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
very very fine line there now we're

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.610 
very very fine line there now we're
leaving<00:05:20.939> this<00:05:21.360> smart<00:05:21.629> on<00:05:21.870> because<00:05:22.319> we<00:05:22.439> want<00:05:22.590> to

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
leaving this smart on because we want to

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.119 
leaving this smart on because we want to
come<00:05:22.800> from<00:05:22.949> the<00:05:23.099> inside<00:05:23.430> to<00:05:25.069> number<00:05:26.069> of

come from the inside to number of
reasons<00:05:26.280> one<00:05:26.610> of<00:05:26.849> them<00:05:26.969> is<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.539> often<00:05:28.110> there

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
reasons one of them is that often there

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.179 
reasons one of them is that often there
are<00:05:28.319> creations<00:05:28.919> left<00:05:29.460> in<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:30.949> barrel<00:05:31.949> so<00:05:32.129> to

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
are creations left in the barrel so to

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.339 
are creations left in the barrel so to
speak<00:05:32.370> of<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.610> tool<00:05:32.819> and<00:05:33.629> those<00:05:33.990> creations

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
speak of the tool and those creations

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.110 
speak of the tool and those creations
can<00:05:34.680> interfere<00:05:35.039> with<00:05:35.099> the<00:05:35.340> efficiency<00:05:35.939> of<00:05:35.969> the
