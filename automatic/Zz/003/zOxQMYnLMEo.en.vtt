00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.230
 ah 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.330
 great expert to be an artist 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.469
 have you seen today organized a party for 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.960
 my friends the bugs have already come 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.000
 all the caterpillar the dragonfly the mosquito 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.740
 there is a little bit of blood there in the background and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.480
 my friend the bee has also come 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.550
 you want to see how these bugs are made 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.039
 Well, it's very easy to start, you have 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.039
 that catch a balloon inflate the lungs and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.340
 inflate it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.550
 the balloon must be half the size 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.060
 of your head and that will be the body of the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.050
 bug for the eyes crushed balls 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.050
 diary paper 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.329
 and then hit the room part sprint by 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.749
 in front of 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.530
 fix them with zeal and we already have the 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:02.049
 body and eyes of the bug the following 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.899
 is to mix a little bit of art attack 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:08.140
 you know tail and water equal parts and 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.130
 spread it all over the globe and also 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.560
 by the eyes 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.689
 We are going to place strips of kitchen paper 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.689
 or silk around the globe and eyes 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.010
 concentrating on the most 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.250
 complicated and in any gap that 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.250
 beech 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.370
 try to cover the balloon with about four 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.120
 layers of the art attack and the 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.120
 kitchen paper 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.280
 do not let dry all night and you'll have 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 something like this you have seen that it is 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 so rigid and hard now what we have 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.620
 what to do is to exploit the balloon there 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.060
 inside with that then with some 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.130
 sharp object for example this 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.200
 must-see if you take the balloon with 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.420
 a lot of quiet care and a little bit of 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.910
 scared but nothing happens now you have to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.000
 take out the balloon very carefully and on 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.950
 everything close the safety pin today in today 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.870
 Now I have to do the details as 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.970
 for example the legs and with what then with 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.899
 what I have here sounds clear to you that 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.810
 if they are these pages that bend and what 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.810
 like this we are very well hear this 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.209
 are going to be the legs of our bug 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.340
 cut in half the longest piece 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.530
 from one of the straws this will be a leg 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.720
 gives a side of the bug with a lot of zeal 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.390
 so that it is well subject 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.280
 now bend your leg a little out 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.680
 to make a foot does not have to be 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.520
 perfect just puts a little bit of zeal for 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.520
 give it the form 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.270
 and now there is another one here 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.230
 to all the legs that you need from the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.970
 same way and remember uses all the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.530
 jealousy that you want because it has to be 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.530
 well fixed and resistant 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.590
 Well here we have our bug and 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.689
 his legs to see are like 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.829
 blandengues so our endure 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.870
 Nothing what I have to do 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.310
 reinforce them and as with our 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.060
 best heart attack and kitchen paper 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.060
 or toilet paper 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.310
 place a little more concoction in the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.760
 together and on any piece of heat 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.760
 that looks 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.980
 now apply with a brush several layers 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.880
 paper towels or toilet paper 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.580
 on the tail 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.170
 mostly good pile by the sides 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.170
 so that they are well subject 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.590
 It also covers the straws with the best 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.590
 heart attack and kitchen paper 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.950
 well we have already let it dry and you see 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.110
 that the legs of our insect and 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.519
 they are rigid and hard, well, now 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.870
 we have to paint it and for this 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.670
 crafts soaked to use 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.909
 acrylic paints because it's going to be a 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.910
 bee we use the yellow the black and 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:05.160
 the white then nothing we are going to paint it 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.080
 what do you think if we painted it as a 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.620
 bee we will start with a yellow 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.250
 canario de base and we will paint everything - 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.080
 legs and eyes when it has 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.080
 dried we will paint the black stripes 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.040
 you can also paint the eyes in white 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.160
 and with a black marker add a 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.120
 little dot in the center 1 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.120
 and the 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.690
 and we continue and now we have to do the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.850
 wings because it is a bee without wings 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.800
 with much cleaner without chorizo ​​are not 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.410

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.270
 you need is this paper to trace 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.550
 it is not attentive 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.030
 draw the shape of the wings on the paper 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.030
 to trace 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.060
 You can also add some pretty 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:06.060
 to make them look more real and for 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.500
