00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.170
 that for all welcome again this 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:09.280
 a little bit today we are going to prepare 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.290
 the famous and delicious chats for 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.769
 all of you who do not know what this is 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.859
 Well basically it's gelatin and we're going 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.460
 to mix with either tequila or with 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.859
 vodka myself in this case I will use the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.839
 tequila these two acts can make the 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.109
 taste that you like lemon 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:32.769
 watermelon melon strawberry of the flavor that 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.219
 find i used huarmey lynn berry 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.530
 blue line that is being lemon these 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.320
 they are already perfect because you have some 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.019
 meeting a birthday are super 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.629
 simple to do the truth and they are very 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.429
 very rich just that water I know why be 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.469
 a little treacherous as they are very 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.809
 sweet because there you can take several and 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.480
 because out of nowhere you already got a little 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.890
 jugs but they are very very rich and very 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.050
 simple to be 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.570
 or that they're going to need three little things 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.100
 they will need first I gelatin 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.040
 I think the most important thing 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.350
 look for the flavor that you want in 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.869
 the supermarket I chose these three 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.330
 flavors are going to need either 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.000
 of tequila or vodka my personally 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.930
 they like more with tequila and will need 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.650
 of glasses or and covers the covers 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.110
 are optional, I did not choose to buy 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.600
 cover them but they do not need 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.430
 ok the first thing they're going to do is they're going 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.340
 to boil a cup of water 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.440
 we put it basically is the same as 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.060
 making jelly is too easy if 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.430
 you have already made gelatin 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.950
 then they are eaten for you 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.920
 It will work out very well for the measures 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.229
 must check the box what 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.800
 comes back are these boxes that I 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.420
 I bought are 85 grams 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.060
 then back comes that I owe them 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.770
 take a cup of hot water and 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.570
 a cup of cold water then what I 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.360
 I'm going to do is throw a cup of water 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.020
 hot and the other cup I'm going to divide 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.600
 in two of water time and tequila 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.310
 So if you buy a box 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.320
 bigger obviously I think they're going to 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.930
 have to throw like two cups then 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.500
 there then throw the two cups of water 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.250
 hot and a cup of water at the time and 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.380
 a cup of tequila or vodka 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.800
 then depending on the size of the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.540
 box and the measures that come back 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.270
 I do not show is to rely on the boxes 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.730
 that I bought and by box they should leave 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.410
 like 25 cups obviously if you bought 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.620
 a bigger box because they have you 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.890
 like 50 and as a last we are going to empty the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.210
 liquid or the mixture in the cups and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.690
 let's leave for 4 hours in the in the 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.980
 refrigerator and after 4 hours your 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.140
 dialysis shots 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.910
 are completely ready if you 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.320
 they want to do a day before or be 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.130
 two days before 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.400
 Of course you can but at least four 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.620
 hours in the refrigerator and that's how 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.780
