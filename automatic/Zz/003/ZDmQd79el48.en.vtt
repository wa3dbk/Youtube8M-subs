 the newspaper and the color of knowledge 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.270
 knowledge guy that's exactly what you want to get with the

 mercedes sls bmw 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.840
 all the famous brands are present 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.490
 it's an event as fast as we invented while usually 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.650
 we focus on driving dynamics and it's going on about 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.140
 other circuits like arnaud for example these are data to the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.450
 speed then we thought about what he would say with the cars of 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.860
 sport 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.940
 and we thought it was definitely not just the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.710
 speed however we had a discipline in the program dropped to 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.560
 during which we were accelerating rai waves to 230 and we have 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.840
 now we are changing a little bit this discipline he has a good transfer is 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.540
 appeared a new process let's measure a sprint of art and a330 and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 back to zero 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 the 0 to 300 me of 17 seconds 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 the dream of all cars 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.300
 m with up to 250 km on major overhang 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.030
 as for the day during the acceleration it is necessary that the co-pilot can not 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.070
 touched the dashboard and when decelerating I need to approach from 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.310
 dorval and in the middle after three tries 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.890
 if we do not remember its purpose the base is really a success 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.310
 complete 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.290
 the numbers are only provided by a gps measuring device that transmits 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.290
 the tours of the circuit 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.820
 now the tuner of life of each level we can only look at the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.130
 test pilot then turns on 60 pts in aveyron 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.920
 more importantly access to genÃ¨ve deceleration in clear 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.429
 brutal braking 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.429

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.909
 with its beaches its successes impresses most people most of them 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.919
 never do it and that's why we always say how much it is 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:23.209
 important to conduct driving courses to brake thoroughly with the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.609
 jubilation and for me especially with 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.289
 these superb sports cars what a French rummy who knows how to do it is 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:33.019
 absolutely fascinating how important it is that a small land of sport 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.019
 automobile i'm talking 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419
 it's the solicitation of a sign for the northern engine 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:43.579
 it's the tire and the right pressure 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.789
 as for each team 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 French cements the title on the circuit 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.409
 the nose of their own logo for the water pressure can adjust the 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:56.709
 ground surface that is to say leave the process and the power of the vehicle 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.029
 electric on the road a larger floor area gives us more 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:02.829
 opportunities to do this 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.159
 maybe he would afford the pressure of m yet according to the 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.539
 professor 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:14.289
 from their production a single run the fastest 24 seconds know if the 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.139
 growth has returned to 0 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.389
 the result was obtained in this series of tests organized by 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.389
 auto sport 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.150
 the resort that is interesting it's not the great feeling of riding at 300 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.939
 thousand dinars next come his future santander is so slow we are 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.540
 pleased with his Sunday on Highway 250 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.610
 but what is it that we get used very quickly to the speed that 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.169
 spain spain 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.729
 the yellow the color of knowledge also during this event 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.669
 membership 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.239
 300 possible speed that's not all that makes driving a 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:52.730
 pleasure
