easy to look at I've also opened a new
deck<00:00:31.679> file<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.369> made<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> grid<00:00:33.630> has<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
deck file and made it so the grid has a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
deck file and made it so the grid has a
three<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.950> second<00:00:35.370> I'll<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> that

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
for blockers blockers are monsters and

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
for blockers blockers are monsters and
terrain<00:01:04.710> basically<00:01:05.670> those<00:01:05.850> are<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> two

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
terrain basically those are the two

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.320 
terrain basically those are the two
things<00:01:06.570> terrain<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.229> mountains<00:01:07.710> water<00:01:08.330> voids

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
things terrain is mountains water voids

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330 
things terrain is mountains water voids
changing<00:01:10.200> lands<00:01:10.590> things<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
changing lands things like that and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.539 
changing lands things like that and
monsters<00:01:11.820> are<00:01:11.970> pretty<00:01:12.180> obvious<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> I'm

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
monsters are pretty obvious so I'm

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.310 
monsters are pretty obvious so I'm
actually<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> drag<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> drop<00:01:15.750> mall<00:01:16.140> in

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
actually going to drag and drop mall in

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.109 
actually going to drag and drop mall in
here<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.490> take<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> look<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.030> see

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
through them all let's just go through

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.670 
through them all let's just go through
obvious<00:01:20.970> monsters<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:24.049> I'm<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.350> put

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
obvious monsters and I'm going to put

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
four of all these because the goal of

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.539 
four of all these because the goal of
every<00:01:28.080> deck<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> most<00:01:29.159> amount<00:01:29.430> of

you have half your darkest blockers then
you'll<00:02:19.150> understand<00:02:19.660> why<00:02:19.930> unmaking<00:02:20.560> has<00:02:20.830> been

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
you'll understand why unmaking has been

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.360 
you'll understand why unmaking has been
always<00:02:21.550> been<00:02:22.210> so<00:02:22.420> powerful<00:02:22.710> because<00:02:23.710> if<00:02:24.160> half

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370
