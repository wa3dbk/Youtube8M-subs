is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.620> really<00:00:26.190> wonderful<00:00:26.340> camera<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.120> one

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
is a really wonderful camera but one

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.660 
is a really wonderful camera but one
problem<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.110> has<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.290> that<00:00:28.860> if<00:00:29.370> you<00:00:29.490> walk

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
problem it has is that if you walk

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.750 
problem it has is that if you walk
around<00:00:29.850> with<00:00:30.120> it<00:00:30.240> while<00:00:30.510> you're<00:00:30.630> videotaping

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
around with it while you're videotaping

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.210 
around with it while you're videotaping
recording<00:00:32.780> it<00:00:33.780> doesn't<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> very<00:00:35.040> good

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
recording it doesn't have a very good

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.140 
recording it doesn't have a very good
stabilization<00:00:36.770> mechanism<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.670> makes<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> very

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
stabilization mechanism it makes it very

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.540 
stabilization mechanism it makes it very
jittery<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.840> video<00:00:40.830> so<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> wanted<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.400> get

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
jittery a video so I wanted to get

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.729 
jittery a video so I wanted to get
something<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> camera<00:00:42.960> stabilizer<00:00:43.410> there

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
something like a camera stabilizer there

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.979 
something like a camera stabilizer there
rather<00:00:43.980> expensive<00:00:44.309> not<00:00:44.730> too<00:00:44.940> easy<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.300> make<00:00:45.330> so

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
rather expensive not too easy to make so

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.390 
rather expensive not too easy to make so
I<00:00:46.020> thought<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.470> maybe<00:00:46.830> I<00:00:46.920> should<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.280> look

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
I thought first maybe I should just look

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.340 
I thought first maybe I should just look
at<00:00:47.580> a<00:00:47.610> camera<00:00:47.879> cradle<00:00:48.330> some<00:00:48.870> people<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.260> had

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
said they had very good success making

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.689 
said they had very good success making
camera<00:00:51.660> crate<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:51.989> camera<00:00:52.379> caddy<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.550> buy

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and online and I thought maybe I should

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.380 
and online and I thought maybe I should
try<00:00:59.730> making<00:00:59.909> one<00:01:00.120> first<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.409> made<00:01:01.769> one

try making one first and I made one

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.880 
try making one first and I made one

15 or 20 minutes it's it's rather crude
I'm<00:01:09.659> almost<00:01:09.900> embarrassed<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.650> took<00:01:10.800> me<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> long

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
is so quick and dirty I was kind of

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.749 
is so quick and dirty I was kind of
embarrassed<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.800> better<00:01:20.100> work<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.549> but

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
embarrassed I do better work in this but

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.219 
embarrassed I do better work in this but
this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.299> something<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.659> put<00:01:21.810> together<00:01:21.990> in

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
this is just something I put together in

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
this is just something I put together in
a<00:01:22.439> few<00:01:22.619> minutes<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:22.950> home<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.329> able<00:01:24.479> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
a few minutes at home and I was able to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.230 
a few minutes at home and I was able to
determine<00:01:25.140> pretty<00:01:26.070> quickly<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.939> camera

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
determine pretty quickly that the camera

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.190 
determine pretty quickly that the camera
cradle<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.780> does<00:01:28.469> help<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> stabilize<00:01:29.670> your

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
cradle it does help to stabilize your

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.719 
cradle it does help to stabilize your
picture<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.799> doesn't<00:01:32.280> really<00:01:32.369> work<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
picture but it doesn't really work that

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.499 
picture but it doesn't really work that
good<00:01:32.789> it's<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.110> put<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.320> spoonful<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
good it's like if you put a spoonful of

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.969 
good it's like if you put a spoonful of
sand<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.659> soup<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.740> something

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
sand in your soup and you have something

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
sand in your soup and you have something
that<00:01:38.130> only<00:01:38.939> puts<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.180> quarter<00:01:39.539> of<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> spoon<00:01:39.899> of

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that only puts a quarter of a spoon of

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.990 
that only puts a quarter of a spoon of
sand<00:01:40.289> under<00:01:40.350> soup<00:01:40.619> used<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.340> last<00:01:41.579> hand<00:01:41.880> in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
sand under soup used to last hand in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
sand under soup used to last hand in
your<00:01:42.119> soup<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.259> doesn't<00:01:43.500> really

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
your soup this this doesn't really

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.789 
your soup this this doesn't really
become<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.820> camera<00:01:45.359> stabilizer<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.590> does

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
become a camera stabilizer but it does

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.289 
become a camera stabilizer but it does
help<00:01:47.810> control<00:01:48.810> your<00:01:48.840> camera<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> very

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
help control your camera and it's a very

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.630 
help control your camera and it's a very
comfortable<00:01:51.829> device<00:01:52.829> especially<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
comfortable device especially with the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.130 
comfortable device especially with the
smaller<00:01:53.729> cameras<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.659> something<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
smaller cameras to have something to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.289 
smaller cameras to have something to
hold<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.859> what<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.820> did<00:01:57.060> notice

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
hold on to it so what I did notice

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.830 
hold on to it so what I did notice
though<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.710> after<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.250> made<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.390> was

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
though is that after I made it it was

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.749 
though is that after I made it it was
such<00:02:01.140> an<00:02:01.380> interesting<00:02:01.740> platform<00:02:02.429> to<00:02:02.579> start

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
such an interesting platform to start

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.539 
such an interesting platform to start
adding<00:02:03.119> things<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:04.079> try<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:05.399> do

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
adding things to to try to to do

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.999

the world to to mess around with and
like<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> said<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.350> does<00:02:19.950> take<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.580> kodak<00:02:21.540> zi8

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
like I said it does take the kodak zi8

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.309 
like I said it does take the kodak zi8
let's<00:02:22.590> put<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> codec<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:24.019> maybe<00:02:25.019> first

let's put the codec on here maybe first
we<00:02:25.530> should<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.860> over<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.129> parts<00:02:26.370> real<00:02:26.519> quick

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
we should go over the parts real quick

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.570 
we should go over the parts real quick
it's<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:28.230> by<00:02:28.409> twos

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
it's just one by twos

you<00:02:38.610> start<00:02:39.390> doing<00:02:39.780> different<00:02:40.170> things<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.410> can

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
you start doing different things you can

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.930 
you start doing different things you can
make<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.710> track<00:02:41.010> here<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.700> put<00:02:41.820> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
make a track here so you can put the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.760 
make a track here so you can put the
bolt<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.210> different<00:02:42.450> places<00:02:42.630> or<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.620> can

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
bolt in different places or you can

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.050 
bolt in different places or you can
drill<00:02:43.980> holes<00:02:44.250> through<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.610> pipe<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:44.940> it's

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
drill holes through the pipe but it's

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.100 
drill holes through the pipe but it's
probably<00:02:45.330> better<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.540> make<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> little<00:02:45.960> track

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
probably better to make a little track

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.270 
probably better to make a little track
this<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.500> very<00:02:46.710> first<00:02:46.860> one<00:02:47.010> that's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
this is the very first one that's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.130 
this is the very first one that's
prototype<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.520> a<00:02:50.990> quarter<00:02:51.990> inch

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140

with<00:02:54.870> some<00:02:55.020> fittings<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:57.420> comes<00:02:57.960> apart

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
with some fittings and it comes apart

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.680 
with some fittings and it comes apart
easily<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:58.830> put<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> screw<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.430> here<00:02:59.460> so<00:03:00.240> it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
easily you can put a screw in here so it

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.120 
easily you can put a screw in here so it
doesn't<00:03:01.080> come<00:03:01.230> out<00:03:01.380> while<00:03:01.950> you're

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
doesn't come out while you're

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
little bolt here we're gonna use to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.740 
little bolt here we're gonna use to
mount<00:03:14.900> okay<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:15.960> have<00:03:16.200> your<00:03:16.410> Kodak<00:03:17.100> mounted

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
and like I said once I started using

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.270 
and like I said once I started using
this<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:21.510> it's<00:03:21.750> very<00:03:21.990> handy<00:03:22.380> for<00:03:23.010> for

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
this it's it's very handy for for

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.520 
this it's it's very handy for for
controlling<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.850> camera<00:03:24.230> I'm<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> pretty

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
controlling the camera I'm a pretty

cradle or having a cradle it was it was

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.080 
cradle or having a cradle it was it was
a<00:03:33.720> lot<00:03:34.020> easier<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:35.190> maneuver<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.910> to

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
a lot easier to to maneuver it and to

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.330 
a lot easier to to maneuver it and to
hold<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.560> thing<00:03:37.770> that<00:03:37.800> impressed<00:03:38.250> me

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
hold it but the thing that impressed me

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.220 
hold it but the thing that impressed me
once<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.240> started<00:03:39.660> playing<00:03:39.810> around<00:03:39.960> with<00:03:40.170> what

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
once I started playing around with what

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.080 
once I started playing around with what
was<00:03:40.950> all<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> things<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.820> could<00:03:41.940> do

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
was all the things that you could do

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.610 
was all the things that you could do
with<00:03:42.240> this<00:03:42.440> for<00:03:43.440> instance<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:45.600> was<00:03:46.230> thinking

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
with this for instance I was thinking

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.470 
with this for instance I was thinking
what<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.430> you're<00:03:47.580> out<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.240> woods

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
what if you're out in the woods

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.810 
what if you're out in the woods
someplace<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.290> don't<00:03:49.440> have<00:03:49.500> your<00:03:49.820> tripod

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
someplace and you don't have your tripod

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.200 
someplace and you don't have your tripod
with<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.270> if<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.140> put<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.560> u-bolt<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.700> here<00:03:54.090> and

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
with you if you put a u-bolt on here and

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.400 
with you if you put a u-bolt on here and
put<00:03:54.270> a<00:03:54.960> clamp

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
put a clamp

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.240 
put a clamp
you<00:03:56.130> can<00:03:56.310> then<00:03:56.430> clamp<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.390> branch

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
you can then clamp this to a branch

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.220 
you can then clamp this to a branch
piece<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.430> wood<00:03:59.580> or<00:03:59.610> of<00:04:00.180> your<00:04:00.510> living

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
piece of wood or of your living

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.270 
piece of wood or of your living
apartment<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.740> can<00:04:01.890> put<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.130> on<00:04:02.190> the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
apartment you can put it on the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.880 
apartment you can put it on the
stairwell<00:04:02.730> on<00:04:02.880> some<00:04:03.420> stairs<00:04:03.690> on<00:04:03.930> railings<00:04:04.320> so

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
stairwell on some stairs on railings so

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.740 
stairwell on some stairs on railings so
you<00:04:04.950> could<00:04:05.310> use<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.880> attach<00:04:06.270> different

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you could use this to attach different

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.430 
you could use this to attach different
things<00:04:06.960> it<00:04:07.320> would<00:04:07.470> be<00:04:07.560> very<00:04:07.740> easy<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.190> add<00:04:09.440> also

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
things it would be very easy to add also

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.980 
things it would be very easy to add also
these<00:04:10.830> are<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.160> vices<00:04:11.430> on<00:04:11.550> top<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:12.270> can<00:04:12.480> put

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
these are the vices on top you can put

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.410 
these are the vices on top you can put
holes<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.440> them<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.740> in<00:04:14.040> add<00:04:14.250> attachments<00:04:15.210> too

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
holes in them and in add attachments too

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.360 
holes in them and in add attachments too
so<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.750> can<00:04:16.020> take<00:04:16.470> things<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.950> put<00:04:17.130> them<00:04:17.280> on

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so you can take things and put them on

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.830 
so you can take things and put them on
and<00:04:17.489> off<00:04:17.580> like<00:04:18.180> for<00:04:18.330> instance<00:04:18.420> you<00:04:18.600> can<00:04:18.750> make

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
and off like for instance you can make

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.210 
and off like for instance you can make
this<00:04:18.960> a<00:04:19.020> cold<00:04:19.850> shoe<00:04:20.850> or<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.650> device<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.830> put<00:04:23.010> on

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
this a cold shoe or a device to put on

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.860 
this a cold shoe or a device to put on
your<00:04:23.840> your<00:04:24.840> microphone<00:04:26.480> also<00:04:27.480> I<00:04:27.690> was<00:04:27.780> thinking

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
your your microphone also I was thinking

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.860 
your your microphone also I was thinking
for<00:04:28.740> mounting<00:04:29.580> on<00:04:29.670> a<00:04:29.700> car<00:04:29.970> they<00:04:30.480> have<00:04:30.690> these

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
for mounting on a car they have these

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.260 
for mounting on a car they have these
magnets<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.680> can<00:04:31.770> get<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:31.980> eBay<00:04:32.250> they're<00:04:33.150> out

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
magnets you can get on eBay they're out

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.850 
magnets you can get on eBay they're out
of<00:04:33.420> computer<00:04:33.810> hard<00:04:33.990> drives<00:04:34.200> they're

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
of computer hard drives they're

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.500 
of computer hard drives they're
extraordinarily<00:04:35.550> strong<00:04:35.970> they'll<00:04:36.210> actually

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
extraordinarily strong they'll actually

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.180 
extraordinarily strong they'll actually
pinch<00:04:37.020> your<00:04:37.140> fingers<00:04:37.200> you<00:04:37.890> have<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.070> be

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
pinch your fingers you have to be

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.560 
pinch your fingers you have to be
careful<00:04:38.580> there<00:04:38.729> fill<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.030> holes<00:04:39.240> already

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
careful there fill the holes already

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.500 
careful there fill the holes already
drilled<00:04:39.750> so<00:04:40.440> you<00:04:40.500> can<00:04:40.740> attach

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
drilled so you can attach

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.900 
drilled so you can attach
to<00:04:41.630> anything<00:04:42.010> once<00:04:43.010> you<00:04:43.100> did<00:04:43.340> that<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.760> could

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
to anything once you did that you could

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.190 
to anything once you did that you could
make<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:44.210> into<00:04:44.420> something<00:04:44.690> you<00:04:44.870> could<00:04:44.990> mount

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
make this into something you could mount

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.160 
make this into something you could mount
on<00:04:45.380> your<00:04:45.410> car<00:04:45.770> while<00:04:46.070> you<00:04:46.370> were<00:04:46.580> driving<00:04:47.170> this

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
on your car while you were driving this

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.540 
on your car while you were driving this
is<00:04:48.380> something<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.800> saw<00:04:48.980> in<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.190> hardware<00:04:49.490> store

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
is something I saw in the hardware store

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.290 
is something I saw in the hardware store
it<00:04:50.390> makes<00:04:51.140> a<00:04:51.520> if<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:52.760> don't<00:04:52.880> want<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.150> put

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
it makes a if you don't want to put

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.520 
it makes a if you don't want to put
these<00:04:53.420> T's<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:53.870> there<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.230> just<00:04:54.320> had<00:04:54.500> a

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
these T's on there you just had a

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.010 
these T's on there you just had a
straight<00:04:55.100> piece<00:04:55.310> of<00:04:55.340> pipe<00:04:55.670> you<00:04:55.940> can<00:04:56.600> use<00:04:56.900> this

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
straight piece of pipe you can use this

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.470 
straight piece of pipe you can use this
it<00:04:57.200> has<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.440> flat<00:04:57.830> mount<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.060> can<00:04:59.330> put<00:04:59.450> a

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
it has a flat mount so you can put a

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.640 
it has a flat mount so you can put a
hole<00:04:59.690> in<00:04:59.720> there<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.140> you<00:05:00.200> can<00:05:00.320> add<00:05:00.470> different

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
hole in there and you can add different

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.670 
hole in there and you can add different
attachments<00:05:01.550> also<00:05:02.240> I<00:05:02.510> was<00:05:02.630> thinking<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.260> this

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
attachments also I was thinking and this

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.370 
attachments also I was thinking and this
was<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.950> something<00:05:04.400> I'm<00:05:04.550> going<00:05:04.640> to<00:05:04.700> do<00:05:04.850> I<00:05:04.880> think

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
was a something I'm going to do I think

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.180 
was a something I'm going to do I think
what<00:05:06.380> if<00:05:06.530> you<00:05:06.680> were<00:05:06.800> out<00:05:06.890> in<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:07.040> woods

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
what if you were out in the woods

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.190 
what if you were out in the woods
someplace<00:05:07.880> and<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.300> wanted<00:05:08.690> a<00:05:08.750> straight<00:05:08.990> shot

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
someplace and you wanted a straight shot

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
someplace and you wanted a straight shot
and<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.410> didn't<00:05:09.590> want<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.830> make<00:05:09.920> a<00:05:09.950> dolly

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
and you didn't want to make a dolly

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.100 
and you didn't want to make a dolly
because<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:10.610> would<00:05:10.700> take<00:05:10.820> all<00:05:11.000> day<00:05:11.150> long<00:05:11.360> well

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
because it would take all day long well

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.260 
because it would take all day long well
if<00:05:12.440> you<00:05:12.590> could<00:05:12.740> string<00:05:12.950> up<00:05:13.100> some<00:05:13.250> wire<00:05:13.460> and

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
if you could string up some wire and

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:21.630 
if you could string up some wire and
make<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.140> tight<00:05:15.320> with<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:17.140> a<00:05:19.090> clamp<00:05:20.090> here<00:05:20.300> with<00:05:21.020> a

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
make it tight with a a clamp here with a

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.110 
make it tight with a a clamp here with a
turnbuckle

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
turnbuckle

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.050 
turnbuckle
once<00:05:23.870> you<00:05:23.990> got<00:05:24.080> your<00:05:24.260> wire<00:05:24.440> tight<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.910> could

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
once you got your wire tight you could

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.110 
once you got your wire tight you could
put<00:05:26.210> your<00:05:26.360> wire<00:05:26.540> on<00:05:27.530> these<00:05:28.070> pulleys<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.880> mount

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
put your wire on these pulleys and mount

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.940 
put your wire on these pulleys and mount
your<00:05:29.210> pulley<00:05:29.510> to<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.870> top<00:05:30.050> of<00:05:30.320> your<00:05:30.350> your

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
your pulley to the top of your your

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.980 
your pulley to the top of your your
camera<00:05:31.370> cradle<00:05:31.850> and<00:05:32.000> then<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.690> could<00:05:32.840> have

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
camera cradle and then you could have

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.390 
camera cradle and then you could have
another<00:05:33.260> line<00:05:33.530> attached<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:34.040> your<00:05:34.100> camera

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
another line attached to your camera

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.710 
another line attached to your camera
cradle<00:05:34.700> and<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.150> you<00:05:35.240> could<00:05:35.360> pull<00:05:35.540> it<00:05:35.630> along

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
cradle and so you could pull it along

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.920 
cradle and so you could pull it along
your<00:05:36.020> line<00:05:36.200> and<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.800> would<00:05:36.920> make<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.130> dolly<00:05:37.930> very

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
your line and it would make a dolly very

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.740 
your line and it would make a dolly very
quickly<00:05:39.230> and<00:05:39.590> efficiently<00:05:40.030> in<00:05:41.030> any<00:05:41.450> rough

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
quickly and efficiently in any rough

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.240 
quickly and efficiently in any rough
terrain<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.320> it's<00:05:42.620> something<00:05:42.890> I<00:05:42.950> think<00:05:42.980> I'm

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
terrain and it's something I think I'm

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.770 
terrain and it's something I think I'm
going<00:05:43.580> to<00:05:43.640> experiment<00:05:44.180> with<00:05:45.580> also<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:47.360> was

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
going to experiment with also I was

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.860 
going to experiment with also I was
thinking<00:05:49.030> what<00:05:50.030> if<00:05:50.180> you<00:05:50.390> were<00:05:50.540> wanting<00:05:50.840> to

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
thinking what if you were wanting to

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.750 
thinking what if you were wanting to
take<00:05:51.020> a<00:05:51.050> low<00:05:51.260> dolly<00:05:51.530> shot<00:05:51.860> something<00:05:52.490> you

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
take a low dolly shot something you

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.390 
take a low dolly shot something you
could<00:05:52.910> add<00:05:53.090> wheels<00:05:53.360> or<00:05:53.750> if<00:05:54.500> you're<00:05:54.650> out<00:05:54.800> in<00:05:55.010> the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
could add wheels or if you're out in the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.950 
could add wheels or if you're out in the
pool<00:05:55.580> someplace<00:05:56.060> you<00:05:56.240> want<00:05:56.390> to<00:05:56.480> take<00:05:56.630> a<00:05:56.660> shot

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
pool someplace you want to take a shot

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.140 
pool someplace you want to take a shot
or<00:05:57.860> someone<00:05:58.220> swimming<00:05:58.610> you<00:05:58.700> could<00:05:58.850> put<00:05:59.000> this

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
or someone swimming you could put this

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.190 
or someone swimming you could put this
on<00:05:59.330> piece<00:05:59.600> of<00:05:59.720> styrofoam<00:05:59.900> and<00:06:00.470> pull<00:06:01.010> it<00:06:01.100> along

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
on piece of styrofoam and pull it along

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.000 
on piece of styrofoam and pull it along
also<00:06:03.200> you<00:06:03.440> could<00:06:03.650> put<00:06:03.710> a<00:06:05.350> magnifying<00:06:06.350> glass<00:06:06.560> in

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
also you could put a magnifying glass in

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.860 
also you could put a magnifying glass in
front<00:06:07.070> of<00:06:07.430> your<00:06:07.550> camera<00:06:07.700> this<00:06:08.270> has<00:06:08.450> a<00:06:08.480> macro

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
front of your camera this has a macro

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.720 
front of your camera this has a macro
lens<00:06:09.050> but<00:06:09.320> with<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.620> magnifying<00:06:09.950> glass<00:06:10.160> you

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
lens but with the magnifying glass you

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.100 
lens but with the magnifying glass you
could<00:06:10.910> adjust<00:06:11.000> it<00:06:11.330> if<00:06:11.660> you<00:06:11.840> had<00:06:11.960> a<00:06:11.990> little

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
could adjust it if you had a little

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.930 
could adjust it if you had a little
track<00:06:12.350> here<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:13.130> could<00:06:13.310> move<00:06:13.460> the<00:06:13.640> camera

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
track here you could move the camera

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.160 
track here you could move the camera
back<00:06:13.970> and<00:06:14.270> forth<00:06:14.450> till<00:06:14.600> you<00:06:14.660> got<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.960> right

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
back and forth till you got the right

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.320 
back and forth till you got the right
focal<00:06:15.890> plane<00:06:16.070> and<00:06:16.310> then<00:06:16.940> with<00:06:17.120> your

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
focal plane and then with your

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.330 
focal plane and then with your
magnifying<00:06:17.600> glass<00:06:18.140> you<00:06:18.380> could<00:06:18.530> get<00:06:18.680> extremely

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
magnifying glass you could get extremely

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.810 
magnifying glass you could get extremely
interesting<00:06:20.500> close-ups<00:06:21.500> with<00:06:21.800> that<00:06:21.980> so<00:06:22.550> like

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
interesting close-ups with that so like

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.250 
interesting close-ups with that so like
there<00:06:23.060> are<00:06:23.240> so<00:06:23.360> many<00:06:23.510> different<00:06:23.930> things<00:06:24.050> that

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
there are so many different things that

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.140 
there are so many different things that
I<00:06:24.440> could<00:06:24.560> you<00:06:24.860> can<00:06:25.190> do<00:06:25.310> with<00:06:25.520> this<00:06:25.670> once<00:06:26.000> you

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
I could you can do with this once you

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.960 
I could you can do with this once you
make<00:06:26.330> a<00:06:26.360> little<00:06:27.110> cradle<00:06:27.500> that<00:06:28.310> you<00:06:28.700> couldn't

some sort of animation there are so many
different<00:06:58.070> things<00:06:58.160> like<00:06:58.370> I'm<00:06:58.640> going<00:06:58.790> to<00:06:58.820> do<00:06:58.940> a

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
different things like I'm going to do a

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.370 
different things like I'm going to do a
few<00:06:59.150> of<00:06:59.270> these<00:06:59.390> probably<00:07:00.050> the<00:07:00.140> one<00:07:00.230> with<00:07:00.320> the

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
few of these probably the one with the

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.530 
few of these probably the one with the
magnifying<00:07:00.650> glass<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.250> with<00:07:01.550> the<00:07:01.730> little

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540 
magnifying glass and with the little

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.100 
magnifying glass and with the little
like<00:07:02.750> monorail<00:07:03.440> dolly<00:07:04.360> also<00:07:05.360> I<00:07:05.570> was<00:07:05.840> even

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
like monorail dolly also I was even

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.840 
like monorail dolly also I was even
thinking<00:07:06.380> of<00:07:06.500> you<00:07:07.340> could<00:07:07.520> hook<00:07:08.120> up<00:07:08.270> your<00:07:08.510> small

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850 
thinking of you could hook up your small

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.370 
thinking of you could hook up your small
binoculars<00:07:10.850> in<00:07:11.030> front<00:07:11.630> of<00:07:11.780> your<00:07:11.900> camera<00:07:12.260> lens

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
binoculars in front of your camera lens

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.420 
binoculars in front of your camera lens
and<00:07:13.030> and<00:07:14.030> try<00:07:14.360> different<00:07:14.420> zoom<00:07:15.380> shots<00:07:15.680> that

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
and and try different zoom shots that

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.100 
and and try different zoom shots that
way<00:07:16.610> likes<00:07:16.820> it<00:07:16.940> this<00:07:17.360> looks<00:07:17.630> like<00:07:17.720> a<00:07:17.780> really

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
way likes it this looks like a really

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.840 
way likes it this looks like a really
fun<00:07:18.260> platform<00:07:18.920> for<00:07:19.280> making<00:07:19.610> a<00:07:19.670> lot<00:07:19.820> of

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
fun platform for making a lot of

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.400 
fun platform for making a lot of
different<00:07:20.270> gadgets<00:07:20.390> to<00:07:20.870> mess<00:07:21.110> around<00:07:21.260> with

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410 
different gadgets to mess around with

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.650 
different gadgets to mess around with
with<00:07:21.680> hardly<00:07:22.010> no<00:07:22.160> money<00:07:22.340> at<00:07:22.430> all<00:07:22.490> and<00:07:22.670> it's

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660 
with hardly no money at all and it's

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.720 
with hardly no money at all and it's
something<00:07:23.990> anybody<00:07:24.200> can<00:07:24.500> do<00:07:24.650> and<00:07:25.130> it<00:07:25.460> comes

in your camera bag and it doesn't take
up<00:07:32.750> hardly<00:07:32.930> any<00:07:33.080> space<00:07:33.200> so<00:07:34.070> I'll<00:07:34.580> be<00:07:34.760> making

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 
up hardly any space so I'll be making

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.300 
up hardly any space so I'll be making
except<00:07:35.990> the<00:07:36.080> one<00:07:36.200> with<00:07:36.380> the<00:07:36.560> microphone<00:07:36.860> with
