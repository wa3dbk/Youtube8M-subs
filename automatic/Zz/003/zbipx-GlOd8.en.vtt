00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
be right here it's because it's very

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
be right here it's because it's very
crucial<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> paint<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.260> paint

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
crucial so what is the paint the paint

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.520 
crucial so what is the paint the paint
is<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.550> area<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.510> field<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
is the area of the field that the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.680 
is the area of the field that the
defense<00:00:35.010> needs<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.820> stay<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.690> protect

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
defense needs to stay in and protect

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.850 
defense needs to stay in and protect
whenever<00:00:39.690> they're<00:00:39.930> not<00:00:40.140> playing<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.649> ball

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
carrier it's Bible to stay in the paint

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
carrier it's Bible to stay in the paint
when<00:00:43.440> you're<00:00:43.649> off<00:00:43.950> ball<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:46.489> we<00:00:47.489> don't

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
when you're off ball because we don't

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.360 
when you're off ball because we don't
want<00:00:48.180> anyone<00:00:48.539> coming<00:00:48.870> inside<00:00:49.379> easily<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
want anyone coming inside easily and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.100

being able to get a quick pass in a shot

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.100 
being able to get a quick pass in a shot
so<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.530> protect<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> paint<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.550> help<00:00:54.110> we

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so if we protect the paint we help we

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.439 
so if we protect the paint we help we
help<00:00:55.289> shut<00:00:55.620> down<00:00:55.800> those<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.430> time<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:57.210> one

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
help shut down those one time those one

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.639 
help shut down those one time those one
timers<00:00:58.100> those<00:00:59.100> time<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.550> room<00:00:59.730> shots<00:01:00.649> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
timers those time and room shots and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.350 
timers those time and room shots and
it's<00:01:02.370> pretty<00:01:02.550> crucial<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.060> here

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it's pretty crucial so and we have here

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
it's pretty crucial so and we have here
ball<00:01:06.659> carriers<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.290> gold<00:01:07.560> ball<00:01:07.740> above

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
ball carriers with the gold ball above

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.200 
ball carriers with the gold ball above
them<00:01:08.220> teal<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.450> offense<00:01:09.869> dark<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.500> defense<00:01:11.369> so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
them teal is offense dark is defense so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.090 
them teal is offense dark is defense so
we<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.600> defender<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.229> playing<00:01:13.650> out<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
we have defender a playing out on the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.910 
we have defender a playing out on the
ball<00:01:14.340> he's<00:01:14.700> extended<00:01:15.570> outside<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.650> paint

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ball he's extended outside the paint

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
ball he's extended outside the paint
because<00:01:17.280> he's<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> ball<00:01:18.000> carrier<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
because he's on the ball carrier so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
because he's on the ball carrier so
that's<00:01:18.780> fine<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:20.460> notice<00:01:20.790> B<00:01:21.030> B<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.200> inside<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that's fine but notice B B is inside the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.640 
that's fine but notice B B is inside the
paint<00:01:23.549> line<00:01:23.820> he's<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.570> pressing<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
paint line he's not pressing out on to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.630 
paint line he's not pressing out on to
if<00:01:25.950> he<00:01:26.100> presses<00:01:26.310> all<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.030> way<00:01:27.180> out<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:28.020> it

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
if he presses all the way out on to it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.649 
if he presses all the way out on to it
actually<00:01:29.640> opens<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.329> an<00:01:30.479> opportunity<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:32.659> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
actually opens up an opportunity for the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.440 
actually opens up an opportunity for the
offense<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.710> move<00:01:34.979> into<00:01:35.400> space<00:01:37.790> this<00:01:38.790> scenario

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
offense to move into space this scenario

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
offense to move into space this scenario
is<00:01:39.630> designed<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.320> look<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.130> there

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
is designed to look like as if there

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.260 
is designed to look like as if there
were<00:01:41.840> full<00:01:42.840> six<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.320> six<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.670> truly<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.060> 2

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
were full six on six this was truly a 2

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.950 
were full six on six this was truly a 2
on<00:01:45.420> 2<00:01:45.450> B<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.680> closer<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.280> 2<00:01:48.000> player<00:01:48.240> 1<00:01:48.659> but

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
on 2 B would be closer to 2 player 1 but

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.990 
on 2 B would be closer to 2 player 1 but
we're<00:01:49.140> assuming<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.399> diagram<00:01:50.640> that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
we're assuming in this diagram that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.550 
we're assuming in this diagram that
there<00:01:51.299> are<00:01:51.540> other<00:01:52.350> players<00:01:53.509> so<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.350> pass

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
there are other players so as the pass

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.459 
there are other players so as the pass
occurs<00:01:56.520> from<00:01:56.820> player<00:01:57.030> 1<00:01:57.270> player<00:01:57.570> 2<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:58.140> notice

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
occurs from player 1 player 2 we notice

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.179 
occurs from player 1 player 2 we notice
player<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.759> drops<00:02:00.689> back<00:02:00.990> into<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> paint<00:02:01.590> wall

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
player a drops back into the paint wall

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.580 
player a drops back into the paint wall
B<00:02:02.460> extends<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:05.719> the<00:02:06.719> main<00:02:07.020> concept

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
B extends that is the main concept

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.910 
B extends that is the main concept
behind<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.310> paint<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.690> expand<00:02:10.500> onto

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
behind the paint we want to expand onto

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.010 
behind the paint we want to expand onto
the<00:02:11.009> ball<00:02:11.190> carrier<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:12.090> contract<00:02:12.690> when

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the ball carrier and then contract when

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.490 
the ball carrier and then contract when
you're<00:02:13.170> off

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you're off

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.930 
you're off
also<00:02:13.890> expand<00:02:14.600> contract<00:02:15.600> expand<00:02:16.530> contract<00:02:17.040> so

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
also expand contract expand contract so

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.350 
also expand contract expand contract so
we're<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.240> spring<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.530> sense<00:02:20.360> so

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
we're like a spring in that sense so
