00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
cruise drive system and then a car comes

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.670 
cruise drive system and then a car comes
in<00:00:32.730> front<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.270> which<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:33.989> driving<00:00:34.260> slower

than 120 kilometers an hour then the car

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
than 120 kilometers an hour then the car
will<00:00:37.140> automatically<00:00:37.920> slow<00:00:38.070> down<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
will automatically slow down for you and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
will automatically slow down for you and
then<00:00:39.719> once<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.170> car<00:00:40.469> moves<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.070> overtake

the<00:00:41.700> car<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.329> car<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.600> then<00:00:42.750> take<00:00:42.899> itself<00:00:43.170> up

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the car the car will then take itself up

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.220 
the car the car will then take itself up
to<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.040> preferred<00:00:44.370> cruise<00:00:44.760> control<00:00:45.230> setting

to the preferred cruise control setting

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.869 
to the preferred cruise control setting
that<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.770> yourself<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> really

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that you put in yourself what I really

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.250 
that you put in yourself what I really
think<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.180> cool<00:00:48.329> about<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> suspension<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
think is cool about the suspension is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.619 
think is cool about the suspension is
that<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.500> doesn't<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:49.800> throw<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> around

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
that it doesn't really throw you around

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.250 
that it doesn't really throw you around
considering<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> road<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.230> very

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
considering that the road is very

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.840 
considering that the road is very
curvaceous<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.980> we're<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.699> down

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
curvaceous and we're going up and down

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.850 
curvaceous and we're going up and down
turning<00:00:54.210> inside<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.469> mean<00:00:55.590> even

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
turning inside and out and I mean even

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.990 
turning inside and out and I mean even
if<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.039> turn<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> steering<00:00:56.430> wheel<00:00:56.699> quite

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
if you turn the steering wheel quite

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.299 
if you turn the steering wheel quite
quickly<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.750> doesn't<00:00:57.989> lose<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> lot<00:00:58.920> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
quickly it doesn't lose you a lot it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.220

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
gripping on the corners pretty nicely

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
gripping on the corners pretty nicely
considering<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:03.809> driving<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.229> around

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409

120<00:01:05.070> around<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.700> me

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530 

let's<00:01:16.930> see<00:01:17.049> what<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.229> real<00:01:17.590> SUV<00:01:18.009> can<00:01:18.700> do<00:01:18.909> on<00:01:19.119> the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
let's see what a real SUV can do on the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.899 
let's see what a real SUV can do on the
mountains<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.770> gravel<00:01:21.100> road<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.520> all

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
mountains and the gravel road and all

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.550 
mountains and the gravel road and all
the<00:01:22.150> crazy<00:01:22.390> stuff<00:01:22.659> if<00:01:22.960> they<00:01:23.140> said<00:01:23.320> it's<00:01:23.470> a

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
the crazy stuff if they said it's a

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.590 
the crazy stuff if they said it's a
technologically<00:01:24.159> advanced<00:01:24.580> SUV<00:01:25.030> let's<00:01:25.450> put

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
technologically advanced SUV let's put

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.510 
technologically advanced SUV let's put
it<00:01:25.689> to<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.899> test<00:01:25.930> once<00:01:26.920> again<00:01:27.310> that

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
it to the test once again that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.340 
it to the test once again that
intelligent<00:01:28.119> all-wheel<00:01:28.330> drive<00:01:28.750> system<00:01:29.140> comes

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
intelligent all-wheel drive system comes

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.859 
intelligent all-wheel drive system comes
in<00:01:29.590> unlike<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.430> old-school<00:01:31.000> four<00:01:31.450> by<00:01:31.600> fours

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
in unlike the old-school four by fours

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.600 
in unlike the old-school four by fours
you'd<00:01:32.110> have<00:01:32.289> two<00:01:32.560> gears<00:01:32.860> something<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.310> engage

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
you'd have two gears something to engage

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.910 
you'd have two gears something to engage
it<00:01:33.759> in<00:01:33.850> two<00:01:33.970> 4x4<00:01:34.450> mode<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:35.289> clever<00:01:35.560> thing<00:01:35.649> on

it in two 4x4 mode the clever thing on

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.710 
it in two 4x4 mode the clever thing on
this<00:01:36.039> car<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.399> that<00:01:36.430> once<00:01:36.789> you<00:01:36.970> get<00:01:37.149> onto<00:01:37.450> an
