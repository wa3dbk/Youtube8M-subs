00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.880
 fifa teresa the decor is do not speak 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.130
 of beauty in miss ethics is a factor that 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.890
 needs to be well studied 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.570
 see how to plan and decorate a 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.570
 sustainable hall 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.360
 Look at the marina, the excuses are over. 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.640
 to have a salon ecologically 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070
 correct making changes much more 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.329
 simple and laser harry is here to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.010
 proving how you think about this project is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.409
 something like that is actually already 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 in my family 50 years ago, and we are 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.629
 is sought to address the issue of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.129
 naturality of hair hair health 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.570
 and that this has everything to do with 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.570
 sustainability and well - being 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.470
 the walls are well leaked 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.720
 she tries to get the most out of a 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.390
 cloudy day as it is today what would be the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.670
 natural light and the light is also cold which is 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.259
 a light that spends less energy than it is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.539
 More than that, can you tell us 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.210
 people use the least energy 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.310
 I think that's how it is in our things 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.110
 very practical on a daily basis for example 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.660
 at the time you were going to get a hair 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.789
 always take a lot of moisture from it with 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.340
 towel and dry it well for after 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.280
 begin to do the brushing process are 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.619
 Simple things, I do not think 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.140
 environments when you do not have the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 look for doors and windows to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.310
 opening to allow natural light to enter is 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.520
 a super simple thing you can do 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520
 also 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.820
 We have the washbasins behind the 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.659
 people wanted to know what you do with 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.030
 Water 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.070
 So the water is really like that. 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.090
 been in this house for 15 years is a 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.280
 which is already old 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.799
 Unfortunately I do not have a way to 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.360
 recycle this water would be a dream and the 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.550
 My house that I was able to get 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.650
 do you do channels so in 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.690
 around the house and has a place to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.299
 store is very cool to start you 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.090
 can use toilet can use to water 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.379
 garden can be a lot of thing but the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.690
 that we do so whenever we do not 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.599
 using washbasin off use the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.970
 minimum of water is our gold, right? 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:34.510
 of the future that process mom 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.069
 Italian equipment is that he stopped 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.819
 Discard the foil in the middle 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.920
 environment 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.079
 then you do processes of wicks and 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.329
 calls for sustainable wicks, not because 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.090
 this cookie he's used more than a thousand 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.610
 times head each strand around 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.140
 250 grams of used aluminum foil or 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.110
 so so if you do not have that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.180
 equipment are you at least clean 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.420
 and discard it in place. 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.549
 that can be is recycled from some 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.400
 right way because only in sao paulo by 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.950
 example are 60 thousand halls times 250 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.190
 grams per customer per day are 15 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.520
 tons of aluminum foil and 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.160
 discarded in the environment 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.980
 The dilution of the shampoo picks up your shampoo 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.250
 take a mouthful 50% water 50 per 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.050
 one hundred shampoo dilutes and passes does not pass neat 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.210
 in the hair because it is not that if it is 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.580
 remove, you 'll know when 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.130
 for removal is much easier to remove 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.520
 and then what happens - water - aggression 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.760
 chemistry the hair i'm the cosmetologist 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.320
 finishing or my specialization and 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.330
 there my dream was always to develop a 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.400
 biodegradable product that he 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.500
 when it was for the environment and not 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.360
 knows so much and also not leather policia 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.360
 hair and the client's wires nÃ© 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.380
 is there an ideal plant to bounce 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.900
 inside my lounge in a garden of 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.510
 Herbs, right? Because we do some 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.040
 products so over we thought 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.780
 well this green thing I think the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.610
 people already live in an air 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.170
 conditioning in the game within four 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.540
 walls people go out in the car that has to 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.340
 closing the video is always a cause of 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.920
 People can have life on our side. 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.130
 that the plant lives right then anyone 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.320
 that it is adaptable to aaa to your 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.880
 place when you want to spend there is closed 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.090
 so I'm going to look for a plant that is 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.160
 Good. There, I understand a little bit of everything. 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.810
 We 're all connected, right? 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.210
 however its a cycle its 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.110
 sustainability has much that you are 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.970
 from to to z 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.710
 You have to think where the 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.630
 process is where it ends 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.630
 so he will not break 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.320
 it seems the sintab one thing is fashion is far 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.390
 distant is just that big company, right? 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.420
 it's not us, we the little ones 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.020
 habits at home make a big change 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.020
 in the world 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.509
 A beauty
