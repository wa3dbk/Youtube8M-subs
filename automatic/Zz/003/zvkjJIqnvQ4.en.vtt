00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
we're going to see a very very late

we're going to see a very very late

vulture drop now at this stage or if
we're<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.550> two

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
we're just going to see that the two

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.950 
we're just going to see that the two
weapons<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> assume<00:00:24.660> we're<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
weapons one and I assume we're going to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.230 
weapons one and I assume we're going to
see<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> very<00:00:25.500> late<00:00:25.710> vulture<00:00:26.160> drop<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.939> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
see a very late vulture drop because I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.880 
see a very late vulture drop because I
don't<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.720> an<00:00:27.810> armored<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.289> anywhere<00:00:28.680> out<00:00:28.800> in

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
don't see an armored you anywhere out in

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.320 
don't see an armored you anywhere out in
the<00:00:28.949> field<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.670> pursue<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.029> weapons

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the field to just pursue the weapons

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.150 
the field to just pursue the weapons
upgrades<00:00:30.660> weapons<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.260> nowhere<00:00:31.980> near

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
upgrades weapons one nowhere near

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.889 
upgrades weapons one nowhere near
nowhere<00:00:33.000> near<00:00:33.180> finished<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.660> yeah<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.840> think

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
nowhere near finished so yeah I think

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.240 
nowhere near finished so yeah I think
we're<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.469> drop<00:00:34.770> game<00:00:34.980> after

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
we're going to see a drop game after

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.069 
we're going to see a drop game after
this<00:00:35.370> which<00:00:35.640> would<00:00:36.450> work<00:00:36.600> out<00:00:36.719> pretty<00:00:36.930> well

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
this which would work out pretty well

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.660 
this which would work out pretty well
but<00:00:37.440> honestly<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> get

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
but honestly I think it's going to get

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
but honestly I think it's going to get
spot<00:00:38.940> there's<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> control<00:00:39.629> tower<00:00:39.809> right<00:00:40.020> now

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
spot there's the control tower right now

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.510 
spot there's the control tower right now
and<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.829> actually<00:00:41.040> i<00:00:41.190> don't<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.489> that

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and that actually i don't think that

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970 
and that actually i don't think that
mine<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.270> nine<00:00:42.480> o'clock<00:00:42.750> even<00:00:43.350> blocks<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
mine at the nine o'clock even blocks the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.400 
mine at the nine o'clock even blocks the
nexus<00:00:44.309> i<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:45.059> might

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
nexus i think it actually just might

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.810 
nexus i think it actually just might
indicate<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.590> there's<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> nexus<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.579> so

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
indicate that there's a nexus there so

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.160 
indicate that there's a nexus there so
anyway<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.300> another<00:00:48.539> command<00:00:48.809> center<00:00:49.020> being

anyway in another command center being

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
anyway in another command center being
built<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.800> wander<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.250> take<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> three

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
built to wander out and take that three

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.069 
built to wander out and take that three
o'clock<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.149> honestly<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.600> stage<00:00:51.899> with

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
o'clock but honestly at this stage with

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.420 
o'clock but honestly at this stage with
the<00:00:52.170> amount<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.440> factories<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> amount<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the amount of factories of the amount of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.189 
the amount of factories of the amount of
troops<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.570> they're<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.079> out

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
troops that they're going to be out

of an additional factory I don't know

of an additional factory I don't know
that<00:01:00.719> novell<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.079> really<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.620> a

position to go take that three o'clock
base<00:01:03.300> looks<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.690> he's<00:01:03.870> adding<00:01:04.080> two<00:01:04.199> more

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
base looks like he's adding two more

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
going to be able to do that while

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.130 
going to be able to do that while
performing<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.180> vulture<00:01:09.450> drop<00:01:09.659> particularly

out in the field they try to engage this

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.179 
out in the field they try to engage this
and<00:01:13.350> you're<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.530> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.770> see<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> lot<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and you're just going to see a lot of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.440 
and you're just going to see a lot of
Dragoon<00:01:14.549> starting<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> move<00:01:15.060> forward<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.420> think

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
Dragoon starting to move forward I think

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.570 
Dragoon starting to move forward I think
actually<00:01:15.720> he<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.950> stop<00:01:17.159> worrying<00:01:17.400> he's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
actually he can just stop worrying he's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.649 
actually he can just stop worrying he's
going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.939> pylon<00:01:18.270> wall<00:01:18.509> right

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.910 
going to have that pylon wall right
there<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.810> thinking<00:01:19.110> actually<00:01:19.259> start<00:01:19.650> worrying

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
there I thinking actually start worrying

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.109 
there I thinking actually start worrying
stop<00:01:20.159> worrying<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.759> natural

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
stop worrying about this natural

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
stop worrying about this natural

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
expansion just move a ton of your goons

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
expansion just move a ton of your goons
up<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.220> use<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> scouting<00:01:24.060> from<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.840> try

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
up and use the scouting from here to try

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.899

to counter counter right otherwise and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.370 
to counter counter right otherwise and
it<00:01:26.970> looks<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.210> novell<00:01:27.570> emptying<00:01:28.259> that

have dragoons in position nor does it

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.610 
have dragoons in position nor does it
look<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.599> he<00:02:39.750> had<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.049> scouting<00:02:40.500> outs

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
look like he had the scouting outs

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.960 
look like he had the scouting outs
really<00:02:40.890> deal<00:02:41.010> with<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.220> even<00:02:41.310> though<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.580> kind

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
really deal with it even though it kind

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.580 
really deal with it even though it kind
of<00:02:42.000> took<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.209> backward<00:02:42.540> path<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.170> he<00:02:43.379> going

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
of took a backward path and is he going

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.110 
of took a backward path and is he going
to<00:02:43.650> see<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.860> no<00:02:43.980> he's<00:02:44.099> not<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.430> see<00:02:44.549> it<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
to see it no he's not going to see it so

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.370 
to see it no he's not going to see it so
after<00:02:45.239> all<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.599> time<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.810> said<00:02:46.079> hey<00:02:46.230> this

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
after all this time I said hey this

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.780 
after all this time I said hey this
whole<00:02:46.590> harass<00:02:46.890> not<00:02:47.130> going<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> work<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.640> looks

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
whole harass not going to work it looks

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.460 
whole harass not going to work it looks
like<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> vulture<00:02:48.209> arrest<00:02:48.450> will<00:02:48.989> work<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
like the vulture arrest will work it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.050 
like the vulture arrest will work it
going<00:02:50.130> straight<00:02:50.340> at<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> middle<00:02:50.730> lane<00:02:50.849> kind

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
going straight at the middle lane kind

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.330 
going straight at the middle lane kind
of<00:02:51.120> an<00:02:51.209> orthodox<00:02:51.959> position<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:52.890> sears<00:02:53.099> able

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
of an orthodox position but sears able

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.680 
of an orthodox position but sears able
to<00:02:53.400> see<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.610> rather<00:02:53.760> rapidly<00:02:54.209> looks<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.569> he's

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
to see it rather rapidly looks like he's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.210 
to see it rather rapidly looks like he's
going<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.870> be<00:02:54.930> able<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.110> respond<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.739> fairly

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
going to be able to respond to it fairly

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.559 
going to be able to respond to it fairly
quickly<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.730> doesn't<00:02:57.000> look<00:02:57.060> like<00:02:57.150> end<00:02:57.510> up

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
quickly it doesn't look like end up

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.600 
quickly it doesn't look like end up
losing<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.989> lot<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.140> probes<00:02:58.470> as<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> result<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.190> I

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
losing a lot of probes as a result and I

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.309 
losing a lot of probes as a result and I
able<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.940> engage<00:03:00.150> fairly<00:03:00.840> quickly<00:03:01.019> as<00:03:01.170> well

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
able to engage fairly quickly as well

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.720 
able to engage fairly quickly as well
looks<00:03:01.709> like<00:03:01.769> yeah<00:03:02.010> we've<00:03:02.160> got<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.459> command

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
looks like yeah we've got the command

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.309 
looks like yeah we've got the command
center<00:03:02.849> there<00:03:03.090> no<00:03:03.329> suvs<00:03:03.750> being<00:03:04.019> transferred

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
center there no suvs being transferred

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.920 
center there no suvs being transferred
might<00:03:04.500> actually<00:03:04.819> be<00:03:05.819> interesting<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.390> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
might actually be interesting to to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.050 
might actually be interesting to to
actually<00:03:07.079> see<00:03:07.470> that<00:03:08.069> dropship<00:03:08.549> used<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.849> kind

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
actually see that dropship used to kind

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.550 
actually see that dropship used to kind
of<00:03:09.090> transfer<00:03:09.540> keep<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.840> alive<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.079> use<00:03:10.379> it<00:03:10.530> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
of transfer keep it alive and use it to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.900 
of transfer keep it alive and use it to
transfer<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> couple<00:03:11.220> troops<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:11.670> some<00:03:11.790> more

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
transfer a couple troops and some more

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.640 
transfer a couple troops and some more
vultures<00:03:12.269> being<00:03:12.989> dropped<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.319> that<00:03:13.440> corner

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
vultures being dropped to that corner

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.900 
vultures being dropped to that corner
looks<00:03:13.739> like<00:03:13.920> they<00:03:14.160> managed<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.489> get<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.700> couple

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
looks like they managed to get a couple

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.280 
looks like they managed to get a couple
more<00:03:15.120> kills<00:03:15.360> but<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.840> looks<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.110> that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
more kills but that looks like that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.509 
more kills but that looks like that
dropship<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.860> be<00:03:16.920> taken<00:03:17.220> out<00:03:17.310> or<00:03:17.459> at

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
dropship going to be taken out or at

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.410 
dropship going to be taken out or at
least<00:03:17.639> force<00:03:17.850> from<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.000> back<00:03:18.239> corner

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
least force from that back corner

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.050 
least force from that back corner
otherwise<00:03:19.220> mines<00:03:20.220> cleared<00:03:20.519> go<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.880> north

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
otherwise mines cleared go to the north

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.940 
otherwise mines cleared go to the north
so<00:03:21.269> xerosis<00:03:21.630> economy<00:03:22.079> disrupted<00:03:22.500> for<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:22.859> a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
so xerosis economy disrupted for just a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.930 
so xerosis economy disrupted for just a
second<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.430> don't<00:03:23.639> think<00:03:23.700> there<00:03:23.880> was

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
second but I don't think there was

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.120 
second but I don't think there was
enough<00:03:24.090> damage<00:03:24.510> really<00:03:24.750> done<00:03:24.930> by<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:26.010> be

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
enough damage really done by that to be

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.530 
enough damage really done by that to be
worthwhile<00:03:26.310> some<00:03:26.760> more<00:03:26.910> vulture<00:03:27.180> starting<00:03:27.480> to

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
worthwhile some more vulture starting to

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.120 
worthwhile some more vulture starting to
wander<00:03:27.720> out<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.019> field<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.739> still<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
wander out in the field but still the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.220 
wander out in the field but still the
third<00:03:29.340> base<00:03:29.519> up<00:03:29.760> no<00:03:29.940> nothing<00:03:30.720> happening<00:03:31.049> with

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
third base up no nothing happening with

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.900 
third base up no nothing happening with
it<00:03:31.380> i<00:03:31.410> think<00:03:31.530> xirrus<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.099> pretty<00:03:32.430> well<00:03:32.579> along

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
it i think xirrus is pretty well along

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.759 
it i think xirrus is pretty well along
the<00:03:33.030> way<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.840> looks<00:03:33.959> actually<00:03:34.079> he's<00:03:34.590> going

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
the way to it looks actually he's going

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.680 
the way to it looks actually he's going
to<00:03:34.829> go<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.190> heavy<00:03:35.400> infantry<00:03:35.790> match<00:03:36.060> instead

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
to go for a heavy infantry match instead

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.420 
to go for a heavy infantry match instead
he<00:03:36.930> doesn't<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.799> Templar<00:03:38.130> archives

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
he doesn't have the Templar archives

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.220 
he doesn't have the Templar archives
down<00:03:38.639> just<00:03:38.880> yet<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.540> he's<00:03:39.750> going<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.930> play<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.109> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
down just yet so he's going to play it a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.140 
down just yet so he's going to play it a
little<00:03:40.349> bit<00:03:40.560> more<00:03:40.829> passively<00:03:41.549> go<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:41.970> heavy

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
little bit more passively go for a heavy

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.030 
little bit more passively go for a heavy
infantry<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.660> map<00:03:42.810> control<00:03:43.109> from<00:03:43.200> here<00:03:43.440> losing

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
infantry of map control from here losing

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.379 
infantry of map control from here losing
couple<00:03:44.340> Joe<00:03:44.430> goons<00:03:44.609> here<00:03:44.849> to<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.030> north<00:03:45.150> just

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
couple Joe goons here to the north just

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.449 
couple Joe goons here to the north just
kind<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.569> wandering<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:46.019> out<00:03:46.139> there<00:03:46.349> not<00:03:47.250> quite

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
kind of wandering it out there not quite

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.680 
kind of wandering it out there not quite
sure<00:03:47.489> why<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.150> looks<00:03:48.389> like<00:03:48.540> now<00:03:48.660> that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
sure why and it looks like now that

mines<00:06:23.220> from<00:06:23.340> that<00:06:23.490> corner<00:06:23.700> but<00:06:23.910> I<00:06:23.940> think<00:06:24.270> I'm

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
mines from that corner but I think I'm

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.030 
mines from that corner but I think I'm
not<00:06:24.660> sure<00:06:24.780> that<00:06:24.810> was<00:06:25.050> worth<00:06:25.230> losing<00:06:25.500> that

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
not sure that was worth losing that

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.830 
not sure that was worth losing that
three<00:06:26.250> o'clock<00:06:26.490> spot<00:06:26.760> because<00:06:27.450> he's<00:06:27.660> going<00:06:27.780> to

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
three o'clock spot because he's going to

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.570 
three o'clock spot because he's going to
need<00:06:28.020> basically<00:06:28.500> three<00:06:28.920> cannons<00:06:29.250> rather<00:06:29.460> than

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
need basically three cannons rather than

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.160 
need basically three cannons rather than
just<00:06:29.790> to<00:06:29.970> defend<00:06:30.390> without<00:06:30.690> those<00:06:30.810> two<00:06:31.020> goons

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
just to defend without those two goons

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.050 
just to defend without those two goons
I'm<00:06:31.920> kind<00:06:32.130> of<00:06:32.160> at<00:06:32.310> that<00:06:32.430> position<00:06:32.610> looks<00:06:32.910> like

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
I'm kind of at that position looks like

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.370 
I'm kind of at that position looks like
a<00:06:33.090> couple<00:06:33.450> vultures<00:06:33.780> able<00:06:34.050> to<00:06:34.110> get<00:06:34.200> a<00:06:34.260> couple

here<00:06:59.400> he's<00:06:59.550> only<00:06:59.730> got<00:06:59.940> seven<00:07:00.810> factories<00:07:01.260> and

those weird situations I like the high

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.010 
those weird situations I like the high
