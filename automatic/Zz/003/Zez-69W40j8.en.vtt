00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.620
 hello you welcome to my dear 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.170
 next video 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.880
 the latter I unfortunately do not stop so often 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.840
 videos because you already see me 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.910
 totally swollen and tired of mine 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.090
 baby is currently doing something to me 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.189
 but I have mine today 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.900
 Last pink box I wanted to get 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 not withheld from you 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.320
 and that's why the last one I have 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.690
 now just subscribed because I have the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.320
 the last time was not as old satisfied 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 and I think the glossybox is easy 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.270
 somehow much better and therefore happy 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.610
 I'm the last one now 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.289
 got that bank couple nice 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.629
 products and I wish you much fun 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.600
 in this video 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.420
 First of all I got something from l'oréal paris 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.920
 apa 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.590
 if I was a surprise so far 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.890
 pretty much every box has something of it 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.890
 l'oréal paris and that is the l vital 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.299
 sun defense protective summer shampoo 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.610
 and assigns it a limited edition as well 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.130
 It stands here and it should protect 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.430
 Dehydration results in intensive care 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.659
 and immediate regeneration for summer 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 damaged hair sun beach and pool 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.140
 I think that's really cool because 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.000
 it is known yes one means somewhere in the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.119
 Pool bathing goes through this chlorine water 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.250
 please always dry very quickly 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.860
 and so weird if you feel it afterwards 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.810
 washed has smells very very 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 enjoyable 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 that is yes 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.159
 I do not even know about that 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.850
 shampoo neither flowery nor 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 especially fresh that just smells good 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.700
 I am pleased with light shampoo and I am happy 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.920
 me on it so that's really ne 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.149
 interesting and a good thing that is 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.399
 with lotus nectar with uva uvb filter as 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.239
 Next we had this baby 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.510
 here and these eat for game 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:16.230
 Polish and I have the color 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.840
 11 forever young in short what a red one 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.630
 pink I would say yes I have 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.750
 Never tried these nail polishes 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.900
 I do not know how they are but good 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.690
 I 'm looking forward to it, mine is mine 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.799

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.060
 you too where we are maybe I am so 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.580
 excited about it 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.700
 I am very happy about that 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.620
 this book you to body care bath salts 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.730
 Although this is a summer limited edition 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.470
 1 bath salt with orange oil 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.590
 virtualization and football are revitalizing the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.549
 senses suitable for every skin type 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.290
 although I actually summer and 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.880
 orange oil i know the orange compound 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.280
 I spend more and more with winter as well 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.780
 but always that should be very pleasant 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.120
 I have just been sniffed and 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.760
 they are so coarse crystalline and me 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.829
 Can you ask for a full body though 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.010
 also for a nice foot bath use 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.139
 I would very much like that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.269
 try and look forward to it that way 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.370
 provable yes like like such things 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.370
 As you know next we had one 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:28.170
 Product again from soosten carla 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.790
 hybrid a puppy must have the lipsic and such 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.859
 It looks and I wondered 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.590
 I thought that would be such a lip gloss but 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.530
 there is really a really blatant 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.300
 color to validity in this part and me 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.640
 I'm looking forward to using that 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.840
 you know i love those gaudy ones 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.960
 colors and that 's really the madness what 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.830
 the covering on the lips so I think 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.810
 so yes it already really I think about it 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.830
 now just applied but completely 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.300
 Little because I think that's easy too 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.580
 dolle bangs and I today very 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.980
 I would like to make a showy make-up 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.220
 not so exaggerated on the lips 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.620
 pop and something waterproof 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.590
 I just believe it is a care 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.070
 lip care which gives off extreme color and 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.989
 waterproof is and yes you can get that 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.740
 even now really not on 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.750
 Let's get on with it now 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.890
 Although I have from of Canusa cream 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.590
 look vital and we have it here 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.170
 a foam and at first I thought so 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.400
 But that would be his body look 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.760
 be that if you are a sensitive one 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.760
 skin has a yes today is something with us 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.560
 go with chamomile and vitamin a 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.300
 and b i think thats really cool i have 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.820
 tried it out before and it is 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.860
 really such a beautiful beautiful fine 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.070
 it looks really great on the 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.010
 Last but not least, we had skin here 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.150
 Martha again I like this newspaper 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.890
 I really like the last one too 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.990
 even or even something from the last 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.690
 boiled and that's really great 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.330
 guessing healthy if I'm not 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.919
 I think I have two fat ones now 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.100
 dinger at home and would like to me first 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:19.710

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.810

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.060
 sweet that was the last pink oxide 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.010
 Although I have presented the catch 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.140
 but you want products now 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.240

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.890

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.710
 maybe I'll just find it 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.990
 Somehow a better box which holds 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:41.010
 You are currently on a pint box 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.480

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.970
