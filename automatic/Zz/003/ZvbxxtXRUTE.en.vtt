00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that we have called crunk songs but

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.440 
that we have called crunk songs but
absolutely<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.830> movement<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> body<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
absolutely the movement of the body that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.590 
absolutely the movement of the body that
all<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:10.110> directly<00:01:11.100> related<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.760> dances

all can be directly related to dances
that<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.140> make<00:01:13.409> our<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:14.070> makes<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> at

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that they do make our what makes it at

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.810 
that they do make our what makes it at
work<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:15.060> think<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.020> movement<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.820> suppose

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
work I think the movement and suppose

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
work I think the movement and suppose
they<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.869> what's<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> difference<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.560> um

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
they like what's the difference like um

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
they like what's the difference like um
I<00:01:20.369> mean<00:01:20.909> really<00:01:20.970> there<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.689> don't<00:01:21.810> think

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
I mean really there I don't think

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.480 
I mean really there I don't think
there's<00:01:22.290> necessarily<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.979> difference<00:01:23.369> between

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
there's necessarily a difference between

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
there's necessarily a difference between
actually<00:01:24.119> targeting<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.840> popping<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.500> just

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
actually targeting and popping I just

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.649 
actually targeting and popping I just
think<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.610> working<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> popular

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
think now it's working as the popular

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
think now it's working as the popular
life<00:01:27.930> term<00:01:28.619> we're<00:01:28.890> using<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.150> does

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
life term we're using for it there does

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.450 
life term we're using for it there does
seem<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.750> gyration<00:01:31.710> though<00:01:31.890> yeah<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
seem to be more gyration though yeah in

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.210 
seem to be more gyration though yeah in
this<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:33.420> opposed<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> popping<00:01:34.200> yes<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.740> mean

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this as opposed to popping yes I mean

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.069 
this as opposed to popping yes I mean
and<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> thing<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.299> seems<00:01:36.600> problematic

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and and the thing that seems problematic

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.740 
and and the thing that seems problematic
to<00:01:37.560> me<00:01:37.590> even<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.280> trace<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.090> historical

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
to me even as we trace the historical

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.600 
to me even as we trace the historical
roots<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.740> fact<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.340> has

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
roots of it is the fact that it has

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.760 
roots of it is the fact that it has
become<00:01:42.119> somewhat<00:01:42.750> perverted<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.619> its

don't agree with that comment at all
because<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.290> think<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.159> becomes<00:02:02.640> hyper

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
because I think I think it becomes hyper

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.730 
because I think I think it becomes hyper
sexualized<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> history<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
sexualized because of the history of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and objectified but I think it only

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.450 
and objectified but I think it only
becomes<00:02:10.920> disgusting<00:02:11.670> when<00:02:11.819> we<00:02:11.940> look<00:02:12.120> at

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
becomes disgusting when we look at

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.940 
becomes disgusting when we look at
as<00:02:12.520> something<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.120> women<00:02:13.360> are<00:02:13.660> doing<00:02:13.990> for

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
as something that women are doing for

don't<00:02:17.830> agree<00:02:18.130> with<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.370> think<00:02:18.550> there<00:02:18.850> has<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.030> be

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
don't agree with I think there has to be
