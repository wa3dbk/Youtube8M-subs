00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
about 10 months ago but look at the five

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.800 
about 10 months ago but look at the five
best<00:00:22.890> wearables<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.300> buy<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
best wearables that you can buy and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.330 
best wearables that you can buy and
these<00:00:25.050> are<00:00:25.170> all<00:00:25.289> first<00:00:25.500> generation<00:00:25.590> products

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
these are all first generation products

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.740 
these are all first generation products
so<00:00:26.460> they're<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> beginning<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.570> new

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750

so they're the beginning of a new
product<00:00:28.019> category<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.670> could<00:00:29.849> all<00:00:30.000> sort

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
product category and they could all sort

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.209 
product category and they could all sort
of<00:00:30.510> tell<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> new

something<00:00:33.809> new<00:00:33.960> was<00:00:34.079> happening<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
something new was happening but if you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.799 
something new was happening but if you
actually<00:00:35.550> wanted<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> do<00:00:36.180> anything<00:00:36.420> about<00:00:36.630> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
actually wanted to do anything about it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.330 
actually wanted to do anything about it
or<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.230> wanted<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> take<00:00:37.710> action<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.250> if

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
or if you wanted to take action or if

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100 
or if you wanted to take action or if
you<00:00:38.430> want<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.700> reply<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> something<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you want to reply to something like a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260 
you want to reply to something like a
new<00:00:40.320> message<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.700> still<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> take

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
new message then you still have to take

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.910 
new message then you still have to take
your<00:00:42.450> phone<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.840> pocket<00:00:43.110> anyway<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
your phone out your pocket anyway so

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.410 
your phone out your pocket anyway so
that's<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.460> guess<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> main<00:00:45.030> difference

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
that's I guess the main difference

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
that's I guess the main difference
between<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.079> had<00:00:46.289> then<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.890> what<00:00:47.430> we

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
between what we had then and what we

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.220 
between what we had then and what we
have<00:00:47.700> now<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.210> Google<00:00:48.510> i/o<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.750> summer<00:00:49.050> we

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
have now at Google i/o this summer we

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.319 
have now at Google i/o this summer we
saw<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> introduction<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:50.100> Android<00:00:50.640> wear<00:00:51.000> so

watch<00:03:30.959> but<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.650> think<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:31.949> one<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.190> strikes

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
watch but I think the one that strikes

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.460 
watch but I think the one that strikes
the<00:03:32.669> balance<00:03:32.849> best<00:03:33.389> is<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.750> Zen<00:03:33.959> watch<00:03:34.169> it's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
the balance best is the Zen watch it's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.589 
the balance best is the Zen watch it's
probably<00:03:34.949> easily<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.790> best-looking

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
probably easily the best-looking

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.809 
probably easily the best-looking
SmartWatch<00:03:37.379> that<00:03:37.889> has<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.069> full<00:03:38.459> square

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819

aluminum<00:03:40.859> on<00:03:40.979> the<00:03:41.099> sides<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.609> has<00:03:41.729> that<00:03:41.849> subtle

curve around the edges it has the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.129

leather band it has that clasp like a

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.110 
leather band it has that clasp like a
normal<00:03:46.440> timepiece<00:03:46.889> so<00:03:47.159> it's<00:03:47.310> very<00:03:47.489> nice<00:03:48.060> of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
normal timepiece so it's very nice of

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.670 
normal timepiece so it's very nice of
striking<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.810> balance<00:03:48.989> between<00:03:49.319> something

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
striking the balance between something

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.439 
striking the balance between something
that<00:03:49.949> looks<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> timepiece<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:51.150> also<00:03:51.299> it

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
that looks like a timepiece but also it

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.759 
that looks like a timepiece but also it
gives<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.810> sort<00:03:51.989> of<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.139> high-tech<00:03:52.290> look

necessarily pick it over the number one
and<00:03:57.900> number<00:03:58.019> two<00:03:58.169> but<00:03:58.949> I<00:03:58.979> do<00:03:59.069> want<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.459> put<00:03:59.579> it

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
the G watch are for round is much better

the G watch are for round is much better
looking<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.340> think<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.820> easily<00:04:49.180> something

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
looking I think and is easily something

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.900 
looking I think and is easily something
I<00:04:50.200> could<00:04:50.350> recommend<00:04:50.590> but<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.310> number<00:04:51.490> one<00:04:51.700> I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
I could recommend but the number one I

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.910 
I could recommend but the number one I
think<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.630> one<00:04:52.810> that<00:04:53.050> you<00:04:53.320> guys<00:04:53.530> probably

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
think is the one that you guys probably

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.840 
think is the one that you guys probably
all<00:04:54.220> saw<00:04:54.430> coming

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
all saw coming

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.470 
all saw coming
number<00:04:55.510> one<00:04:55.750> is<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.650> Moto<00:04:56.890> 360<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.640> moto<00:04:57.820> 360<00:04:58.030> is

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
number one is the Moto 360 a moto 360 is

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.480 
number one is the Moto 360 a moto 360 is
a<00:04:58.630> round<00:04:58.900> SmartWatch<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.620> it's<00:05:00.010> also<00:05:00.280> running

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
a round SmartWatch and it's also running

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.730 
a round SmartWatch and it's also running
Android<00:05:00.880> wear<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:02.110> has<00:05:02.260> a<00:05:02.290> metal<00:05:02.500> version

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
Android wear and it has a metal version

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.620 
Android wear and it has a metal version
too<00:05:03.100> so<00:05:03.310> if<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.460> prefer<00:05:03.790> that<00:05:03.940> premium<00:05:04.390> look

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
too so if you prefer that premium look

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.840 
too so if you prefer that premium look
and<00:05:04.780> feel<00:05:04.960> closer<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.560> normal<00:05:05.919> watch<00:05:06.460> as<00:05:06.790> a

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
and feel closer to a normal watch as a

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.700 
and feel closer to a normal watch as a
clasp<00:05:07.480> so<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.750> has<00:05:07.870> everything<00:05:07.900> like<00:05:08.290> that<00:05:08.500> you

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
clasp so it has everything like that you

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.500 
clasp so it has everything like that you
have<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:09.070> option<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.610> think<00:05:10.120> it's<00:05:10.210> one<00:05:10.360> of<00:05:10.419> the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
have that option I think it's one of the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.630 
have that option I think it's one of the
best-looking<00:05:10.930> smartwatches<00:05:11.800> actually<00:05:12.520> might

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640

toss-up between like the top three or

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.230 
toss-up between like the top three or
four<00:05:56.530> depending<00:05:57.310> on<00:05:57.520> what<00:05:57.700> sort<00:05:57.850> of<00:05:57.880> a<00:05:57.970> design

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
four depending on what sort of a design

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.730 
four depending on what sort of a design
you<00:05:58.450> like<00:05:58.479> and<00:05:58.810> what<00:05:58.930> functionality<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.710> want

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
you like and what functionality you want

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.740 
you like and what functionality you want
the<00:06:00.340> clasp<00:06:00.640> design<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.180> material<00:06:01.600> design

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
the clasp design the material design

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.020 
the clasp design the material design
also<00:06:02.530> there's<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.770> Sony<00:06:03.280> option<00:06:03.700> the<00:06:03.820> Sony

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030

those<00:06:06.400> Samsung<00:06:07.000> options<00:06:07.810> that<00:06:07.960> I<00:06:07.990> talked

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
those Samsung options that I talked

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.960 
those Samsung options that I talked
about<00:06:08.500> as<00:06:08.650> they<00:06:08.830> start<00:06:09.100> to<00:06:09.160> flood<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.580> market

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
about as they start to flood the market

so really there are a lot more options

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.950 
so really there are a lot more options

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.390 
also below it's a question mark for me
in<00:06:28.870> terms<00:06:29.020> of<00:06:29.290> functionality<00:06:29.950> and<00:06:30.070> what<00:06:30.280> it's

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
in terms of functionality and what it's

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.710 
in terms of functionality and what it's
actually<00:06:30.729> going<00:06:30.820> to<00:06:30.880> be<00:06:30.970> able<00:06:31.060> to<00:06:31.210> do<00:06:31.390> and<00:06:31.630> what

actually going to be able to do and what

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.969 
actually going to be able to do and what
the<00:06:31.840> interface<00:06:32.200> will<00:06:32.380> look<00:06:32.500> like<00:06:32.620> and<00:06:32.860> all

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
the interface will look like and all

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.920 
the interface will look like and all
these<00:06:33.130> other<00:06:33.280> things<00:06:33.340> but<00:06:34.120> best<00:06:34.539> watch<00:06:34.720> that

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
these other things but best watch that

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.839 
these other things but best watch that
video<00:06:35.020> is<00:06:35.289> totally<00:06:35.440> separate<00:06:35.950> and<00:06:36.610> it's<00:06:36.760> an

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
video is totally separate and it's an

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.460 
video is totally separate and it's an
interesting<00:06:37.030> concept<00:06:37.419> but<00:06:37.930> we<00:06:38.050> all<00:06:38.169> know<00:06:38.320> that

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
interesting concept but we all know that

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.980 
interesting concept but we all know that
once<00:06:38.620> Apple

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
once Apple

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.720 
once Apple
tends<00:06:39.110> to<00:06:39.260> get<00:06:39.440> into<00:06:39.620> things<00:06:39.860> that's<00:06:40.550> what

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
tends to get into things that's what

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.130 
tends to get into things that's what
really<00:06:40.850> gets<00:06:41.000> the<00:06:41.150> competition<00:06:41.690> going<00:06:41.960> and

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
really gets the competition going and

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.480 
really gets the competition going and
that<00:06:42.500> makes<00:06:42.680> better<00:06:42.860> products<00:06:43.310> for<00:06:43.460> us

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
that makes better products for us

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.740 
that makes better products for us

always<00:07:01.250> had<00:07:01.490> in<00:07:01.610> the<00:07:01.730> back<00:07:01.880> of<00:07:02.030> our<00:07:02.120> mind<00:07:02.300> that

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:02.480 
always had in the back of our mind that

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.600 
always had in the back of our mind that
thought<00:07:02.720> of<00:07:02.930> a<00:07:03.020> consumer<00:07:03.710> version<00:07:04.070> of<00:07:04.280> Google

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
thought of a consumer version of Google

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.210 
thought of a consumer version of Google
glass<00:07:04.820> for<00:07:05.120> a<00:07:05.600> lower<00:07:05.780> price<00:07:06.110> tag<00:07:06.350> that<00:07:06.650> we<00:07:07.010> just

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
glass for a lower price tag that we just

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.680 
glass for a lower price tag that we just
straight-up<00:07:07.610> never<00:07:07.970> saw<00:07:08.240> I<00:07:08.420> mean<00:07:08.450> Google

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
straight-up never saw I mean Google

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.110 
straight-up never saw I mean Google
glass<00:07:09.050> is<00:07:09.290> still<00:07:09.530> 1,500<00:07:09.950> bucks<00:07:10.370> right<00:07:10.640> now<00:07:10.820> so

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
glass is still 1,500 bucks right now so

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.640 
glass is still 1,500 bucks right now so
I<00:07:11.390> wouldn't<00:07:11.840> be<00:07:11.930> surprised<00:07:12.260> if<00:07:12.290> that<00:07:12.530> was

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:12.650 
I wouldn't be surprised if that was

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.420 
I wouldn't be surprised if that was
wrecker<00:07:12.940> resurrected<00:07:13.940> we<00:07:14.780> brought<00:07:15.590> back<00:07:15.980> from

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430
