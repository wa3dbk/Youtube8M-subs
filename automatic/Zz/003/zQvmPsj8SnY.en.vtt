00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.520 
color so as I see it turning out to look
like<00:02:13.260> this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
like this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.760 
like this
take<00:02:13.650> already<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.190> then<00:02:14.790> go<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.690> hood<00:02:16.530> and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
take already and then go to the hood and

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.559 
take already and then go to the hood and
i<00:02:16.860> recommend<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.370> stock<00:02:17.670> hood<00:02:17.850> because<00:02:18.390> it

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
i recommend the stock hood because it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.090 
i recommend the stock hood because it
does<00:02:18.660> look<00:02:18.780> pretty<00:02:18.900> cool<00:02:19.140> i<00:02:19.380> do<00:02:19.440> not<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
does look pretty cool i do not like the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.290

one<00:02:20.220> with<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.340> stripe<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.819> doesn't<00:02:21.180> really

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
one with the stripe on it doesn't really

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.540 
one with the stripe on it doesn't really
you<00:02:21.990> know<00:02:22.020> look<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.560> good<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.160> put<00:02:23.370> our

recommend putting the second area on
your<00:02:25.500> spoiler<00:02:26.130> because<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.640> does<00:02:26.760> show<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
your spoiler because it does show and
