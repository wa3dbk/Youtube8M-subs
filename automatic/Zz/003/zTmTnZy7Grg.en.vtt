00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
really good job doing it so just to show

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.209 
really good job doing it so just to show
you<00:00:36.360> guys<00:00:36.600> basically<00:00:37.170> how<00:00:37.320> we<00:00:37.380> build<00:00:38.040> these

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you guys basically how we build these

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.520 
you guys basically how we build these
harnesses<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> essentially<00:00:40.050> layer<00:00:40.290> by

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
harnesses we do it essentially layer by

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
harnesses we do it essentially layer by
layer<00:00:40.559> we'll<00:00:41.219> take<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.670> center<00:00:41.969> bundle<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
layer we'll take a center bundle and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150 
layer we'll take a center bundle and
then<00:00:42.629> we'll<00:00:42.750> take<00:00:42.899> another<00:00:42.930> set<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> wires<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
then we'll take another set of wires and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.160 
then we'll take another set of wires and
as<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.270> layer<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:46.110> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
as you can see this layer here is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
as you can see this layer here is
wrapped<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.309> direction<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.480> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
wrapped to this direction and then the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.990 
wrapped to this direction and then the
layer<00:00:48.809> underneath<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.980> actually<00:00:50.489> wrapped

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
layer underneath it is actually wrapped

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
layer underneath it is actually wrapped
the<00:00:51.300> other<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> ends<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.129> doing

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the other way so what this ends up doing

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.060 
the other way so what this ends up doing
is<00:00:53.579> giving<00:00:53.940> us<00:00:54.110> maximum<00:00:55.110> flexibility<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
is giving us maximum flexibility and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.240 
is giving us maximum flexibility and
it's<00:00:56.520> extremely<00:00:57.360> flexible<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.250> motorsport

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
it's extremely flexible and motorsport

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
it's extremely flexible and motorsport

need a custom wiring harness these are
milspec<00:01:12.630> connectors<00:01:13.020> people<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> use

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
milspec connectors people like to use

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.109 
milspec connectors people like to use
these<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.340> they're<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.729> quick-release

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
these because they're just quick-release

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.840 
these because they're just quick-release
they<00:01:15.750> look<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.259> good<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.770> instead<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
they look really good and instead of

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.249 
they look really good and instead of
fighting<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.180> connectors<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.900> trying<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
fighting for connectors and trying to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.200 
fighting for connectors and trying to
disconnect<00:01:19.830> plastic<00:01:20.250> stuff<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.939> pull

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
disconnect plastic stuff you can pull

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.969 
disconnect plastic stuff you can pull
the<00:01:21.330> engine<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.659> real<00:01:21.930> real<00:01:22.110> quick<00:01:22.320> makes<00:01:22.799> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the engine out real real quick makes it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.700 
the engine out real real quick makes it
easy<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:23.970> manufacture<00:01:24.630> products<00:01:25.560> that

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
easy we also manufacture products that

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.859 
easy we also manufacture products that
compliment<00:01:26.159> our<00:01:26.310> wiring<00:01:26.549> harnesses<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.659> we

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
compliment our wiring harnesses so we

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
compliment our wiring harnesses so we
have<00:01:28.049> connector<00:01:28.530> plates<00:01:28.799> that'll<00:01:29.310> make<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
have connector plates that'll make the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.219 
have connector plates that'll make the
harness<00:01:30.119> look<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.780> good<00:01:30.990> all

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
harness look really really good all

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.630 
harness look really really good all
cutting<00:01:31.560> through<00:01:31.740> firewalls<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.610> a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
cutting through firewalls we have a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.030 
cutting through firewalls we have a
version<00:01:33.000> two<00:01:33.329> radiator<00:01:33.869> now<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
version two radiator now it's like a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.410 
version two radiator now it's like a
tough<00:01:35.340> design<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:35.939> could<00:01:36.060> fit<00:01:36.210> underneath

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
tough design that could fit underneath

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600 
tough design that could fit underneath
the<00:01:36.570> core<00:01:36.810> support<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> dual<00:01:37.799> pass<00:01:38.100> design

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the core support it's a dual pass design

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.120 
the core support it's a dual pass design
so<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> water<00:01:39.509> will<00:01:39.720> come<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.140> it'll<00:01:40.860> cool

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so the water will come in it'll cool

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.389 
so the water will come in it'll cool
it'll<00:01:41.759> go<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.390> tank<00:01:42.750> cool<00:01:43.680> again<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it'll go down this tank cool again and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.260 
it'll go down this tank cool again and
then

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
then

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.350 
then
so<00:01:45.900> this<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.590> radiator<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.000> three

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so this little radiator it's a three

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.260 
so this little radiator it's a three
inch<00:01:48.540> thickness<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:50.159> has<00:01:50.460> maximum

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
inch thickness and it has maximum

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.810 
inch thickness and it has maximum
cooling<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.930> its<00:01:52.079> size<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.460> look<00:01:53.670> at

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
cooling for its size also they look at

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.399 
cooling for its size also they look at
