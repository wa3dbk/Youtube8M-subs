00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.010
 room the room equey the welcome time 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.270
 the best place in the world but who 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.460
 is the place to be cep which saves his 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.019
 I'm sick and I hope that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 you are ready because today we 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.880
 will literally destroy his arms on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.920
 going this clause is the king muscle so 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.809
 it's gone in all there will be six exo 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 three eps currencies and three triceps 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.649
 like you're going to do super 7 for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.570
 to make simple basically you go 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.280
 chain an exo for the ebit and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.170
 directly without taking time from 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.940
 rest an exo for the writing is a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.129
 method that saves time and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.480
 that endurance but behind people 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.430
 you go especially before the pressure 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.530
 from before the arms even more huge 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.420
 even more massive even drier 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.390
 hashtag little finger of the biceps 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.079
 anyway I will put the program 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.760
 in the description 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.829
 so we start at the entrance with 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.260
 heart the supine bottom with the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.390
 coxswain help we will continue with 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.310
 of the Bar on this exercise which will be 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 important to control your movement 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.909
 no need to put so mikio on the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.590
 bar the biceps and triceps are 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.750
 small muscles the most important will be 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.549
 to be in the exo own novel without helping himself 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.930
 from his back like an asshole after small 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.549
 advice I gave you when you 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.310
 have started your training especially 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.930
 especially keep your jacket on you 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.790
 give would have cost me that's important 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.920
 at the beginning of the training your arms are not 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.960
 not yet ready to dazzle the room 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.280
 but as soon as you have done two three 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.170
 series that you will begin to be 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.509
 congested and see your muscles getting 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.340
 gorging with blood that precise moment and 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.210
 not before you will be able to reread 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.840
 your jacket and show people that you 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.320
 process yesterday that you are the one she 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.180
 chose and you are the ones 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.970
 biceps to govern them all 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.890
 biceps to find concepts 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.890
 kosaner in the darkness and the winger 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.660
 Powerful sl is possible its debut 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:20.730
 fifteen years in who then with the dish 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.520
 resistance 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.590
 omni we have heart scott wash 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.900
 dyed chained with looks me 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.270
 sleep in a hurry thinking about controlling your 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.420
 movement and down gently and 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.190
 think about sticking your triceps on two 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.080
 then three exercises you go 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.080
 work your biceps spade 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.570

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.570
 white welcomes the lighthouse of Alexandria and 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.130
 which is the eiffel tower of the years but 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.690
 especially tell you well one thing is 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.060
 not where the little ones look first 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.000
 the charm the look the smile the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.489
 tenderness in a man and revo from 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.830
 from now your arms will become the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.630
 most important part of our body 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.100
 or and sir I say yes when you 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.690

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.310

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.560

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.510
 not expect you do 42 dry arm

 on the other hand attention the little more it is 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.870
 that you have to do these movements in 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.970
 iso so when you're in contraction 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.290

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.230
 in order to use all your muscles 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.800

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.450
 to progress well 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.300
