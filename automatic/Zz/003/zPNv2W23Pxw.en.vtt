00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
this right here then about right here

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.849 
this right here then about right here
probably<00:02:37.010> about<00:02:37.189> halfway<00:02:37.549> through<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.859> that

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
probably about halfway through it that

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.360 
probably about halfway through it that
right<00:02:40.069> there<00:02:40.310> I'll<00:02:40.519> cut<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.389> off<00:02:42.189> well<00:02:43.189> let's

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
right there I'll cut that off well let's

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.479 
right there I'll cut that off well let's
see<00:02:43.579> how<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.819> looks<00:02:43.969> on<00:02:44.329> your<00:02:44.510> first<00:02:45.280> mate<00:02:46.280> cut

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
see how it looks on your first mate cut

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.599 
see how it looks on your first mate cut
it<00:02:46.609> too<00:02:46.790> short<00:02:47.530> yeah<00:02:48.530> i<00:02:48.560> make<00:02:48.919> her<00:02:48.950> too<00:02:49.159> short

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
it too short yeah i make her too short

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.179 
it too short yeah i make her too short
so<00:02:49.730> that'll<00:02:50.120> probably<00:02:50.359> doesn't<00:02:50.989> trash<00:02:51.319> all

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
so that'll probably doesn't trash all

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.170 
so that'll probably doesn't trash all

the tubing a bunch of people like to put

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.830 
the tubing a bunch of people like to put
the<00:04:10.320> trailer<00:04:11.320> hook<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:12.760> they<00:04:13.090> can<00:04:13.360> move<00:04:13.510> freely

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
the trailer hook so they can move freely

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
tubing will not really work for that so

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.370
