00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
 offroad trophy and in the game you can set 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.060

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.410
 as well as other cars but they 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.660
 will be available only because of the gaming day 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.969
 and who can you on a drop of each 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.360
 surname certain parameters which 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.600
 will affect the game itself we will 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.980
 ride on different levels yourself in 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.809
 This make sure and assessments that if the game 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.399
 provides let's wait for it 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.489
 boot up here it loaded 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.120
 here's our car on the left side 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.550
 map is shown yes we can this is a book 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.440
 backwater slow down also have everything 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.100
 parameters of life and gasoline which we have 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.949
 gradually 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.930
 but it ends beyond that we can have 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.780
 the camera's are like this here so that's 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.510
 up to 3 cameras it turns out 4 cameras 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.970
 5 cameras and here 6 is the camera 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.830
 interestingly interesting such 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.070
 januar car simulator can 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 Mataji we drive ourselves as we want 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.710
 and sometimes the camera is not friends so to speak 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.930
 She here is this just kind of such was another 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.119
 level is quite well done than 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.860
 I do not like what they level 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.659
 after all, they appear and gradually as 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.810
 only we are approaching i understand what it is 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.240
 made to reduce carry 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.880
 load up 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.060
 our processors are our phone and crying. 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.220
 it looks like something is very not very not 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.280
 don't like this and enough 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.259
 interesting interesting race for various 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.960
 off-road racing where we can 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.810
 ride yourself and enjoy these 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.729
 tracks that are present here as 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.560
 I understand you need to get there but local 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.110
 another but I did not become here I just decided 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.360

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.430
 simulator then this game is for you about 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.120
 Plus I will say that it is quite convenient 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.799
 management of such and such a political hiccups 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.600

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.440
 water of course in general a complete joke 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.650
