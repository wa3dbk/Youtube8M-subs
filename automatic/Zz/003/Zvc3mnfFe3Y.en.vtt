springboard which really makes it cool

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
springboard which really makes it cool
because<00:01:41.159> these<00:01:41.460> icons<00:01:41.880> are<00:01:42.060> they're<00:01:42.360> smaller

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
because these icons are they're smaller

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.859 
because these icons are they're smaller
than<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> usual<00:01:43.409> size<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.939> allows<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
than the usual size and this allows it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.870 
than the usual size and this allows it
to<00:01:45.899> look<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.350> cool<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:46.799> these<00:01:47.009> those<00:01:47.670> two

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
