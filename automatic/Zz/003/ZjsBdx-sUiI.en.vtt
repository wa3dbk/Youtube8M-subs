00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.350
 Look, I consider myself very happy . 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 I do and and to be living what I'm 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.070
 living I do not even know if I call it 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.340
 work I call this an experience 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.010
 but so that I of my resignation 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.800
 employment and decides to undertake this addition 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.530
 knows how to do this with people who 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.250
 the same ideals that I never 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.900
 I repented 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.570
 Our idea was that we dreamed about 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.430
 this here that the city because the city 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
 sao paulo needed neighborhood needed 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.629
 of this change one of the ideas also by 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.190
 behind the dust is this there for the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.980
 people you can do differently 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.589
 follow your dream earn a living from 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.300
 noble use companies because companies 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.550
 interviews with cyclists 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.949
 I was more at explaining what he 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 would have to do and that's one more thing 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 so robotic and thus tends to meet 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.850
 so this has to be said so you have 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.650
 that I got so caught up I had a lot of 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.240
 It's very late 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.340
 I lost count of the day I had to 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.170
 get out in the rain because if you do not see 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
 first we do is count as the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.240
 company was created because it was 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.210
 created more than one is an athlete and 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.909
 pedal time 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.860
 one is he needs to identify with 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.110
 this shows another differential today in 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.820
 15 for a long time almost anything 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.100
 missing almost an hour late 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.250
 the guy already identifies himself there is easy 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.360
 logical test training and it passes 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.360
 This image on Twitter 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.950
 What shaped just was this is a 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.090
 actual absurd to their values and that 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.090
 It's the family face. 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.360
 your type goes down and gives me a tip 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:54.580
 would be to start learning to us 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.580
 begin to go after the dream
