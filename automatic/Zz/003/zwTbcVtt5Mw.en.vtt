00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.460
 some settings a little bit 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:14.210

 further scrolls down the page to 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:38.300
 light drag right side and here it is 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.620
 here is the link template we click on it 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.160
 opens a lot of settings 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:59.839
 hyip instead of the show and you can apply 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.230
 see what happens turn on 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:07.700
 our site as we see we have here 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.939
 Letters index, that is, Yandex and clicks 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.030
 on which and some letters we will have 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.390
 fall out 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.579
 so-called goods to the letter 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.509
 and I can not cubes but we have so far only 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.840
 bmw and 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.229
 key if you do not want you 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.689
 It was shown in letters or by the way 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.930
 that's what we did now 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:36.409
 took the letter index so go to 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.229
 kia cars 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.159
 click update and as we see with us 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.009
 there is no alphabetic top 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.729
 if we go into the directory itself 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.270
 cars 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.450
 then we have an alphabetic index and if 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.000
 we will go cars bmw fireboxes index 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.760
 also available 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.229
 we go further that us here 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.659
 This column interests here 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.709
 worth global 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.989
 If you uncheck it, you can see that 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.520
 global we have two elements also 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.470
 we can draw a conclusion on 3 elements 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.200
 let's apply and see what we have 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.060
 happened 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.040
 go to our website anthem important 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.810
 remove car kia 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.769
 because we were setting 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.040
 directly category cars kia 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.580
 and we see here that we now have a conclusion 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.100
 elements of three 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:54.200
 you can also do and almost go to 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:54.200
 administer template 4 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.190
 click apply go to our website 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.570
 click update and we see that we 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.520
 four elements 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:16.690
 here in a row but it is not always convenient 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:18.450
 somehow not very visible I prefer 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.910
 to have two 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.330
 by in this site such a withdrawal option 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.150
 Looks much more beautiful exactly 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.640
 on this site and so on 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.700
 here you can also edit this 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.830
 that when we go in some particular 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.650
 trivia element 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:44.170
 venga then you can not go back 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.390
 visitor will be in this category kia 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.850
 This can be easily corrected for this. 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.850
 we go again his administration 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.320
 so close 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.320
 Next, click on the gear 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:07.920
 then product catalog and familiar path 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.920
 We conclude from the patterns 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.590
 further here we will need to take here 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:23.050
 this is the category field 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:29.970
 and drag it out of here not sweaty 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:32.740
 and then click on it to apply 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:37.720
 back to our site click 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:41.440
 update and now visitors are available 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.920
 the ability to move an item to 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:48.340
 the category of this item is very 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.770
 conveniently happens and so we created two 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.490
 categories cars kia tammim bil and 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.470
 gmb and created four elements of each 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.160
 from categories 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:03.190
 but after that the site began to look empty 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.380
 because on the main page directory 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.810
 cars were just two categories 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.270
 and so I decided to create more 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.410
 two categories and another 4 cars 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.840
 each of them often looks like this 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.590
 there is a catalog of cars in it four 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.710
 categories 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.150
 nissan mitsubishi kia cars 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:29.530
 and cars dmb category nissan me 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.680
 for now two more cars about category 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:35.360
 mitsubishi but 4 cars 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.910
 i recommend you do the same 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.639
 because further it is very us 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:46.120
 need let's see what there 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:49.490
 there are items from mitsubishi cars 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.270
 this mitsubishi and with x mitsubishi eclipse 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.680
 mitsubishi lancer mitsubishi outlander a 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:06:00.860
 and from nissan cars 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.370
 this 350z is nissan gt-r 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.919
 these are nissan juke and nissan qashqai which 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.050
 I will now create while I 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.229
 create you create and all the rest 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.229
 items
