00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:11.819 
six inches and we're going to put a down

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:17.269 
six inches and we're going to put a down
in<00:01:13.549> each<00:01:14.549> hole<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.439> guess<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.859> of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.069> key

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:17.279 
in each hole and I guess one of the key

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.219 
in each hole and I guess one of the key
things<00:01:18.149> to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:18.539> we're<00:01:18.719> drilling<00:01:18.959> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
things to do when we're drilling the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.440 
things to do when we're drilling the
holes<00:01:19.679> were<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.249> kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.579> alternate<00:01:21.029> as<00:01:21.270> we

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
holes were to kind of alternate as we

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:30.070 
holes were to kind of alternate as we
went<00:01:21.599> around

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.270 

I'm<00:01:31.080> mashing<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.549> block<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.360> beeswax<00:01:34.280> this

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I'm mashing up a block of beeswax this

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.370 
I'm mashing up a block of beeswax this
will<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.520> melted<00:01:35.700> down<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.540> paint<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> ends<00:01:37.229> of

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
will be melted down to paint the ends of

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.540 
will be melted down to paint the ends of
the<00:01:37.470> logs<00:01:37.680> painting<00:01:38.610> wax<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.150> top<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
the logs painting wax on top of the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:49.100 
the logs painting wax on top of the
plugs<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.009> other<00:01:46.159> spores<00:01:47.659> don't<00:01:48.659> get<00:01:48.960> in

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
plugs so that other spores don't get in

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.320 
plugs so that other spores don't get in
and<00:01:49.380> contaminate<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:51.060> also<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.600> keep<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
and contaminate and also to keep the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.499 
and contaminate and also to keep the
moisture<00:01:54.330> inside<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.290> log<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:57.750> this

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
moisture inside the log so that this

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.760 
moisture inside the log so that this
shitake<00:02:00.509> spores<00:02:00.840> will<00:02:01.050> have<00:02:01.170> lots<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.560> nice

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
shitake spores will have lots of nice

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.919 
shitake spores will have lots of nice
wet<00:02:02.100> stuff<00:02:02.929> inside<00:02:04.160> to<00:02:05.160> feed<00:02:05.369> off<00:02:05.550> of<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> now

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
wet stuff inside to feed off of so now

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.940 
wet stuff inside to feed off of so now
log<00:02:07.320> has<00:02:07.619> been<00:02:08.209> drilled<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.479> plugged<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.320> wax

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
log has been drilled and plugged and wax

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.240 
log has been drilled and plugged and wax
and<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.360> we're<00:02:12.510> going<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.810> do<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.739> to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
and so now what we're going to do is to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.140 
and so now what we're going to do is to
put<00:02:14.910> these<00:02:15.620> in<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.860> moist<00:02:18.739> shady<00:02:20.150> place

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
put these in a moist shady place

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.430 
put these in a moist shady place
shiitakes<00:02:22.019> are<00:02:22.260> sort<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:23.150> challenged<00:02:24.150> in

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
shiitakes are sort of challenged in

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.440 
shiitakes are sort of challenged in
competing<00:02:25.440> with<00:02:25.590> native<00:02:26.459> competitor<00:02:27.060> fungi

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
competing with native competitor fungi

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660 
competing with native competitor fungi
so<00:02:27.750> they'll<00:02:27.959> keep<00:02:28.650> these<00:02:28.800> off<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.130> ground<00:02:29.370> and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
so they'll keep these off the ground and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.300 
so they'll keep these off the ground and
we're<00:02:30.209> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.450> stack<00:02:30.959> them<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.500> put<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.160> in

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
we're going to stack them so put them in

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.069 
we're going to stack them so put them in
sort<00:02:32.579> of<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.760> wood<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.150> setting<00:02:33.660> thinking

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
sort of a wood like setting thinking

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.390 
sort of a wood like setting thinking
about<00:02:34.260> where<00:02:34.440> mushrooms<00:02:34.920> would<00:02:35.100> grow

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
about where mushrooms would grow

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.270 
about where mushrooms would grow
naturally<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:37.140> putting<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.590> tarp<00:02:37.829> some

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
naturally and then putting a tarp some

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.880 
naturally and then putting a tarp some
sort<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.579> burlap<00:02:39.320> natural<00:02:40.320> permeable

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
sort of burlap natural permeable

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.069 
sort of burlap natural permeable

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
material over the top of them will help

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.009 
material over the top of them will help
to<00:02:43.200> control<00:02:43.320> humidity<00:02:44.100> fluctuations<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.600> to

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
to control humidity fluctuations and to

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.250 
to control humidity fluctuations and to
keep<00:02:46.170> them<00:02:46.410> fairly<00:02:47.130> moist<00:02:47.510> if<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:49.019> end<00:02:49.170> up

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
keep them fairly moist if we end up

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.840 
keep them fairly moist if we end up
getting<00:02:49.380> really<00:02:49.650> dry<00:02:50.010> season<00:02:50.489> they<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:50.730> be

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
getting really dry season they can be

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.390 
getting really dry season they can be
watered<00:02:51.239> during<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.900> season<00:02:52.260> as<00:02:52.380> well<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:53.190> use

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
watered during the season as well we use

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.080 
watered during the season as well we use
some<00:02:53.850> maple<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.570> alder<00:02:55.100> the<00:02:56.100> alder<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.760> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
some maple and alder the alder is a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.020 
some maple and alder the alder is a
little<00:02:57.570> bit<00:02:57.720> less<00:02:58.019> dense<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.010> hardwood<00:02:59.400> so

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
little bit less dense of a hardwood so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.630 
little bit less dense of a hardwood so
that<00:03:00.329> Oprah<00:03:00.660> can<00:03:00.870> be<00:03:01.079> six<00:03:01.920> months<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.430> one<00:03:02.610> year

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
that Oprah can be six months to one year

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640 
that Oprah can be six months to one year
so<00:03:03.329> if<00:03:03.450> they're<00:03:03.630> not<00:03:03.660> fruiting<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.440> fall

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
so if they're not fruiting in the fall

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.920 
so if they're not fruiting in the fall
then<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.310> would<00:03:05.459> expect<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.970> see<00:03:06.150> some<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.660> those

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
then I would expect to see some on those

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.490 
then I would expect to see some on those
this<00:03:07.920> time<00:03:08.190> next<00:03:08.430> year<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.570> maple<00:03:09.720> I

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
this time next year and the maple I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.479 
this time next year and the maple I
would<00:03:11.040> expect<00:03:11.400> for<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.750> year-plus<00:03:12.750> alder<00:03:13.680> being

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
would expect for a year-plus alder being

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.120 
would expect for a year-plus alder being
a<00:03:14.579> less<00:03:14.820> dense<00:03:15.120> hardwood<00:03:15.510> as<00:03:15.750> well<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:17.040> know

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
a less dense hardwood as well you know

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.069 
a less dense hardwood as well you know
they<00:03:17.310> could<00:03:17.489> last<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.299> three-year<00:03:18.660> range

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
they could last in the three-year range

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.670 
they could last in the three-year range
give<00:03:19.530> or<00:03:19.650> take<00:03:20.060> maple<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> little<00:03:21.570> denser<00:03:22.380> of

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
give or take maple is a little denser of

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.699 
give or take maple is a little denser of
a<00:03:22.799> wood<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.280> those<00:03:23.850> logs<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.299> also<00:03:24.840> thicker

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
a wood and those logs are also thicker

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.220 
a wood and those logs are also thicker
diameter<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:27.120> while<00:03:27.329> they<00:03:27.480> might<00:03:27.660> take<00:03:27.930> longer

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
diameter so while they might take longer

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.550 
diameter so while they might take longer
to<00:03:28.890> fruit<00:03:29.190> they<00:03:29.970> may<00:03:30.150> last<00:03:30.390> five<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.959> six<00:03:31.200> years

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
to fruit they may last five to six years

and<00:03:41.730> something<00:03:42.730> that's<00:03:42.760> very<00:03:42.970> important

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
and something that's very important

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.520 
and something that's very important
vitamin<00:03:44.290> D<00:03:44.610> there's<00:03:45.610> actually<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.030> way<00:03:46.180> to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
vitamin D there's actually a way to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.900 
vitamin D there's actually a way to
increase<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.860> amount<00:03:48.160> of<00:03:48.310> vitamin<00:03:48.520> D<00:03:48.760> that

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
increase the amount of vitamin D that

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.300 
increase the amount of vitamin D that
the<00:03:49.240> mushroom<00:03:49.570> has<00:03:49.780> by<00:03:50.530> taking<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.980> shiitake

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
the mushroom has by taking the shiitake

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.600 
the mushroom has by taking the shiitake
mushroom<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.050> leaving<00:03:53.050> it<00:03:53.200> gills<00:03:54.100> side<00:03:54.400> up

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
mushroom and leaving it gills side up

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.190 
mushroom and leaving it gills side up
after<00:03:54.940> you've<00:03:55.060> harvested<00:03:55.240> it<00:03:55.660> either<00:03:55.840> fresh

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
after you've harvested it either fresh

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.760 
after you've harvested it either fresh
or<00:03:56.230> dry<00:03:56.740> put<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:57.670> gills<00:03:57.910> up<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.570> expose<00:03:59.530> them

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
or dry put the gills up and expose them

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.460 
or dry put the gills up and expose them
to<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.010> sunlight<00:04:00.430> for<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> day<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.510> if<00:04:02.350> they

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
to the sunlight for a day and if they

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.610 
to the sunlight for a day and if they
are<00:04:02.620> able<00:04:02.740> to<00:04:02.980> absorb<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:04.450> sunlight<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:05.050> it

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
are able to absorb the sunlight and it

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.070 
are able to absorb the sunlight and it
activates<00:04:06.250> more<00:04:06.850> of<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.210> vitamin<00:04:07.600> D<00:04:07.720> within

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
activates more of the vitamin D within

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.460 
activates more of the vitamin D within
them<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.740> you're<00:04:08.860> getting<00:04:09.070> a<00:04:09.130> more<00:04:09.340> potent

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
them so you're getting a more potent

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.580 
them so you're getting a more potent
dose<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.860> vitamin<00:04:12.340> D<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:12.790> way<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.590> I

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
dose of vitamin D in that way and I

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.090 
dose of vitamin D in that way and I
think<00:04:15.100> it's<00:04:15.430> 10<00:04:15.760> grams<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.540> dried<00:04:17.100> shiitakes

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
think it's 10 grams of dried shiitakes

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.280 
think it's 10 grams of dried shiitakes
in<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.609> way<00:04:18.790> will<00:04:19.510> provide<00:04:19.780> all<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:20.109> your

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
in that way will provide all of your

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.120 
in that way will provide all of your
vitamin<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:20.830> for<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.100> week<00:04:22.230> so<00:04:23.230> it's<00:04:23.830> pretty

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
vitamin to you for a week so it's pretty

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.910 
vitamin to you for a week so it's pretty
potent
