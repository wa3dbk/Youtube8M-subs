00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello how are you good today we are going to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.820
 work on a collage that is already a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.320
 little advanced we always get to this 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.969
 instance of color work is a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 a matter of time then I thought 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.800
 interesting that they see how to follow something 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.900
 that is already in this instance yes and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.029
 also so that they understand this started 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.539
 with acrylic and some paper for 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 papers with different visual textures 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 then understand that it is nothing more than 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.350
 that step that is not the previous of the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.820
 papers up the acrylic and that's where it ended 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.800
 quietly above this I continue 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.000
 working with textures with others 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.870
 roles in this case I chose this kind of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.390
 papers 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.710
 corrugated 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.809
 of colors because they have to do with the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.850
 palette that works in the box if these 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.920
 they get them in different colors 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.410
 that you need in this case 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.780
 they are not drawn by hand but rather 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.850
 Cut them with scissors because the precise 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.860
 as a pretty precise line because my 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.960
 work already started already has line 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.940
 then this comes to accompany the work 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.830
 and also so that they understand that each 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.650
 Once I enter the box with the element 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.050
 that is what I have to do in the way 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.690
 composed that I have been saying that 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.790
 work always then if I want 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.700
 incorporate a new element so heavy 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.430
 visually like this cardboard I can not 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.619
 throw it at random by any of the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.560
 sides of my paintings and if I would 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.970
 would make me have a lot more work on 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.340
 of the box if I already have a 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.570
 armed composition and a tour is 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.320
 good that this comes to accompany 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.420
 then for example I cut a piece 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.770
 to apply in this sector of the table 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.310
 yes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.470
 and step tapo or silence some area 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.930
 where it is not very potable in the work and not 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.170
 I'm hurting the opposite 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.730
 doubt not with the application in this case 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.730
 the part of the cardboard and applied it 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.060
 with a little pressure this is going to 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.350
 grab very easy has paper underneath and 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.450
 this is cardboard what we are applying 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.420
 Here begins the tour of the box in 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.790
 this case the route of the red color 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.030
 then I keep pulling lines in my work 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.020
 and I notice where those can serve me 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.060
 Red lines 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.310
 I read the lines of the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.830
 picture so I can lean on this 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.780
 would come in handy I would not also throw a 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.670
 in red here or here would be 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.980
 loose would be detached from the work 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.890
 then a good reading of the picture 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.270
 would be to put it here to apply it here 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.270
 if I'm going to keep this one 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.980
 and I chose these corrugated cards because 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.930
 if I do not know if you get to see they have already 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.390
 applied to the work some papers with a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.190
 visual texture as if it were corrugated 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.720
 then they come to appreciate it here 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.080
 these are also papers that have 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.900
 texture here there is also a kind of 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.780
 blind then here also in this 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.819
 face I have a set of lines then 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.540
 what I apply I apply it taking in 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.239
 account that too 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.280
 if I overdo it with the tail I apply 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.440
 have a problem because this is dry and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.720
 transparent 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.480
 just like I do when I give brushstrokes 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.590
 the application in the element collage 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.540
 what I am applying has to be 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.620
 varied also then I play with 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.150
 sizes with directions if this would be 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.520
 a brush stroke that started here 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.260
 red continues and comes from this side a lot 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.660
 smaller like when we do 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.530
 in acrylic or in oil or in the material 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.940
 that we are working 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.430
 that way I follow 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.640
 pulling 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.640
 lines in this red you can use this other 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.680
 and we will also add others in this 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.980
 well brown tone that has to do 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.319
 also with the palette that I use 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.090
 play to not completely cover the texture 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.340
 that they have below let her glimpse a 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.349
 little and if I'm going to cover I'm going to cover what 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.349
 less fiber I use the work 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.860
 we can incorporate some other can 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.479
 that these papers that I am applying to me 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.520
 they are directing to the work they are 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.220
 giving more character to the addresses that 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.980
 they were already with the acrylic on 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.410
 only 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.020
 if I played this way with the paper that 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.690
 I cut it the cardboard could do the same 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.100
 in another sector of the table to integrate 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.100
 that gesture 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.240
 It seems simple when you put it 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.980
 thus raised the issue is when one is 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.500
 searching and composing remember that no 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.780
 we are copying any box the 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.139
 understand it from 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.780
 the way that I have to accompany and 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.610
 if I played with this so that appears 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.770
 on the other hand if I played with fine lines 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.990
 that there are other thinner ones in other 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.419
 addresses all that adds up to the 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.569
 composition of the work have it well 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.429
 I presented 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.429
 let's throw another line here 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.470
 and on top of this I obviously can 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.539
 keep pulling some others 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.509
 small cartons but I want to show you 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:36.479
 also how to start in turn to 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:39.389
 mute a little background then to 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.169
 your time to add papers in this 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.169
 cartons case 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.190
 I start now to silence a little more that 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.190
 background if I had to touch any 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.720
 piece of cardboard or support the painting not 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.150
 there is no problem they do not have to be left 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.389
 posts if the work asks for it and I have 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.700
 than to throw a brush stroke over it 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:08.030
 I do without any problem 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.980
 I take out what does not work for me in the box or 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.410
 at least what intuitively 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.090
 it does not lead me to anything favorable in the 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.280
 good work in this way can 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.710
 continue moving forward and taking out some 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.560
 graphics that do not serve us and good the 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.410
 idea was to show them a little how to give 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.180
 a turn of greater thread something that I already 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.520
 I have a little mastered collage and 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.180
 acrylic then how to deepen it a 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.730
 a little more 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.010
 adding very different elements to it 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.640
 this case with many corrugated paper 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.640
 thanks see you
