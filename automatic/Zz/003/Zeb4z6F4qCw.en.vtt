00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
taking Sam profile and play a track

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.359 
taking Sam profile and play a track
which<00:01:40.250> is<00:01:40.400> very<00:01:40.670> demanding<00:01:41.180> lots<00:01:41.869> and<00:01:42.080> lots<00:01:42.200> of

frequency changes quick bass lines quick
punches<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.590> we'll<00:01:45.830> see<00:01:45.979> how<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.610> sounds<00:01:47.150> and

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
punches and we'll see how it sounds and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:02:39.619 
punches and we'll see how it sounds and
how<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.509> keeps<00:01:47.660> up

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.880 

brain<00:02:40.629> pressure<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.140> let's<00:02:41.319> see<00:02:41.440> how<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.739> plays

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
brain pressure so let's see how it plays

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.070 
brain pressure so let's see how it plays
a<00:02:42.010> little<00:02:42.129> bit<00:02:42.370> decaf<00:02:42.790> add<00:02:43.030> some<00:02:43.599> ice<00:02:43.720> slowly

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
a little bit decaf add some ice slowly

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.750 
a little bit decaf add some ice slowly
baseline<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:44.890> see<00:02:45.099> if<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.250> can<00:02:45.400> keep<00:02:45.580> up<00:02:45.730> with

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
baseline and see if you can keep up with
