in<00:00:51.940> here<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:52.300> can't<00:00:52.539> see<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.870> but<00:00:52.989> there's<00:00:53.109> a

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
in here you can't see it but there's a

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.950 
in here you can't see it but there's a
can<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.859> what<00:00:54.699> this<00:00:54.850> cam<00:00:55.090> does<00:00:55.359> is<00:00:55.600> it<00:00:55.750> takes

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
can and what this cam does is it takes

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.410 
can and what this cam does is it takes
this<00:00:56.920> motion<00:00:57.460> which<00:00:57.730> you're<00:00:57.940> familiar<00:00:58.090> with

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
this motion which you're familiar with

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.720 
this motion which you're familiar with
when<00:00:58.750> you<00:00:58.840> tighten<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.260> lever<00:00:59.519> this<00:01:00.519> is<00:01:00.699> a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
when you tighten the lever this is a

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.150 
when you tighten the lever this is a
rotational<00:01:01.480> motion<00:01:01.660> like<00:01:02.019> that<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.320> it

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
rotational motion like that and it

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.790 
rotational motion like that and it
translates<00:01:03.910> it<00:01:04.150> into<00:01:04.300> making<00:01:04.930> this<00:01:05.379> piece

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
translates it into making this piece

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.430 
translates it into making this piece
which<00:01:06.760> is<00:01:06.790> up<00:01:07.030> against<00:01:07.390> your<00:01:07.510> fork<00:01:07.750> blade<00:01:07.960> move

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
which is up against your fork blade move

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.670 
which is up against your fork blade move
this<00:01:08.740> way<00:01:09.010> so<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.600> do<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.260> tighten

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
this way so that you do this to tighten

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.860 
this way so that you do this to tighten
this<00:01:12.160> moves<00:01:12.460> this<00:01:12.700> way<00:01:12.970> everything<00:01:13.600> stays

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
this moves this way everything stays

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.960 
this moves this way everything stays
tight<00:01:14.170> now<00:01:15.010> it's<00:01:15.130> not<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.280> whole<00:01:15.490> lot<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.700> motion

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
tight now it's not a whole lot of motion

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.460 
tight now it's not a whole lot of motion
just<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.420> give<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:16.660> an<00:01:16.780> idea<00:01:17.020> let's<00:01:17.230> take<00:01:17.439> a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
just to give you an idea let's take a

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.740 
just to give you an idea let's take a
ruler<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.970> spring<00:01:19.299> out<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.630> way

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
ruler get the spring out of the way

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.749 
ruler get the spring out of the way
we're<00:01:19.869> going<00:01:19.900> to<00:01:20.049> put<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.259> ruler<00:01:20.590> here<00:01:20.920> got<00:01:21.640> it

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
we're going to put the ruler here got it

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.380 
we're going to put the ruler here got it
parallel<00:01:22.270> with<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.600> space<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:24.759> I<00:01:24.939> do<00:01:25.000> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.389 

see<00:01:28.390> this<00:01:28.600> face<00:01:28.869> moving<00:01:29.259> in<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.770> out<00:01:29.829> it's<00:01:30.130> not

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
see this face moving in and out it's not

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.270 
see this face moving in and out it's not
very<00:01:30.729> much<00:01:31.079> boy<00:01:32.079> maybe<00:01:32.409> about<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.740> millimeter

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
very much boy maybe about a millimeter

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.149 
very much boy maybe about a millimeter
or<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:33.759> but<00:01:34.659> that<00:01:34.869> little<00:01:35.229> bit<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.439> movement<00:01:35.740> is

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
or so but that little bit of movement is

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.030 
or so but that little bit of movement is
you<00:01:36.310> rotate<00:01:36.549> and<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.990> moves<00:01:38.290> this<00:01:38.500> way<00:01:38.770> is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
you rotate and it moves this way is

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.910 
you rotate and it moves this way is
enough<00:01:39.790> if<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.329> is<00:01:40.479> properly<00:01:40.930> adjusted<00:01:41.530> to

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
enough if this is properly adjusted to

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.289 
enough if this is properly adjusted to
make<00:01:42.009> sure<00:01:42.219> your<00:01:42.399> front<00:01:42.579> wheel<00:01:42.790> doesn't<00:01:43.030> fall

got the wheel in the and the fort now
all<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.009> adjustments<00:01:57.700> in<00:01:57.789> terms<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:58.240> how

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
all the adjustments in terms of how

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.300 
all the adjustments in terms of how
tight<00:01:58.630> or<00:01:58.659> loose<00:01:58.810> things<00:01:59.259> are<00:01:59.530> are<00:01:59.860> going<00:02:00.250> to

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
tight or loose things are are going to

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.520 
tight or loose things are are going to
be<00:02:00.430> made<00:02:00.640> over<00:02:00.969> here<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.450> lot<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.049> times<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.380> see

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
be made over here a lot of times you see

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.170 
be made over here a lot of times you see
people<00:02:02.740> doing<00:02:03.009> things<00:02:03.310> like<00:02:03.399> twirl<00:02:03.789> in<00:02:04.030> this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
people doing things like twirl in this

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.330 
people doing things like twirl in this
around<00:02:04.539> don't<00:02:05.259> do<00:02:05.409> this<00:02:05.619> make<00:02:06.189> your

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
around don't do this make your

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.460 
around don't do this make your
adjustments<00:02:06.880> over<00:02:07.149> here<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:08.110> want<00:02:08.320> to

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
adjustments over here you want to

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.590 
adjustments over here you want to
tighten<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.100> to<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.430> point<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.030> as<00:02:10.330> you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
tighten this to the point that as you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.950 
tighten this to the point that as you
start<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.020> rotate<00:02:11.230> this<00:02:11.590> lever<00:02:12.240> once<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.600> isn't

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
start to rotate this lever once it isn't

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.310 
start to rotate this lever once it isn't
90<00:02:14.410> degrees<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> fork<00:02:15.430> blade<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.930> start

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
90 degrees to the fork blade you start

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.130 
90 degrees to the fork blade you start
to<00:02:17.500> feel<00:02:17.740> some<00:02:17.980> resistance<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:19.750> when<00:02:20.020> you

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
to feel some resistance that's when you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.390 
to feel some resistance that's when you
know<00:02:20.260> you've<00:02:20.440> got<00:02:20.560> things<00:02:20.770> adjusted<00:02:21.370> just

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
know you've got things adjusted just

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.119 
know you've got things adjusted just
right<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.230> when<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.470> reach<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.860> point

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
right so when you reach that point

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.160 
right so when you reach that point
you've<00:02:24.430> got<00:02:24.610> resistance<00:02:24.910> here

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
you've got resistance here

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.199 
you've got resistance here
I<00:02:26.230> usually<00:02:26.740> do<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.069> with<00:02:27.130> my<00:02:27.459> fingers<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
I usually do this with my fingers on the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.809 
I usually do this with my fingers on the
fork<00:02:28.480> blade<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.560> put<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.860> palm<00:02:30.099> of<00:02:30.370> my<00:02:30.400> hand

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
fork blade and I put the palm of my hand

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.300 
fork blade and I put the palm of my hand
on<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.090> quick-release<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> can<00:02:33.099> use<00:02:33.280> that

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
on the quick-release so I can use that

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.150 
on the quick-release so I can use that
leverage<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.120> tighten<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.540> up<00:02:35.099> now<00:02:36.099> the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
leverage to tighten it up now the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.430 
leverage to tighten it up now the
quick-release<00:02:36.550> is<00:02:37.000> tightened<00:02:37.420> properly<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
quick-release is tightened properly the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.890 
quick-release is tightened properly the
wheel<00:02:38.650> shouldn't<00:02:39.099> fall<00:02:39.250> out<00:02:39.520> I'll<00:02:40.450> tell<00:02:40.750> you

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
wheel shouldn't fall out I'll tell you

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.449 
wheel shouldn't fall out I'll tell you
though<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.680> isn't<00:02:41.980> going<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.130> come<00:02:42.310> off

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
though this isn't going to come off

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.850 
though this isn't going to come off
easily<00:02:43.200> you're<00:02:44.200> not<00:02:44.319> just<00:02:44.530> going<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.709> be<00:02:44.800> able

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
easily you're not just going to be able

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.030 
easily you're not just going to be able
to<00:02:45.010> flip<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.610> easel<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.300> undone

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
to flip this easel and get it undone

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.440 
to flip this easel and get it undone
it's<00:02:48.040> not<00:02:48.250> just<00:02:48.520> friction<00:02:48.790> that's<00:02:49.120> keeping

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
it's not just friction that's keeping

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.940 
it's not just friction that's keeping
stuff<00:02:49.660> in<00:02:49.840> place<00:02:49.959> it's<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.319> fact<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.739> you've

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
stuff in place it's the fact that you've

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.070 
stuff in place it's the fact that you've
kind<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.340> gone<00:02:51.520> let's<00:02:51.880> say<00:02:52.060> pass<00:02:52.360> top<00:02:52.750> dead

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
kind of gone let's say pass top dead

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.960 
kind of gone let's say pass top dead
center<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.280> little<00:02:54.489> camp

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
center on the little camp

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.820 
center on the little camp
remember<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.420> cam<00:02:55.630> we<00:02:55.810> talked<00:02:56.050> about<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.500> here

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
remember the cam we talked about in here

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.650 
remember the cam we talked about in here
and<00:02:56.920> now<00:02:57.519> what<00:02:57.760> you've<00:02:57.910> got<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.209> do<00:02:58.330> is<00:02:58.510> get

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
and now what you've got to do is get

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.350 
and now what you've got to do is get
yourself<00:02:58.810> back<00:02:59.470> over<00:02:59.800> that<00:02:59.980> hump<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.550> order<00:03:01.239> to

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
yourself back over that hump in order to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.750 
yourself back over that hump in order to
undo<00:03:01.569> this<00:03:01.720> quick-release<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.400> takes<00:03:03.640> a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
undo this quick-release so it takes a

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.870 
undo this quick-release so it takes a
fair<00:03:03.970> amount<00:03:04.530> all<00:03:05.530> right<00:03:05.739> once<00:03:06.280> I<00:03:06.430> get<00:03:06.610> over

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
fair amount all right once I get over

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.360 
fair amount all right once I get over
top<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.090> Center<00:03:07.769> then<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:08.890> comes<00:03:09.069> undone

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
top that Center then it comes undone

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.430 
top that Center then it comes undone
really<00:03:09.640> easily<00:03:10.030> there's<00:03:10.840> another<00:03:11.080> check<00:03:11.410> on

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
really easily there's another check on

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.949 
really easily there's another check on
your<00:03:11.739> work<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.250> you're<00:03:12.670> saying<00:03:12.910> well<00:03:13.120> how<00:03:13.750> much

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
your work if you're saying well how much

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.140 
your work if you're saying well how much
is<00:03:14.200> too<00:03:14.830> tight<00:03:15.100> did<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.400> get<00:03:15.610> this<00:03:15.760> too<00:03:15.940> loose

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
is too tight did I get this too loose

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.570 
is too tight did I get this too loose
this<00:03:16.870> goes<00:03:17.110> on<00:03:17.290> really<00:03:17.560> really<00:03:17.650> easily<00:03:18.280> and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
this goes on really really easily and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.699 
this goes on really really easily and
you<00:03:19.269> don't<00:03:19.450> have<00:03:19.569> to<00:03:19.720> work<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.110> get<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.380> undone

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
you don't have to work to get it undone

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.949 
you don't have to work to get it undone
yeah<00:03:21.250> you've<00:03:21.489> got<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.790> too<00:03:21.910> loose<00:03:22.150> because

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
yeah you've got it too loose because

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.020 
yeah you've got it too loose because
tightness<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.769> relative<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.400> all<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.700> us<00:03:24.790> isn't

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
tightness is relative to all of us isn't

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.460 
tightness is relative to all of us isn't
it<00:03:25.239> depending<00:03:25.600> on<00:03:25.690> what<00:03:25.840> our<00:03:25.870> hand<00:03:26.170> strength

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
it depending on what our hand strength

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.860 
it depending on what our hand strength
is<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.890> what<00:03:26.980> our<00:03:27.100> perception<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.840> play<00:03:28.840> with

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
is and what our perception is play with

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.420 
is and what our perception is play with
this<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.200> little<00:03:29.290> bit<00:03:29.500> you'll<00:03:29.860> get<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.190> feel<00:03:30.400> of

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
this a little bit you'll get the feel of

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.569 
this a little bit you'll get the feel of
it<00:03:30.690> very<00:03:31.690> very<00:03:32.109> important<00:03:32.620> very<00:03:32.920> elegant<00:03:33.519> very
