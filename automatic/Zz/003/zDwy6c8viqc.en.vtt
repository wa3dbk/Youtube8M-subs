the turtles talent works wonders I

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.520 
the turtles talent works wonders I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
train a turtle to do that and I thought

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.260 
train a turtle to do that and I thought
that<00:01:42.780> anything<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.320> possible<00:01:44.270> including

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that anything is possible including

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.679 
that anything is possible including
using<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.810> turtle<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> show<00:01:46.470> kids<00:01:46.860> how<00:01:47.689> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
using the turtle to show kids how to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810 
using the turtle to show kids how to
overcome<00:01:49.320> obstacles<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:50.280> dealing<00:01:50.790> with

overcome obstacles like dealing with

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.179 
overcome obstacles like dealing with
divorce<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.229> put<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.530> doll<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.009> back

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189

trained the turtle but it was obvious
when<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.680> came<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.310> he<00:02:21.460> could<00:02:21.670> get<00:02:21.820> the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
when I came in that he could get the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.970 
when I came in that he could get the
turtle<00:02:22.210> to<00:02:22.330> do<00:02:22.480> things<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.530> Ariana

was<00:02:24.160> responding<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.140> turtle<00:02:26.380> the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
was responding like the turtle the

therapy<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.580> move<00:02:27.820> slow<00:02:28.210> but<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.960> end

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.900 
therapy can move slow but in the end
there's<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.500> lesson<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:29.920> even<00:02:30.250> parents<00:02:30.730> can

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.890 
there's a lesson that even parents can
take<00:02:31.120> home<00:02:32.280> rewarding<00:02:33.280> good<00:02:33.310> behavior<00:02:33.900> works
