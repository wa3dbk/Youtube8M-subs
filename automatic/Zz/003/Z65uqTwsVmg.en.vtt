there's no no need for me sure to hold
that<00:06:49.680> a<00:06:49.890> star<00:06:50.430> so<00:06:50.930> even<00:06:51.930> though<00:06:51.960> I<00:06:52.080> was

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 
that a star so even though I was

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.650 
that a star so even though I was
comfortable<00:06:52.470> at<00:06:52.860> the<00:06:52.920> time<00:06:53.160> I<00:06:53.490> let<00:06:54.030> the<00:06:54.180> cap<00:06:54.390> go

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.020 
comfortable at the time I let the cap go
and<00:06:55.050> I<00:06:55.860> think<00:06:56.040> if<00:06:56.220> you<00:06:56.310> watch<00:06:56.460> the<00:06:56.640> footage<00:06:56.910> you

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
and I think if you watch the footage you
