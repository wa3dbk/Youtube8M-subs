so<00:00:00.450> let's<00:00:00.690> get<00:00:00.840> started<00:00:01.170> making<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:02.040> classic

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
so let's get started making the classic

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.799 
so let's get started making the classic
dart<00:00:03.000> design<00:00:07.639> first<00:00:08.639> step<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.360> fold<00:00:09.660> your

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
dart design first step is to fold your

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.249 
dart design first step is to fold your
paper<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.320> half<00:00:11.509> and<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.719> going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> be

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
paper in half and this is going to be

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.110 
paper in half and this is going to be
the<00:00:13.440> first<00:00:13.740> step<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.250> lot<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.639> different

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
the first step in a lot of different

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.080 
the first step in a lot of different
airplanes<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.109> on<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.410> channel

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
airplanes that we do on this channel

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.740 
airplanes that we do on this channel
what<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.779> line<00:00:19.020> up<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> corners

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
what I like to do is line up the corners

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.410 
what I like to do is line up the corners
take<00:00:21.750> your<00:00:21.930> time<00:00:22.170> make<00:00:23.130> sure<00:00:23.189> both<00:00:23.730> corners

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
take your time make sure both corners

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.630 
take your time make sure both corners
are<00:00:24.630> lined<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:25.070> and<00:00:26.480> once<00:00:27.480> you're<00:00:28.369> happy<00:00:29.369> with

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
are lined up and once you're happy with

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.110 
are lined up and once you're happy with
the<00:00:30.380> setup<00:00:31.380> want<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.040> slow<00:00:32.399> hold<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.940> with<00:00:33.090> one

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the setup want to slow hold it with one

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.430 
the setup want to slow hold it with one
hand<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.940> slowly<00:00:36.590> start<00:00:37.590> making<00:00:37.950> your<00:00:38.070> fold

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.720 

probably<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> most<00:00:43.739> important<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.700> about

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
probably the most important thing about

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.290 
probably the most important thing about
folding<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.660> good<00:00:45.899> paper<00:00:46.230> airplane<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:48.030> take

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
folding a good paper airplane is to take

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.900 
folding a good paper airplane is to take
your<00:00:48.510> time<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:50.100> patient<00:00:52.340> it's<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.820> an

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
your time and be patient it's really an

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.400 
your time and be patient it's really an
art<00:00:54.210> form<00:00:54.570> when<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> start<00:00:55.170> getting<00:00:55.440> into<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
art form when you start getting into it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.110 
art form when you start getting into it
so<00:00:58.410> once<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> got<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.219> fold<00:00:59.670> we'll

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
so once you got your first fold we'll

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.500 
so once you got your first fold we'll
try<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> reinforce<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:02.030> by<00:01:03.030> running<00:01:03.300> our

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
try to reinforce it by running our

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.310 
try to reinforce it by running our
fingers<00:01:03.960> along<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> crease<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.540> use<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
fingers along the crease and use the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.550 
fingers along the crease and use the
pressure<00:01:08.299> apply<00:01:09.299> pressure<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.260> tip<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
pressure apply pressure to the tip of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
pressure apply pressure to the tip of
your<00:01:10.770> finger<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:13.549> then<00:01:14.549> we're<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.880> open

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
your finger and then we're going to open

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
your finger and then we're going to open
it<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.470> looks<00:01:16.650> like<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.860> mountain

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
it up so that it looks like a mountain

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.560 
it up so that it looks like a mountain
the<00:01:19.110> next<00:01:19.530> step<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.100> take<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.640> edge<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the next step is to take this edge and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.380 
the next step is to take this edge and
bring<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> down<00:01:22.530> towards<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> center<00:01:23.390> so

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
bring it down towards the center so

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.810 
bring it down towards the center so
we're<00:01:24.540> gonna<00:01:24.630> get<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:25.140> corner<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
we're gonna get the right corner the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
we're gonna get the right corner the
first<00:01:27.270> thing<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.290> line<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.650> up

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
first thing we want to do is line it up

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.140 
first thing we want to do is line it up
I<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> focus<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> corners<00:01:32.909> first

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I like to focus on the corners first

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.090 
I like to focus on the corners first
because<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:33.869> if<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.500> corners

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
because I know if I have the corners

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.450 
because I know if I have the corners
lined<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> rest<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.090> it'll<00:01:36.329> look<00:01:36.479> good<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
lined up the rest of it'll look good and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
lined up the rest of it'll look good and
once<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.670> got<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.119> hold<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.630> with<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.960> hand

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
once I got it I hold it with one hand

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.249 
once I got it I hold it with one hand
and<00:01:40.470> slowly<00:01:41.430> start<00:01:42.270> making<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> decrease<00:01:43.079> at

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and slowly start making a decrease at

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.680 
and slowly start making a decrease at
the<00:01:43.380> corners

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.450 

if<00:01:50.690> this<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.170> your<00:01:51.290> first<00:01:51.650> time<00:01:51.920> holding<00:01:52.220> a

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
if this is your first time holding a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.670 
if this is your first time holding a
paper<00:01:52.670> airplane<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.510> is<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.870> perfect<00:01:54.500> video

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
paper airplane this is the perfect video

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.540 
paper airplane this is the perfect video
for<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:56.770> then<00:01:57.770> we're<00:01:57.950> going<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.100> take<00:01:58.310> the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
for you then we're going to take the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.390 
for you then we're going to take the
left<00:01:58.820> corner<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.570> do<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.110> same<00:02:00.350> thing<00:02:00.650> bring

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
left corner and do the same thing bring

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.050 
left corner and do the same thing bring
it<00:02:01.550> down<00:02:01.700> towards<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.210> center<00:02:02.390> crease<00:02:04.060> and

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
it down towards the center crease and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.749 
it down towards the center crease and
we're<00:02:05.270> gonna<00:02:05.360> line<00:02:05.690> up<00:02:05.720> our<00:02:06.020> corners<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.640> if

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
we're gonna line up our corners and if

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.430 
we're gonna line up our corners and if
you<00:02:10.850> don't<00:02:11.030> get<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.270> perfect<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.870> first<00:02:12.230> time

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
you don't get it perfect the first time

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.090 
you don't get it perfect the first time
or<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> second<00:02:13.370> time<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:13.730> okay<00:02:15.100> that's

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
or the second time that's okay that's

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.670 
or the second time that's okay that's
the<00:02:16.430> fun<00:02:16.730> about<00:02:17.030> folding<00:02:17.750> paper<00:02:17.990> that's<00:02:18.410> part

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
the fun about folding paper that's part

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.750 
the fun about folding paper that's part
of<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.860> fun<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.220> folding<00:02:19.550> paper<00:02:19.580> airplanes<00:02:21.760> is

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
of the fun of folding paper airplanes is

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.060 
of the fun of folding paper airplanes is
you<00:02:22.940> get<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.239> try<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.840> experiment<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.800> do<00:02:24.950> it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
you get to try and experiment and do it

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.070 
you get to try and experiment and do it
over<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.520> over<00:02:25.700> again<00:02:26.030> until<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.600> get<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.959> good

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
over and over again until you get a good

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.330 
over and over again until you get a good
design<00:02:28.450> then<00:02:29.450> reinforce<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.260> crease<00:02:30.530> with

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
design then reinforce the crease with

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.199 
design then reinforce the crease with
the<00:02:31.489> tip<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.820> our<00:02:31.940> finger<00:02:33.520> then<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.700> next<00:02:35.000> step

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the tip of our finger then the next step

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.860 
the tip of our finger then the next step
is<00:02:35.989> we're<00:02:36.200> going<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.350> fold<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.770> in<00:02:36.890> half<00:02:36.920> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
is we're going to fold it in half and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.080 
is we're going to fold it in half and
then<00:02:38.870> we're<00:02:39.260> going<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.410> take<00:02:39.709> this<00:02:40.459> part<00:02:40.850> and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
then we're going to take this part and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.440 
then we're going to take this part and
bring<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:41.450> down<00:02:41.480> towards<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.080> center<00:02:43.450> so

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
bring it down towards the center so

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.800 
bring it down towards the center so
we're<00:02:44.630> going<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.780> line<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.140> up<00:02:50.590> there<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.800> go

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
we're going to line it up there we go

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.210 
we're going to line it up there we go
then<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.930> can<00:02:54.110> kind<00:02:54.380> of<00:02:54.470> see<00:02:54.680> here<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.100> it's

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
then you can kind of see here that it's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.220 
then you can kind of see here that it's
going<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.430> get<00:02:55.610> more<00:02:56.000> tricky<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.870> make<00:02:57.019> your

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
going to get more tricky to make your

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.800 
going to get more tricky to make your
folds<00:02:57.799> because<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.400> plane<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:59.150> getting

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
folds because the plane is getting

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.300 
folds because the plane is getting
thicker<00:03:01.930> once<00:03:02.930> we<00:03:03.080> got<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:03.380> lined<00:03:03.560> up<00:03:03.769> hold<00:03:04.130> it

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
thicker once we got it lined up hold it

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.490 
thicker once we got it lined up hold it
with<00:03:04.459> one<00:03:04.670> hand

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
with one hand

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.289 
with one hand
and<00:03:06.500> then<00:03:06.799> make<00:03:07.040> our<00:03:07.070> crease<00:03:10.030> slowly<00:03:11.030> and

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
and then make our crease slowly and

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.170 
and then make our crease slowly and
patiently

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.729 

and<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:19.360> design<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:20.050> really<00:03:20.590> really

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
and this design is a really really

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.229 
and this design is a really really
classic<00:03:21.340> design<00:03:21.790> as<00:03:23.550> we<00:03:24.550> go<00:03:24.760> through<00:03:25.060> the

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
classic design as we go through the

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.140 
classic design as we go through the
channel<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.930> make<00:03:26.080> more<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:27.430> we<00:03:27.670> make<00:03:27.910> more

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
channel and make more as we make more

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.520 
channel and make more as we make more
videos<00:03:28.950> we're<00:03:29.950> going<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:31.050> start<00:03:32.050> making<00:03:32.170> more

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
videos we're going to start making more

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.100 
videos we're going to start making more
complicated<00:03:33.340> designs<00:03:33.730> but<00:03:34.060> I'm<00:03:34.239> going<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.510> try

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
complicated designs but I'm going to try

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.020 
complicated designs but I'm going to try
and<00:03:35.290> start<00:03:35.590> by<00:03:35.799> making<00:03:36.040> these<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:36.519> order<00:03:36.790> from

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
and start by making these in order from

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.650 
and start by making these in order from
easiest<00:03:37.599> to<00:03:37.810> hardest<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:40.269> line<00:03:40.599> up<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:43.269> fold

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
easiest to hardest so line up the fold

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.270 
easiest to hardest so line up the fold
with<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.049> bottom<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.739> plane<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:47.280> start

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
with the bottom of the plane and start

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.330 
with the bottom of the plane and start
making<00:03:48.610> our<00:03:48.760> crease<00:03:49.120> at<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.450> corners<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:53.340> used

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
making our crease at the corners I used

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.250 
making our crease at the corners I used
to<00:03:54.459> fold<00:03:54.670> paper<00:03:54.880> airplanes<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.569> lot<00:03:55.840> when<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.079> was

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
to fold paper airplanes a lot when I was

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.880 
to fold paper airplanes a lot when I was
a<00:03:56.319> kid<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.829> was<00:03:56.950> a<00:03:56.980> fun<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.459> easy<00:03:57.549> thing<00:03:57.940> to<00:03:57.970> do

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
a kid it was a fun and easy thing to do

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.680 
a kid it was a fun and easy thing to do
didn't<00:03:59.890> cost<00:04:00.099> very<00:04:00.489> much<00:04:00.579> as<00:04:01.060> long<00:04:01.209> as<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:01.480> had

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
didn't cost very much as long as you had

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.860 
didn't cost very much as long as you had
standard<00:04:02.349> size<00:04:02.560> paper<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.250> were<00:04:03.370> fine<00:04:03.870> and

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
standard size paper you were fine and

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.210 
standard size paper you were fine and
what<00:04:05.049> I'm<00:04:05.140> using<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.620> eight<00:04:05.829> and<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:05.980> half<00:04:06.010> by

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
what I'm using is eight and a half by

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.059 
what I'm using is eight and a half by
eleven<00:04:06.849> letter<00:04:07.060> sized<00:04:07.390> paper<00:04:07.829> it's<00:04:08.829> really

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
eleven letter sized paper it's really

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.449 
eleven letter sized paper it's really
common<00:04:09.340> here<00:04:09.730> in<00:04:09.760> North<00:04:10.090> America

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
common here in North America

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.780 
common here in North America
the<00:04:12.459> last<00:04:12.700> step<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.390> fold<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.260> wing<00:04:14.790> so

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
the last step is to fold the wing so

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.270 
the last step is to fold the wing so
we're<00:04:16.000> going<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.150> repeat<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.780> process<00:04:17.280> by

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
we're going to repeat the process by

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.590 
we're going to repeat the process by
lining<00:04:18.789> up<00:04:18.940> this<00:04:19.209> edge<00:04:19.539> with<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.139> face<00:04:20.410> here

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
lining up this edge with the face here

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.500 
lining up this edge with the face here
this<00:04:22.600> one's<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.080> hardest<00:04:23.500> fold<00:04:23.889> to<00:04:24.160> make

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.520 

and<00:04:31.550> starting<00:04:32.550> with<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.820> tip<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.600> mean<00:04:34.200> our<00:04:34.380> way

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
and starting with the tip I mean our way

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.480 
and starting with the tip I mean our way
across<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.340> other<00:04:35.430> corner<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:38.400> then

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
across to the other corner and then

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.720 
across to the other corner and then
double-checking<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.300> tip<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:41.100> slowly

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
double-checking the tip and slowly

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.220 
double-checking the tip and slowly
making<00:04:42.600> our<00:04:42.900> crease<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:45.360> first<00:04:45.660> crease<00:04:46.020> I'm

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
making our crease the first crease I'm

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.480 
making our crease the first crease I'm
always<00:04:46.530> more<00:04:46.800> gentle<00:04:49.100> then<00:04:50.100> once<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.430> think

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
always more gentle then once I think

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.210 
always more gentle then once I think
I've<00:04:50.820> got<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.300> I'll<00:04:52.170> reinforce<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:53.010> with<00:04:53.040> a

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
I've got it I'll reinforce it with a

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.110 
I've got it I'll reinforce it with a
little<00:04:53.520> more<00:04:53.670> pressure<00:04:58.520> there<00:04:59.520> we<00:04:59.670> go

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
little more pressure there we go

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:11.960 
little more pressure there we go
and<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:02.370> last<00:05:02.610> part<00:05:03.090> here<00:05:10.400> now<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.460> tip<00:05:11.790> of

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
and the last part here now the tip of

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.080 
and the last part here now the tip of
the<00:05:12.060> plane<00:05:12.330> is<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.600> tricky<00:05:13.110> part<00:05:13.880> got<00:05:14.880> to<00:05:15.000> be

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
the plane is the tricky part got to be

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.760 
the plane is the tricky part got to be
careful<00:05:15.540> though<00:05:15.750> if<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.080> have<00:05:16.260> a<00:05:16.290> really

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
careful though if you have a really

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.920 
careful though if you have a really
pointy<00:05:17.640> tip<00:05:18.000> when<00:05:18.360> you're<00:05:18.480> flying<00:05:18.720> these

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
pointy tip when you're flying these

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.610 
pointy tip when you're flying these
paper<00:05:19.230> airplanes<00:05:20.990> because<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.170> can<00:05:22.440> be

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
paper airplanes because it can be

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.690 
paper airplanes because it can be
dangerous<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:25.260> what<00:05:25.440> I<00:05:25.470> recommend<00:05:26.100> is<00:05:26.310> cutting

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
dangerous so what I recommend is cutting

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.190 
dangerous so what I recommend is cutting
off<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:27.090> tip<00:05:27.300> you<00:05:27.480> can<00:05:27.510> use<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:27.870> pair<00:05:28.170> of

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
off the tip you can use a pair of
