yeah go get Dennis how you doing we have

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.940 
yeah go get Dennis how you doing we have
here<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> 1991<00:00:05.069> Honda<00:00:05.819> Accord<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.899> believe<00:00:07.680> you

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
here a 1991 Honda Accord I believe you

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.690 
here a 1991 Honda Accord I believe you
have<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> 93<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.330> should<00:00:09.570> be<00:00:10.250> very<00:00:11.250> very

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
have a 93 so it should be very very

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.150 
have a 93 so it should be very very
similar<00:00:12.030> if<00:00:12.360> not<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.570> same<00:00:12.769> so<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:13.799> wanted<00:00:14.040> to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
similar if not the same so I wanted to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.490 
similar if not the same so I wanted to
show<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.429> how<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.120> disable<00:00:15.450> your<00:00:15.690> car<00:00:15.929> so

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
show you how you can disable your car so

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.849 
show you how you can disable your car so
that<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:17.100> won't<00:00:17.279> get<00:00:17.490> stolen<00:00:18.080> and<00:00:19.080> again<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that it won't get stolen and again the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.279 
that it won't get stolen and again the
operating<00:00:20.580> principle<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.390> if<00:00:21.689> someone

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
operating principle is that if someone

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.810 
operating principle is that if someone
tries<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.500> steal<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:22.980> car<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.550> doesn't

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
tries to steal your car and it doesn't

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.070 
tries to steal your car and it doesn't
start<00:00:24.029> they're<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:24.449> gonna<00:00:24.600> go<00:00:24.750> try<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> find

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
start they're just gonna go try to find

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.099 
start they're just gonna go try to find
it<00:00:25.350> another<00:00:25.560> car<00:00:26.510> theft<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> crime<00:00:27.810> of

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
it another car theft is a crime of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
it another car theft is a crime of
opportunity<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.760> they<00:00:30.090> don't<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.510> what

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
opportunity and if they don't get what

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.939 
opportunity and if they don't get what
they<00:00:30.689> want<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.080> away<00:00:31.140> they're<00:00:31.529> gonna<00:00:31.619> go<00:00:31.800> do

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
they want right away they're gonna go do

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.540 
they want right away they're gonna go do
something<00:00:32.309> else

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
something else

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.340 
something else
so<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> number<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.899> ways<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.079> can

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
so there's a number of ways you can

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.880 
so there's a number of ways you can
disable<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.920> car<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:36.090> over<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.680> have

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
disable the car now over here you have

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.240 
disable the car now over here you have
the<00:00:38.610> ignition<00:00:38.760> setup<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.809> there's<00:00:40.590> also<00:00:40.800> some

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the ignition setup and there's also some

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760 
the ignition setup and there's also some
circuitry<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.390> your<00:00:42.510> injectors<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.260> don't

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
circuitry for your injectors I don't

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.440 
circuitry for your injectors I don't
expect<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> take<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.670> apart<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
expect you to take that apart but if you

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
expect you to take that apart but if you
took<00:00:45.629> any<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.989> these<00:00:46.079> connectors<00:00:46.559> apart<00:00:46.680> your

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
took any of these connectors apart your

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.560 
took any of these connectors apart your
engine<00:00:47.910> wouldn't<00:00:48.120> start<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:49.020> better<00:00:49.680> bet<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
engine wouldn't start a better bet is

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.080 
engine wouldn't start a better bet is
over<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.860> fuse<00:00:53.160> box<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.730> your

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
over here this is your fuse box and your

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.660 
over here this is your fuse box and your
relay<00:00:54.510> panel<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.800> relays<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> big

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
relay panel and the relays are the big

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.490 
relay panel and the relays are the big
things<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> fuses<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> little

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
things and the fuses are the little

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.939 
things and the fuses are the little
things<00:00:58.940> well<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> look<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.809> top<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
things well I look at the top of the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.329 
things well I look at the top of the
fuse<00:01:02.699> box<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.619> there's<00:01:04.619> also<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
fuse box and there's also one on the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.960 
fuse box and there's also one on the
inside<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.700> believe<00:01:06.260> yeah<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:08.010> one<00:01:08.280> has<00:01:08.310> all

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
inside I believe yeah this one has all

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.109 
inside I believe yeah this one has all
the<00:01:09.180> fuses<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.260> engine<00:01:10.830> now<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.939> one

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the fuses for the engine now this one

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.390 
the fuses for the engine now this one
right<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.570> says<00:01:12.900> ECU<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.830> means

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
right here says ECU that means

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.510 
right here says ECU that means
electronic<00:01:14.970> control<00:01:15.450> unit<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.280> that's<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
electronic control unit and that's the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
electronic control unit and that's the
computer<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.270> controls<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:19.140> engines

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
computer that controls your engines

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.859 
computer that controls your engines
operation<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> pair<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> pliers<00:01:22.310> now

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
operation you got a pair of pliers now

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
operation you got a pair of pliers now
without<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.049> ECU<00:01:25.650> your<00:01:26.310> injectors<00:01:27.060> won't

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
without the ECU your injectors won't

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.420 
without the ECU your injectors won't
work<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> nothing<00:01:28.470> will<00:01:28.590> work<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> engine

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
work and nothing will work on the engine

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.620 
work and nothing will work on the engine
so<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.570> instance<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.380> was<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> come<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.950> here

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
so for instance if I was to come in here

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
so for instance if I was to come in here
and<00:01:33.829> pull<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.420> just<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.829> can

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and pull that just like that and I can

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.030 
and pull that just like that and I can
clip<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.310> back<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.680> no<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:40.799> will<00:01:40.890> ever

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
clip this back on and no one will ever

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.760 
clip this back on and no one will ever
know<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.610> gone<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.500> 10

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
know that it's gone and if you have a 10

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.179 
know that it's gone and if you have a 10
in<00:01:44.009> fact<00:01:44.250> what<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.579> do<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.649> I<00:01:46.649> would<00:01:46.890> have

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
in fact what I would do is I would have

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.920 
in fact what I would do is I would have
