and I try to apply this in sections and
I<00:00:44.969> make<00:00:45.149> sure<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.510> apply<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.800> by

little and not a lot at one time as you
can<00:00:50.250> see<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:50.789> applying<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.899> downward

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.729 
can see I'm applying this in a downward
motion<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.300> this<00:00:54.300> sort<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> motion<00:00:54.960> helps<00:00:55.379> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
motion and this sort of motion helps in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.910 
motion and this sort of motion helps in
application<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.570> foundation<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
application of the foundation in a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.870 
application of the foundation in a
better<00:00:59.190> way

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.730 

gives<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> matte<00:01:10.290> finish<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:13.500> was

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
gives you a matte finish but this was

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
gives you a matte finish but this was
the<00:01:13.979> color<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.430> was<00:01:14.520> closest<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> my<00:01:15.270> skin

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the color that was closest to my skin

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.540 
the color that was closest to my skin
that's<00:01:15.720> why<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> got<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.650> sometimes<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.280> feel

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
that's why I got it but sometimes I feel

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.520 
that's why I got it but sometimes I feel
like<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.940> is<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.450> wide<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.260> face

very long even if I sweat it does not
come<00:01:36.150> off<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:37.080> really<00:01:37.200> weird<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.770> when

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
come off it's really weird because when

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you sweat with this foundation on the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.130 
you sweat with this foundation on the
sweat<00:01:40.440> kind<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.979> comes<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.180> then<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.990> can

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sweat kind of comes out and then you can

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.950 
sweat kind of comes out and then you can
dab<00:01:43.410> it<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.810> handkerchief<00:01:45.810> or

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
dab it with your handkerchief or

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
dab it with your handkerchief or
whatever<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:47.670> your

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
whatever you have but it's really your

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.969 
whatever you have but it's really your
light<00:01:48.360> foundation<00:01:48.960> hasn't<00:01:49.200> come<00:01:49.350> off<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
light foundation hasn't come off but the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.670 
light foundation hasn't come off but the
sweat<00:01:50.280> comes<00:01:50.610> through<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.240> foundation<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.050> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
sweat comes through the foundation and I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.520 
sweat comes through the foundation and I
find<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.340> little<00:01:53.520> hocus-pocus<00:01:53.759> but

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530
