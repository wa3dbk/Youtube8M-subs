more of a better in-depth looked at the
power<00:00:23.550> pack<00:00:23.900> so<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.050> acts<00:00:25.200> as<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.440> case<00:00:25.950> as

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
power pack so this acts as a case as

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.790 
power pack so this acts as a case as
well<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> power<00:00:27.410> external<00:00:28.410> battery<00:00:28.740> pack

anyway it's a design for the iphone as
you<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.480> now<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.780> you'll<00:00:45.960> notice<00:00:46.140> off

you see here now as you'll notice off

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.979 
you see here now as you'll notice off
the<00:00:46.770> bat<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.100> does<00:00:47.310> add<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.630> certain

the bat it does add you know a certain

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.319 
the bat it does add you know a certain
width<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.700> extra<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.910> an<00:00:51.000> extra

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
width and extra you know an extra

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.389 
width and extra you know an extra
thickness<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> device<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
thickness to the device so you know it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.240 
thickness to the device so you know it
you<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:55.250> obviously

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
you know it's going to be obviously

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.530 
you know it's going to be obviously
you're<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.790> see<00:00:56.880> that<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.420> it

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
you're going to see that just because it

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.210 
you're going to see that just because it
is<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.780> external<00:00:58.200> battery<00:00:58.590> pack<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.100> then

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
is an external battery pack but then

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.319 
is an external battery pack but then
again<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.550> does<00:00:59.700> you<00:00:59.910> know<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.239> not

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
again it does you know if you're not

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000 
again it does you know if you're not
into<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> whole<00:01:00.750> thickness<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.440> actual

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
into the whole thickness of the actual

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.789 
into the whole thickness of the actual
device<00:01:02.840> you<00:01:03.840> know<00:01:03.960> may<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.469> for<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.680> but

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
device you know may not be for you but

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.580 
device you know may not be for you but
anyway<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.670> also<00:01:06.360> acting<00:01:06.840> as<00:01:06.899> a<00:01:06.960> case<00:01:07.259> so<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
anyway it is also acting as a case so it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.399 
anyway it is also acting as a case so it
does<00:01:07.799> protect<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.250> backing<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.759> your<00:01:08.880> device

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
does protect the backing of your device

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.890 
does protect the backing of your device
while<00:01:10.409> still<00:01:10.740> maintaining<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.190> camera

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
while still maintaining the camera

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.410 
while still maintaining the camera
besides<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.380> bottom<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.729> allows<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.210> full

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
besides the bottom and allows you full

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.850 
besides the bottom and allows you full
access<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> front<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> whole

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
access to the front you know the whole

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160 
access to the front you know the whole
front<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> plug<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.900> here<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.020> also

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
front of the plug now here it also

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.140 
front of the plug now here it also
allows<00:01:19.470> speakers<00:01:20.190> it<00:01:20.460> kind<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> reflects<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
allows speakers it kind of reflects the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.430 
allows speakers it kind of reflects the
sound<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.510> I<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.720> make<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> speaker<00:01:22.140> sound

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
sound and I can make the speaker sound

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.960 
sound and I can make the speaker sound
better<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> sounded<00:01:23.310> being<00:01:23.549> directed

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
better because it sounded being directed

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
better because it sounded being directed
towards<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> instead<00:01:24.690> of<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:24.930> around<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
towards you instead of all around and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.740 
towards you instead of all around and
allows<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.790> access<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.270> mic<00:01:27.510> so

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.470 
the iphone first and then the power pack
so<00:02:40.410> charge<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.800> both<00:02:40.860> second<00:02:41.820> priority<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
so charge of both second priority if the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.410 
so charge of both second priority if the
iphone<00:02:42.600> uses<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.110> milli<00:02:43.380> bout<00:02:44.000> iphone<00:02:45.000> uses<00:02:45.390> a

iphone uses a milli bout iphone uses a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.530 
iphone uses a milli bout iphone uses a
milli<00:02:45.630> power<00:02:45.900> pack<00:02:46.110> battery<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.880> basically

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
milli power pack battery so basically

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.000 
milli power pack battery so basically
it's<00:02:48.720> saying<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.110> when<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.890> this

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
