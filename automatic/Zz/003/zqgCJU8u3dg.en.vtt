00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.470
 in fact I have a lot to say about 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.820
 kirikou and the witch 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:16.080
 it's a movie that changed my life but 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.660
 who also changed the life of de 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.789
 French animation and even 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.480
 European animation I was also told 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.179
 and I repeat the past 14 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.769
 years that this film exists 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.250
 I did good people is not 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.960
 not only to specialists in 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.960
 cinema 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:43.550
 so before the shots we think that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 only Americans can do long 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.760
 han han animated film one has 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.610
 a lot of trouble to find the money for 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.539
 to make these films we have trouble doing it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.670
 and also 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.190
 then we have trouble distributing it 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.940
 because as it was a cartoon 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.870
 French 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.490
 nobody wanted it and these young people 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.830
 provincial distributor who took it in 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.830
 hand margoni of lyon 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:22.900
 there was no money to make 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.640
 posters of the trailers 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.590
 press advertisements 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.900
 what is it 18h to find directors 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.380
 of cinemas who loved cinema and who 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.780
 could understand that this movie was a 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.210
 word of mouth film and that he 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.550
 had to keep up with rooms 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.830
 full so that people who were 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.170
 in sparse cinema can tell to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.810
 their neighbors were going to have to and this is 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.830
 what happened is 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.500
 released the same day as a disney movie 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:05.170
 is just a week before a movie of 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:08.170
 dreamworks and little by little the rooms 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.750
 filled up from week to week there 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.370
 would be more crowded when the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.950
 distributor was getting money from this 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.610
 these full rooms instead of making 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.600
 advertisement 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.930
 he was buying a new copy and we are 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.440
 60 against 600 copies for 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.400
 American movies we are finished at 1 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.950
 160 copy but kirikou never stopped 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.290
 to turn while the movies 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.010
 Americans last two or three months 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.360
 then go away and that's it 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.780
 something extraordinary 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.820
 and from that success we started 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.590
 do a lot of feature films in 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.430
 France are better in better 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.120
 and I think it's going to continue 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.130
 my life has become just pleasure 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.030
 first I felt successes that 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.069
 arrived and 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.480
 people who loved my tibet hero 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.750
 but also and since then I do everything that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.750
 I want
