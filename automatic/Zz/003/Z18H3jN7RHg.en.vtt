00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
you brought up the Weston a price diet

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.749 
you brought up the Weston a price diet
and<00:00:02.550> dairies<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> big<00:00:03.149> part<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.449> that

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
and dairies a big part of that

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.190 
and dairies a big part of that
but<00:00:05.759> it's<00:00:05.879> controversial<00:00:06.569> as<00:00:06.750> well<00:00:06.930> there's<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
lot of there's another side that says

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.759 
lot of there's another side that says
stay<00:00:09.240> away<00:00:09.269> from<00:00:09.510> Dairy<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.440> some<00:00:10.740> people

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
stay away from Dairy and and some people

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.709 
stay away from Dairy and and some people
that<00:00:11.130> say<00:00:11.309> look<00:00:11.519> cow's<00:00:11.790> milk<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.570> cows

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
that say look cow's milk is for cows

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.770 
that say look cow's milk is for cows
goats<00:00:13.290> milk<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:13.950> baby<00:00:14.130> goats<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.630> on

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
goats milk is for baby goats and so on

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.380 
goats milk is for baby goats and so on
what<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.430> say<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.880> argument

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
what what do you say to that argument

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.650 
what what do you say to that argument
well<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> would<00:00:19.410> say<00:00:19.650> any<00:00:20.250> any<00:00:20.760> anthropologist

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
well I would say any any anthropologist

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.849 
well I would say any any anthropologist
will<00:00:21.750> tell<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.500> plenty<00:00:22.740> of

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
will tell you that we have plenty of

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
will tell you that we have plenty of
evidence<00:00:23.460> throughout<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.840> history<00:00:24.960> of

stance would be that raw milk is fit for

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
stance would be that raw milk is fit for
human<00:01:03.600> consumption<00:01:04.019> whereas<00:01:04.530> pasteurized

milk is has been you know pasteurized is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.700 
milk is has been you know pasteurized is
if<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.030> still<00:01:36.360> contains<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> phosphatase

if it still contains the phosphatase

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.880 
if it still contains the phosphatase

enzyme so phosphatase enzyme is in the
milk<00:01:41.100> by<00:01:41.400> design<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.720> part<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.680> what

allows that milk to be deposited and to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.700 
allows that milk to be deposited and to
