to<00:02:34.310> be<00:02:34.430> themselves<00:02:35.920> because<00:02:36.920> they're<00:02:37.040> quality

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
to be themselves because they're quality

people and quality players and I do and

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.910 
people and quality players and I do and
I<00:02:40.370> think<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:40.820> important<00:02:41.300> for<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.510> game

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
I think it's important for the game

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.699 
I think it's important for the game
you'd<00:02:42.920> ask<00:02:43.160> me<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.370> 10<00:02:43.730> years<00:02:43.910> ago<00:02:44.030> I<00:02:44.709> you

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
you'd ask me that 10 years ago I you

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.050 
you'd ask me that 10 years ago I you
wouldn't<00:02:45.950> get<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> sniff<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.580> coming<00:02:46.850> in<00:02:46.940> our

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
wouldn't get a sniff of coming in our

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.420 
wouldn't get a sniff of coming in our
locker<00:02:47.300> room<00:02:47.769> but<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.800> think<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.220> really

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
locker room but I think it's really

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.340 
locker room but I think it's really
important<00:02:49.940> for<00:02:50.000> our<00:02:50.090> game<00:02:50.330> for<00:02:50.569> people<00:02:50.870> to<00:02:50.989> see

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
important for our game for people to see

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.259 
important for our game for people to see
some<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.130> those<00:02:52.310> things<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.819> go<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:52.940> behind

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
some of those things that go on behind

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.509 
some of those things that go on behind
the<00:02:53.540> scenes<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.769> what<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.160> people<00:02:55.340> are

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
the scenes and and what the people are

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.960 
the scenes and and what the people are
really<00:02:55.670> like<00:02:56.620> people<00:02:57.620> have<00:02:57.970> misperceptions

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
really like people have misperceptions

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.820 
really like people have misperceptions
of<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.480> lot<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.870> people<00:03:00.140> in<00:03:00.230> our<00:03:00.290> game<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.739> I

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
of a lot of people in our game and I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.199 
of a lot of people in our game and I

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
think this type of stuff is going to be

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.240 
think this type of stuff is going to be
really<00:03:02.329> good<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.829> answer<00:03:04.070> your<00:03:04.130> question

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.729 
people i think that's their nervousness
I<00:03:56.480> would<00:03:56.630> think<00:03:56.780> without<00:03:57.019> even<00:03:57.350> talking<00:03:57.500> to

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
I would think without even talking to

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.400 
I would think without even talking to
them<00:03:57.859> that<00:03:58.160> how<00:03:59.000> much<00:03:59.209> do<00:03:59.390> you<00:03:59.510> want<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.230> how

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
them that how much do you want and how

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.289 
them that how much do you want and how
much<00:04:00.470> are<00:04:00.709> they<00:04:00.769> going<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:01.190> give<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.519> within

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
much are they going to give you within

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.390 
much are they going to give you within
the<00:04:02.510> game<00:04:02.720> itself<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.350> locker<00:04:03.590> room<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.160> and

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
the game itself the locker room and and

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.920 
the game itself the locker room and and
stuff<00:04:04.640> like<00:04:04.790> that<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:05.060> think<00:04:05.390> that's<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.750> neat

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
stuff like that I think that's the neat

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.170 
stuff like that I think that's the neat
stuff<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.560> need<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.860> see<00:04:07.069> but<00:04:07.970> when<00:04:08.090> you

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
stuff that you need to see but when you

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.210 
stuff that you need to see but when you
start<00:04:08.390> following<00:04:08.780> them<00:04:08.840> around<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.980> and

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
start following them around and this and

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.780 
start following them around and this and
that<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.400> they

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
that and they

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.050 
that and they
family<00:04:11.299> young<00:04:11.599> kids<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:13.489> know<00:04:13.579> I<00:04:13.730> think

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
family young kids you know I think

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.910 
family young kids you know I think
there's<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.540> line<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.049> I'm<00:04:15.530> sure<00:04:15.709> they're

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
there's a line and I'm sure they're

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.009 
there's a line and I'm sure they're
going<00:04:16.009> to<00:04:16.070> draw<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.609> line<00:04:16.820> for<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.299> as<00:04:17.479> you

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019
