you<00:04:15.690> know<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.840> think<00:04:16.170> that<00:04:16.350> it's<00:04:17.150> we<00:04:18.150> want<00:04:18.360> good

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
you know I think that it's we want good

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.600 
you know I think that it's we want good
players<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:20.070> know<00:04:20.130> all<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.549> things

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
players and and you know all the things

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.940 
players and and you know all the things
factor<00:04:21.570> in<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:22.200> know<00:04:22.320> sometimes<00:04:22.560> we're

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
factor in you know sometimes we're

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.160 
factor in you know sometimes we're
looking<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.430> add<00:04:23.550> more<00:04:24.330> character<00:04:24.900> more

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
looking to add more character more

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.370 
looking to add more character more
toughness<00:04:25.490> more<00:04:26.490> shooting<00:04:27.110> better<00:04:28.110> ball

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
handling better decision-making better

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.900 
handling better decision-making better
upside<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.920> know<00:04:32.010> all<00:04:32.250> of<00:04:32.280> those<00:04:32.460> things<00:04:32.520> are

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
upside you know all of those things are

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.640 
upside you know all of those things are
realistically<00:04:33.600> coming<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.050> play<00:04:34.230> every<00:04:34.470> time

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
realistically coming to play every time

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.850 
realistically coming to play every time
we<00:04:34.770> draft<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.370> so<00:04:35.870> rarely<00:04:36.870> are<00:04:37.710> those

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
we draft and so rarely are those

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.070 
we draft and so rarely are those
characteristics<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.820> one<00:04:39.030> player<00:04:39.330> if<00:04:39.810> they

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
characteristics in one player if they

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.520 
characteristics in one player if they
are<00:04:40.260> then<00:04:40.500> his<00:04:40.620> name<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:40.920> Michael<00:04:41.220> Jordan<00:04:41.580> and

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
are then his name is Michael Jordan and

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.620 
are then his name is Michael Jordan and
so<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:44.430> know<00:04:44.460> those<00:04:44.730> are<00:04:44.910> all<00:04:45.030> factors<00:04:45.480> that

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
so you know those are all factors that

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.390 
so you know those are all factors that
we<00:04:45.750> consider<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:46.410> what<00:04:46.890> we're<00:04:47.130> looking<00:04:47.370> for

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
we consider and what we're looking for

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.210 
we consider and what we're looking for
the<00:04:47.670> we're<00:04:47.940> looking<00:04:48.330> for<00:04:48.480> good<00:04:48.630> people<00:04:49.220> every

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
movie was that we were able to pull at

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.070 
movie was that we were able to pull at
all<00:05:23.870> really<00:05:25.730> yeah<00:05:26.730> I<00:05:26.760> know<00:05:26.850> you<00:05:27.750> know<00:05:27.840> runs

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
all really yeah I know you know runs

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.380 
all really yeah I know you know runs
tough<00:05:28.440> kid<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.950> think<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:29.580> any<00:05:30.090> of<00:05:30.180> our

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
tough kid I think that any of our

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.280 
tough kid I think that any of our
players<00:05:30.660> would<00:05:30.960> have<00:05:31.050> been<00:05:31.140> out<00:05:31.260> there

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
players would have been out there

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.200 
players would have been out there
playing<00:05:31.710> though<00:05:31.919> in<00:05:32.070> that<00:05:32.190> situation<00:05:32.550> it's<00:05:33.000> a

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
playing though in that situation it's a

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.150 
playing though in that situation it's a
you<00:05:33.900> don't<00:05:34.050> really<00:05:34.200> get<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.530> opportunity<00:05:35.040> to

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
you don't really get the opportunity to

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.060 
you don't really get the opportunity to
play<00:05:35.310> in<00:05:35.430> big<00:05:36.000> serious<00:05:36.270> like<00:05:36.570> that<00:05:36.780> and

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
play in big serious like that and

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.440 
play in big serious like that and

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
rashon was in a lot of pain and was able

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.650 
rashon was in a lot of pain and was able

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
nothing players get enough code for that

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.630 
nothing players get enough code for that
lastly<00:05:47.450> you<00:05:48.450> know<00:05:49.040> rather<00:05:50.040> what<00:05:50.220> he<00:05:50.340> did<00:05:50.490> was

lastly you know rather what he did was
amazing<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.660> I<00:05:51.780> agree<00:05:52.020> with<00:05:52.050> Danny<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.530> think

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
amazing and I agree with Danny I think

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.210

everyone<00:05:53.100> on<00:05:53.220> our<00:05:53.310> team<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:54.180> just<00:05:54.920> can't<00:05:55.920> speak

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
everyone on our team I just can't speak

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.370 
everyone on our team I just can't speak
for<00:05:56.400> other<00:05:56.460> teams<00:05:56.850> but<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.390> think<00:05:57.780> we<00:05:57.990> have<00:05:58.140> that

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
for other teams but I think we have that

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.310 
for other teams but I think we have that
type<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:58.620> group<00:05:59.010> that<00:05:59.720> they<00:06:00.720> wanted<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.110> win

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
type of group that they wanted to win

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.230 
type of group that they wanted to win
and<00:06:01.350> they<00:06:01.710> know<00:06:01.920> that<00:06:01.950> you<00:06:02.370> can't<00:06:02.610> take<00:06:02.820> any

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
and they know that you can't take any

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.660 
and they know that you can't take any
year<00:06:03.540> for<00:06:03.720> granted<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:04.440> they<00:06:04.770> wanted<00:06:05.070> this<00:06:05.400> to

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
year for granted and they wanted this to

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.490 
year for granted and they wanted this to
be<00:06:05.700> that<00:06:06.120> year<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:06.660> it<00:06:06.810> obviously<00:06:06.990> didn't

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
be that year and it obviously didn't

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.280 
be that year and it obviously didn't
happen<00:06:07.530> but<00:06:08.450> still<00:06:09.450> says<00:06:09.720> a<00:06:09.750> lot<00:06:09.930> about<00:06:09.990> the

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
happen but still says a lot about the

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.920
