00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
then they clamp down and I have about a

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.580 
then they clamp down and I have about a
clip<00:04:54.060> here<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.660> click<00:04:54.930> there

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.060 

and<00:05:06.150> kids<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.810> plan<00:05:07.050> on<00:05:07.080> siding<00:05:07.680> I<00:05:07.710> heard<00:05:07.920> them

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
and kids I plan on siding I heard them

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.540 
and kids I plan on siding I heard them
yelling<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:08.730> go<00:05:09.090> away<00:05:09.330> then<00:05:09.690> so<00:05:10.650> that<00:05:11.010> is

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
yelling so I go away then so that is

yelling so I go away then so that is
what<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:11.970> used<00:05:12.480> to<00:05:12.960> clamp<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:13.650> down<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:14.220> I<00:05:14.370> think

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
what I used to clamp it down and I think

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.650 
what I used to clamp it down and I think
it<00:05:14.700> feels<00:05:14.850> more<00:05:15.120> secure

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
it feels more secure

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.310 
it feels more secure
I<00:05:15.960> used<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:17.070> wig<00:05:17.820> cap<00:05:17.850> with<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.660> adjustable

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
I used the wig cap with the adjustable

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.130 
I used the wig cap with the adjustable
straps<00:05:19.920> the<00:05:20.580> netted<00:05:21.030> wig<00:05:22.250> net<00:05:23.250> for<00:05:23.910> my<00:05:24.870> hair<00:05:25.110> I

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
straps the netted wig net for my hair I

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.680 
straps the netted wig net for my hair I
