with<00:03:27.829> his<00:03:27.950> old<00:03:28.130> thing<00:03:28.400> is<00:03:28.549> just<00:03:28.700> use<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> brand

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
with his old thing is just use a brand

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.479 
with his old thing is just use a brand
new<00:03:29.480> one<00:03:29.630> so<00:03:30.590> we're<00:03:30.709> going<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.889> cut<00:03:31.069> each<00:03:31.220> wire

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
new one so we're going to cut each wire

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.750 
new one so we're going to cut each wire
off<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.090> then<00:03:32.660> solder<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.170> together

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.490 

risada<00:03:37.760> all<00:03:38.030> these<00:03:38.180> pins<00:03:38.480> here<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.349> where

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
risada all these pins here this is where

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.600 
risada all these pins here this is where
the<00:03:40.000> socket<00:03:41.000> actually<00:03:41.750> connects<00:03:42.400> to<00:03:43.400> the

the socket actually connects to the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.510 
the socket actually connects to the
connector<00:03:44.360> here<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.830> we're<00:03:45.980> going<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.160> reheat

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
connector here so we're going to reheat

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.640 
connector here so we're going to reheat
each<00:03:46.730> one<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.780> make<00:03:47.930> sure<00:03:48.110> it<00:03:48.230> has<00:03:48.349> a<00:03:48.380> good

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
each one to make sure it has a good

each one to make sure it has a good
connection<00:03:49.010> sometimes<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:50.300> get<00:03:50.420> an<00:03:50.599> auction

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
connection sometimes you get an auction

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.259 
connection sometimes you get an auction
piece<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.500> end<00:03:51.739> up<00:03:51.920> dropping<00:03:52.550> off<00:03:53.000> the

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
piece that you end up dropping off the

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:07.559 
piece that you end up dropping off the
roof

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569
