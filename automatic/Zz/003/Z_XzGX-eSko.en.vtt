 when i no longer have to go on the photo i really want to 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.609
 that was of course a record on several fronts 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.669
 when it comes to judging iran feel where we may be 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.259
 kept out of a collection 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.549
 that required three Germans 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.979

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:00.860
 as paris 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.969
 that tells the telegraph that they are too much 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:08.969
 I got to the next club provided you experience full criticism of $ 100 x100e 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:10.689
 right structural 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.589
 if I already talk to you 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.609
 on the next 120 runs on these videos 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.909
 the view that I am anyway I have three of the injured 5 full anyway 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.099
 and 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.099
 to get started on the poet 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.869
 I've had so many flares lately, so much on one in most 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:34.879
 Palaces that is really not healthy and just not normal how fast that is 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.839
 I throw and 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:39.559
 and I am very happy I am really happy with you and when they are busy 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.289
 the fans 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.259
 nelemans on twitter followers 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.029
 I am currently on Twitter 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.759
 three hundred 60 according to the eu is also super much natural 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:54.029
 and I am still happy with you for your support 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.319
 It feels like an injury to thinking I never thought I'd ever be that big 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.319
 would be that is the result is the biggest pick 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.259
 I succeeded 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.289
 we hope in October 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:12.879
 and i really mean serious to come up for the msc is really one 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:13.779
 kind of happy with it 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.859
 and with that was due to the 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:16.959
 prot the lead role 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.629
 if it works on a water project for half an hour 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:23.050
 and then it turned out that the sound was last curved set 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.610
 another one at the height of the church 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.370
 the best bales are 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.690
 and the already reading mail 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.979
 You can see that in the movie 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.449
 can become beautiful today actually already 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.539
 I am already linked today with that of head coach about that 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.289
 this time that's so 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.490
 and 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.680
 and who become super official through a super view yourself 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.139

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.759

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.009
 3 k 12 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.009
 great mvl a deep fryer the deen remains 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.980
 and also the field 11 the doubt i play place the best movie 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.410
 and niels the voice for my vip structural tank mail sent 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.629
 that is only possible when they hear 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:07.580
 to it 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.879
 however as one 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.580
 again it was not recorded live that was not talked live easter not live 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.589
 recorded because I 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:16.950
 this again 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.339
 recorded on when i know 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.050
 the busiest day was city 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.770
 to play like that 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.449
 and 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.169
 actually i found this 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.169
 the best he got I thought the public should not stand 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.490
 belga ka found this game 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.150
 if i'm not sure but i thought it was there i have i have 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.009
 play left here think something of that city 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.870
 last week Saturday 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.120
 to the CEO I can only use the state penultimate nothing 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.300
 and 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.120
 why do I know a lot 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.740
 the man who bought up as I know a lot 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.960
 but from the match almost finished I see here 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.880
 what can i have i will use nothing for years 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.909
 if the biggest I thought you can be the biggest 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.099
 by this queen 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.559
 hardly once 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.300
 I thought sharks and 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.699
 I don't know if it was a real show or a nice representation of the city 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.599
 allegedly I can be the first tender the players that I know that guy 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:16.289
 days 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.409
 it's I think they train and I just head for it 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:20.440
 and 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.050
 What is there to do 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.420
 adc a year ago i was there being me is you there was my alarm clock and the 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.619
 reality work 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:27.719
 what a sick one 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:32.699
 he claims to see the telecom law to his knees and he ran further limited to the 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.129
 best off and to the point that it was back then 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:38.039
 as the next edition of twelve that I had won 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.150
 for the then only 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.150
 yes, that is true, and it has already been achieved together 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.819
 but I regret it did not agree 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:48.509
 come on carrie 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:49.580
 the cia 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.090
 and before the pipeline I was too 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.100
 I think so 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.240
 yes for women won with 6 0 6 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.529
 m 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:59.090
 and what a reason that we just say 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.610
 when I see that my arm contradicts 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.539
 I did have creative jaliens and vitality tells the value fund 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.879
 in the course of the first hour it seemed unclear or certainly short 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:12.610
 from the title the trio who comes then the live 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.409
 so keep looking 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:15.300
 last time
