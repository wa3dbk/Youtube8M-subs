00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.670
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.920
 special dinner I am cooking 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.020
 and tina is the one who changes that and the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.560
 stupid questions is well this fight 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.759
 they are entitled to breasts 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.440
 is a difficult topic in germany 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.690
 in each one says he invented the 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.029
 berliner the duisburgers the dortmunder 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.010
 airport in general there are some 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.000
 which are made with cola 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.530
 reduced cola 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.110
 I think that's a bit 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.160
 very crazy we chose one 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.140
 variant decided 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:47.140
 the significantly less exotic ingredients 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.019
 demanded like vinegar, for example 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.330
 soy sauce a bit of huster sauce 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.570
 tomato paste and tomato juice and whole 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.309
 important apricot jam after roses 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.119
 jam thought of us we do the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.379
 small potato real to it 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.820
 let instead of banal celebrities the 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.680
 that is easier in a small 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.210
 pot advice are done faster 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.190
 make less piggies very cool 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.710
 look cooler for that too 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.229
 say good looking completely clear 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.539
 You can wed with about plus 1 wedding 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.759
 count for the sauce three quarters of an hour 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.829
 It's also a fast first 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.180
 You can change the statement in the supermarket 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.659
 not an hour later to eat 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.359
 to change 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.750
 for the currysauce had to onions too 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:32.549
 really stay because we are after that 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.890
 the one cooked can anyway still in 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.730
 the mixer scare the potatoes in 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.630
 small cubes 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.200
 I always put a cut here 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.280
 flat places 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.680
 then you can get the potato good 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.360
 It is important to set up a sharp one 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.860
 But now I have a knife on it 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.440
 no influence i just hope that 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.230
 then have your service knife cuts 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:59.200
 one about 1 centimeter wide 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:02.440
 stripes and comes here at the end 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.840
 make small flat again when they 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.960
 then increasingly lie down and it really does 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.420
 then want to go back to about 1 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.530
 inch-wide stripes hold me 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.210
 stuck here with your finger 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:22.870
 so i can do it relatively simple 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:24.760
 can you really do it i believe we 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.890
 The onions always sweat first 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.740
 a bit of olive oil normal ireland 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.230
 I am in olive oil so far come the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.750
 tomatoes are just that 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.910
 falling cans tomatoes and gets a time 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.350
 could be next to it but more effort and 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.580
 you would definitely have the shell 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.580
 remove and it is a pity 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.120
 her taste and also the same 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.040
 with purely the army of asia 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.240
 now the curry comes one of the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.670
 key ingredients of a curry 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.920
 sauce you already hear on the name of me 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.680
 swear personally on curry mixes 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.800
 from ingo holland because they really are 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.120
 fruits and a really great one then 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.070
 you have a taste of course there are 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.530
 Also a lot of other providers the 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.250
 have currys 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:22.950
 so wear it now comes the kür 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:26.920
 is a small amount of sun oil 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:34.630
 temperature we should vote against 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:37.630
 rhein- and the temperatures are not up 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.130
 particularity and relatively sensitive and 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.290
 like to burn the sun on games 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.110
 brown 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.440
 At the same time, yes, someday 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.970
 then take it relatively large and after 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.280
 Possibility also high pot then too 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.410
 here it will inject and fill well 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.110
 make centimeters high with the oil more 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.370
 does not have to be but less upholstery 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.920
 Jesus especially important that we wait 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.230
 is it reached reasonably temperature 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.110
 has been because the want to ask your 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.970
 why because the potato set begin 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.470
 the oil together too if there is one 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.480
 searched 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.510
 Christine and then we do not feel 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.220
 want very strong on the oil for the 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.470
 Body has the right temperature 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.930
 if you have a terrorist there 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.720
 are about 120 degrees pay but 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.690
 times then there is the old dryer 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.970
 fluent you just play 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:41.850
 you learn when the beginning down to 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:43.400
 Bubble is it's enough you can 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.460
 actually largely let alone 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:52.070
 if the temperature is right in 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.070
 Guarantee very comfortable to yourself 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.730
 that looks pretty good i find him 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.880
 kitchen paper so little bit canceled 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.160
 becomes 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:18.400
 then you will be a bit the pages 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.900
 After complaining it is nice 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:28.540
 If you look at it a bit 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:29.950
 curry sauce had schälchen 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.870
 Of course you can also with on the 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.120
 injuries depending on what you a 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.190
 dishes at home but has better if 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.190
 they are important now 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.890
 that's how it looks like i think it's good 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.120
 it is very beautiful it is really beautiful 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.100
 or you can of course now 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.920
 Also some green parsley 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.450
 but sprinkle over it but I mean 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.680
 let's face it, it's one 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.940
 currywurst with curry sauce and 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.800
 potato cubes there is such a bully 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.800
