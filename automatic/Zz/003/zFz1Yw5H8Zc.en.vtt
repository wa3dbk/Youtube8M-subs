00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929 

now<00:00:00.149> on<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.780> lengthening<00:00:01.380> which<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.639> next

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
now on the lengthening which is the next

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.260 
now on the lengthening which is the next
piece<00:00:03.120> we're<00:00:03.389> gonna<00:00:03.480> look<00:00:03.720> at<00:00:04.580> we<00:00:05.580> say<00:00:05.940> the

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
piece we're gonna look at we say the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.379 
piece we're gonna look at we say the
horse<00:00:06.569> should<00:00:07.290> cover<00:00:08.120> more<00:00:09.120> ground<00:00:10.490> so<00:00:11.490> if<00:00:11.969> you

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
horse should cover more ground so if you

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.660 
horse should cover more ground so if you
went<00:00:12.630> across<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.990> diagonal<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:14.160> think<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.549> is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
went across the diagonal I think this is

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.689 
went across the diagonal I think this is
a<00:00:14.700> helpful<00:00:15.150> exercise<00:00:15.450> sometimes<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.770> just

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
a helpful exercise sometimes and just

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.700 
a helpful exercise sometimes and just
did<00:00:17.940> your<00:00:18.119> regular<00:00:18.600> working<00:00:18.840> trot<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.470> said

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
did your regular working trot and said

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.000 
did your regular working trot and said
it<00:00:19.830> takes<00:00:20.390> 15<00:00:21.390> strides<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.350> from<00:00:22.619> point<00:00:22.830> A

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
it takes 15 strides to get from point A

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.580 
it takes 15 strides to get from point A
to<00:00:23.039> point<00:00:23.160> B<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:24.180> I'm<00:00:24.359> gonna<00:00:24.570> lengthen<00:00:24.840> oh

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.410 

that<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.949> 15<00:00:29.400> strides<00:00:30.560> right<00:00:31.820> okay<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that was so 15 strides right okay so you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.180 
that was so 15 strides right okay so you
want<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.170> want<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> say<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> in

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
want to you want to say I can do it in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.850 
want to you want to say I can do it in
13<00:00:35.820> strikes<00:00:36.260> all<00:00:37.260> right

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
13 strikes all right

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.369 
13 strikes all right
so<00:00:38.160> covering<00:00:38.910> more<00:00:39.120> ground<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.750> means<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
so covering more ground that means the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
so covering more ground that means the
horse<00:00:40.620> should<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.280> longer<00:00:41.760> strides<00:00:42.059> not

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
horse should have longer strides not

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.880 
horse should have longer strides not
faster<00:00:43.140> strikes<00:00:43.789> because<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.750> some<00:00:46.020> at

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
faster strikes because we see some at

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.180 
faster strikes because we see some at
first<00:00:47.190> level<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:47.730> interesting

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
first level very interesting

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
first level very interesting
interpretations<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.870> lengthening<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.079> think

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
interpretations of lengthening I think

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.500 
interpretations of lengthening I think
some<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.250> children<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.820> getting<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
some of these children are getting to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
some of these children are getting to
get<00:00:54.660> shaken<00:00:55.110> baby<00:00:55.350> syndrome<00:00:55.500> trying<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> sit

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
get shaken baby syndrome trying to sit

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.290 
get shaken baby syndrome trying to sit
but<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.370> okay<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.730> poster<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
but that's right okay you can poster you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.319 
but that's right okay you can poster you
can<00:01:00.480> sit<00:01:00.780> now<00:01:01.590> even<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.219> first<00:01:02.460> level<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.149> would

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
can sit now even at first level it would

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.730 
can sit now even at first level it would
be<00:01:03.390> great<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.369> two<00:01:05.580> transitions

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
be great if we can see two transitions

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.170 
be great if we can see two transitions
one<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> beginning<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:08.880> at<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> end

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
one at the beginning and one at the end

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.760 
one at the beginning and one at the end
we<00:01:09.390> hardly<00:01:09.659> ever<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:10.049> first<00:01:10.260> saw<00:01:10.439> we'll<00:01:10.619> see

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
we hardly ever at first saw we'll see

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.890 
we hardly ever at first saw we'll see
anybody<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> end<00:01:11.840> do<00:01:12.840> anything<00:01:13.520> okay<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
anybody at the end do anything okay and

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
anybody at the end do anything okay and
remember<00:01:15.900> our<00:01:15.930> pendulum<00:01:16.820> okay<00:01:17.820> at<00:01:18.000> first

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
remember our pendulum okay at first

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.600 
remember our pendulum okay at first
level<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.380> only<00:01:19.650> doing<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:21.680> okay<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
level it's only doing this okay so you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
level it's only doing this okay so you
don't<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.479> can't<00:01:24.869> lengthen<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.350> lot

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
don't we know you can't lengthen a lot

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.609 
don't we know you can't lengthen a lot
but<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.430> come<00:01:26.759> back<00:01:26.970> some

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
but we know you can come back some

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.670 
but we know you can come back some
alrighty<00:01:28.880> okay<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.409> at<00:01:31.590> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
alrighty okay so can we do this one at a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.510 
alrighty okay so can we do this one at a
time<00:01:32.240> I'll<00:01:33.240> talk<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:34.049> bit<00:01:34.259> I'll<00:01:34.520> tell

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
time I'll talk a little bit I'll tell

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:55.380 
time I'll talk a little bit I'll tell
you<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:35.909> doing<00:01:35.939> score<00:01:36.509> wise

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.600 

so<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.230> turn<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.830> approach<00:01:57.250> is<00:01:57.580> a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
so the turn in the approach is a

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.250 
so the turn in the approach is a
modifier<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:59.020> circle<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.720> let<00:02:01.900> me<00:02:02.020> see<00:02:02.170> the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
modifier to the circle so let me see the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.050 
modifier to the circle so let me see the
hot<00:02:02.440> just<00:02:02.680> going<00:02:02.920> right<00:02:03.340> a<00:02:03.400> little<00:02:03.700> bit<00:02:03.850> of

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
hot just going right a little bit of

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:12.540 
hot just going right a little bit of
he's<00:02:04.270> not<00:02:04.300> turning<00:02:10.650> now<00:02:11.650> she<00:02:11.740> did<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
he's not turning now she did that in the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.340 
he's not turning now she did that in the
show<00:02:12.730> go<00:02:12.910> back<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.360> start<00:02:13.570> over<00:02:13.750> but<00:02:14.080> if<00:02:14.170> she

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
show go back and start over but if she

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.590 
show go back and start over but if she
did<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> show<00:02:15.220> ring<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.700> went<00:02:16.360> back

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
did that in the show ring and went back

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.680 
did that in the show ring and went back
and<00:02:16.960> started<00:02:17.230> over<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:18.280> have<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.090> judge<00:02:19.480> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
and started over I have to judge the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.050 
and started over I have to judge the
first<00:02:19.960> attempt<00:02:20.560> which<00:02:21.310> is<00:02:21.459> going<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.670> be<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:21.850> low

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
first attempt which is going to be a low

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.760 
first attempt which is going to be a low
score<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.530> give<00:02:24.040> her<00:02:24.130> an<00:02:24.280> error<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:26.050> if<00:02:26.500> you

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
score and give her an error so if you

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.280 
score and give her an error so if you
want<00:02:26.950> do-overs<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:29.050> ready<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.440> pay<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.800> price

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.630 

you<00:02:35.290> might<00:02:35.440> discuss<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> little<00:02:36.280> counter

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
you might discuss a little counter

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.900 
you might discuss a little counter
flexing<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.390> prepare<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.170> seven<00:02:41.910> okay

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
flexing to prepare for that seven okay

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.479 
flexing to prepare for that seven okay
so<00:02:42.970> he<00:02:43.390> tripped<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.810> little<00:02:44.080> bit<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.190> trots

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
so he tripped a little bit but the trots

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.180 
so he tripped a little bit but the trots
quite<00:02:45.850> nice<00:02:46.120> it's<00:02:46.630> fluid<00:02:47.110> she<00:02:47.650> has<00:02:47.860> enough

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
quite nice it's fluid she has enough

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.000 
quite nice it's fluid she has enough
Bend<00:02:48.520> finishes<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.360> center<00:02:49.690> line<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:50.890> you

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
Bend finishes on center line so if you

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.940 
Bend finishes on center line so if you
want<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.310> be<00:02:51.430> mean<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.880> say<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.300> tripped<00:02:52.950> but

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
want to be mean and say it tripped but

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.120 
want to be mean and say it tripped but
otherwise<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:54.580> seven<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.620> leg<00:02:56.620> yield<00:02:56.890> has

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
otherwise is seven the leg yield has

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.490 
otherwise is seven the leg yield has
crossing<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.180> he's<00:02:58.270> starting<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.690> lean<00:02:59.080> and

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
crossing but he's starting to lean and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.670 
crossing but he's starting to lean and
the<00:02:59.950> truck<00:03:00.220> didn't<00:03:00.519> see<00:03:00.670> quite<00:03:01.120> regular<00:03:01.750> okay

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
the truck didn't see quite regular okay

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:11.180 
the truck didn't see quite regular okay
so<00:03:02.739> it's<00:03:03.250> six

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.240 

I<00:03:11.250> would<00:03:12.030> say<00:03:12.240> modest<00:03:12.810> something<00:03:13.740> happened

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
I would say modest something happened

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.250 
I would say modest something happened
but<00:03:14.550> not<00:03:14.760> much<00:03:15.140> six<00:03:18.020> okay

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
but not much six okay

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.650 
but not much six okay

forward and downward maintaining the

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.320 
forward and downward maintaining the
contact<00:03:37.490> now<00:03:38.490> Aaron<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:38.970> looked<00:03:39.150> like<00:03:39.240> a

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
contact now Aaron that looked like a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.070 
contact now Aaron that looked like a
submarine

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
submarine

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.530 
submarine
okay<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.400> was<00:03:41.610> what<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:41.910> would<00:03:42.090> call<00:03:42.300> it

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
okay that was what we would call it

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.200 
okay that was what we would call it
gravity<00:03:43.140> stretch<00:03:43.530> she<00:03:44.280> let<00:03:44.490> go<00:03:44.520> of<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.000> reins

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
gravity stretch she let go of the reins

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.090 
gravity stretch she let go of the reins
and<00:03:45.510> because<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.110> head<00:03:46.380> weighs<00:03:46.680> more<00:03:47.040> than

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
and because it's head weighs more than

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.380 
and because it's head weighs more than
anything<00:03:47.520> in<00:03:47.760> his<00:03:47.910> body

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
anything in his body

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.530 
anything in his body
it<00:03:48.870> went<00:03:49.260> falling<00:03:49.800> down<00:03:50.280> okay<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.240> was<00:03:51.390> not

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
it went falling down okay it was not

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.870 
it went falling down okay it was not
really<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:52.140> an<00:03:52.350> aid<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.980> then<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.430> could<00:03:53.610> see

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
really on an aid and then you could see

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.970 
really on an aid and then you could see
the<00:03:54.360> reins<00:03:54.570> getting<00:03:54.960> Li<00:03:55.080> pick<00:03:55.320> him<00:03:55.470> up<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.800> try

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
the reins getting Li pick him up and try

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.690 
the reins getting Li pick him up and try
it<00:03:56.070> once<00:03:56.370> more

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
it once more

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.050 
it once more
so<00:03:57.510> for<00:03:58.200> me<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:58.680> that's<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.340> problem<00:03:59.610> that's

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
so for me that that's a problem that's

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.180 
so for me that that's a problem that's
not<00:04:00.210> that's<00:04:00.750> not<00:04:00.960> what<00:04:01.110> we're<00:04:01.530> looking<00:04:01.560> for

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
not that's not what we're looking for

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.310 
not that's not what we're looking for
go<00:04:02.640> back<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.120> other<00:04:03.150> way<00:04:03.390> go<00:04:03.720> back<00:04:03.990> through

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
go back the other way go back through

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.880 
go back the other way go back through
the<00:04:04.410> shorten<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.010> come<00:04:05.190> try<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.490> once<00:04:05.760> more

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
the shorten and come try it once more

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.670 
the shorten and come try it once more
so<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.280> forward<00:04:08.940> downward<00:04:09.680> maintaining

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
so it's forward downward maintaining

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.130 
so it's forward downward maintaining
contact<00:04:11.370> if<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.210> horse<00:04:12.420> goes<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> little

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
contact if the horse goes a little

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.199 
contact if the horse goes a little
behind<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.620> vertical<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.190> don't<00:04:14.400> care<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.730> sort<00:04:15.150> of

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
behind a vertical I don't care I sort of

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.349 
behind a vertical I don't care I sort of
almost<00:04:15.780> feel<00:04:16.020> like<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.410> horse<00:04:16.940> has<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:17.970> do<00:04:18.330> a

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
little behind the vertical to let his

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.670 
little behind the vertical to let his
back<00:04:20.580> go<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.239> there<00:04:21.959> are<00:04:22.020> some<00:04:22.200> people<00:04:22.470> say<00:04:22.650> oh

came<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:17.009> me<00:05:17.130> afterwards<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.849> said<00:05:18.090> am<00:05:18.479> I

came to me afterwards and said am I

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.300 
came to me afterwards and said am I
ready<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.870> go<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.139> second<00:05:19.620> level<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:19.979> would<00:05:20.039> say

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
ready to go to second level I would say

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.510 
ready to go to second level I would say
no<00:05:20.900> okay<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:21.960> need<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.590> work<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:23.039> little<00:05:23.190> bit

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
no okay you need to work a little bit

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.830 
no okay you need to work a little bit
more

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.750 

it's<00:05:32.530> a<00:05:32.650> good<00:05:32.919> turn<00:05:33.190> on<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.520> centerline

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.190 

second<00:05:39.760> half<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.240> circles<00:05:40.720> better<00:05:40.930> than

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
second half of the circles better than

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.800 
second half of the circles better than
the<00:05:41.320> first<00:05:41.560> half<00:05:42.210> tempo<00:05:43.210> was<00:05:43.389> a<00:05:43.419> little

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
the first half tempo was a little

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:52.020 
the first half tempo was a little
hurried<00:05:44.139> at<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.470> beginning<00:05:45.010> of<00:05:45.580> seven<00:05:51.030> seven

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
hurried at the beginning of seven seven

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.909 
hurried at the beginning of seven seven
there's<00:05:52.270> enough<00:05:52.600> good<00:05:52.840> things<00:05:52.900> a<00:05:53.350> trot<00:05:53.620> stayed

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
there's enough good things a trot stayed

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:05.820 
there's enough good things a trot stayed
the<00:05:54.100> same<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.460> angle<00:05:54.850> varied<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.300> little<00:05:55.450> bit

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.110 

so<00:06:06.830> you<00:06:06.890> can<00:06:07.220> see<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.550> worst<00:06:07.730> skin<00:06:07.910> on<00:06:08.030> the

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
so you can see the worst skin on the

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.090 
so you can see the worst skin on the
forehand<00:06:08.450> and<00:06:08.690> get<00:06:08.810> wide<00:06:09.020> behind<00:06:09.680> in<00:06:09.980> the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
forehand and get wide behind in the

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.490 
forehand and get wide behind in the
lengthening<00:06:10.660> so<00:06:11.860> still<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:12.890> six<00:06:13.370> but<00:06:14.350> with<00:06:15.350> the

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
lengthening so still a six but with the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.470 
lengthening so still a six but with the
comment<00:06:16.040> for<00:06:16.340> me<00:06:16.550> that<00:06:16.910> this<00:06:17.060> is<00:06:17.240> going<00:06:17.420> to

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
comment for me that this is going to

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:31.980 
comment for me that this is going to
create<00:06:17.840> big<00:06:18.170> problems<00:06:18.200> at<00:06:18.860> medium<00:06:19.250> tribe

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.840 

so<00:06:32.990> she<00:06:33.050> goes<00:06:33.320> out<00:06:33.620> a<00:06:33.950> little<00:06:34.220> bit<00:06:34.400> more<00:06:34.640> than

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
so she goes out a little bit more than

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.510 
so she goes out a little bit more than
she<00:06:34.880> goes<00:06:35.270> down<00:06:35.630> oh<00:06:36.080> she<00:06:36.350> says<00:06:36.770> oh<00:06:37.160> you<00:06:37.220> want

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
she goes down oh she says oh you want

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.120 
she goes down oh she says oh you want
that<00:06:37.580> okay<00:06:40.270> so<00:06:41.270> the<00:06:41.540> the<00:06:41.570> last<00:06:42.380> quarter<00:06:43.010> was

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
that okay so the the last quarter was

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.630 
that okay so the the last quarter was
actually<00:06:43.640> the<00:06:43.790> best<00:06:43.970> part<00:06:44.390> but<00:06:45.200> if<00:06:45.350> she<00:06:45.560> if<00:06:46.070> she

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
actually the best part but if she if she

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.400 
actually the best part but if she if she
did<00:06:46.850> that<00:06:46.880> in<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:47.330> show<00:06:47.510> it<00:06:47.630> still<00:06:47.900> stick<00:06:48.200> give

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
did that in the show it still stick give

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.010 
did that in the show it still stick give
us<00:06:48.560> six<00:06:48.860> and<00:06:49.190> just<00:06:49.220> say<00:06:50.060> it<00:06:50.180> goes<00:06:50.330> out<00:06:50.600> needs<00:06:50.900> to

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
us six and just say it goes out needs to

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.750 
us six and just say it goes out needs to
go<00:06:51.230> more<00:06:51.410> downwards<00:06:54.070> the<00:06:55.070> widening<00:06:55.490> and<00:06:55.670> the

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
go more downwards the widening and the

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.380 
go more downwards the widening and the
trot<00:06:57.430> sometimes<00:06:58.430> it's<00:06:58.700> a<00:06:58.790> strength<00:06:59.090> issue

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
trot sometimes it's a strength issue

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.450 
trot sometimes it's a strength issue
just<00:06:59.690> sometimes<00:07:00.140> it's<00:07:00.470> a<00:07:00.530> balance<00:07:01.040> usually

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
just sometimes it's a balance usually

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.960 
just sometimes it's a balance usually
it's<00:07:01.610> a<00:07:01.640> balance<00:07:02.090> live<00:07:02.540> strength<00:07:03.110> issue

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
it's a balance live strength issue

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.280 
it's a balance live strength issue
sometimes<00:07:04.970> those<00:07:05.180> stallions<00:07:05.480> it's<00:07:05.960> a<00:07:06.050> learned

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
sometimes those stallions it's a learned

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.210 
sometimes those stallions it's a learned
behavior<00:07:07.480> you<00:07:08.480> know<00:07:08.660> I<00:07:09.020> have<00:07:09.590> to<00:07:09.770> be<00:07:09.890> careful

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
behavior you know I have to be careful

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:17.460 
behavior you know I have to be careful
as<00:07:10.880> a<00:07:10.940> judge<00:07:11.480> that<00:07:12.410> I<00:07:12.800> don't<00:07:15.160> that<00:07:16.160> I<00:07:16.190> don't<00:07:16.520> say

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
as a judge that I don't that I don't say

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.860 
as a judge that I don't that I don't say
that's<00:07:18.470> because<00:07:19.190> of<00:07:19.370> this<00:07:19.630> because<00:07:20.630> you<00:07:20.750> know

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870 
that's because of this because you know

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.900 
that's because of this because you know
I<00:07:20.900> don't<00:07:21.080> really<00:07:21.620> know<00:07:22.040> I<00:07:22.070> see<00:07:22.400> the<00:07:22.520> horse<00:07:22.700> for

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
I don't really know I see the horse for

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.750 
I don't really know I see the horse for
six<00:07:23.150> minutes<00:07:23.390> so<00:07:24.200> I<00:07:24.530> just<00:07:24.770> have<00:07:25.040> to<00:07:25.280> put<00:07:25.550> down

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:25.760 
six minutes so I just have to put down

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.910 
six minutes so I just have to put down
my<00:07:25.790> reflections<00:07:26.660> I<00:07:26.810> have<00:07:26.930> to<00:07:27.050> say<00:07:27.260> that<00:07:27.650> horse

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:27.920 
my reflections I have to say that horse

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.910 
my reflections I have to say that horse
is<00:07:28.100> wide<00:07:28.280> behind<00:07:28.820> and<00:07:29.320> so<00:07:30.320> I'm<00:07:30.410> not<00:07:30.590> giving

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:30.920 
is wide behind and so I'm not giving

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.250 
is wide behind and so I'm not giving
more<00:07:31.070> than<00:07:31.220> a<00:07:31.250> six<00:07:31.580> and<00:07:31.790> then<00:07:31.910> I<00:07:31.940> have<00:07:32.210> to<00:07:32.570> hope

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
more than a six and then I have to hope

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.870 
more than a six and then I have to hope
that<00:07:33.530> she<00:07:33.710> has<00:07:33.770> a<00:07:33.830> trainer<00:07:34.250> that<00:07:34.520> will<00:07:34.700> read

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
that she has a trainer that will read

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.000 
that she has a trainer that will read
the<00:07:35.060> test<00:07:35.300> and<00:07:35.630> you<00:07:36.020> know<00:07:36.140> take<00:07:36.410> care<00:07:36.440> of<00:07:36.860> it

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.010 
the test and you know take care of it

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.610 
the test and you know take care of it
okay<00:07:37.450> so<00:07:38.450> I<00:07:38.570> think<00:07:38.660> it's<00:07:38.900> judges<00:07:39.260> we<00:07:39.380> have<00:07:39.410> to

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:39.620 
okay so I think it's judges we have to

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.650 
okay so I think it's judges we have to
be<00:07:39.770> a<00:07:39.800> little<00:07:39.980> bit<00:07:40.280> careful<00:07:40.490> what<00:07:41.480> we<00:07:41.510> say

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:41.660 
be a little bit careful what we say

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.020 
be a little bit careful what we say
sometimes<00:07:42.400> because<00:07:43.400> if<00:07:43.520> I<00:07:43.640> said<00:07:43.850> something

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.030 
sometimes because if I said something

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.120 
sometimes because if I said something
that<00:07:44.210> needs<00:07:44.570> to<00:07:44.810> go<00:07:44.930> more<00:07:45.169> forward<00:07:45.650> for<00:07:45.919> better

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.130 
that needs to go more forward for better

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.659 
that needs to go more forward for better
balance<00:07:47.500> that<00:07:48.500> would<00:07:48.740> probably<00:07:48.950> only<00:07:49.400> make<00:07:49.640> it

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:49.669 
balance that would probably only make it

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:51.820 
balance that would probably only make it
worse<00:07:50.000> you<00:07:50.540> know<00:07:50.690> so<00:07:50.900> we<00:07:51.020> have<00:07:51.050> to<00:07:51.260> be<00:07:51.380> careful

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:51.830 
worse you know so we have to be careful

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.320 
worse you know so we have to be careful
do<00:07:52.310> you<00:07:52.370> want<00:07:52.520> to<00:07:52.610> do<00:07:52.700> a<00:07:52.730> little<00:07:52.910> work<00:07:53.120> with

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:53.330 
do you want to do a little work with

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.840 
do you want to do a little work with
them<00:07:53.540> yep
