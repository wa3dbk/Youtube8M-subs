 funny and why because we're going to do 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.759
 that the levels bleed kaká gum and the 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.339
 global is a shit command because 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.859

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.180
 command is believed shit in minecraft download 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.250

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.269
 start well here we see here what 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.009

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.250
 video we give back and take a button 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.750
 and we give him and now he will start to create the 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.290
 command is worth as you see 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.989

 here you remove them that is to say is that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.559
 all this is eliminated worth what it is that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.409
 does the good command what the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.149
 command is to create 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.500
 that animals the animals themselves 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.550
 OK 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.760
 generate what has been poop 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.800

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:25.330
 horses 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.330
 here plates to our village gave us disgust 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.070
 sheep and pigs 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.780
 and here it will start to leave here 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.370
 will start how to do as here and what 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.370
 we have done 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.620
 to be here further 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.020
 we have a lot of pigs and now 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.719
 you will see how they start generating here 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.640
 that yes also what it does is that of 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.859
 bottom line if you're near them 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.810
 when you are going to release the reason will be 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.810
 valència background as a fart also 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.080
 adds that stink sound is very is very 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.260
 hardcore is worth seeing if we find it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.410
 mechanics let me a little bit of what 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.660
 your there is this village, you see what 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.560
 you see there does not just generate the first 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.240
 shit since they loved more shits 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.460
 As you can see, I already have three shits and 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.310
 they are accumulating good this here is 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.750
 an urbanc text is worth that's why it looks like this 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.950
 what he lets me do is download the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.599
 stadium information from these 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.240
 nice jeans 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.220
 that here is called the pop pack 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.870
 and you put it and ready and my other three 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.190
 what is this really doing 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.200
 command when I 'm when what they do 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.740
 It is mainly that horses 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.430
 sheep pigs chickens cows 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.010
 the temple cows et cetera et cetera 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.170
 and generate with every time that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.969
 you saw in agreement what does that do 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.819
 that cocca bevel texture so that what 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:55.079
 converts into kaká vale and also adds the 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.640
 fart sound man okay 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.620
 then it is a command to generate kaka 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.709
 that he has the good thing about this that when 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.599
 your character whatever it is worth as you see 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.639
 the cookies are going to make cookies 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.129
 kaka oily cookies with his song of 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:12.860
 cocoa that is how they will teach flat 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:15.590
 if the inks is empty kaka nothing 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.900
 the clay just like that of kaká and so 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.000
 everything you need to use the change is 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.680
 of kaka in fact 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.960

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.330
 plant 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.760
 so you see that they are guilty 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.290
 Well that's it and this is all that 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.720
