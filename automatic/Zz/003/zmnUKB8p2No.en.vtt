00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
pretty cool this is the only notable

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.560 
pretty cool this is the only notable
difference<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.460> gameplay<00:03:16.610> which<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.180> kind<00:03:17.480> of

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
difference in gameplay which is kind of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.480 
difference in gameplay which is kind of
a<00:03:17.630> downside<00:03:18.080> but<00:03:18.350> whatever<00:03:18.740> could<00:03:19.400> have

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
a downside but whatever could have

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.070 
a downside but whatever could have
tested<00:03:19.820> some<00:03:19.940> new<00:03:20.060> features<00:03:20.210> other<00:03:20.720> than<00:03:20.900> the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
tested some new features other than the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.570 
tested some new features other than the
triple<00:03:21.380> battle<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.770> double<00:03:22.040> while<00:03:22.190> battle

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500
