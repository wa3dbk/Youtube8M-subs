like Julian with a little skipped out
bottle<00:02:20.010> turn<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.580> then<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.849> right<00:02:21.450> behind

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
bottle turn and then this right behind

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.330 
bottle turn and then this right behind
it<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.959> know<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.349> a<00:02:22.410> long<00:02:22.650> barrel<00:02:22.920> now

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
it you know this is a long barrel now

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.979 
it you know this is a long barrel now
it's<00:02:23.580> really<00:02:23.790> tight<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.450> stop<00:02:24.720> at<00:02:24.900> a

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
it's really tight here to stop at a

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.460 
it's really tight here to stop at a
flange<00:02:25.349> down<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.830> line<00:02:26.450> really<00:02:27.450> clean<00:02:27.780> it's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
flange down the line really clean it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.589 
flange down the line really clean it's
just<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.739> matter<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.069> how<00:02:29.489> deep<00:02:30.060> he<00:02:30.209> got<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.569> it

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
just a matter of how deep he got on it

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.280 
just a matter of how deep he got on it
managed<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.440> throw<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.799> tourney<00:02:32.099> at<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.489> end<00:02:33.290> so

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
managed to throw a tourney at the end so

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.229 
managed to throw a tourney at the end so
the<00:02:34.739> front<00:02:35.069> on<00:02:35.250> angle<00:02:35.610> will<00:02:35.910> give<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.209> a

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
the front on angle will give you a

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.570 
the front on angle will give you a
better<00:02:36.900> idea<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.319> exactly<00:02:37.620> how<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.310> you

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
better idea of exactly how do you

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
better idea of exactly how do you
because<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.209> what<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> judges<00:02:39.660> are<00:02:39.989> like

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
because that's what the judges are like

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.470
