hello this is tape with black grout
doors<00:00:04.080> black<00:00:04.500> doors<00:00:05.040> net<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.000> we<00:00:06.420> wanted<00:00:06.660> to

doors black doors net and we wanted to

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.509 
doors black doors net and we wanted to
talk<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> little<00:00:07.170> bit<00:00:07.319> about<00:00:07.410> splitting<00:00:08.160> wood

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
talk a little bit about splitting wood

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.910 
talk a little bit about splitting wood
today<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.210> some<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> techniques<00:00:10.710> we've

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
today and some of the techniques we've

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.720 
today and some of the techniques we've
come<00:00:11.099> up<00:00:11.130> for<00:00:11.370> that

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
come up for that

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.999 
come up for that
now<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.450> first<00:00:13.170> log<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.500> want<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.769> show<00:00:13.950> you

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
now the first log you want to show you

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.630 
now the first log you want to show you
is<00:00:14.190> splitting<00:00:14.610> who<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.570> regular<00:00:15.870> old

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
is splitting who is just a regular old

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.929 
is splitting who is just a regular old
log<00:00:18.020> and<00:00:19.020> as<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.320> can<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.710> when<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.580> split

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
log and as you can see when you split

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.349 
log and as you can see when you split
them<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.869> wood<00:00:22.109> goes<00:00:22.529> both<00:00:22.980> ways<00:00:23.300> and<00:00:24.300> then

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
them the wood goes both ways and then

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849 
them the wood goes both ways and then
you<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.869> pick<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> put<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you have to pick it up you have to put a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.609 
you have to pick it up you have to put a
backup<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> logs<00:00:26.699> put<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> again<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:28.230> one

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
backup of the logs put it again now one

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.279 
backup of the logs put it again now one
thing<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.949> found<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.599> start<00:00:31.019> with

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
thing we found is that if we start with

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.940 
thing we found is that if we start with
a<00:00:31.859> log<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:33.030> we've<00:00:33.180> set<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.690> tire<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
a log that we've set up a tire this is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.430 
a log that we've set up a tire this is
just<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.309> old<00:00:35.430> used<00:00:35.670> tire<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.440> we've

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
just an old used tire here we've

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.639 
just an old used tire here we've
recycled<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.940> start<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.510> an<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.200> block<00:00:40.469> like

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
recycled we start on an on a block like

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
recycled we start on an on a block like
this<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.340> movable<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.030> move<00:00:42.149> this

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
this one it's movable we can move this

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
this one it's movable we can move this
anywhere<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.750> want<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.050> we've<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> tire

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
anywhere we want to go we've got a tire

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.689 
anywhere we want to go we've got a tire
on<00:00:44.520> top<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.170> sit<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.680> start<00:00:49.680> by

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.959 

taking<00:00:53.699> off<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.270> corners<00:00:55.610> then<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.820> just

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
taking off just corners then we can just

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.959 
taking off just corners then we can just
walk<00:00:57.210> around<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:01.070> split<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> whole<00:01:02.430> log<00:01:02.699> up

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
walk around and split the whole log up

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:13.740 
walk around and split the whole log up
just<00:01:03.809> walking<00:01:03.989> around<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:41.520 

well<00:01:14.320> having<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.800> fall<00:01:15.070> off<00:01:15.310> every<00:01:15.580> single

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.890 

and<00:01:42.530> if<00:01:42.620> we<00:01:42.740> want<00:01:43.010> we<00:01:43.160> action<00:01:43.520> Rebecca<00:01:43.900> double

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
and if we want we action Rebecca double

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.960 
and if we want we action Rebecca double
split<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.320> in<00:01:46.310> a<00:01:46.490> store<00:01:46.730> just<00:01:50.140> come<00:01:51.140> back<00:01:51.320> in<00:01:51.970> so

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
split it in a store just come back in so

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:01.170 
split it in a store just come back in so
maybe<00:01:53.210> we're<00:01:53.390> trying<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.720> akin<00:01:54.020> Lee

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.240 

we'll<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.330> keep<00:02:02.510> walking<00:02:02.930> down<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:07.070> put

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
we'll just keep walking down I just put

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.040 
we'll just keep walking down I just put
it<00:02:07.340> up<00:02:07.430> without<00:02:08.179> having<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.510> pick<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.810> up<00:02:08.899> off

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
it up without having to pick it up off

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.980 
it up without having to pick it up off
the<00:02:09.080> ground<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:11.030> get<00:02:11.209> smaller<00:02:11.510> chunks<00:02:11.900> like

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
the ground we get smaller chunks like

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.640 
the ground we get smaller chunks like
this<00:02:12.910> they<00:02:13.910> would<00:02:14.060> fall<00:02:14.360> over<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:15.320> were<00:02:15.410> trying

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
this they would fall over we were trying

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.670 
this they would fall over we were trying
to<00:02:15.680> split<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:15.980> by<00:02:16.100> itself<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.300> we<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.780> split

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
to split it by itself and we can split

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.650 
to split it by itself and we can split
them<00:02:18.830> smaller<00:02:19.160> than<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:20.240> works<00:02:20.450> really

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
them smaller than that it works really

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.650 
them smaller than that it works really
great<00:02:20.840> for<00:02:21.340> logs<00:02:22.340> let's<00:02:22.700> say<00:02:22.910> they're<00:02:23.540> not

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
great for logs let's say they're not

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.530 
great for logs let's say they're not
shaped<00:02:24.050> on<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.440> bottom<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:26.209> know<00:02:26.330> maybe

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
shaped on the bottom you know maybe

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.390 
shaped on the bottom you know maybe
there's<00:02:26.780> something<00:02:27.110> that's<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.560> little<00:02:27.800> off<00:02:28.100> or

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
there's something that's a little off or

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.060 
there's something that's a little off or
we<00:02:28.490> didn't<00:02:28.730> cut<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:28.880> quite<00:02:29.150> right<00:02:29.420> or<00:02:30.070> just

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
we didn't cut it quite right or just

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.949 
we didn't cut it quite right or just
something<00:02:31.340> we<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.760> hit<00:02:31.970> several<00:02:32.690> times

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
something we have to hit several times

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.010 
something we have to hit several times
to<00:02:33.140> get<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.350> split<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:35.690> taped<00:02:35.930> with

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
to get it to split so this is taped with

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.880 
to get it to split so this is taped with
black<00:02:36.230> grout<00:02:36.470> doors<00:02:36.709> like<00:02:37.070> road<00:02:37.310> or<00:02:37.430> go<00:02:37.640> ahead
