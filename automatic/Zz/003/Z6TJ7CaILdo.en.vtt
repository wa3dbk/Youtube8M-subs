00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.240
 I 'm going to show you the knives 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.910
 needed to cut ham 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.730
 the first knife that we will use is 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.140
 a knife with a broad and hard blade 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.050
 you can see is a knife that does not 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.150
 can bend and has a length of 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.930
 sheet roughly about 20 to 22 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.779
 centimeters we will use it to des 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.820
 crust and to clean the ham you can 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.650
 use a smaller one if you think that 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.620
 This can be too big and 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.329
 little very unmanageable 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.540
 the next knife that we will use 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.670
 is the so-called sprig is of leaf 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.440
 narrow and as you can see has little 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.050
 flexibility has something but but very 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.750
 little has a sheet length of more or 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.059
 minus 67 centimeters as you can see 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.070
 this ends in rounded but has no 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.649
 why be the lace like this can be 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.460
 totally straight and we will use it to 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.040
 Separate ham meat from bone 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.780
 when we come to certain towards others 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.610
 areas such as the bone of the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.700
 hip makes it much easier to cut 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.700
 Ham 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.600
 and the third and last knife that 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.450
 we will use is the so-called knife 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.929
 ham that you can see is leaf 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.770
 narrow and very very flexible which is what 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.340
 that the knives are asked jamoneros 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.609
 is a knife that has a length of 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.009
 26 to 27 centimeters that and each one 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.520
 you can choose the length that you 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.560
 may like more as you can see what 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.319
 length of the knife has alveoli 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.390
 both on the one hand and on the other that 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.600
 what they do is cut when the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.539
 ham separate the easiest slice of the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.310
 knife is not essential that the 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.450
 ham knife have those alveoli 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.450
 but yes it is recommended 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.240
 apart from the knives to make 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 the cut of ham we will also need 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.390
 use a shawl and as a supplement 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.560
 we can use some pieces to be able 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.929
 take the slice of the ham 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.030
 we will use the chaira to settle 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.720
 the edge as we have already explained in others 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.319
 videos la chaira does not sharpen simply 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.420
 seat the edge we will use it for 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.230
 can seat the edge of the knife 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.569
 ham holder from time to time because to the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.849
 time to cut the ham on the knife 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.280
 ham holder loses the edge and then 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.349
 interesting to be able to cut 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.290
 correct the ham from time to time 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.530
 set the edge of the ham knife in 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.209
 another video you can see how to use how 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.810
 use the shawl to set the edge 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.810
 ham knife
