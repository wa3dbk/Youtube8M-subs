00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:12.120
 that is the condition before the assembly in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.450
 Baumarkt from a cook plate 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.850
 we cut ten inches of pieces 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.510
 Let's have it complete here 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.510
 built up 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.320
 so now i have the tv 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.540
 decreased and therefore comes with all 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.460
 Connect away so I have now 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.750
 first six holes drilled the old one 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.890
 holes are still on the old track 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 therefore I he had exchanged is 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.430
 already the new wall holder and 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.570
 become the second three and a half now 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.170
 Now tighten ambushes on the wall 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.850
 with everything very stable out so now 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.380
 screw with the names of the man 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.869
 and I just have a little bit 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.869
 prepared to help with marco peters 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.840
 especially as the women are solid and the eu as b 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.660
 I already have a plan right now 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:48.500
 Aligned and closet has enough 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:50.840
 means important is screw sunk now 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.870
 I get the laundry a usb plates 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.380
 for sockets and antenna and so on 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.850
 and here's for the wall 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.850
 the dax disappears completely 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.410
 sunk before that is easy 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.610
 helpful is a template because the 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.610
 distances are indeed in the forest lag 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.410
 pull the next row from that 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.560
 slate laminate fixed and also one 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.830
 bit stuck because only brand can 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.750
 yes yes screw because of the goal new 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.430
 someone's expert 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.180
 on the edge was that of the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.180
 bar overlaid 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.650
 The laminate sessions almost to the ceiling 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.880
 with the kreml 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.390
 it is necessary to use the sticks around 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.390
 glued 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.530
 so we are almost finished now 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.629
 television only needs to sell 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.480
 yet to be done so now before we 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:04:00.290
 the alu bar I have here 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:03.860
 still the led know less 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.519
 test works fine 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.769
 appearance 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.209
 and a little bit of the glue to the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:13.519
 afford and fixed in a few days 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.709
 Debtors of the expert is very nice 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.459
 from that if you the background there 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.459
 not recognizable
