think<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:29.230> a<00:00:29.259> very<00:00:29.589> very<00:00:29.890> simple<00:00:30.310> process<00:00:30.579> that

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
think is a very very simple process that

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.380 
think is a very very simple process that
has<00:00:32.740> eight<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.160> he<00:00:33.280> says<00:00:33.490> triple<00:00:33.850> on<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.180> side

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.750 
has eight and he says triple on the side
and<00:00:34.690> just<00:00:34.780> simply<00:00:35.140> remove<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:36.160> release<00:00:36.310> liner

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
and just simply remove the release liner

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.510 
and just simply remove the release liner
to<00:00:37.450> connect<00:00:37.810> the<00:00:37.930> sides<00:00:38.170> together<00:00:44.520> after

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
to connect the sides together after

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.090 
to connect the sides together after
they've<00:00:45.640> been<00:00:45.790> laid<00:00:46.000> in<00:00:46.030> place<00:00:46.650> it<00:00:47.650> creates<00:00:48.010> a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
they've been laid in place it creates a

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.110
