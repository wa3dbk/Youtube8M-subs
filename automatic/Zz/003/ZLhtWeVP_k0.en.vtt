just<00:01:08.549> takes<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.299> step<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:09.810> looking

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
just takes it one step up from looking

very natural and just kind of fills in
those<00:01:12.510> gaps<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.409> holes<00:01:13.439> where<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> might<00:01:14.220> be

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.629 
you might have to try it a couple times
and<00:02:56.170> then<00:02:56.290> redo<00:02:56.799> it<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.130> try<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> couple<00:02:57.519> more

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
and then redo it and try a couple more

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.220 
and then redo it and try a couple more
times<00:02:57.880> but<00:02:58.480> there's<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> couple<00:02:58.900> tricks<00:02:59.079> to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
times but there's a couple tricks to

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.229 
times but there's a couple tricks to
make<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.500> super<00:02:59.739> easy<00:02:59.799> so<00:03:00.400> break<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.819> down<00:03:01.030> for

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
make it super easy so break it down for

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.640 
make it super easy so break it down for
me<00:03:01.269> because<00:03:01.480> as<00:03:01.660> far<00:03:01.720> as<00:03:01.989> I'm<00:03:02.170> concerned<00:03:02.200> I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
me because as far as I'm concerned I

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.870 
me because as far as I'm concerned I
think<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:02.950> only<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.250> four<00:03:03.459> simple<00:03:03.760> steps

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
think it's only like four simple steps

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.420 
think it's only like four simple steps
right<00:03:04.359> I<00:03:04.450> know<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.870> it's<00:03:05.109> very<00:03:05.260> simple<00:03:05.500> one

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
right I know it is it's very simple one

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.220 
right I know it is it's very simple one
of<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.639> tricks<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.120> used<00:03:07.510> in<00:03:07.780> order<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.109> do

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
of the tricks that I used in order to do

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.660 
of the tricks that I used in order to do
this<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.650> what<00:03:08.799> I<00:03:08.829> like<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.160> explain<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.549> other

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
this and what I like to explain to other

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.879 
this and what I like to explain to other
people<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.090> order<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.359> do<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.540> at<00:03:10.660> home<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:11.170> you

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
people in order to do it at home is you

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.710 
people in order to do it at home is you
start<00:03:12.160> off<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.400> same<00:03:12.609> principle<00:03:13.239> by<00:03:13.389> doing

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
start off the same principle by doing

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.199 
start off the same principle by doing
the<00:03:14.139> little<00:03:14.560> dots<00:03:14.859> or<00:03:15.130> dashes<00:03:15.160> along<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.030> lash

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
the little dots or dashes along the lash

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.300 
the little dots or dashes along the lash
line<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.750> then<00:03:17.169> you<00:03:17.290> just<00:03:17.500> kind<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:17.739> create<00:03:18.130> a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
line and then you just kind of create a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.940 
line and then you just kind of create a
45<00:03:18.849> degree<00:03:19.000> angle<00:03:19.209> flick<00:03:19.810> at<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:19.989> end<00:03:20.109> of<00:03:20.380> your

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
45 degree angle flick at the end of your

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.740 
45 degree angle flick at the end of your
and<00:03:21.310> then<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.849> finish<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.150> off<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.569> would<00:03:22.629> just

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
and then to finish it off you would just

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.270 
and then to finish it off you would just
connect<00:03:23.080> these<00:03:23.170> two<00:03:23.379> lines<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.890> fill<00:03:24.040> in<00:03:24.160> that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
connect these two lines and fill in that

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.729 
connect these two lines and fill in that
little<00:03:24.550> triangle<00:03:24.790> very<00:03:25.510> easy<00:03:25.810> awesome<00:03:26.530> so

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
little triangle very easy awesome so

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.220 
little triangle very easy awesome so
it's<00:03:26.920> like<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.400> swoop<00:03:27.819> a<00:03:28.030> flick<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.810> then<00:03:28.959> fill

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
it's like a swoop a flick and then fill

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.580 
it's like a swoop a flick and then fill
yeah<00:03:30.160> fantastic<00:03:30.459> yeah<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.420> there's<00:03:32.379> quite

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
yeah fantastic yeah and so there's quite

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.140 
yeah fantastic yeah and so there's quite
a<00:03:32.709> spectrum<00:03:33.280> when<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.489> comes<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.819> cat<00:03:33.970> eyes

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
a spectrum when it comes to cat eyes

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.759 
a spectrum when it comes to cat eyes
there's<00:03:34.420> like<00:03:34.510> the<00:03:34.629> lauren<00:03:34.900> conrad<00:03:35.410> end<00:03:35.709> of

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
there's like the lauren conrad end of

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.080 
there's like the lauren conrad end of
the<00:03:35.830> spectrum<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.430> then<00:03:36.760> there's<00:03:36.910> like<00:03:37.060> the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
the spectrum and then there's like the

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.540 
the spectrum and then there's like the
any<00:03:37.510> Winehouse<00:03:37.989> yes<00:03:38.620> I've<00:03:38.800> turned<00:03:39.040> up<00:03:39.130> they

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
any Winehouse yes I've turned up they

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.970 
any Winehouse yes I've turned up they
didn't<00:03:39.760> go<00:03:39.880> any<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.239> between<00:03:40.569> you<00:03:40.959> in<00:03:41.680> order<00:03:41.950> to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
didn't go any in between you in order to

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.220 
didn't go any in between you in order to
take<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.819> more<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.060> a<00:03:43.120> natural<00:03:43.360> cat<00:03:43.900> eye<00:03:43.930> which

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
take it more of a natural cat eye which

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.050 
take it more of a natural cat eye which
i<00:03:44.349> think<00:03:44.500> is<00:03:44.620> what<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:44.980> prefer<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.910> would

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
i think is what you prefer you would

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.150 
i think is what you prefer you would
just<00:03:46.150> kind<00:03:46.300> of<00:03:46.390> make<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.569> very<00:03:46.810> thin<00:03:47.160> lashline

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160
