on<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> steel<00:00:20.159> used<00:00:20.429> on<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.669> guy<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.449> can

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
on the steel used on this guy you can

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
on the steel used on this guy you can
see<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:22.019> they're<00:00:22.140> using<00:00:22.169> that<00:00:22.439> same

see here they're using that same
scalloped<00:00:23.099> steel<00:00:23.339> design<00:00:23.669> so<00:00:23.880> it's<00:00:23.999> gonna

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
scalloped steel design so it's gonna

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.120 
scalloped steel design so it's gonna
decrease<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:24.749> weight<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.079> little<00:00:25.380> bit<00:00:25.499> as<00:00:25.650> well

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
they call a rugged armor basically it's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
they call a rugged armor basically it's
a<00:01:06.930> similar<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> Serling<00:01:08.250> type<00:01:08.430> material<00:01:08.790> so

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
a similar to a Serling type material so

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.300 
a similar to a Serling type material so
it's<00:01:08.970> gonna<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> very<00:01:09.660> like<00:01:10.020> hard<00:01:10.380> design

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it's gonna have a very like hard design

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's gonna have a very like hard design
to<00:01:11.490> its<00:01:11.730> conferring<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.450> good<00:01:12.660> protection

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to its conferring some good protection

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
to its conferring some good protection
but<00:01:13.980> also<00:01:14.160> it's<00:01:14.370> got<00:01:14.460> offer<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> great<00:01:15.000> level

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
but also it's got offer a great level

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
but also it's got offer a great level
support<00:01:15.480> on<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.230> is<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> fairly<00:01:16.590> stiff<00:01:16.980> skate

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
support on this is a fairly stiff skate

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
support on this is a fairly stiff skate
so<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.640> definitely<00:01:18.000> gonna<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.390> great<00:01:18.690> for

as well as the u plus 12 and this is
gonna<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.550> exhaust<00:01:33.000> system<00:01:33.240> tongue<00:01:33.690> but

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
gonna be the exhaust system tongue but

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.900 
gonna be the exhaust system tongue but
it's<00:01:34.170> also<00:01:34.320> gonna<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> u<00:01:35.100> +<00:01:35.340> foams<00:01:35.670> on

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
it's also gonna have that u + foams on

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.610 
it's also gonna have that u + foams on
it<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.510> that's<00:01:36.600> gonna<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:36.960> black<00:01:37.260> foam

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
it so that's gonna be the black foam

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.590 
it so that's gonna be the black foam
right<00:01:37.800> here<00:01:38.070> um<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.700> down<00:01:39.030> below<00:01:39.090> the

right here um you can see down below the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
right here um you can see down below the
laces<00:01:40.110> where<00:01:40.620> it<00:01:40.710> actually<00:01:40.890> has<00:01:41.220> those<00:01:41.430> vents

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
laces where it actually has those vents

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.250 
laces where it actually has those vents
to<00:01:42.000> allow<00:01:42.120> some<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.480> heat<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.720> exit<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
to allow some of the heat to exit the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.080 
to allow some of the heat to exit the
skate<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.220> u<00:01:44.430> foam<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> gonna<00:01:44.970> actually

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
skate but that u foam is gonna actually

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.180 
skate but that u foam is gonna actually
allow<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.720> mold<00:01:45.960> around<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> skate<00:01:46.650> or

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
allow it to mold around the skate or

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.620 
allow it to mold around the skate or
around<00:01:47.580> your<00:01:47.730> foot<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.150> it's<00:01:48.270> gonna<00:01:48.390> offer<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
around your foot so it's gonna offer a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.360 
around your foot so it's gonna offer a
more<00:01:48.780> customized<00:01:49.380> fit<00:01:49.710> than<00:01:49.980> some<00:01:50.190> of<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
more customized fit than some of the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.340 
more customized fit than some of the
more<00:01:50.520> traditional<00:01:50.670> tongues<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.110> still

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
more traditional tongues but it still

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.890 
more traditional tongues but it still
has<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.920> traditional<00:01:53.640> felt<00:01:53.970> backing<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:54.720> as

has a traditional felt backing to it as

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.600 
has a traditional felt backing to it as
you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.140> see<00:01:55.200> there<00:01:55.620> it<00:01:55.830> has<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.370> stitching

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
you can see there it has the stitching

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.890 
you can see there it has the stitching
down<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> center<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.300> it's<00:01:57.510> really<00:01:57.660> gonna

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
down the center so it's really gonna

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.260 
down the center so it's really gonna
offer<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.530> nice<00:01:59.100> comfortable<00:01:59.490> fit<00:01:59.760> allow<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.150> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
offer a nice comfortable fit allow it to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.960 
offer a nice comfortable fit allow it to
wrap<00:02:00.480> around<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:01.020> shin<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:02.190> may<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.790> has<00:02:02.940> a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
wrap around the shin it may it has a

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.670 
wrap around the shin it may it has a
little<00:02:03.180> bit<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.570> shorter<00:02:04.050> tongue<00:02:04.350> kind<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
little bit of a shorter tongue kind of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.380 
little bit of a shorter tongue kind of
compared<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.160> some<00:02:05.370> so<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.120> gonna<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

little<00:02:09.899> break<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.200> flop<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.860> tongue<00:02:11.069> down

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
little break and flop the tongue down

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.600 
little break and flop the tongue down
and<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.240> we<00:02:12.420> go<00:02:12.540> ahead<00:02:12.840> inside<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> skate<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and as we go ahead inside the skate you

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.229 
and as we go ahead inside the skate you
can<00:02:14.730> see<00:02:14.970> here<00:02:15.210> they're<00:02:15.360> using<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.660> nice

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
can see here they're using a nice

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.790 
can see here they're using a nice
what<00:02:16.510> they're<00:02:16.630> calling<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> duratec<00:02:17.500> liner

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
what they're calling the duratec liner

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.770 
what they're calling the duratec liner
so<00:02:18.489> it's<00:02:18.640> gonna<00:02:18.790> offer<00:02:19.060> some<00:02:19.420> moisture

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
so it's gonna offer some moisture

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.030 
so it's gonna offer some moisture
wicking<00:02:19.930> properties<00:02:20.200> as<00:02:20.650> well<00:02:20.770> as<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> nice

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
wicking properties as well as a nice

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.460 
wicking properties as well as a nice
secure<00:02:21.489> grip<00:02:21.520> on<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.030> foot<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:23.110> then<00:02:23.230> also

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
secure grip on the foot and then also

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.620 
secure grip on the foot and then also
why<00:02:23.739> we're<00:02:23.890> looking<00:02:24.099> inside<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.700> skate<00:02:24.970> this

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
why we're looking inside the skate this

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.330 
why we're looking inside the skate this
is<00:02:25.780> gonna<00:02:25.900> be<00:02:26.170> an<00:02:26.709> area<00:02:27.040> where<00:02:27.190> they've

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
is gonna be an area where they've

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.339 
is gonna be an area where they've
actually<00:02:27.489> upgraded<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.420> foams<00:02:28.720> from

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
actually upgraded the foams from

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.530 
actually upgraded the foams from
previous<00:02:29.739> year<00:02:29.980> CCM<00:02:30.459> skates<00:02:30.760> um<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.420> it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
previous year CCM skates um so it's

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.759 
previous year CCM skates um so it's
gonna<00:02:31.630> have<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> little<00:02:31.900> more<00:02:32.050> comfortable<00:02:32.470> fit

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
gonna have a little more comfortable fit

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.780 
gonna have a little more comfortable fit
initially<00:02:33.400> also<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:35.590> goes<00:02:35.800> for<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.190> overall

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
initially also that goes for the overall

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.430 
initially also that goes for the overall
design<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> skate<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:37.720> gonna<00:02:37.870> be<00:02:38.080> just<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
design of the skate it's gonna be just a

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.680 
design of the skate it's gonna be just a
little<00:02:38.620> more<00:02:39.209> comfortable<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.269> little<00:02:40.330> more

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
little more comfortable a little more

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.229 
little more comfortable a little more
improved<00:02:41.170> fit<00:02:41.530> from<00:02:41.830> previous<00:02:42.280> CCM<00:02:42.700> model<00:02:43.030> sim

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
improved fit from previous CCM model sim

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.330 
improved fit from previous CCM model sim
so<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:43.599> always<00:02:43.840> nice<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.080> see<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:45.220> then

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
so it's always nice to see and then

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.520 
so it's always nice to see and then
finally<00:02:45.849> we'll<00:02:46.300> go<00:02:46.420> ahead<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.660> take<00:02:47.050> out<00:02:47.319> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
finally we'll go ahead and take out the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.759 
finally we'll go ahead and take out the
footbed<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.670> skate<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:50.380> see<00:02:50.590> what

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
footbed on this skate to see what

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.410 
footbed on this skate to see what
they're<00:02:50.920> using<00:02:51.069> they're<00:02:51.340> fairly<00:02:52.269> traditional

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
they're using they're fairly traditional

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.320 
they're using they're fairly traditional
footbed<00:02:53.049> that's<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.290> brushed<00:02:53.620> felt<00:02:54.430> or<00:02:54.880> brushed

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
footbed that's a brushed felt or brushed

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330 
footbed that's a brushed felt or brushed
nylon<00:02:55.780> footbed<00:02:56.410> as<00:02:56.560> well<00:02:56.709> as<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:56.830> very<00:02:56.980> thin

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
nylon footbed as well as a very thin

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.430 
nylon footbed as well as a very thin
design<00:02:57.850> cradles<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.690> heel<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> little<00:02:59.140> bit<00:02:59.230> for

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
design cradles the heel a little bit for

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.259 
design cradles the heel a little bit for
a<00:02:59.470> little<00:02:59.650> additional<00:02:59.950> support<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:01.209> that's

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
a little additional support so that's

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.380 
a little additional support so that's
