blend<00:01:07.560> nicely<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:08.219> why<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.789> play<00:01:09.509> powder

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

her eye a bit like the sunset and I lift

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.500 
her eye a bit like the sunset and I lift
her<00:02:37.020> eyebrow<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.800> slightly<00:02:38.340> shimmery<00:02:38.880> beige

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510

her eyebrow it's slightly shimmery beige
color<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:40.740> put<00:02:41.100> also<00:02:41.370> here<00:02:42.060> on<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.930> bar

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310

under<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> eyebrow<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.120> then<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.390> looks

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
under the eyebrow because then it looks

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.530 
under the eyebrow because then it looks
like<00:02:45.810> she<00:02:46.020> has<00:02:46.230> more<00:02:46.800> space<00:02:47.310> here<00:02:47.730> when<00:02:48.510> I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
like she has more space here when I

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.850 
like she has more space here when I
start<00:02:48.990> not<00:02:49.230> open<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.910> looks<00:02:51.150> brighter

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
start not open that it looks brighter

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.410 
start not open that it looks brighter
that's<00:02:52.860> why<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.310> apply<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:53.880> one<00:02:54.120> slightly

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
that's why we apply this one slightly

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.570 
that's why we apply this one slightly
lowered<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.080> now<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.350> can<00:02:55.620> go<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:56.310> one
