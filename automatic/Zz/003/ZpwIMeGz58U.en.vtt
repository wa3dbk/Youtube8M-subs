00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
the ram 1500 is wait better than this

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
now this is a 2013 ram 1500 RT and as

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.160 
now this is a 2013 ram 1500 RT and as
you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:05.820> look<00:01:06.119> aight<00:01:06.540> ty<00:01:06.810> 4<00:01:07.049> inch

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you can see look aight ty 4 inch
