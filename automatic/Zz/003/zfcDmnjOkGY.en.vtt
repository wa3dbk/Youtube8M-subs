00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:21.000
If you think about the cars of the eastern european sector, such cars will come
to your mind: Dacias, Zastavas, Ladas in a very poor shape at a "MERKUR" car depot.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:26.200
However, you would defenetly not think on two words:

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:29.947
exotic, and V8 engine.

00:00:30.482 --> 00:00:36.053
Well, on this little hole, there is a V8, that is breathing,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.050
an 1971 built Tatra 603's V8 engine.

00:00:51.285 --> 00:00:56.133
Tatra, made in Czechslovakia, not Czech Republic,
Czechslovakia

00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:02.405
Yes, it's a socialist car a bit

00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:05.405
Let's count:

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.090
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.009
8 cylinders, air cooling, in the rear! 
This is really exotic, for real!

00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:28.065
This is an almost flat bolster

00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:31.183
one piece of the professional aerodynamic planning.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.107
Which they started to use at the Tatra from the early '30s,
before anybody else.

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:40.102
And this is the 2nd generation Tatra 603 nose

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.000
This is why it has 4 headlights, not 3 with 1 in the middle, 
like in the 1st generation Tatras.

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:55.207
Which was under a plexi cover.

00:01:55.955 --> 00:02:01.300
And it's just because for the air could run more smoothly
around the most beautiful shape of the socialism.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.020
Finaly, not a car, that steals american design,
this has a pure, genuine design.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.327
In those times there was plenty of chrome.
They mined a lot in the eastern block too.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.300
Tatra is long as the new BMW 7series or Mercedes S or Opel Omega
so this is a very huge car.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.310
I'll measure it: The front is not long,
because there's nothing interesting in it.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
The interior is very big, 
there's a lot of room inside

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And behind the rear axle is the engine room,
with the air cooled V8 inside!

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.500
Dictatorship is an excellent thing, 
if you ranked high enough,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because you can sit in the back of a Tatra,
and find intresting little details.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.912
For example the hooks 
and roof lamp 

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.999
In those times they could make
this nice pieces.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.500
When they don't have to make everything
from cheap plastic.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.733
And the well-made armrest with the little
"door" that fits in the hole

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:46.400
Just because to hide
the ugly hole.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.000
You can't see this in todays modern
luxury cars.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:08.500
Big time of my life has come, Ferrari, Rolls, Porsche
is one thing, but a Tatra, is a Tatra.

00:04:09.224 --> 00:04:13.863
Let's go, curiosity kills me.
So, away and up. (1st gear)

00:04:14.694 --> 00:04:18.650
And handbrake.
Turn it a bit and release.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Not bad sound, and not bad acceleration either,
105 HP, and top speed of 160 Km/h.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:59.010
The ride is smooth, and suprisingly, it is very stable -
not like some US cars, because the conscientious czech engineers made it so.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:10.000
undercarriage is ment to be smooth at the first,
so the bit boat feeling is not a problem.

00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:23.235
On long distance rallyes the had very good results,
and had even won a few.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.020
This car is about beeing the coolest in the Polical life,
and about excellent riding.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.030
No steering servo, but we have brake servo,
and with all this, it isnt hard to drive the car.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:46.040
The very good thing is that it has excellent dynamics...

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.050
...in third gear, you step on the pedal,
and it accelerates very distinct.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Talking about beeing a rater modern car: we have 4 disc brakes
which is unusual in eastern europe

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:14.047
We're going with 70 Km/h, and we're
travelling in a traveller limousine.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.010
it's strong as a heavy weight boxer, 
not like an athlete.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:48.020
At 90Km/h, it does 12l on 100km, on long distance
aprox 10-11l, in city above 20l. - But its a V8...

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.735
Everything is great, 
and I love it.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:37.040
I feel sadness, because I have to give it back,
and of course I'm very jealous. I just want one.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.550
I think I always wanted a Tatra.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.000
BMW M5 s...
boxsters, Ferraris...

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.010
Just plastic toys.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.020
Air cooling, rear engine,
V8, Tatra. Give it to me.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.030
