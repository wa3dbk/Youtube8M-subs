realize this is really applies across

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.809 
realize this is really applies across
the<00:02:50.069> board<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.000> what<00:02:51.209> we<00:02:51.330> have<00:02:51.569> access<00:02:52.350> to

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
the board and so what we have access to

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.280 
the board and so what we have access to
what's<00:02:53.819> available<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.420> us<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.989> what<00:02:55.110> we're

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
what's available to us and what we're

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.850 
what's available to us and what we're
told<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.830> good<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.930> often<00:02:57.930> far<00:02:58.230> different<00:02:58.799> than

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
told is good is often far different than

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.940 
told is good is often far different than
what<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.310> should<00:02:59.940> be<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.440> for<00:03:01.440> myself

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
what it really should be and for myself

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.180 
what it really should be and for myself
I<00:03:02.250> found<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.209> disturbing<00:03:03.870> I've<00:03:04.709> used<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
I found that disturbing I've used the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.339 
I found that disturbing I've used the
term<00:03:05.510> Franken<00:03:06.510> supplements<00:03:07.200> because

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
term Franken supplements because

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.430 
term Franken supplements because
supplements<00:03:08.250> unfortunately<00:03:09.150> follow<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
supplements unfortunately follow the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.289 
supplements unfortunately follow the
same<00:03:10.709> patterns<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:11.819> now<00:03:11.970> we've<00:03:12.120> got

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
same patterns and so now we've got

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.180 
same patterns and so now we've got
frankenfoods<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.319> we<00:03:13.440> have<00:03:13.530> access<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
frankenfoods that we have access to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.339 
frankenfoods that we have access to
every<00:03:14.340> day<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.060> then<00:03:15.660> we<00:03:15.750> try<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.959> make<00:03:16.170> up

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
every day and then we try to make up

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.410 
every day and then we try to make up
that<00:03:16.530> difference<00:03:16.769> between<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:18.120> know<00:03:18.209> what

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
that difference between you know what

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.569 
that difference between you know what
we're<00:03:18.570> eating<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.680> nutrition<00:03:20.100> we're<00:03:20.250> getting

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
we're eating the nutrition we're getting

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.890 
we're eating the nutrition we're getting
and<00:03:20.700> what<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:20.910> should<00:03:21.150> be<00:03:21.329> getting<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.840> we

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
and what we should be getting and we

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.020 
and what we should be getting and we
wind<00:03:22.140> up<00:03:22.290> taking<00:03:22.500> Franken<00:03:23.280> supplements<00:03:23.910> and

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
wind up taking Franken supplements and

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.780 
wind up taking Franken supplements and
it's<00:03:24.120> really<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.680> cycle<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.950> doesn't<00:03:26.430> promote

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
it's really a cycle that doesn't promote

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.340 
it's really a cycle that doesn't promote
good<00:03:27.060> health<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.750> lot<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:27.959> people<00:03:28.170> are

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
good health and a lot of people are

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.590 
good health and a lot of people are
spending<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.739> lot<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:28.980> money<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.609> not<00:03:30.359> being

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
spending a lot of money and not being

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.840 
spending a lot of money and not being
served<00:03:30.959> in<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> way<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.829> they<00:03:31.890> want<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.519> and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
served in the way that they want to and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.990 
served in the way that they want to and
so<00:03:33.090> for<00:03:33.420> myself<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:35.280> think<00:03:35.579> for<00:03:35.790> many

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
so for myself and I think for many

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.059 
so for myself and I think for many
others<00:03:36.630> because<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.170> begin<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.470> look<00:03:37.560> around
