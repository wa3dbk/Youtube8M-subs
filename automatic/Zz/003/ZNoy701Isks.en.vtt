others<00:00:14.309> are<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> nice<00:00:14.760> foundation<00:00:15.240> because<00:00:15.869> you

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
others are a nice foundation because you

are<00:01:03.640> constant<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:05.140> start<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.619> same<00:01:05.860> way

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
are constant we start the same way

so<00:01:18.729> left<00:01:19.140> research<00:01:20.140> with<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.500> right<00:01:20.979> drag<00:01:21.670> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
so left research with the right drag and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.770 
so left research with the right drag and
play<00:01:23.320> three<00:01:24.159> drag<00:01:24.940> plates<00:01:26.789> place<00:01:27.789> one<00:01:28.119> two

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
play three drag plates place one two

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.380 
play three drag plates place one two
three<00:01:31.890> once<00:01:32.890> you've<00:01:33.039> got<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:33.429> down<00:01:33.700> again

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
three once you've got that down again

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.899 
three once you've got that down again
repeat<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.200> process<00:01:35.440> try<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.369> pick<00:01:36.610> up<00:01:36.759> the

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
repeat the process try to pick up the

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.180 
repeat the process try to pick up the
knees<00:01:37.090> over<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.140> toes<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.830> then<00:01:38.979> try<00:01:39.159> to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
knees over the toes and then try to

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.850 
knees over the toes and then try to
remove<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.670> toes<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.240> do<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.289> move<00:01:41.440> for<00:01:41.710> real

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
remove the toes and do the move for real

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.809 
remove the toes and do the move for real
so<00:01:42.580> it<00:01:42.970> would<00:01:43.119> look<00:01:43.210> like<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:43.679> with<00:01:44.819> without

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
so it would look like this with without

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.480 
so it would look like this with without
me<00:01:46.060> his<00:01:46.240> toes<00:01:46.450> only

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.270 

yeah<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.110> then<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.560> go<00:01:53.710> ahead<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:53.979> do<00:01:54.159> the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
yeah and then you go ahead and do the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.899 
yeah and then you go ahead and do the
real<00:01:54.430> thing

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
real thing

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:03.330 
real thing

you<00:03:30.860> just<00:03:31.069> can't<00:03:31.280> do<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.519> hybrid<00:03:31.670> version

you just can't do the hybrid version

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
because they don't have porcupine we can

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.300 
because they don't have porcupine we can
start<00:03:35.659> with<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.870> same<00:03:36.019> process

start with the same process
and<00:03:38.790> you'll<00:03:39.270> notice<00:03:39.480> each<00:03:39.900> time<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.170> start<00:03:40.590> with

switch<00:04:38.449> legs<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.380> can<00:04:39.530> try<00:04:39.710> alone<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.280> you

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
switch legs you can try alone and you

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.830 
switch legs you can try alone and you
can<00:04:40.490> switch<00:04:40.699> them<00:04:40.820> up<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.210> get<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:41.449> lot<00:04:41.750> of

can switch them up and get a lot of
variety<00:04:41.990> with<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.610> so

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
variety with it so

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.420

you can skip all the all the training

variation is called sidewalks and it is
what<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:02.030> sound<00:05:02.210> like

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
what it sound like

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.680 
what it sound like
you<00:05:02.930> take<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.289> basic<00:05:03.620> idea<00:05:03.949> of<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:05.180> walk<00:05:05.419> and

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
you take the basic idea of the walk and

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.200 
you take the basic idea of the walk and
then<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.259> twist<00:05:06.800> it<00:05:07.069> to<00:05:07.190> one<00:05:07.370> side<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:08.090> really

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
then you twist it to one side it really

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.270 
then you twist it to one side it really
be<00:05:08.419> either<00:05:08.599> side<00:05:08.930> you<00:05:09.080> can<00:05:09.289> you<00:05:09.440> over<00:05:10.039> to<00:05:10.160> the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
be either side you can you over to the

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.219 
be either side you can you over to the
sidewalks<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:11.060> legs<00:05:11.569> to<00:05:11.810> lean<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.169> the
