00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello people, welcome, one more 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.089
 video of the electric world channel 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.189
 in this video I will show you how 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.929
 connected a siren using the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:19.619
 circuit breaker programming 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:21.000
 rst time 40 corel will demonstrate 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.279
 this personal video how to do 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.609
 programming courses that lasted less than 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.470
 one minute there is a load on 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.859
 in this time switch, which is the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.140
 rts of 40 more information about this 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.000
 time and how to buy you find 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.800
 below the personal description the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.239
 next, I already have the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 switch and has a scheduled time 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.850
 as demonstrated in previous video and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.530
 now I will carry out such a programming 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.410
 push the test button 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 the first schedule it is in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.789
 looking here are now eight and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 Four I'm going to program this switch 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.960
 for 8 and 7 first programming is enough 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.500
 select the day that I want to stay 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.390
 connected on site from Monday to Friday 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.060
 and then I'll schedule my time 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 at 8 o'clock and the minutes I want it to start 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.430
 I'm expelled at 86 and then I'm going to press 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.020
 the day button plus a minute button and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:30.540
 then it will open the course option that 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.369
 appeared 00 to his hold it will change 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.909
 the seconds 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.960
 Ok, let's put things in three seconds. 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.150
 and 6 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.460
 and then I select which position will be 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.590
 connected if the load waiver charges and 2 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.810
 load load r 1 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.649
 I'm going to call a signalman to show 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.540
 for you 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.360
 then this type of course schedule 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.399
 staff is normally to use lahm INEP 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.000
 can be used there for example the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.119
 lazio school siren is that you 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.810
 want to start the times out of your 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.149
 classrooms 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.009
 you can do it there in a company 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.810
 for example the output entry time 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.330
 lunch time and afternoon tea 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.800
 employees can be programmed through 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.950
 this time attempt 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.640
 with this wrist option why 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.340
 other models from other companies 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.890
 never had a chance to manipulate him 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.620
 there's no way you can program less than one 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.260
 minute this one you can program from 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.780
 one to 59 seconds inside a 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.120
 programming so that you can 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.790
 example using a siren 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.700
 Okay, I'll show you this 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.230
 programming is working, you do not have it here 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.180
 a siren attached 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.310
 the diagram of this connection will appear 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.510
 for you to get more information about 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.519
 this siren 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.530
 I did a previous video, you can give 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.430
 a look at it and appears on the screen to 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.920
 you 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.200
 so when 86 and serene she'll be 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.500
 questioned will she stay three 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.410
 seconds connected to it will stay 13 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.180
 seconds and then it goes 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.930
 target then it will be a course 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.690
 three seconds, which is an option of this 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.970
 time switch here to have 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.280
 less than one minute is 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.599
 karga called same minute, come on 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.599
 now 86 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.870
 That's it folks showing there. 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.389
 for you are 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.060
 I can do programming with less than 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:36.130
 one minute to connect the load nef too 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.200
 used there with alarms and sirens to 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.150
 warning people that's got it 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.430
 personnel is going to spend our video likes 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.829
 share share have every doubt 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 leave in comments we want to respond 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.720
 Thanks guys and until the next video
