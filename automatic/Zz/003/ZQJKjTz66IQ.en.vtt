00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
big difference when it comes to the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.560 
big difference when it comes to the
concave<00:01:40.900> is<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:42.070> believe<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.729> really<00:01:43.150> good

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
concave is I believe a really good

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.250 
concave is I believe a really good
revolution<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.800> other<00:01:45.280> decks<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.720> has<00:01:46.900> medium

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
revolution to other decks it has medium

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.070 
revolution to other decks it has medium
conquer<00:01:48.070> Vader<00:01:48.190> set<00:01:48.610> but<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.810> big<00:01:50.050> difference

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
conquer Vader set but the big difference

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.520 
conquer Vader set but the big difference
is<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.979> center<00:01:51.430> it's<00:01:51.940> a<00:01:52.150> really<00:01:52.390> flat<00:01:52.990> center

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
is the center it's a really flat center

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.480 
is the center it's a really flat center
so<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.430> has<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:56.290> good<00:01:56.770> if<00:01:56.950> that

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
so it has the really good if that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.719 
so it has the really good if that
helps<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:57.940> flipping<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.900> board<00:01:59.500> but<00:02:00.310> also

has the wet filter that gives you the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.380 
has the wet filter that gives you the
stability<00:02:04.930> in<00:02:05.350> your<00:02:05.740> slides<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:07.000> doesn't

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
stability in your slides so it doesn't

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.770 
stability in your slides so it doesn't
actually<00:02:07.810> balance<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:09.000> very<00:02:10.000> good<00:02:10.269> wide<00:02:10.539> deep

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
you can see as a triangular concave so

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.250 
you can see as a triangular concave so
it<00:02:14.799> balances<00:02:15.250> it's<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:15.909> really<00:02:16.720> good<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.110> not

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
it balances it's not really good and not

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.789 
it balances it's not really good and not
real<00:02:17.640> realistic<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.989> stack<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.260> really

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
real realistic so the stack is really

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.930 
real realistic so the stack is really
