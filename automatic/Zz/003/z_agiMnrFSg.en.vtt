00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.690
 or the note in the exterior painting suffers 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.180
 much for the weather in winter with the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 rain the frost the wind and in 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.480
 summer by direct sunlight and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.250
 rays v 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.560
 that's why spring is ideal for 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.000
 paint the facade the surface was already 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.710
 damaged in the winter but before 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.240
 the summer arrives and it flakes 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.360
 let's apply a new layer 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.370
 protective 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.620
 besides the temperature can affect the 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.480
 finishing the varnishes can acquire 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.060
 a white tone when applied 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.040
 very cold on the contrary if it is painted 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.750
 with a lot of environmental heat or if the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.090
 surface where we will work is very 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.340
 hot some paintings kidnap and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.260
 they end up detaching and for the same 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.870
 these works must leave early 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.370
 because the wall released during the night 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.370
 the heat that he acquired during the day 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 before starting a job of these 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.790
 characteristics 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.950
 we have to look if we find 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.620
 cracks or fissures caused by a 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.360
 earthquake the most common is that they are 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.340
 in the openings by the force of strong 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.560
 diagonal interaction that is generated as 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.630
 for example that in the corner now is 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.670
 very important to evaluate the crack and if it is 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.000
 necessary to call a professional to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.000
 I see her 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.230
 yes 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.579
 in the fissure area we apply an adhesive 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.710
 toxic the correct way is by locating the 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.950
 product nozzle directly on the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950
 crack 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.730
 yes 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.630
 this facade has 22 square meters 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.609
 the yield of a gallon is between 40 and 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.030
 45 square meters and a net tea 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:57.819
 between 200 and 225 as it is a surface 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.920
 irregular we will consider between 20 a 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.899
 25 percent more paint and how 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.710
 let's apply two hands with this line 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.990
 we have leftovers 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.880
 texture surfaces like this one 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.459
 facade are especially prone to 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.260
 hide dust are very popular because 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.030
 they refer to the constructions of 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.430
 the antiquity where the postmen 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.400
 they got this kind of texture to like 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.940
 hammer or marcelo hence the name 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.940
 martelly na 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.010
 Of course we must work on 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.920
 a clean surface free of dust and 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.910
 fats a practical and fast option is 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.910
 work with a pressure washer 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.799
 usually the eaves and the tobacco are 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.629
 of a different color from the facade 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.700
 so let's mask it is very 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.860
 important to protect the window both the 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.780
 frame like glass if it's going to work in 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.390
 height consider renting in the store 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.750
 a scaffold and of course use a harness and 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.750
 helmet 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.660
 to not have problems with the texture 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.849
 of the facades we are going to paint with 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.560
 pistols and to avoid contact with 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.599
 the particles in suspension with 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.590
 our eyes and respiratory tract 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.120
 we are going to wear glasses and eye masks that 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.739
 these particles also move with 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.630
 the wind and can stain the cars that 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.040
 they are in the vicinity and I also spoke with 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.040
 the neighbor to work quiet 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.550
 we use a paint that contains trimmer 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:31.740
 because it ensures adhesion and sealing 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.500
 which results in color accuracy 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.539
 final in this case is a red like this 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.729
 that is associated with the clay eyebrows of 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.030
 ceiling with the same paint is also 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.650
 water enamel hydro repellent 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.750
 waterproofing can be washed 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.900
 fungicide and resistant to uv rays 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.900
 time 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.410
 usually these doors have to be 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.060
 adjust them it is recommended up to 5 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.520
 millimeters on each side for that 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.889
 we occupy this electric brush that we 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.139
 allows to regulate the depth of 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.210
 recesses as a termination we are going to apply 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.010
 an oak color tint and to protect the 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.020
 moisture door we will apply for 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.830
 its two faces and all its edges a 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.830
 water varnish 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.140
 ah 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.040
 that today the manufacturer of the 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.350
 painting recommends applying the second 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.880
 hand five hours later and 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.740
 check the weather forecast for 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.330
 make sure it's not going to rain if you 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.040
 There was some doubt, remember who 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.140
 do it this same point you can see it 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.700
 the products the codes a complete 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.410
 step by step of this program and 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.240
 share it with all your friends in the 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.240
 social networks we see you chau chau
