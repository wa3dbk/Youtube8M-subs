00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
virtual pro so I do know a little bit

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 
virtual pro so I do know a little bit
about<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> ratings<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> pace<00:01:25.229> is

about the ratings I know that pace is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.030 
about the ratings I know that pace is
probably<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.820> most<00:01:27.240> important<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:29.009> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
probably the most important thing one of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.670 
probably the most important thing one of
the<00:01:29.189> most<00:01:29.400> important<00:01:29.880> things<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.560> couple<00:01:31.560> other

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the most important things a couple other

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.890 
the most important things a couple other
youtubers<00:01:32.400> uh<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:33.030> kill<00:01:33.329> Hollywood<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
youtubers uh like kill Hollywood and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
youtubers uh like kill Hollywood and
stuff<00:01:34.110> he's<00:01:34.350> saying<00:01:34.740> pace<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.159> gonna<00:01:35.640> be

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
stuff he's saying pace is gonna be

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.499 
stuff he's saying pace is gonna be
really<00:01:36.000> big<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.450> open<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.750> team<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:38.670> got<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
really big and open the team so I got a

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.530 
really big and open the team so I got a
silver<00:01:40.110> left<00:01:40.470> wing<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:41.430> decent<00:01:41.970> pace<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.509> I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
silver left wing with decent pace so I

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.480 
silver left wing with decent pace so I
mean<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.810> guess<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.170> good<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:44.280> otherwise

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
mean I guess that's good but otherwise

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910 
mean I guess that's good but otherwise
most<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:44.970> players<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> bronze<00:01:45.619> few<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.740> them

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
most of my players a bronze few of them

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.090 
most of my players a bronze few of them
are<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.460> same<00:01:47.640> country<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.320> do

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
are from the same country so I do

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.139 
are from the same country so I do
understand<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> chemistry<00:01:51.119> thing<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.820> I'm

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
understand the chemistry thing and I'm

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.530 
understand the chemistry thing and I'm
assuming<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:56.340> green<00:01:57.829> lit<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:59.540> little

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
assuming that the green lit up little

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.780 
assuming that the green lit up little
boot<00:02:01.110> means<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.740> they<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> position<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
boot means that they like a position and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.560 
boot means that they like a position and
the<00:02:03.090> red<00:02:03.329> one<00:02:03.570> or<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.560> green<00:02:05.210> little<00:02:06.210> square

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the red one or the green little square

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.180 
the red one or the green little square
thing<00:02:06.600> means<00:02:07.079> they<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> formation<00:02:07.950> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
thing means they like the formation and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.609 
thing means they like the formation and
if<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.119> lit<00:02:09.390> up<00:02:09.539> then<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.379> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
if it's lit up then they really like it

madden<00:02:56.610> ultimate<00:02:56.670> team<00:02:57.440> where<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.470> could

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
madden ultimate team where you could

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.840

just<00:02:59.010> hit<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.160> button<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.730> would

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
just hit a button and it would

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.790 
just hit a button and it would
automatically<00:03:00.330> put<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.840> best<00:03:01.050> players<00:03:01.380> at

their<00:03:02.100> best<00:03:02.280> positions<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.450> pitch<00:03:03.780> but<00:03:03.990> I

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
their best positions on the pitch but I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.120 
their best positions on the pitch but I
guess<00:03:04.230> I'll<00:03:04.380> gonna<00:03:04.590> get<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.740> little<00:03:04.890> bit<00:03:04.980> too

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
depth there really you know makes me

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.420 
depth there really you know makes me
appreciate<00:04:05.400> what's<00:04:05.850> going<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:07.040> so<00:04:08.040> I'm<00:04:08.220> really

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
appreciate what's going on so I'm really

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.190 
appreciate what's going on so I'm really
going<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.670> get<00:04:08.820> into<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.090> mode<00:04:09.360> like<00:04:09.690> very

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
going to get into this mode like very

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.670 
going to get into this mode like very
seriously<00:04:10.739> like<00:04:10.980> I<00:04:11.100> see<00:04:11.489> myself<00:04:11.670> having<00:04:12.120> two

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
seriously like I see myself having two

main videos that i will be making for

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.390 
main videos that i will be making for
fifa<00:04:15.870> 12<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.290> it's<00:04:16.380> going<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.560> be<00:04:16.739> virtual<00:04:17.130> pro

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
fifa 12 and it's going to be virtual pro

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.349 
fifa 12 and it's going to be virtual pro
and<00:04:17.750> ultimate<00:04:18.750> team<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.650> don't<00:04:20.310> think<00:04:20.489> manager

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
and ultimate team I don't think manager

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.840 
and ultimate team I don't think manager
mode<00:04:21.510> will<00:04:21.750> be<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.260> high<00:04:22.440> my<00:04:22.680> list<00:04:22.950> if<00:04:23.640> i<00:04:23.789> do

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
mode will be that high my list if i do

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.210 
mode will be that high my list if i do
i'll<00:04:24.180> probably<00:04:24.390> do<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.600> wolverhampton<00:04:25.320> manager

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
i'll probably do a wolverhampton manager

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.500 
i'll probably do a wolverhampton manager
mode

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
mode

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.890 
mode
just<00:04:28.510> because<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:28.750> kind<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.050> like<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.290> team<00:04:30.900> but

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
just because I kind of like the team but

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.190 
just because I kind of like the team but
uh<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.440> might<00:04:33.430> only<00:04:34.180> do<00:04:34.420> a<00:04:34.450> couple<00:04:34.540> videos<00:04:35.050> of

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
uh I might only do a couple videos of

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
uh I might only do a couple videos of
that<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.500> it's<00:04:35.620> going<00:04:35.710> to<00:04:35.800> be<00:04:35.860> made<00:04:36.010> the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
that and it's going to be made the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.830 
that and it's going to be made the
ultimate<00:04:36.340> team<00:04:36.760> just<00:04:37.030> because<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.570> amount<00:04:37.780> of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
ultimate team just because the amount of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.660 
ultimate team just because the amount of
time<00:04:38.080> you<00:04:38.440> have<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.650> put<00:04:38.890> into<00:04:39.070> him<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.340> team<00:04:39.520> to

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
time you have to put into him a team to

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.550 
time you have to put into him a team to
be<00:04:39.790> successful<00:04:39.820> from<00:04:40.600> what<00:04:40.840> I'm<00:04:40.960> starting<00:04:41.500> to

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
be successful from what I'm starting to

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.090 
be successful from what I'm starting to
realize<00:04:43.440> it's<00:04:44.440> going<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.650> be<00:04:44.740> taking<00:04:44.950> up<00:04:45.010> all

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
realize it's going to be taking up all

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.820 
realize it's going to be taking up all
my<00:04:45.160> time<00:04:45.370> on<00:04:45.550> playing<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.120> game<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.710> in<00:04:47.710> a

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
my time on playing this game and in a

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.250 
my time on playing this game and in a
week<00:04:48.040> NBA<00:04:48.700> 2k12<00:04:49.210> comes<00:04:49.540> out<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:49.930> I'll<00:04:50.110> be

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
week NBA 2k12 comes out and I'll be

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.800 
week NBA 2k12 comes out and I'll be
splitting<00:04:50.650> my<00:04:50.680> game<00:04:50.980> time<00:04:51.190> in<00:04:51.340> half<00:04:51.810> well

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
splitting my game time in half well

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.630 
splitting my game time in half well
actually<00:04:52.930> less<00:04:53.500> than<00:04:53.530> half<00:04:53.920> I'll<00:04:54.250> be<00:04:54.370> probably

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
actually less than half I'll be probably

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.000 
actually less than half I'll be probably
playing<00:04:54.850> and<00:04:55.090> made<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.360> be<00:04:55.510> called<00:04:55.720> more<00:04:56.010> but

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
playing and made to be called more but

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.340 
playing and made to be called more but
I'm<00:04:57.640> still<00:04:57.970> trying<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.360> get<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.600> info<00:04:59.080> out

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
I'm still trying to get this info out

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.580 
I'm still trying to get this info out
for<00:04:59.530> you<00:04:59.620> guys<00:05:00.660> right<00:05:01.660> here<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.990> was<00:05:02.350> just

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
for you guys right here I was just

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.230 
for you guys right here I was just
trying<00:05:02.920> to<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.250> was<00:05:03.520> going<00:05:04.000> through<00:05:04.030> the

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
trying to I was going through the

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.430 
trying to I was going through the
different<00:05:04.510> formations<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.170> trying<00:05:05.380> to

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
different formations and trying to

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.780 
different formations and trying to
figure<00:05:05.680> out<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:06.160> was<00:05:06.250> just<00:05:06.370> picking<00:05:06.580> the

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
figure out I was just picking the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.240 
figure out I was just picking the
highest<00:05:07.120> chemistry<00:05:07.600> I<00:05:07.890> don't<00:05:08.890> know<00:05:08.950> if<00:05:09.070> that's

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
highest chemistry I don't know if that's

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.330 
highest chemistry I don't know if that's
right<00:05:09.430> let<00:05:10.000> me<00:05:10.030> know<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:11.410> thought<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:12.070> had<00:05:12.250> the

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
right let me know I thought I had the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.980 
right let me know I thought I had the
players<00:05:12.700> at<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.000> right<00:05:13.270> positions<00:05:13.720> but<00:05:13.930> I

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
players at the right positions but I

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.150 
players at the right positions but I
know<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.260> left-wingers<00:05:14.740> out<00:05:14.980> of<00:05:15.070> position

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
know the left-wingers out of position

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.730 
know the left-wingers out of position
right<00:05:15.490> now<00:05:16.590> but<00:05:18.210> when<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:20.140> chemistry<00:05:20.590> is<00:05:20.620> the

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
right now but when the chemistry is the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.290 
right now but when the chemistry is the
highest<00:05:21.160> does<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.580> mean<00:05:21.760> that's<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.120> best

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
highest does that mean that's the best

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.820 
highest does that mean that's the best
formation<00:05:22.810> for<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.080> players<00:05:23.350> you<00:05:23.530> have<00:05:23.560> out

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
formation for the players you have out

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.230 
formation for the players you have out
there<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.280> mean<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.670> would<00:05:24.790> assume<00:05:25.030> it<00:05:25.180> is<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:27.240> kind

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
there I mean I would assume it is I kind

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.390 
there I mean I would assume it is I kind
of<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:28.480> pick<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:29.230> best<00:05:29.440> players<00:05:29.800> ratings

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
of just pick the best players ratings

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.340 
of just pick the best players ratings
wise<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:30.970> then<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.480> put<00:05:31.690> them<00:05:31.810> all<00:05:32.080> on<00:05:32.140> the

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
wise and then I put them all on the

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.830 
wise and then I put them all on the
field<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:33.060> then<00:05:34.060> I'm<00:05:34.150> just<00:05:34.360> playing<00:05:34.750> around

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
field and then I'm just playing around

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.050 
field and then I'm just playing around
with<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.110> chemistry<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:36.100> mean<00:05:36.430> let<00:05:36.850> me<00:05:36.940> know

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
with the chemistry so I mean let me know

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.740 
with the chemistry so I mean let me know
if<00:05:37.150> that's<00:05:37.330> a<00:05:37.720> good<00:05:37.990> idea<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:40.120> one<00:05:40.360> ended<00:05:40.630> up

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
if that's a good idea this one ended up

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.100 
if that's a good idea this one ended up
being<00:05:41.020> really<00:05:41.290> good<00:05:41.590> because<00:05:41.980> the<00:05:42.900> because<00:05:43.900> of

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
being really good because the because of

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.080 
being really good because the because of
all<00:05:44.410> my<00:05:44.530> all<00:05:44.800> my<00:05:44.830> defenders<00:05:45.430> loved<00:05:45.670> it<00:05:45.850> and<00:05:45.970> my

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
all my all my defenders loved it and my

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.570 
all my all my defenders loved it and my
goalkeeper<00:05:46.510> loved<00:05:46.690> it<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:47.080> now<00:05:47.620> one<00:05:48.190> group<00:05:48.400> I

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
goalkeeper loved it and now one group I

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.550 
goalkeeper loved it and now one group I
had<00:05:48.790> was<00:05:49.060> my<00:05:49.360> goal<00:05:49.570> keeper<00:05:49.900> didn't<00:05:50.260> like<00:05:50.410> the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
had was my goal keeper didn't like the

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.220 
had was my goal keeper didn't like the
formations<00:05:51.660> like<00:05:52.660> why<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.900> heck<00:05:53.050> doesn't

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.230 
formations like why the heck doesn't

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.660 
formations like why the heck doesn't
matter<00:05:53.500> if<00:05:53.680> a<00:05:53.770> goalkeeper<00:05:54.220> doesn't<00:05:54.460> like<00:05:54.550> the

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
matter if a goalkeeper doesn't like the

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.580 
matter if a goalkeeper doesn't like the
formations<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:55.750> know<00:05:57.510> but<00:05:58.510> you<00:05:59.380> know<00:05:59.440> it's

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
formations you know but you know it's

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.420 
formations you know but you know it's
probably<00:05:59.680> something<00:06:00.040> to<00:06:00.160> do<00:06:00.250> with<00:06:00.280> it

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
probably something to do with it

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.980 
probably something to do with it
obviously<00:06:00.850> like<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.330> more<00:06:01.510> defenders<00:06:01.810> that

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
obviously like the more defenders that

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.660 
obviously like the more defenders that
are<00:06:02.260> by<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.470> goalkeeper<00:06:03.070> he<00:06:03.280> probably<00:06:03.430> feels

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
are by the goalkeeper he probably feels

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.180 
are by the goalkeeper he probably feels
better<00:06:05.010> stuff<00:06:06.010> like<00:06:06.160> that<00:06:06.480> but<00:06:07.710> yeah<00:06:08.710> this<00:06:08.980> is

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
better stuff like that but yeah this is

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.130 
better stuff like that but yeah this is
I<00:06:09.460> kind<00:06:09.760> of<00:06:09.880> realized<00:06:10.240> that<00:06:10.450> I<00:06:10.600> want<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:10.900> settle

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
I kind of realized that I want to settle

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.480 
I kind of realized that I want to settle
on<00:06:11.350> a<00:06:11.380> 4<00:06:12.030> 4321<00:06:13.030> formation<00:06:13.830> for<00:06:14.830> now<00:06:14.980> for<00:06:15.370> my

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
matched with better players mainly

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.500 
matched with better players mainly
because<00:06:53.110> i<00:06:53.650> have<00:06:53.919> this<00:06:54.100> silver<00:06:54.460> pack<00:06:54.850> so<00:06:55.210> i

because i have this silver pack so i

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.840 
because i have this silver pack so i
might<00:06:55.930> just<00:06:55.960> start<00:06:56.320> out<00:06:56.440> from<00:06:56.650> scratch<00:06:56.980> with

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
might just start out from scratch with

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.340 
might just start out from scratch with
the<00:06:57.940> bronze<00:06:58.150> pack<00:06:58.510> but<00:06:58.900> what<00:06:59.020> I<00:06:59.050> went<00:06:59.260> ahead

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
the bronze pack but what I went ahead

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.770 
the bronze pack but what I went ahead
and<00:06:59.500> did<00:06:59.770> you<00:07:00.460> know<00:07:00.550> just<00:07:00.580> in<00:07:00.910> case<00:07:00.940> I<00:07:01.270> made<00:07:01.510> two

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
and did you know just in case I made two

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.930 
and did you know just in case I made two
different<00:07:02.139> squads<00:07:02.470> so<00:07:03.250> what<00:07:03.370> I'm<00:07:03.460> assuming<00:07:03.730> is

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
different squads so what I'm assuming is

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.730 
different squads so what I'm assuming is
I<00:07:04.060> can<00:07:04.210> pick<00:07:04.600> the<00:07:04.750> which<00:07:05.050> squad<00:07:05.320> I<00:07:05.350> want<00:07:05.590> to<00:07:05.650> use

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
I can pick the which squad I want to use

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.350 
I can pick the which squad I want to use
for<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:05.980> games<00:07:06.220> and<00:07:06.490> that'll<00:07:06.700> make<00:07:07.180> my

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
for the games and that'll make my

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.720 
for the games and that'll make my
decision<00:07:07.660> easier<00:07:08.130> but<00:07:09.130> that's<00:07:09.400> pretty<00:07:09.610> much

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
decision easier but that's pretty much

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.330 
decision easier but that's pretty much
