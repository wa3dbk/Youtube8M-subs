these do is in addition to giving it up

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.760 
these do is in addition to giving it up
and<00:00:31.859> down<00:00:32.009> left<00:00:32.340> they<00:00:33.030> also<00:00:33.210> act<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.110> tilt<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and down left they also act to tilt the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.790 
and down left they also act to tilt the
helicopter<00:00:35.489> forward<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.780> motion<00:00:37.290> or

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
helicopter forward for for motion or

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.410 
helicopter forward for for motion or
tilt<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> backwards<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.120> gives<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
tilt the backwards and that gives a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:01:02.900 
tilt the backwards and that gives a
backwards<00:00:39.930> motion

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.340

helicopter or airplane for that matter

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.440 
helicopter or airplane for that matter
it's<00:01:29.409> best<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.890> use<00:01:29.920> very<00:01:30.399> slow<00:01:30.759> gradual

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
it's best to use very slow gradual

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.590 
it's best to use very slow gradual
promotions<00:01:32.080> as<00:01:32.289> opposed<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.890> jerky<00:01:33.600> movements

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
promotions as opposed to jerky movements

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.020 
promotions as opposed to jerky movements
you'll<00:01:35.590> also<00:01:35.800> notice<00:01:36.070> on<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:36.520> there's<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:36.850> lot

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
you'll also notice on this there's a lot

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.290 
you'll also notice on this there's a lot
of<00:01:37.060> trim<00:01:37.509> wheels<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:39.430> ones<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.880> left<00:01:40.119> hand

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
of trim wheels the ones on the left hand

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.660 
of trim wheels the ones on the left hand
side<00:01:40.420> are<00:01:40.720> actually<00:01:41.110> too<00:01:41.289> small<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:42.039> ignore

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
side are actually too small so ignore

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.400 
side are actually too small so ignore
them<00:01:42.850> they<00:01:43.000> don't<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.479> know<00:01:43.600> typically<00:01:44.110> turn

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
them they don't you know typically turn

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.919 
them they don't you know typically turn
the<00:01:45.250> ones<00:01:45.429> on<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.610> right<00:01:45.820> hand<00:01:46.000> side<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.660> top

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
the ones on the right hand side the top

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.109 
the ones on the right hand side the top
one<00:01:47.170> is<00:01:47.440> for<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.800> forward<00:01:48.310> backwards<00:01:48.820> hover

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
one is for the forward backwards hover

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.450 
one is for the forward backwards hover
speed<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.830> what<00:01:50.950> you're<00:01:51.100> going<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.310> want<00:01:51.399> to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
speed and what you're going to want to

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.070 
speed and what you're going to want to
do<00:01:51.580> with<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:51.850> one<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.300> set<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:52.660> in<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.869> very

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
do with that one is set it in a very

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.690 
do with that one is set it in a very
neutral<00:01:53.259> position<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.310> just<00:01:54.429> basically

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
neutral position so it's just basically

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.080 
neutral position so it's just basically
hovering<00:01:55.420> straight<00:01:55.869> out<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.880> not<00:01:58.060> moving

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
hovering straight out and not moving

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.359 
hovering straight out and not moving
forward<00:01:58.630> or<00:01:58.899> backwards<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.920> bottom<00:02:00.220> one

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
forward or backwards and the bottom one

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.920 
forward or backwards and the bottom one
is<00:02:00.399> what<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.880> does<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.090> trim<00:02:01.660> returning<00:02:02.590> it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
is what it does to trim returning it

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.740 
is what it does to trim returning it
right<00:02:03.200> start<00:02:04.100> by<00:02:04.430> dusting<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.150> bottom<00:02:05.510> trim

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
right start by dusting the bottom trim

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.750 
right start by dusting the bottom trim
so<00:02:06.140> make<00:02:06.560> sure<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.830> it's<00:02:07.160> just<00:02:07.340> when<00:02:07.610> it's

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
so make sure that it's just when it's

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.359 
so make sure that it's just when it's
when<00:02:08.330> it's<00:02:08.360> flying<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.649> not<00:02:09.860> spinning

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
when it's flying that is not spinning

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.460 
when it's flying that is not spinning
and<00:02:10.670> then<00:02:11.120> what<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.420> get<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.750> right<00:02:11.810> then

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
and then what you get that right then

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.500 
and then what you get that right then
address<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.980> top<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:13.730> that'll<00:02:13.970> just<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
address the top one and that'll just the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.550 
address the top one and that'll just the
other<00:02:14.690> screen<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.710> then<00:02:15.830> you're<00:02:15.980> ready<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.250> go
