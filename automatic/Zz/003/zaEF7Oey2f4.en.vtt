 we select the memory that we go to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.060
 use to format our 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.670
 computer and we select that it 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.420
 enamore bag see for example and we leave 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.880
 This is as it once and stop

 they will charge simply we give to begin 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.800
 and it will tell us that all the 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.230
 files are inside the USB memory 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.730
 to be you will look for a mole you go 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.290
 to see that it is already formatted 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.180
 previously that is to say that it is free not 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.670

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.160
 enter all the memory files 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.540
 usb then we have our usb 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.250
 ready to start the format let's go to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.010
 the part of the cut 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.820

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.450
 of windows 10 from a usb using what 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.640
 which is the several using the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.120
 windows start configuration for 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.270
 boot or boot from the usb from 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.910
 the several but in this video I'm going 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.910
 to teach how to install it so 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.310
 normal from the same pc without using 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.840
 no type of external memory what 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.080
 they have to do it once we finish 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.070
 the process of this program that I have 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.160
 here in this usb program then 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.140
 let's move on to open that usb where 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.380
 we import everything and I love giving it to this 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.810
 button called septo when we give it there 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.820
 will open this small box that is 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.370
 to install the windows technical 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.920
 windows 10 preview we follow the steps 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.890
 when we get here he tells us we're going 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.560
 to leave here let's leave the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.080
 windows configuration files 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.760
 personal and 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.220
 or if they want nothing more to leave the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.200
 personal files or leave nothing 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.720
 start again format the from 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.940
 zero I'm going to give you this option here 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.510
 leave all my data and applications I'll 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.890
 to save the next once here and 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.890
 will process 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.590
 and 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.589
 i 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.479
 i 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.550
 good friends and after all this 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.400
 process 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.640
 then the beginning will not come out 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.100
 normal with all our files 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.820
 photos and other configurations and all 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.040
 ready and prepared as you could see it 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.660
 must pass many processes or depending 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.700
 of the amount of training we have 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.310
 in our computer of all the 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.920
 files that we have and this is going to 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.870
 vary in how much it can last for me in what 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.540
 general lasted me about an hour 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.420
 to be able to load what is the windows and 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.850
 everything is already fine I really like it 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.100
 how it looks its appearance is very good 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.310
 as you can see the start bar is what 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:08.370
 what else is remarkable in this in some 210 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.500
 and for now it is in English 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.350
 in the version 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.570
 but the important thing is that it preserves all 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.840
 my files have many things of 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.780
