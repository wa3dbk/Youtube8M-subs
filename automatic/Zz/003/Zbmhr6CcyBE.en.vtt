00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
thing that we are doing is this is the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.130 
thing that we are doing is this is the
first<00:02:26.620> time<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.130> Emerson<00:02:27.730> knives<00:02:28.390> ever<00:02:28.780> had

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
a flipper as the frame so i could be

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.070 
a flipper as the frame so i could be
wrong<00:02:32.560> but<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.580> this<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.690> only<00:02:34.810> knife
