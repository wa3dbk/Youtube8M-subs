here we would recommend buying this card

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.720 
here we would recommend buying this card
quite<00:03:16.049> soon<00:03:16.290> because<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.519> old

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
quite soon because it's the old

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.390 
quite soon because it's the old
generation<00:03:18.239> around<00:03:18.870> 7000<00:03:19.620> series<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:20.099> parts

so<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.030> might<00:03:21.239> not<00:03:21.299> be<00:03:21.419> able<00:03:21.449> to<00:03:21.569> find<00:03:21.810> them

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
so you might not be able to find them

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.520 
so you might not be able to find them
for<00:03:22.290> too<00:03:22.440> much<00:03:22.530> longer<00:03:23.510> we've<00:03:24.510> got<00:03:24.690> one<00:03:24.930> silent

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
for too much longer we've got one silent

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.960 
of the antec 300 case that once again
just<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:33.660> they're<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.290> saw<00:03:34.470> them<00:03:34.680> and

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
just because they're really saw them and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.890 
just because they're really saw them and
they<00:03:35.970> put<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> good<00:03:36.389> map<00:03:36.690> Erin<00:03:37.760> finally<00:03:38.900> we've

you're<00:03:51.449> going<00:03:51.569> to<00:03:51.629> need<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.900> get<00:03:52.049> an<00:03:52.139> FX

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
you're going to need to get an FX

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.569 
you're going to need to get an FX
processor<00:03:52.980> because<00:03:54.919> mdf<00:03:55.919> stopped<00:03:56.190> producing

so<00:04:00.510> you're<00:04:00.659> really<00:04:00.780> going<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.019> need<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.230> get

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
so you're really going to need to get

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.490 
so you're really going to need to get
one<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.500> these<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:03.959> probably<00:04:04.169> going

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
one of these and this is probably going

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.520 
one of these and this is probably going
to<00:04:04.560> be<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:04.889> one<00:04:05.099> of<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.389> most

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
to be like one of the most

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
hurt stock drop which is the highest you

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.420 
hurt stock drop which is the highest you

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.760 
can get stock clocks for a bulldozer
highest<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:18.510> can<00:04:18.539> get<00:04:18.780> in<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.049> world

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
highest you can get in the world

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.410 
highest you can get in the world
which<00:04:20.770> is<00:04:21.070> really<00:04:21.220> good<00:04:21.430> considering<00:04:21.880> the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
which is really good considering the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.980 
which is really good considering the
bulldozers<00:04:22.990> per<00:04:23.850> each<00:04:24.850> core<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.390> less

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
bulldozers per each core is less

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.260 
bulldozers per each core is less
efficient<00:04:26.440> than<00:04:26.500> saying<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.550> five<00:04:27.820> for

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
efficient than saying I five for

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.560 
efficient than saying I five for
instance<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:29.290> bumping<00:04:29.740> up<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:29.920> core<00:04:30.610> really

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
instance so bumping up the core really

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.680 
instance so bumping up the core really
does<00:04:31.750> kind<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.890> little<00:04:33.850> taste<00:04:34.150> on<00:04:34.390> par<00:04:34.660> with

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
does kind of a little taste on par with

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.900 
does kind of a little taste on par with
a<00:04:34.990> 2500<00:04:35.830> cred<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.250> can't<00:04:36.610> say<00:04:36.760> anything

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
a 2500 cred I can't say anything

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.380 
a 2500 cred I can't say anything
definite<00:04:37.300> has<00:04:37.420> been<00:04:37.570> reviewed<00:04:37.930> it<00:04:38.110> yet<00:04:38.140> but

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
definite has been reviewed it yet but

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.190 
definite has been reviewed it yet but
you<00:04:40.390> know<00:04:40.510> it's<00:04:41.850> makes<00:04:42.850> up<00:04:43.030> for<00:04:43.330> bulldozers

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
you know it's makes up for bulldozers

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.309 
you know it's makes up for bulldozers
lower<00:04:44.650> efficiency

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.319 

so<00:04:48.319> that's<00:04:48.499> it<00:04:48.649> for<00:04:49.159> our<00:04:49.189> system<00:04:49.939> this<00:04:50.089> is<00:04:50.239> the

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:50.329 
so that's it for our system this is the

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:53.319 
so that's it for our system this is the
500-pound<00:04:51.169> stevia<00:04:51.649> rebuild<00:04:52.009> so<00:04:52.879> we'll<00:04:53.209> be

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:53.329 
500-pound stevia rebuild so we'll be

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:56.889 
500-pound stevia rebuild so we'll be
back<00:04:53.689> with<00:04:54.109> our<00:04:54.379> 800<00:04:55.009> under<00:04:55.549> 800<00:04:56.059> pounds<00:04:56.449> build

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:56.899 
back with our 800 under 800 pounds build

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:59.289 
back with our 800 under 800 pounds build
for<00:04:57.289> febuary<00:04:57.709> and<00:04:57.949> are<00:04:58.099> over<00:04:58.279> 800<00:04:58.549> pound<00:04:59.029> of

00:04:59.289 --> 00:04:59.299 
for febuary and are over 800 pound of

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.089 
for febuary and are over 800 pound of
febuary<00:04:59.779> and<00:04:59.959> then<00:05:00.439> we'll<00:05:00.589> be<00:05:00.679> back<00:05:00.859> next

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
febuary and then we'll be back next

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.739 
febuary and then we'll be back next
month<00:05:02.089> in<00:05:02.389> March<00:05:02.629> to<00:05:03.319> show<00:05:03.529> you<00:05:04.719> what<00:05:05.719> I

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:05.749 
month in March to show you what I

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.779 
month in March to show you what I
recommend<00:05:06.019> what<00:05:06.409> we<00:05:06.529> recommend<00:05:06.859> next<00:05:07.399> month

recommend what we recommend next month
so<00:05:08.119> thanks<00:05:08.569> for<00:05:08.629> watching<00:05:08.929> gutter<00:05:09.109> first<00:05:09.379> good

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:10.339 
so thanks for watching gutter first good

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.969 
so thanks for watching gutter first good
luck<00:05:10.489> with<00:05:10.639> your<00:05:10.669> build
