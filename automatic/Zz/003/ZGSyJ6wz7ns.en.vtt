 friv haven games and who without a while 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.279
 I was talking about growth in your company 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.260
 As a videogame, you know how sad you are 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.820
 people know with that beauty where 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.790
 you want to get there if you know how is your 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.939
 market if you do not understand if you can 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.400
 anticipate easy so much anticipated you go 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.990
 to find those keys in the value 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.820
 added that the product's foundation 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.079
 to make it grow to be stronger 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 I am still a child 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.650
 because a child a child has a 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.960
 awesome astonishment capacity like 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.710
 when we are adults we become 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.710
 boring 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.430
 we talk when we are in a project 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.380
 in a house called school the same 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.479
 I think you have to have fun 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.329
 have to have those concepts about what 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.890
 wants to follow and approve a child was a 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.759
 very basic exercise that I do in other 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.319
 conferences you to a five year old boy 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.640
 you say pay a sheet of paper and draw 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:39.999
 your company is the same as the people who 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.859
 draws will go through an action of 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.659
 fear of nerves because it's because the 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.620
 main enemy of creativity is 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.660
 the iniesta 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.520
 he as adults we grow up with a fear of 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.770
 rejection we have a fear to be told 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.780
 that a child is not afraid does not know the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.700
 obviously afraid that you have to have a 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.310
 sense of not good be the street 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.990
 it costs more but but you have to 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.750
 understand what a company was what 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.090
 means many companies 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.890
 because your employees are afraid of 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.200
 expose the days because they are afraid of 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.970
 rejection because totally fundamental 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.620
 because companies have crushed us 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.180
 as companies many times we have 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.740
 crushed the new ideas that we have 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.120
 crushed the four titles here to 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.660
 work the known ones of 30 years 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.660
