00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.200 
time to be a nurse
making<00:05:39.350> a<00:05:39.440> difference<00:05:39.920> meaningful<00:05:40.790> work<00:05:41.000> I

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
making a difference meaningful work I

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.230 
making a difference meaningful work I
think<00:05:41.480> is<00:05:41.600> so<00:05:41.840> important<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:43.220> what<00:05:43.730> you<00:05:43.970> do<00:05:44.120> and

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
think is so important to what you do and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.930 
think is so important to what you do and
I<00:05:44.330> think<00:05:44.390> nursing<00:05:44.840> provides<00:05:45.200> that<00:05:45.440> this

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
I think nursing provides that this

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.270 
I think nursing provides that this
profession<00:05:46.940> is<00:05:47.030> something<00:05:47.510> that<00:05:47.780> is<00:05:48.590> changing

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
profession is something that is changing

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.030 
profession is something that is changing
and<00:05:49.430> growing<00:05:49.640> daily<00:05:50.320> and<00:05:51.320> so<00:05:51.590> you're<00:05:51.770> always

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
learning the area serves as a vehicle to

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.590 
learning the area serves as a vehicle to
