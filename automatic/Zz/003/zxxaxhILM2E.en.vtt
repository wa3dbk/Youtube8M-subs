00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.990
 the defeÃ±os live with many 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.910
 winged inhabitants and here abound the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.950
 birds either as pets or as 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.540
 part of the ecosystem that's why in the 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.610
 faculty of veterinary medicine and 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.550
 zootechnics of the unam there is a hospital 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.859
 specialized in birds and here we are going to 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.929
 talk to a guy who specializes 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.929
 in prosthetics for boys 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.050
 in the city both in homes and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.870
 many species live outside 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.380
 of domestic birds are almost always 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 canaries parrots nymphs macaws or 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.320
 cockatoos and they frequently fracture 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.840
 from the peak 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 and who are your patients good 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.909
 we have all kinds of patients from 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.770
 good patients have been raised in 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.810
 house have been born in the house of 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.420
 patient owners that good 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.909
 Acquire in pet and bird stores 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.789
 that they bring and rescued 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.429
 what it means for a bird to have its beak 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.460
 damaged depending on the type of bird is the 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.890
 peak type with the peak can 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.189
 hold on hang hang on towards 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.200
 another branch is like let's say its third 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.149
 Paw also works for the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.189
 social coexistence through the peak 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.299
 they can make those alliances 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.369
 socially soaking up their congeners 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.719
 then it is a very very important part 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.789
 and above all good the part of the 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.090
 food that is the limiting not if 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.750
 the beak is incomplete or it hurts them 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.750
 they are not going to feed 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.539
 what is the process to elaborate a 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.560
 prosthesis of a peak there are many 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.560
 Procedures 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.229
 We can use many materials 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.780
 dentures such as acrylic or 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.979
 resin good wax to start 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.470
 mold it 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.330
 what are the most common mistakes that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.819
 commit the birds owners of 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.290
 company that feed the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.690
 food is the number one problem 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.170
 that we have here not all the birds are 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.840
 they feed on very different things in your 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.000
 case what it was that led you to dedicate yourself 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.340
 to birds and specifically to the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.459
 prosthesis development I came here to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.709
 bird hospital of the unam and well then 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.690
 try to return them a little bit of what 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.150
 that they give us not so much as birds of 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.250
 company as in nature not 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.170
 the bird hospital of the faculty of 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.079

 accessible and nowhere else are you going
