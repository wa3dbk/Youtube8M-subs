after<00:05:39.200> board<00:05:39.560> and<00:05:39.740> they<00:05:39.800> say<00:05:39.980> all<00:05:40.100> this

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
after board and they say all this

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.460 
after board and they say all this
they're<00:05:40.550> just<00:05:40.700> not<00:05:40.850> ready<00:05:41.080> it<00:05:42.080> does<00:05:42.290> involve

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
they're just not ready it does involve

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.550 
they're just not ready it does involve
it's<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.860> new<00:05:43.010> angle<00:05:43.280> sure<00:05:43.640> and<00:05:43.880> so<00:05:44.470> speaking<00:05:45.470> of

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
it's a new angle sure and so speaking of

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.930 
it's a new angle sure and so speaking of
your<00:05:45.740> matchups<00:05:46.100> you<00:05:46.220> said<00:05:46.370> you<00:05:46.430> had<00:05:46.550> one<00:05:46.700> loss

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
your matchups you said you had one loss

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.090 
your matchups you said you had one loss
today<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.750> one<00:05:47.870> loss<00:05:48.050> was<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.260> read<00:05:48.650> because

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
today the one loss was to read because

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.830 
today the one loss was to read because
you<00:05:49.400> didn't<00:05:49.640> put<00:05:49.760> shocks<00:05:50.060> in<00:05:50.300> your<00:05:50.419> sideboard

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
you didn't put shocks in your sideboard

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.810 
you didn't put shocks in your sideboard
so<00:05:51.080> if<00:05:51.169> people<00:05:51.320> were<00:05:51.740> playing<00:05:52.280> this<00:05:52.610> debt

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
so if people were playing this debt

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.130 
so if people were playing this debt
going<00:05:53.060> forward<00:05:53.510> they<00:05:53.690> would<00:05:53.840> want<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.080> have

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
going forward they would want to have

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.530 
going forward they would want to have
shocked<00:05:54.410> yes<00:05:54.980> it's<00:05:55.790> almost<00:05:56.150> it's<00:05:56.360> not

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
shocked yes it's almost it's not

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.230 
shocked yes it's almost it's not
overkill<00:05:57.080> but<00:05:57.530> it<00:05:57.860> helps<00:05:58.610> to<00:05:58.700> match<00:05:58.850> up<00:05:59.000> a<00:05:59.090> lot

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
overkill but it helps to match up a lot

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.520 
overkill but it helps to match up a lot
more<00:05:59.360> especially<00:05:59.660> when<00:05:59.930> like<00:06:00.080> sixty<00:06:00.440> percent

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
more especially when like sixty percent

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.380 
more especially when like sixty percent
of<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.860> field<00:06:01.070> is<00:06:01.340> that<00:06:01.580> deck<00:06:01.820> or<00:06:01.970> a<00:06:02.000> variant
