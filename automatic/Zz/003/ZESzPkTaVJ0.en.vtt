 major problems affecting i 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.170

 among many which will be the companion of one 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.600

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.210
 with the hope that one of the two meetings 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.210
 in favor of the hunter 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 vito 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:57.350

 and also on four 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.399
 and nervous he wants to hunt 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.180

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.860
 closed in trial and on display his 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.140
 selection principles are based on 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.840
 couplings between subjects with spiccate 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.690
 natural qualities such as the typicality of 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.240
 breed the right ability to carry over 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.210
 instinctive the expressive signature the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.460
 character and balance 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.860
 different are the laurels collected by the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.090
 his dogs in all these years 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.400
 we mention in 1998 and 2007 the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.570
 participation in the team 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.970

 defines stocky has its own elegance 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.860
 and a vigor that is expressed not only by the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.330
 movement but also from the look always
