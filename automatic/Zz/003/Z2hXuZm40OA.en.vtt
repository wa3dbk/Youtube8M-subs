00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Did you ever notice how people 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.950
 Do you like sugar cane sugar? 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.170
 cachaça up to car 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.400
 After all, fuel alcohol comes from here. 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.380
 sugar cane 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.870
 but now you must be wondering 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.310
 with which sugarcane has to do with the history of 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.289
 Brazil is not really 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.600
 then know that who gave the great 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.420
 push to Brazil to start your 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.420
 history was precisely the sugar cane 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.489
 today Brazil is like this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.270
 but at the time when the Portuguese 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.719
 They arrived here and they did not even talk in Brazil. 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.399
 there was an international agreement 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.980
 dividing the new continent 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.559
 this agreement was called a 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.410
 tordesilhas which is the name of the city of 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:03.059
 Spain where it was signed and the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.080
 stayed here is Spanish America and 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.240
 Here the Portuguese America and Portugal 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.860
 Spain were the great powers 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.590
 economic conditions of that time 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.020
 for this very reason they were great rituals and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.509
 for them the new world was before 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.240
 anything a source of wealth 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.840
 the Spaniards advanced to the interior 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.700
 behind gold and silver the Portuguese are 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.890
 settled on the coast 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.950
 It was there that started a very 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.689
 trade between the Portuguese 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.220
 and Indians from Tupinambás or barter 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.710
 which first drew the attention of 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.649
 Portuguese in these new lands was the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.869
 Brazil wood a very valued wood 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.960
 in Europe because it was used to dye 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.960
 fabrics 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.870
 to have access to this wood the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.630
 Portuguese have formed alliances with 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.090
 different indigenous peoples the Indians 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.280
 They cut the trees and carrying the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.950
 Brazil wood until the coast 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.979
 in exchange they received from the Portuguese 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.560
 iron for agriculture 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.429
 fabrics mirrors beads among others 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.440
 articles 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.200
 this type of product exchange for 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.750
 product is called barter 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.060
 in many moments the Portuguese used 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.790
 elements of the social organization of 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.980
 native peoples for their own 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.470
 war would be one of the elements 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.980
 of the social organization of 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:33.850
 tupinambá is through it that the groups 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.070
 better in time and space 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.980
 another characteristic that must be 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.730
 emphasized is the question of alliances 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.650
 wars provided and this will be 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.380
 with the arrival of Europeans 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.870
 one of the keys to penetration of 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.079
 European domination in this region of 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.660
 America precisely because the Indians did not 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.130
 be interested in making alliances with 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.049
 that they offered 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:05.079
 about the traditional enemy and 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:08.370
 for Europeans in return was 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:12.430
 very clear that it was not enough to enter 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.820
 invade kill and yes it would be necessary 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.970
 before to achieve your goals 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.459
 to enter this circuit of alliances and 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.200
 indigenous war 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.110
 the French wanted to enter any 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.390
 cost in Brazil 's wood business they do not 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.940
 they gave the least ball to the agreement that 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.150
 divided the new world between Portuguese 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.820
 in a short time the tide became 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.860
 favorable to the French and 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.290
 Portuguese realized that not 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.340
 to take their share of the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.799
 america weather and close reminiscent of sugarcane 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.930
 that's when she enters the king of portugal 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.299
 perceived that the best way to occupy 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.760
 our territory was to stimulate 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.590
 cultivation of sugarcane and sugar production 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.150
 in these Brazilian lands 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.100
 that's where the history of our 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.280
 colonization 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.590
 The Portuguese began to be worth it. 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.520
 they chose the sugar cane because they knew 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.370
 it made a profit 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.470
 he already had experience in the branch was 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.560
 cool that they colonized their islands 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.430
 near the African coast labor not 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.650
 it was a problem 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.989
 besides the native Indians in the colony 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.150
 Portuguese had another source for them 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.650
 they knew how to take advantage of conflicts between 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.650
 the African tribes 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.670
 there was also the practice of barter, only 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.680
 instead of wood 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.900
 the merchandise they carried in their 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.720
 ships was human 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.210
 economic model based on large 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.580
 cane plantations touched by hand 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.170
 of slave labor was imported with 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.170
 success for america
