00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.950

 we have enjoyed the camera 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.409
 we can even explain the fact that 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.720
 for the third place we decided to donate 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.790
 this one is a 1000 rubles card 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:23.840
 let's show you closer to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.760
 the person who played you need to click is not 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.200
 one of the amazing compositions of all 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.770
 world but at least he played it 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.810
 very cool worthy as people mm and spam 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.950
 it was a group of pantera composition 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.950
 called artush by this 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.820
 the signal pretty flowed her cynically yes with 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.800
 points of view 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:05.620
 give thanks to him 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.410
 but we liked it a lot 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.750
 how he did let it on his face was not 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.660
 grudge 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.260
 but the race would play very arrogantly and 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.340
 getting we even started crying out to everyone 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:26.830
 and even threw it open where is the evil but 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.670
 maybe he's just such a crowd of fox 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.000
 you can customize 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.230
 what occupy and get second place 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.230
 takes and gets 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.680
 daft punk and get lucky song 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.000
 i hate this song and everything 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.270
 I don't like daft punk either 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.770
 Cottages do not like but still on 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.690
 it should be noted that the carpet is played very 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.970
 lightly attentively all parties 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.489
 cool picked up played and this 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.550
 the only carpet is the only one 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:17.340
 cameras among the videos that were 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.410
 selected where we present vocals 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.139
 letting vocals of course in places not 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.590
 perfect but i feel that somewhere there 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.500
 three this potential stars and ready 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.930
 break out so cameras are very me 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.090
 liked it really good and 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.710
 when a video was sent to us right away 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:42.060
 understand that this is one of the prizes 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:45.919
 thank you very good fellow 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.919
 first place us all is gorgeous 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.940
 what gets this lucky he gets 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.190
 five thousand rubles in water and order 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.060
 case we are incredibly lucky him that I 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:20.450
 can I tell you for the song wait 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:23.600
 which composition is no stasis worth well 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.580
 let's just bend it a little shamefully only 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.380
 the fact that everything was recorded on camera and 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.820
 the sound came from the cameras but he was 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.400
 no worse than u 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.470
 yes whom I cheat teeth a little worse than u 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:43.730
 other contestants but he 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:45.800
 handed what they thought here if 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.440
 he cut off his head and attach head 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.320
 the person who originally track it then 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.890
 Basically nothing would change everything 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:58.820
 it was very clear and straight forward here 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:01.730
 right here is the first place a man took 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:06.440
 who played a song cover on strike 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:09.710
 to song us track to song on strike 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.950
 boogie that joe initially performs 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.950

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:49.070

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.770

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:04.730

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.070
 come up with further contests 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.810
