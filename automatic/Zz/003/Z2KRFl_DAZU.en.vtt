this<00:00:04.770> brake<00:00:05.339> caliper<00:00:05.960> whenever<00:00:07.130> you<00:00:08.130> press<00:00:08.670> I

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
this brake caliper whenever you press I

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.310 
this brake caliper whenever you press I
just<00:00:09.179> changed<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.540> brakes<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.080> had<00:00:10.230> to

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
just changed the brakes and we had to

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.700 
just changed the brakes and we had to
take<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> caliper<00:00:11.040> off<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:12.150> get<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.230> piston

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
take the caliper off to get the piston

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.320 
take the caliper off to get the piston
to<00:00:13.799> go<00:00:13.920> back<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.280> because<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.700> was<00:00:14.790> stuck<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
to go back in because it was stuck and

to go back in because it was stuck and
the<00:00:15.509> pins<00:00:15.809> also<00:00:16.260> were<00:00:16.440> stuck<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.920> had<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.250> get

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the pins also were stuck we had to get

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.660 
the pins also were stuck we had to get
all<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.029> moving<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.750> lubricate<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.800> up<00:00:19.920> put

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
all that moving and lubricate it up put

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.460 
all that moving and lubricate it up put
the<00:00:20.760> new<00:00:20.880> brake<00:00:21.060> pads<00:00:21.090> back<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.199> in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the new brake pads back on it put it in

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.730 
the new brake pads back on it put it in
but<00:00:23.310> now<00:00:23.609> whenever<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.359> press<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.080> brake<00:00:25.260> the

but now whenever you press the brake the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.560 
but now whenever you press the brake the
cowl<00:00:25.949> or<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.519> piston<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.060> caliber<00:00:27.420> will

cowl or the piston on the caliber will

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.189 
cowl or the piston on the caliber will
come<00:00:27.750> out<00:00:28.160> but<00:00:29.160> won't<00:00:29.369> stay<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.689> go<00:00:30.960> when

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
come out but won't stay out it go when

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.659

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you let off the brake it goes all the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.299 
you let off the brake it goes all the
way<00:00:33.030> back<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.710> when<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.920> press<00:00:35.070> the

way back in and then when you press the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.889 
way back in and then when you press the
brake<00:00:35.430> again<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.850> won't<00:00:35.969> come<00:00:36.239> back<00:00:36.270> out<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
brake again it won't come back out and

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.350 
brake again it won't come back out and
meet<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> brake<00:00:37.500> pad<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.980> I've<00:00:38.610> bled<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
meet the brake pad and I've bled it and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.869 
meet the brake pad and I've bled it and
I've<00:00:39.450> bled<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:39.989> I've<00:00:40.050> wet<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.670> after<00:00:41.670> even

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I've bled it and I've wet it after even

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.350 
I've bled it and I've wet it after even
try<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> holding<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.160> piston<00:00:44.160> caliber<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
try to holding the piston caliber or the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660 
try to holding the piston caliber or the
piston<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:46.230> while<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.190> let<00:00:47.309> off<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.640> brake

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
piston out while we let off the brake

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.549 
piston out while we let off the brake
hoping<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> would<00:00:48.510> suck<00:00:48.719> some<00:00:48.899> fluid<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
hoping it would suck some fluid in to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.930 
hoping it would suck some fluid in to
fill<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> chamber<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.640> didn't<00:00:50.879> work

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
fill up the chamber but that didn't work

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.580 
fill up the chamber but that didn't work
either

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590

now I'm gonna have my wife press it if

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
now I'm gonna have my wife press it if

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
on pumping now let off of it as you can

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.690 
on pumping now let off of it as you can
see<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.320> back<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.520> will

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
see there it's going back in and it will

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.750 
see there it's going back in and it will
go<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:12.630> back<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.619> stop<00:01:14.549> now

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
go all the way back in and stop now

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.499 
go all the way back in and stop now
press<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> brake<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:17.000> as<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.330> see

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
press the brake one time as you can see

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
press the brake one time as you can see
it<00:01:19.170> didn't<00:01:19.439> come<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.890> touch<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> brakes

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it didn't come out and touch the brakes

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
it didn't come out and touch the brakes
now<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.570> I'm<00:01:21.659> thinking<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> there<00:01:22.500> might<00:01:22.740> be

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
now what I'm thinking is there might be

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.700 
now what I'm thinking is there might be
some<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.369> one-way<00:01:23.729> valve<00:01:24.350> that's<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
some kind of one-way valve that's of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.020 
some kind of one-way valve that's of
course<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.009> mean<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.400> don't<00:01:26.490> see<00:01:26.640> how<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.909> would

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
course I mean I don't see how that would

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.090 
course I mean I don't see how that would
work<00:01:27.119> because<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.530> possible<00:01:29.009> that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
work because it would it's possible that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.580 
work because it would it's possible that
that<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.369> cause<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:30.200> hold<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> brakes

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
that would cause it to hold the brakes

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.859 
that would cause it to hold the brakes
on<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.100> for<00:01:32.310> some<00:01:32.520> reason<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.299> piston<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
on but for some reason the piston is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.569 
on but for some reason the piston is
shooting<00:01:34.140> all<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> way<00:01:34.680> back<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.479> I've<00:01:36.479> tried

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
shooting all the way back in I've tried

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.310 
shooting all the way back in I've tried
you<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.610> pressing<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> caliper<00:01:40.020> all<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
you know pressing the caliper all the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.760 
you know pressing the caliper all the
way<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.630> open<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
way in and then you know open it up to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.609 
way in and then you know open it up to
even<00:01:44.009> let<00:01:44.159> air<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.880> see<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> would<00:01:45.619> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
even let air in to see if that would you

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.010 
even let air in to see if that would you
know<00:01:46.799> keep<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> piston<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.149> until<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.689> could

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
know keep the piston out until I could

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420 
know keep the piston out until I could
get<00:01:49.200> fluid<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.130> didn't<00:01:50.369> work

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
get fluid in it but that didn't work

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.859 
get fluid in it but that didn't work
I've<00:01:51.390> tried<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.479> I've<00:01:54.479> tried<00:01:54.689> several

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
I've tried you know I've tried several

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.359 
I've tried you know I've tried several
methods<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> bleeding<00:01:55.890> where<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:58.369> have

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
methods of bleeding where you have

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.209 
methods of bleeding where you have
someone<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.500> you<00:02:01.500> open<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> bleeder<00:02:02.100> valve

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
someone to you open the bleeder valve

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.859 
someone to you open the bleeder valve
you<00:02:02.579> pressed<00:02:02.909> all<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> way<00:02:03.420> down<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you pressed all the way down on the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.090 
you pressed all the way down on the
pedal<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.649> tighten<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> bleeder

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
pedal and then you tighten the bleeder

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.249 
pedal and then you tighten the bleeder
valve<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.850> didn't<00:02:06.060> work<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.540> mean<00:02:07.140> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
valve back up I didn't work I mean it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.719 
valve back up I didn't work I mean it
bled<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:07.799> nothing<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.129> know<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.459> didn't

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
bled it but nothing you know that didn't

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660 
bled it but nothing you know that didn't
fix<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.569> I've<00:02:09.720> had<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.830> pump<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.459> brake

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
fix it and I've had to pump the brake

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.080 
fix it and I've had to pump the brake
all<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.209> way<00:02:12.270> up

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
all the way up

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.580 
all the way up
and<00:02:13.420> then<00:02:15.510> open<00:02:16.510> hold<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.140> hold<00:02:17.500> the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and then open hold it and hold the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.680 
and then open hold it and hold the
breakdown<00:02:17.950> after<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.819> pump<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.120> up<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.390> open

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
breakdown after you pump it up and open

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.750 
breakdown after you pump it up and open
the<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.140> bleeder<00:02:20.770> valve<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.310> let's<00:02:21.489> pressure

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
the the bleeder valve and let's pressure

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.479 
the the bleeder valve and let's pressure
off<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.390> bled<00:02:23.020> -<00:02:23.319> but<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.920> didn't<00:02:24.220> fix<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
off that bled - but that didn't fix the

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.260 
off that bled - but that didn't fix the
problem<00:02:25.260> I'm<00:02:26.260> thinking<00:02:26.860> maybe<00:02:27.069> there's<00:02:28.030> some

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
problem I'm thinking maybe there's some

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.780 
problem I'm thinking maybe there's some
kind<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.630> there's<00:02:28.810> something<00:02:29.020> up<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.410> it's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
kind of there's something up that it's

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.580 
kind of there's something up that it's
letting<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.910> brake<00:02:31.090> fluid<00:02:31.120> flow<00:02:31.989> back<00:02:32.200> up<00:02:32.380> in

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
letting the brake fluid flow back up in

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.660 
letting the brake fluid flow back up in
there<00:02:32.769> or<00:02:32.980> there's<00:02:33.190> something<00:02:33.459> wrong<00:02:33.550> with

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
there or there's something wrong with

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.199 
there or there's something wrong with
this<00:02:33.760> piston<00:02:35.190> any<00:02:36.190> suggestions<00:02:37.030> would<00:02:37.150> be

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
this piston any suggestions would be

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.770 
this piston any suggestions would be
great<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.989> mean<00:02:38.560> I've<00:02:38.739> been<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.370> mechanic

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
great I I mean I've been a mechanic

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.240 
great I I mean I've been a mechanic
forever<00:02:40.780> but<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.440> first<00:02:41.830> video<00:02:42.099> on

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
forever but this is the first video on

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.390 
forever but this is the first video on
and<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.269> cannot<00:02:43.599> figure<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.019> problem<00:02:44.200> out<00:02:44.560> and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
and I cannot figure this problem out and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.039 
and I cannot figure this problem out and
I<00:02:45.489> don't<00:02:45.549> want<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.880> go<00:02:45.970> replacing<00:02:46.540> things<00:02:46.750> that

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
I don't want to go replacing things that

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.509 
I don't want to go replacing things that
I<00:02:47.080> don't<00:02:47.380> know<00:02:47.500> what<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.769> problem<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.190> I

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
I don't know what the problem is I

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.490 
I don't know what the problem is I
thought<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.269> could<00:02:49.450> be<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.930> master<00:02:50.290> cylinder

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
thought it could be the master cylinder

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.400 
thought it could be the master cylinder
but<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.459> don't<00:02:51.850> see<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.720> would<00:02:53.140> that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
but I don't see that that would that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.020 
but I don't see that that would that
would<00:02:53.890> be<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.130> problem<00:02:54.430> because<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.760> rest<00:02:54.790> of

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
would be the problem because the rest of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.729 
would be the problem because the rest of
the<00:02:55.090> brakes<00:02:55.299> work<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:55.720> only<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.319> one<00:02:56.560> right

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
the brakes work it's only this one right

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.680 
the brakes work it's only this one right
here<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.160> causing<00:02:57.549> this<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:57.849> far<00:02:58.090> I've<00:02:58.450> not

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
here this causing this so far I've not

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.940 
here this causing this so far I've not
changed<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.170> other<00:02:59.290> side<00:02:59.500> yet<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.799> I<00:02:59.830> don't

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
changed the other side yet so I don't

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.229 
changed the other side yet so I don't
know<00:03:00.099> if<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.340> gonna<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.670> same<00:03:00.849> yet<00:03:01.120> or

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
know if it's gonna do the same yet or

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.509 
know if it's gonna do the same yet or
not<00:03:01.390> but<00:03:01.690> if<00:03:02.319> any<00:03:02.620> suggestions<00:03:03.250> would<00:03:03.370> be

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
not but if any suggestions would be

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.460 
not but if any suggestions would be
