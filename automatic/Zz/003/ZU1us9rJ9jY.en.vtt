00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 if it costs on all of me if it coordinates in 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
 three states and this is while we're 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.779
 a day so you know that all the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.340
 days a new way and the truth that the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.010
 engine is quite interesting because 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.750
 good came the 1.6 point 4 and I only had 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.670
 nc one thing and there are a couple of things 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.139
 which is quite interesting to improve 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.910
 of the way to do each version what 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.890
 we are improving and the truth that deserves 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.670
 the penalty is that we are going to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 start punt baba he solves the boat 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.750
 agree in this case we do 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.189
 the first mailman mister and then the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.470
 engine functionality that you understand 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 a little better is worth a normal mark on 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.649
 boat that you usually do if you 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.320
 we put a little iron we make a 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.329
 reinforced boat is worth it and if this one formed you 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.640
 reinforced we put you observe that in 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.550
 an obsidian boat so it's a boat 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.020
 reinforced good and very reinforced could 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.910
 to be perfectly I do not know if it is seen 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.820
 when you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.360
 A) Yes 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.950
 very fast so very fast 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.760
 so that it is more or less can be 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.820
 understand 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.920
 the functionality of the reinforced boat is worth 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.650
 let's put here water is worth 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.800
 important 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.930
 a boat without water is a boat there and there 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.050
 as well 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.790
 very good if we put the 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.890
 lollipop texts that you can find 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:21.090
 through the swamp to see 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.970
 and well, there he agrees with the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.590
 boat this here the reinforced with this 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 boat when you find these olympus 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.240
 what happens is that you end up crashing 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.590
 with them in agreement you are taking one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.030
 I'll tell you if maybe in the third 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.700
 had the rom but maybe the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.410
 first the boat breaks or whatever the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.030
 difference is in the reinforced boat 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.479
 when it is not 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.970
 when you pass you see I break it 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.500
 lift a little bit of the beltrÃ¡n 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.940
 seeing in such a way that it is not going to 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.200
 breaking the worthy boat is a boat 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.510
 It reinforced next well for 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.790
 swamps 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.010
 well once done this let's teach 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.890
 what would be the boat of 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.890
 Obsidian is the right name for 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.110
 obsidian if there are we can deduce that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.110
 will be inside the spot here we will enter 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.810
 the portal poster of town and subdued 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.400
 villagers so we could make ourselves a 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.860
 hell day 2 farm of seems 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.900
 quite interesting for the future 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.489
 do something like that in 20 times survival 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.989
 I would do them a lot, so if 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.630
 you are watching the video and some 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.010
 participate really watch their survival for 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.780
 please and is addicted you have to make a 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.800
 villager's farm or a village of 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.599
 villagers do not need a farm 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.360
 villagers a villager villager in the 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.819
 own hell to see how about something 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.319
 curious something funny the boat the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.049
 Obsidian let's catch the other boats 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.269
 so we can see a little what happens if 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:48.660
 I put a normal pot the lava by 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.980
 logic is going to happen this and if it goes it dies 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.650
 if you have reinforced it, a 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.489
 little bit of the same thing but vice versa 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.489
 so one has been another 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.970
 any plan and if you put me aside 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.620
 but it does not matter if he's going to stay and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.410
 once you ride on it you will win 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.870
 resistance to fire that is going to stay 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.040
 there is always worth 350 of him was going to continue 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.370
 at a speed 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.380
 of vertigo there is a vast furious and if I 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.720
 hit 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.390
 nothing is happening then metro that you know more 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.140
 will break the boat or anything for the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.930
 style there is our boat 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.900
 this is good to look for what 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.040
 it's being the morras or whatever 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.040
 I'm going to play because this is not 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.370
 and there are today these holes here mother 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.870
 mine 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.220
 and little else no longer has to be 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.409
 mysterious the reason I think it is 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.319
 interesting mostly for the face 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.790
 sell because all this we have to 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.980
 do we have to be looking for the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.200
 title road out there by a side that 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.420
 we pass it to triple you take it from the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.840
 pull and follow with some engines to your 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.500
 ok roll let's go I see it very 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.420
 interesting is great and graphics this 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.030
 has been everything if you like like subscribe 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.549
 esteem on twitter on google + on facebook 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.540
 in taringa tweets and nothing greater than more and 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.540
 better until later
