00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
came over to America I guess and Canada

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.550

and Shoppers Drug Mart carry some and
what<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.859> very<00:00:20.130> unique<00:00:20.760> about<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.180> line<00:00:21.449> is

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
what is very unique about this line is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.189 
what is very unique about this line is
that<00:00:21.800> here<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.980> Canada<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.660> cheap<00:00:24.990> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
fake lashes and the packaging I mean

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.719 
fake lashes and the packaging I mean
it's<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.630> thick<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:11.159> mascara

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
it's kind of kind of thick for a mascara

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
it's kind of kind of thick for a mascara
but<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.330> mean<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.350> ones<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.770> come

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
but I mean now they have ones that come

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
but I mean now they have ones that come
in<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.189> odd<00:01:14.400> shapes<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> mean<00:01:15.390> doesn't

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
in like odd shapes so I mean doesn't

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
in like odd shapes so I mean doesn't
really<00:01:16.229> matter<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> were<00:01:17.790> story<00:01:18.150> in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
really matter but if you were story in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.780 
really matter but if you were story in
your<00:01:18.360> purse<00:01:18.630> kind<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> it'll<00:01:19.890> bake<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.369> then

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
your purse kind of it'll bake and then

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.880 
your purse kind of it'll bake and then
this<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.990> brush<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.740> very<00:01:22.770> big<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.930> don't

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
this the brush is very big so I don't

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
this the brush is very big so I don't
have<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> compare<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.840> just

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
have one to compare it to but it's just

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.460 
have one to compare it to but it's just
a<00:01:28.170> very<00:01:28.439> thick<00:01:28.950> fiber<00:01:29.490> brush<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.960> actually

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
a very thick fiber brush and it actually

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.940 
a very thick fiber brush and it actually
gives<00:01:31.740> fairly<00:01:32.460> good<00:01:32.670> volume<00:01:32.939> um<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:34.229> doesn't<00:01:34.470> -

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
gives fairly good volume um it doesn't -

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.399 
gives fairly good volume um it doesn't -
it<00:01:35.610> doesn't<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.390> anything<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it doesn't do really anything for the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.490 
it doesn't do really anything for the
length<00:01:37.680> um<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:39.000> definitely<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.720> volume<00:01:40.229> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
length um but definitely for volume it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.810 
length um but definitely for volume it
is<00:01:41.420> pretty<00:01:42.420> awesome<00:01:42.600> um<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.799> separates<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
is pretty awesome um it separates the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940 
is pretty awesome um it separates the
lashes<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.600> some<00:01:45.810> extent<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> coats

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
lashes to some extent and then it coats

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.679 
lashes to some extent and then it coats
them<00:01:47.159> all<00:01:47.280> individually<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.180> actually

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
them all individually so I actually

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.149 
them all individually so I actually
haven't<00:01:49.049> noticed<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.590> any<00:01:49.740> clumping

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
haven't noticed really any clumping

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.670 
haven't noticed really any clumping
maybe<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:51.180> once<00:01:51.570> every<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.020> often<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.560> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
maybe like once every so often but it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.929 
maybe like once every so often but it
could<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.130> I'm<00:01:53.549> putting<00:01:53.820> too

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
could just be because I'm putting too

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.300 
could just be because I'm putting too
much<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.740> way<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.009> doing

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
much on or like just the way I'm doing

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
much on or like just the way I'm doing
in<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.460> sloppy<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.149> early<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> morning

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
in a sloppy it's early in the morning

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.440 
in a sloppy it's early in the morning
but<00:01:58.680> overall<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.520> don't<00:01:59.729> really<00:01:59.909> notice<00:02:00.119> any

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
but overall I don't really notice any

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.469 
but overall I don't really notice any
any<00:02:00.869> clumping<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.490> definitely<00:02:02.729> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
any clumping and it definitely it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.410 
any clumping and it definitely it
definitely<00:02:03.960> adds<00:02:04.110> volume<00:02:04.619> um<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.329> on

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
definitely adds volume um I have it on

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.510 
definitely adds volume um I have it on
my<00:02:06.570> eyelids<00:02:07.079> right<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.069> think<00:02:08.129> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
my eyelids right now and I think it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.480 
my eyelids right now and I think it
makes<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.879> look<00:02:08.940> pretty<00:02:09.420> good

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.080 

now<00:02:13.450> I<00:02:13.480> notice<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:14.410> not<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.280> hundred

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
now I notice that it's not a hundred

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.050 
now I notice that it's not a hundred
percent<00:02:16.350> completely<00:02:17.350> waterproof<00:02:17.710> um<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.790> is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
percent completely waterproof um it is

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.910 
percent completely waterproof um it is
for<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.330> most<00:02:19.540> part<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:20.050> go<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.440> gym<00:02:20.620> or<00:02:20.770> go<00:02:20.860> to

completely fine it doesn't clump at all
which<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:16.480> pretty<00:03:16.750> huge<00:03:17.020> because<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.500> have<00:03:17.800> some

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
which is pretty huge because I have some

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.340 
which is pretty huge because I have some
mascaras<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.480> looks<00:03:19.690> really<00:03:19.930> good<00:03:20.050> but

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
mascaras that it looks really good but

evening and I tend to do that a lot then
it<00:03:24.580> just<00:03:24.910> clumps<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.450> just<00:03:25.690> can't<00:03:25.960> stand<00:03:26.260> that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
it just clumps it just can't stand that

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.770 
it just clumps it just can't stand that
second<00:03:26.770> coat<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.460> it's<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.210> really<00:03:28.570> good<00:03:28.750> I
