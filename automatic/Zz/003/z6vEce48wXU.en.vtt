four discipline problems a week most of
what<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.650> students<00:00:47.040> for<00:00:47.220> when<00:00:47.430> they're

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
what I see students for when they're

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
what I see students for when they're
coming<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.300> they've<00:00:48.629> done<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> good

job on something they're just a very
positive<00:00:51.570> students<00:00:52.230> lots<00:00:52.470> of<00:00:52.590> parents

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
positive students lots of parents

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:03.860 
positive students lots of parents
support<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.519> really<00:00:53.850> helps<00:00:54.120> us<00:01:02.720> when<00:01:03.720> I<00:01:03.750> go

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
support which really helps us when I go

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
support which really helps us when I go
into<00:01:04.110> classrooms<00:01:04.440> what<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.759> a<00:01:05.790> lot<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
into classrooms what I see is a lot of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670 
into classrooms what I see is a lot of
intense<00:01:06.509> interactions<00:01:07.140> between<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
intense interactions between the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.340 
intense interactions between the
teachers<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.399> students<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.350> teachers

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
teachers and the students and teachers

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.960 
teachers and the students and teachers
are<00:01:10.530> interacting<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.190> all<00:01:11.310> times<00:01:11.580> with<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
are interacting at all times with the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.060 
are interacting at all times with the
students<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.440> if<00:01:13.530> students<00:01:13.920> are

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
students and so and if students are

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.320 
students and so and if students are
working<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.490> groups<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.940> each<00:01:14.970> other

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
working in groups with each other

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.940 
working in groups with each other
there's<00:01:15.660> lots<00:01:15.899> of<00:01:16.050> interaction<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.770> on

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
there's lots of interaction going on

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.950 
there's lots of interaction going on
rather<00:01:17.280> than<00:01:17.520> independent<00:01:17.789> work<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
rather than independent work the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.710 
rather than independent work the
independent<00:01:19.590> work<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.490> home<00:01:20.910> and<00:01:21.210> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
independent work is is at home and that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.840 
independent work is is at home and that
the<00:01:22.020> intense<00:01:22.500> instruction<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:23.399> happening<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the intense instruction is happening in

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.270 
the intense instruction is happening in
the<00:01:23.940> classrooms<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> time

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.430 

I<00:01:33.340> think<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.270> test<00:01:34.510> scores<00:01:34.750> keep<00:01:34.990> going<00:01:35.290> up

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
I think the test scores keep going up

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.520 
I think the test scores keep going up
through<00:01:35.680> consistency<00:01:36.930> we've<00:01:37.930> decided<00:01:38.380> on

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
through consistency we've decided on

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.200 
through consistency we've decided on
what<00:01:38.740> what<00:01:39.130> our<00:01:39.159> goals<00:01:39.520> are<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:39.970> what<00:01:40.030> our

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
what what our goals are and what our

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.149 
what what our goals are and what our
programs<00:01:40.659> are<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.960> get<00:01:41.140> there<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.590> we're<00:01:42.070> not

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
programs are to get there and we're not

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.890 
programs are to get there and we're not
changing<00:01:42.460> those<00:01:42.820> programs<00:01:43.270> every<00:01:43.570> single

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
changing those programs every single

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.320 
changing those programs every single
year

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
year

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.999 
year
we're<00:01:46.330> being<00:01:46.570> consistent<00:01:47.259> in<00:01:47.350> our<00:01:47.440> strategies

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
we're being consistent in our strategies

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.010 
we're being consistent in our strategies
that<00:01:48.130> we're<00:01:48.250> using<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:49.330> teachers<00:01:49.690> are<00:01:49.780> using

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
that we're using the teachers are using

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.570 
that we're using the teachers are using
the<00:01:50.110> same<00:01:50.320> strategies<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> year<00:01:51.159> after<00:01:51.430> year

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
the same strategies a year after year

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.040 
the same strategies a year after year
after<00:01:51.670> year<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.330> when<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.540> teachers<00:01:52.899> go

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
after year so that when the teachers go

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.440 
after year so that when the teachers go
from<00:01:53.320> one<00:01:53.770> grade<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.430> next<00:01:54.460> grade<00:01:54.909> they're

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
from one grade to the next grade they're

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.030 
from one grade to the next grade they're
not<00:01:55.630> getting<00:01:55.930> all<00:01:56.140> new<00:01:56.320> instruction<00:01:56.890> in<00:01:57.009> that

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
not getting all new instruction in that

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.670 
not getting all new instruction in that
grade<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.610> not<00:01:58.240> sure<00:01:58.509> how<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.750> do<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.170> it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
grade and not sure how to do it it's

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.499 
grade and not sure how to do it it's
very<00:01:59.890> consistent<00:02:00.340> across<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.030> grade<00:02:01.210> levels

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
very consistent across the grade levels

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.999 
very consistent across the grade levels
and<00:02:01.540> across<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.020> school<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.590> when<00:02:02.770> kids

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
and across the school so that when kids

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.710 
and across the school so that when kids
moved<00:02:03.280> from<00:02:03.640> one<00:02:03.850> teacher<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.360> next

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
moved from one teacher to the next

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.870 
moved from one teacher to the next
teacher<00:02:04.899> for<00:02:05.200> example<00:02:05.259> in<00:02:05.619> writing<00:02:06.009> they

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
teacher for example in writing they

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.639 
teacher for example in writing they
they're<00:02:07.210> taught<00:02:07.420> writing<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.110> same<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.500> one

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
they're taught writing the same in one

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.050 
they're taught writing the same in one
classroom<00:02:08.950> as<00:02:09.310> they'll<00:02:09.489> be<00:02:09.610> taught<00:02:09.820> in<00:02:09.970> the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
classroom as they'll be taught in the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.460 
classroom as they'll be taught in the
next<00:02:10.300> classroom<00:02:10.750> they're<00:02:11.050> taught<00:02:11.230> reading

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
next classroom they're taught reading

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.990 
next classroom they're taught reading
the<00:02:11.800> same<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.100> one<00:02:12.250> classroom<00:02:12.489> as<00:02:12.760> they'll<00:02:12.880> be

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
the same in one classroom as they'll be

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.250 
the same in one classroom as they'll be
taught<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.300> next<00:02:13.540> classroom<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.019> that<00:02:14.050> it's

referring back to that to see what they

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.360 
referring back to that to see what they
need<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:35.200> learn<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.650> how<00:02:35.980> much<00:02:36.130> progress

they've<00:02:36.730> made

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.550 

we<00:02:43.879> have<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.060> level<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.569> literature<00:02:45.140> library

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
we have a level of literature library

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.920 
we have a level of literature library
which<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.189> where<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.519> students<00:02:46.939> teachers<00:02:47.480> can

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
which is where the students teachers can

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.630 
which is where the students teachers can
go<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.140> pull<00:02:48.409> out<00:02:48.560> books<00:02:48.769> at<00:02:48.950> their<00:02:49.250> level

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
go to pull out books at their level

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.059 
go to pull out books at their level
research<00:02:50.569> shows<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:50.900> when<00:02:51.170> students<00:02:51.950> are

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
research shows that when students are

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.470 
research shows that when students are
practicing<00:02:52.459> at<00:02:52.609> their<00:02:52.790> independent<00:02:53.329> level

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
practicing at their independent level

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.809 
practicing at their independent level
there<00:02:54.290> they're<00:02:54.739> more<00:02:54.890> likely<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.340> show<00:02:55.549> growth

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
there they're more likely to show growth

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.539 
there they're more likely to show growth
and<00:02:56.090> consistently<00:02:56.659> move<00:02:56.930> up<00:02:57.140> we<00:02:58.069> also<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
and consistently move up we also have a

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.940 
and consistently move up we also have a
regular<00:02:59.090> library<00:02:59.390> where<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.409> actually<00:03:00.620> have

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
regular library where we actually have

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.890 
regular library where we actually have
met<00:03:01.129> our<00:03:01.220> goal<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.700> getting<00:03:01.849> more<00:03:02.659> than<00:03:02.840> a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
met our goal of getting more than a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.250 
met our goal of getting more than a
ratio<00:03:03.319> of<00:03:03.439> 20<00:03:03.739> books<00:03:03.920> per<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:04.400> student<00:03:05.260> most

ratio of 20 books per one student most
of<00:03:06.470> our<00:03:06.590> students<00:03:07.099> are<00:03:07.519> decoding<00:03:08.450> at<00:03:08.659> grade

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
of our students are decoding at grade

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.210 
of our students are decoding at grade
level<00:03:08.930> but<00:03:09.650> what<00:03:09.799> they're<00:03:09.950> having<00:03:10.189> problems

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
level but what they're having problems

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.520 
level but what they're having problems
with<00:03:10.609> is<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.909> comprehension<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:11.930> reading<00:03:12.379> and

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
with is the comprehension so reading and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.020 
with is the comprehension so reading and
reading<00:03:12.709> just<00:03:13.280> practicing<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.909> practicing

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
reading just practicing and practicing

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.729 
reading just practicing and practicing
and<00:03:14.450> practicing<00:03:14.569> that's<00:03:15.079> really<00:03:15.319> what<00:03:15.439> has<00:03:15.590> to

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
and practicing that's really what has to

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.589 
and practicing that's really what has to
happen<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:16.549> we<00:03:16.579> want<00:03:16.909> to<00:03:16.970> have<00:03:17.060> enough<00:03:17.329> books

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
happen so we want to have enough books

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.569 
happen so we want to have enough books
that<00:03:17.810> students<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:18.290> go<00:03:18.439> in<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.859> get<00:03:19.400> out

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579
