swipe<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.390> over<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.469> side<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.189> will

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
swipe this over to that side and it will

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.929 
swipe this over to that side and it will
say<00:01:59.430> translate<00:02:00.030> from<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.649> could

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
say translate from and then you could

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.959 
say translate from and then you could
enter<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:04.020> leap<00:02:04.439> text<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.880> will

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
enter the leap text in here and it will

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.600 
enter the leap text in here and it will
be<00:02:06.090> translated<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.840> English<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.459> a
