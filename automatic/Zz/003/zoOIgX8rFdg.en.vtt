guess<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.079> no<00:01:46.560> robot<00:01:47.070> modes<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.909> most

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
guess what no robot modes now most

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.940 
guess what no robot modes now most
things<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.570> okay<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.049> me<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.500> when<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> first
