00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.650
 with you the days of health mountain profile sections 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:25.109
 We, along with Max Popov now in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.660
 ice cave hid which 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.019
 taking a picture right here right around the corner 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.969
 see his feet sticking out of the cave 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.770
 so bye 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:41.820
 max is taking photographs i will do 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.719
 video review of his jacket Basque Valdez 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.030
 this warm jacket is a warm winter 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.640
 synthetic insulation calculated 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.100
 on on severe frosts honestly not 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.760
 I remember that the manufacturer indicates 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.460
 the site 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.270
 but I witnessed the participants 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.220
 Mountain section went important hikes with 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:13.010
 temperatures up to -30 with this jacket in 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.650
 as the main main warm 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.900
 Let's outline the characteristics 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.830
 This jacket I said that 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.409
 she has a very warm insulation 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.140
 the characteristic is that she has 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.549
 very high collar in fact if 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.439
 close the collar it turns out that he 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.470
 reaching out here is actually denunciation 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.049
 large hood that allows 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:49.860
 wear it on top of a helmet we take off the hood 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.990
 and go further inside is windproof 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 skirt 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.659
 there are some warm pockets first 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.630
 here 's the bottom and the top on 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.420
 chest level here and on the left side and on 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.409
 right warm pockets under some 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.539
 electronics 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.599
 and everything is all that you need to keep warm 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.590
 outer pockets just as well have 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.930
 small 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.260
 a small pocket in the central area 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.390
 the lightning is warm too 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.910
 warm pockets which are located 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.690
 high enough so it's practically not 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.750
 interfere 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.730
 even if you use the jacket with 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.220
 backpacker 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.220
 we get the belt under our jacket 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.170
 see try well and big mittens 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.329
 climbs and big fluffy hat yet 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.120
 one such feature on which i am 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.940
 constantly pay attention to this here 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.400
 here you see the tail 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.569
 it turns out the back is longer than the front 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.590
 part of the jacket that it gives you not 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.959
 inflates 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.060
 behind you basically even this tail 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.910
 when you can sit down somewhere 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.340
 tuck under the fifth point 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.079
 the jacket does not restrict movement when 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.500
 you take a big step of course it's not 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.319
 the urban jacket is the whole jacket 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.510
 for such extreme adventures 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.040
 but for real serious polar 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.190
 hiking it is used in polar 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.269
 expeditions 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:36.760
 I use it I know that it went on 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:41.169
 everest many people use in 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.840
 ski trips good it should be noted that 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.720
 not yet the most expensive anna if 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.370
 compare with a down jacket top 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.859
 from basque with han tengri 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.810
 it turns out even cheaper from such 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.950
 tell disadvantages compared to 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.799
 down jacket she 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.669
 packaged size is a little bit 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.879
 more than a jacket with the same 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:10.150
 thermal performance but with 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:13.150
 insulation down everything else probably 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.449
 only in a positive way well honestly 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.359
 telling me that jacket really like it 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:23.389
 I have no such 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:26.819
 I only have a little puff here thanks 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:31.889
