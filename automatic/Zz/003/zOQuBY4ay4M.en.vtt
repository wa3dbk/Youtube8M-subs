00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.130 

ok<00:00:05.280> so<00:00:05.340> now<00:00:06.150> we're<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.570> talk<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.840> little

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
ok so now we're going to talk a little

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.330 
ok so now we're going to talk a little
bit<00:00:07.350> about<00:00:07.529> bow<00:00:08.069> divisions<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:09.170> rhythms<00:00:10.340> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
bit about bow divisions and rhythms and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.720 
bit about bow divisions and rhythms and
a<00:00:12.240> good<00:00:12.540> way<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.930> demonstrate<00:00:13.709> bow<00:00:14.490> divisions

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
a good way to demonstrate bow divisions

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.770 
a good way to demonstrate bow divisions
is<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.959> scale<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:17.030> always<00:00:18.030> put<00:00:18.240> my<00:00:18.360> metronome

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
is in a scale I always put my metronome

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.160 
is in a scale I always put my metronome
at<00:00:19.080> 60<00:00:19.650> when<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.860> practice<00:00:20.340> my<00:00:20.520> scales<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
at 60 when I practice my scales and I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.189 
at 60 when I practice my scales and I
work<00:00:22.410> from<00:00:22.679> a<00:00:22.769> slow<00:00:23.070> tempo<00:00:23.390> up<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.550> faster

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
work from a slow tempo up to a faster

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.349 
work from a slow tempo up to a faster
tempo<00:00:28.199> but<00:00:28.589> the<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.089> metronome<00:00:30.089> always

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
tempo but the but the metronome always

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.819 
tempo but the but the metronome always
stays<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.779> 60<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> first<00:00:33.470> you<00:00:34.470> start<00:00:34.500> with

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
stays at 60 so first you start with

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.590 
stays at 60 so first you start with
whole<00:00:35.160> notes<00:00:35.460> which<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:37.190> 4<00:00:38.190> counts<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.910> 60<00:00:39.330> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
whole notes which is 4 counts to 60 and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.500 
whole notes which is 4 counts to 60 and
that's<00:00:40.020> dividing<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.830> bow<00:00:40.980> 1<00:00:41.600> 2<00:00:42.600> 3<00:00:43.640> 4<00:00:44.640> 1<00:00:45.600> 2<00:00:45.900> 3<00:00:47.510> 4

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that's dividing the bow 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.320 
that's dividing the bow 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
so<00:00:48.780> I'll<00:00:48.900> play<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:50.310> an<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.120> major

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
so I'll play a little bit of an a major

00:00:51.330 --> 00:01:08.360 
so I'll play a little bit of an a major
scale<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.990> that

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.830 

okay<00:01:09.370> now<00:01:09.580> I'm<00:01:09.760> going<00:01:09.910> to<00:01:09.970> show<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.270> about

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
okay now I'm going to show you about

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.940 
okay now I'm going to show you about
doing<00:01:11.770> half<00:01:12.340> notes<00:01:12.670> separate<00:01:13.480> bowls<00:01:13.950> I'm

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
doing half notes separate bowls I'm

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.710 
doing half notes separate bowls I'm
going<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.220> divide<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.820> bow<00:01:16.000> one<00:01:16.810> two<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:18.790> two

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
going to divide the bow one two one two

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:37.680 
going to divide the bow one two one two
so<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.530> bowl<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:20.770> going<00:01:20.980> a<00:01:21.070> little<00:01:21.160> faster

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.800 

and<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:40.100> we're<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.520> go<00:01:40.730> to<00:01:40.810> quarter

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
and now we're going to go to quarter

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.970 
and now we're going to go to quarter
notes<00:01:42.910> but<00:01:43.910> we're<00:01:44.060> going<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.660> slur<00:01:45.080> them<00:01:45.410> so

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
notes but we're going to slur them so

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.570 
notes but we're going to slur them so
that<00:01:46.190> one<00:01:46.730> note<00:01:47.060> is<00:01:47.300> half<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.870> bow<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:49.250> next

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
that one note is half a bow and the next

00:01:49.580 --> 00:02:01.140 
that one note is half a bow and the next
note<00:01:49.760> is<00:01:49.910> half<00:01:50.120> a<00:01:50.240> boat

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.860 

but<00:02:01.900> if<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.290> can<00:02:02.530> see<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.580> Bo<00:02:03.790> division<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.480> so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
but if you can see the Bo division is so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.800 
but if you can see the Bo division is so
important<00:02:05.830> because<00:02:06.130> if<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.940> did<00:02:07.210> not<00:02:07.360> divide

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
important because if I did not divide

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.859 
important because if I did not divide
that<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.320> half<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.460> divided<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.210> you<00:02:10.720> know

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
that in half and I divided it you know

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.440 
that in half and I divided it you know
the<00:02:11.110> first<00:02:11.350> note<00:02:11.620> 3/4<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.580> boat<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.000> then

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the first note 3/4 of a boat and then

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.360 
the first note 3/4 of a boat and then
the<00:02:13.600> second<00:02:14.020> note<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.620> quarter<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.220> bow

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
the second note just a quarter of a bow

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.790 
the second note just a quarter of a bow
the<00:02:15.910> sound<00:02:16.270> would<00:02:16.600> be<00:02:16.630> very<00:02:17.020> different<00:02:17.530> it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
the sound would be very different it

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.010 
the sound would be very different it
would<00:02:17.980> sound<00:02:18.250> like<00:02:18.490> this

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.160 

now<00:02:28.950> maybe<00:02:29.460> you'll<00:02:29.910> use<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.300> kind<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.990> bow

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
now maybe you'll use that kind of a bow

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.680 
now maybe you'll use that kind of a bow
speed<00:02:31.470> at<00:02:31.620> some<00:02:31.860> point<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.460> bow<00:02:32.640> division<00:02:33.090> but

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
speed at some point and bow division but

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.840 
speed at some point and bow division but
you<00:02:34.200> know<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> really<00:02:34.950> practice<00:02:35.160> your<00:02:35.550> scales

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
you know to really practice your scales

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.240 
you know to really practice your scales
and<00:02:36.120> get<00:02:36.360> them<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:37.170> know<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.650> right<00:02:37.830> sound

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
and get them you know the right sound

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.270 
and get them you know the right sound
sustained<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.330> do<00:02:39.750> definitely<00:02:40.080> need<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
sustained you do definitely need the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.300 
sustained you do definitely need the
exact<00:02:42.090> bow<00:02:42.450> division<00:02:43.020> sort<00:02:43.320> of<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:44.190> know

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
exact bow division sort of like you know

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.790 
exact bow division sort of like you know
math<00:02:45.890> let's<00:02:46.890> go<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.450> four<00:02:48.450> notes<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.020> bow<00:02:49.260> so

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
math let's go to four notes to a bow so

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.010 
math let's go to four notes to a bow so
now<00:02:49.980> you're<00:02:50.130> dividing<00:02:50.430> each<00:02:50.910> note<00:02:51.210> into

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
now you're dividing each note into

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.180 
now you're dividing each note into
quarters<00:02:52.820> one<00:02:53.820> two<00:02:54.240> three<00:02:54.810> four<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.710> two

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
quarters one two three four one two

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:08.280 
quarters one two three four one two
three<00:02:56.490> four

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.250 

so<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> little<00:03:10.370> example<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:11.260> Bo

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
so this is a little example of Bo

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.949 
so this is a little example of Bo
division<00:03:12.799> in<00:03:12.950> your<00:03:13.099> scales<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.879> you<00:03:14.599> can<00:03:14.780> use

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
division in your scales and you can use

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.110 
division in your scales and you can use
in<00:03:15.140> all<00:03:15.439> your<00:03:15.950> different<00:03:16.310> scales<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:16.819> of

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
in all your different scales and of

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.379 
in all your different scales and of
course<00:03:17.360> your<00:03:17.569> pieces<00:03:17.810> as<00:03:18.200> well
