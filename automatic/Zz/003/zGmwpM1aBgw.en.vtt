Swiss or green chard has these really
thick<00:00:30.050> white<00:00:30.590> stems<00:00:31.220> and<00:00:31.609> then<00:00:31.730> this<00:00:31.910> really

nice dark green leaves and chard is
actually<00:00:35.749> in<00:00:36.019> the<00:00:36.170> same<00:00:36.379> family<00:00:36.710> as<00:00:37.129> spinach

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
actually in the same family as spinach

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.969 
actually in the same family as spinach
so<00:00:38.329> it's<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.569> really<00:00:38.809> nutritious<00:00:39.440> vegetable

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:39.979 
so it's a really nutritious vegetable

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:41.559 
so it's a really nutritious vegetable
and<00:00:40.309> I'm<00:00:40.609> going<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:40.789> kind<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:41.089> talk<00:00:41.300> through

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:41.569 
and I'm going to kind of talk through

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:43.479 
and I'm going to kind of talk through
some<00:00:41.659> of<00:00:41.989> its<00:00:42.199> properties<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:42.979> are

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
some of its properties that are

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.919 
some of its properties that are
important<00:00:43.969> for<00:00:44.089> us<00:00:44.179> to<00:00:44.329> know<00:00:44.479> about<00:00:44.749> when

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
important for us to know about when

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.169 
important for us to know about when
we're<00:00:45.109> feeding<00:00:45.319> it<00:00:45.589> to<00:00:45.620> our<00:00:45.859> guinea<00:00:46.100> pigs<00:00:46.339> and

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
we're feeding it to our guinea pigs and

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.419 
we're feeding it to our guinea pigs and
how<00:00:47.870> often<00:00:48.109> we<00:00:48.319> might<00:00:48.589> want<00:00:48.799> to<00:00:48.859> feed<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:49.159> to

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
how often we might want to feed it to

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.009 
how often we might want to feed it to
them<00:00:49.609> as<00:00:49.999> you<00:00:50.059> can<00:00:50.329> see<00:00:50.510> I'm<00:00:50.659> going<00:00:50.749> to<00:00:50.870> bring

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
them as you can see I'm going to bring

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.299 
them as you can see I'm going to bring
the<00:00:51.109> piggies<00:00:51.379> out<00:00:51.499> I've<00:00:51.710> got<00:00:51.859> a<00:00:51.889> little<00:00:52.069> bit

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
the piggies out I've got a little bit

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.919 
the piggies out I've got a little bit
prepared<00:00:52.699> for<00:00:52.969> them<00:00:53.179> there<00:00:53.389> so<00:00:53.629> they're<00:00:53.780> gonna

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
prepared for them there so they're gonna

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.049 
prepared for them there so they're gonna
have<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.199> taste<00:00:54.499> of<00:00:54.679> it<00:00:54.829> they<00:00:55.370> have<00:00:55.609> tried<00:00:55.850> it

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
have a taste of it they have tried it

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.539 
have a taste of it they have tried it
earlier<00:00:56.269> this<00:00:56.839> week<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.949> I<00:00:58.100> don't<00:00:58.399> know

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
earlier this week and I don't know

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:59.860 
earlier this week and I don't know
whether<00:00:58.729> they<00:00:58.879> were<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.179> keen<00:00:59.420> on<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.719> really

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
whether they were that keen on it really

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.449 
whether they were that keen on it really
so<00:01:00.319> it<00:01:00.469> might<00:01:00.649> be<00:01:00.799> a<00:01:00.829> bit<00:01:00.979> of<00:01:01.069> a<00:01:01.129> different

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:01.459 
so it might be a bit of a different

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:03.579 
so it might be a bit of a different
reaction<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:02.059> some<00:01:02.209> of<00:01:02.299> my<00:01:02.359> other<00:01:02.690> vegetable

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
reaction to some of my other vegetable

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.890 
reaction to some of my other vegetable
videos<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.699> would<00:01:04.879> be<00:01:04.940> really<00:01:05.089> interesting<00:01:05.780> to

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
videos it would be really interesting to

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.630 
videos it would be really interesting to
hear<00:01:06.080> what<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.440> think<00:01:06.650> of<00:01:06.860> chard<00:01:07.160> and<00:01:07.460> whether

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
hear what you think of chard and whether

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.700 
hear what you think of chard and whether
you<00:01:07.850> feed<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.330> your<00:01:08.450> guinea<00:01:08.750> pigs<00:01:08.990> because

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
you feed it to your guinea pigs because

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.280 
you feed it to your guinea pigs because
I<00:01:09.740> have<00:01:09.980> found<00:01:10.250> some<00:01:10.520> conflicting<00:01:11.150> advice<00:01:11.750> on

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290

I have found some conflicting advice on
the<00:01:12.410> Internet<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.100> few<00:01:13.970> things<00:01:14.150> that

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
surprised me and kind of made me

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.760 
surprised me and kind of made me
reconsider<00:01:17.540> what<00:01:17.780> other<00:01:17.900> vegetables<00:01:18.500> I<00:01:18.620> might

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
reconsider what other vegetables I might

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.710 
reconsider what other vegetables I might
be<00:01:18.890> feeding<00:01:19.100> my<00:01:19.310> guinea<00:01:19.520> pigs<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.330> hopefully

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720

this video will give you some useful
information<00:01:23.510> about<00:01:23.660> their<00:01:23.990> diet<00:01:24.260> I'm<00:01:25.250> just

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
information about their diet I'm just

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.100 
information about their diet I'm just
going<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.730> get<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.940> girlies<00:01:26.300> out<00:01:26.480> and<00:01:26.810> they

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
going to get the girlies out and they

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.200 
going to get the girlies out and they
are<00:01:27.320> going<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.650> hopefully<00:01:28.070> sit<00:01:28.550> still<00:01:28.790> and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
are going to hopefully sit still and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.210 
are going to hopefully sit still and
maybe<00:01:29.660> munch<00:01:30.020> on<00:01:30.230> some<00:01:30.410> of<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.560> child<00:01:30.980> if

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
maybe munch on some of that child if

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.780 
maybe munch on some of that child if
they<00:01:31.340> want<00:01:31.550> to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.100 

so<00:01:34.790> here<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.090> piggies<00:01:35.390> are<00:01:35.690> having<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:35.930> good

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
so here the piggies are having a good

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.360 
so here the piggies are having a good
sniff<00:01:36.410> they<00:01:36.590> can<00:01:36.740> smell<00:01:36.950> something<00:01:37.340> that

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
sniff they can smell something that

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.280 
sniff they can smell something that
they're<00:01:37.610> interested<00:01:37.640> in<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.660> is<00:01:38.780> going<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.140> pop

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
they're interested in it is going to pop

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.030 
they're interested in it is going to pop
it<00:01:39.440> in<00:01:39.590> front<00:01:39.800> of<00:01:39.980> them<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:42.200> then<00:01:42.860> they're

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
it in front of them and then they're

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.680 
it in front of them and then they're
diving<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.730> munching<00:01:44.090> on<00:01:44.240> some<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.540> that

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
diving in and munching on some of that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.899 
diving in and munching on some of that
so<00:01:44.990> ever<00:01:45.320> but<00:01:46.010> let's<00:01:46.280> see<00:01:46.430> how<00:01:46.520> long<00:01:46.730> it'll

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
so ever but let's see how long it'll

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.230 
so ever but let's see how long it'll
last<00:01:47.030> them<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.220> when<00:01:49.790> we<00:01:49.880> are<00:01:49.909> thinking

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
last them and so when we are thinking

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.470 
last them and so when we are thinking
about<00:01:50.300> chard<00:01:51.340> some<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.610> things<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.420> we

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
about chard some of the things that we

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.720 
about chard some of the things that we
need<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.720> consider<00:01:53.930> about<00:01:54.860> all<00:01:55.100> vegetables

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
need to consider about all vegetables

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.280 
need to consider about all vegetables
when<00:01:55.880> we're<00:01:56.030> feeding<00:01:56.180> them<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.750> our<00:01:57.020> guinea

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
when we're feeding them to our guinea

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.070 
when we're feeding them to our guinea
pigs<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.880> amount<00:01:59.120> of<00:01:59.210> vitamin<00:01:59.360> C<00:01:59.840> they

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
pigs is the amount of vitamin C they

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.370 
pigs is the amount of vitamin C they
have<00:02:00.490> their<00:02:01.490> cast<00:02:01.909> calcium<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.900> phosphorus

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
have their cast calcium to phosphorus

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.460 
have their cast calcium to phosphorus
ratio<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.450> we<00:02:05.450> also<00:02:05.659> should<00:02:06.020> consider

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
ratio and we also should consider

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.649 
ratio and we also should consider
whether<00:02:06.770> they're<00:02:07.040> high<00:02:07.250> in<00:02:07.280> oxalates<00:02:08.060> or<00:02:08.390> not

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659 
whether they're high in oxalates or not

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.509 
whether they're high in oxalates or not
so<00:02:09.289> I'm<00:02:09.349> just<00:02:09.500> going<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.739> kind<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:09.979> explain

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
so I'm just going to kind of explain

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.009 
so I'm just going to kind of explain
through<00:02:10.789> those<00:02:10.969> things<00:02:11.269> and<00:02:11.510> hopefully<00:02:11.689> it'll

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
through those things and hopefully it'll

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.900 
through those things and hopefully it'll
be<00:02:12.139> easy<00:02:12.590> for<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.249> understand<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.540> can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
be easy for you to understand it can

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.510 
be easy for you to understand it can
a<00:02:14.940> bit<00:02:15.120> technical<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.230> lot<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.650> especially

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
a bit technical and a lot of especially

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.130 
a bit technical and a lot of especially
the<00:02:17.760> stuff<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.210> do<00:02:18.300> with<00:02:18.480> calcium<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the stuff to do with calcium and

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.860 
the stuff to do with calcium and
oxalates<00:02:19.760> quite<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> bit<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.270> research<00:02:21.660> is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
oxalates quite a bit of research is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.840 
oxalates quite a bit of research is
still<00:02:22.080> required<00:02:22.320> really<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.460> don't<00:02:23.640> know

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
still required really and we don't know

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.270 
still required really and we don't know
the<00:02:24.150> exact<00:02:24.930> effects<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
the exact effects that it can have and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.890 
the exact effects that it can have and
the<00:02:26.400> risk<00:02:26.580> factors<00:02:27.060> when<00:02:27.630> we're<00:02:27.780> thinking

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the risk factors when we're thinking

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.320 
the risk factors when we're thinking
about<00:02:28.140> bladder<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.400> kidney<00:02:29.790> stones<00:02:29.850> for

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
about bladder and kidney stones for

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.090 
about bladder and kidney stones for
example<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.290> first<00:02:31.500> things<00:02:31.680> first

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
example so first things first

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.670 
example so first things first
in<00:02:32.220> general<00:02:32.760> child<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.600> really<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.380> good

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
in general child is really really good

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.100 
in general child is really really good
it's<00:02:34.920> really<00:02:34.980> nutritious<00:02:35.850> vegetable<00:02:36.390> it's

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
it's really nutritious vegetable it's

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.710 
it's really nutritious vegetable it's
second<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:38.040> spinach<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.270> one<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
second to spinach as like one of the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.750 
second to spinach as like one of the
most<00:02:39.900> nutritious<00:02:40.260> vegetables<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.100> have<00:02:41.310> so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
most nutritious vegetables we have so

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.420 
most nutritious vegetables we have so
first<00:02:42.000> things<00:02:42.180> first<00:02:42.270> like<00:02:42.870> spinach<00:02:43.410> chard<00:02:44.100> is

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
first things first like spinach chard is

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.610 
first things first like spinach chard is
good<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:44.940> vitamin<00:02:45.330> C<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:45.990> got<00:02:46.170> kind<00:02:46.410> of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
good for vitamin C so it's got kind of

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.890 
good for vitamin C so it's got kind of
medium<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.310> high<00:02:47.520> amount<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.000> vitamin<00:02:48.360> C<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.750> it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
medium to high amount of vitamin C in it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.070 
medium to high amount of vitamin C in it
on<00:02:49.800> guinea<00:02:50.130> lynxes<00:02:50.610> nutrition<00:02:51.300> charts<00:02:51.750> it's

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
on guinea lynxes nutrition charts it's

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.070 
on guinea lynxes nutrition charts it's
13<00:02:52.770> milligrams<00:02:53.040> per<00:02:53.520> hundred<00:02:53.970> grams<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.600> it

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
13 milligrams per hundred grams and it

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.550 
13 milligrams per hundred grams and it
rates<00:02:55.320> about<00:02:55.860> number<00:02:56.400> 24<00:02:56.970> out<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.390> 70<00:02:58.140> or<00:02:58.170> so

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
rates about number 24 out of 70 or so

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.990 
rates about number 24 out of 70 or so
vegetables<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.250> they've<00:02:59.400> got<00:02:59.550> listed<00:02:59.850> on

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
vegetables that they've got listed on

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.570 
vegetables that they've got listed on
there<00:03:00.240> so<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:01.140> has<00:03:01.680> got<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> reasonably<00:03:02.370> high

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
there so it has got a reasonably high

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.220 
there so it has got a reasonably high
amount<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.000> vitamin<00:03:03.360> C<00:03:03.570> which<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.990> good

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
amount of vitamin C which is good

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.080 
amount of vitamin C which is good
because<00:03:04.740> guinea<00:03:05.100> pigs<00:03:05.340> can't<00:03:05.610> produce<00:03:05.790> their

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
because guinea pigs can't produce their

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.180 
because guinea pigs can't produce their
own<00:03:06.150> vitamin<00:03:06.660> C<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.110> we<00:03:07.260> need<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.620> supplement

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
own vitamin C so we need to supplement

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.690 
own vitamin C so we need to supplement
their<00:03:08.670> diet<00:03:08.700> with<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:10.130> however<00:03:11.130> unlike

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
their diet with it however unlike

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.960 
their diet with it however unlike
spinach<00:03:12.270> it's<00:03:13.050> got<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.070> lower<00:03:14.310> range<00:03:14.730> of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
spinach it's got on the lower range of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.900 
spinach it's got on the lower range of
the<00:03:15.150> calcium<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.230> phosphorus<00:03:16.620> ratio<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.400> it's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
the calcium to phosphorus ratio and it's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.610 
the calcium to phosphorus ratio and it's
actually<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.300> lot<00:03:18.510> closer<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.200> recommended

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
actually a lot closer to the recommended

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.820 
actually a lot closer to the recommended
ratio<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.640> guinea<00:03:20.880> pigs<00:03:21.150> than<00:03:21.690> spinach<00:03:22.110> is<00:03:22.320> so

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
ratio for guinea pigs than spinach is so

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.130 
ratio for guinea pigs than spinach is so
spinach<00:03:23.160> has<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> really<00:03:23.790> offset<00:03:24.330> ratio<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.840> lot

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
spinach has a really offset ratio a lot

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.080 
spinach has a really offset ratio a lot
of<00:03:25.260> calcium<00:03:25.560> compared<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.430> phosphorus

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090

calcium to phosphorous ratio so that

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.880

occurs<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.270> guinea<00:03:51.510> pigs<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.350> just<00:03:52.620> looking<00:03:52.920> at

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
occurs in guinea pigs so just looking at

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.490 
occurs in guinea pigs so just looking at
that<00:03:53.220> ratio<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:54.060> was<00:03:54.450> actually<00:03:54.600> surprised<00:03:55.230> in

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
that ratio I was actually surprised in

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.440 
that ratio I was actually surprised in
thinking<00:03:55.860> oh<00:03:56.040> well<00:03:56.550> surely<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:56.940> means<00:03:57.239> we

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
thinking oh well surely that means we

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.750 
thinking oh well surely that means we
can<00:03:57.630> feed<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.870> quite<00:03:58.290> often<00:03:58.550> but<00:03:59.550> then

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
can feed it quite often but then

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.430 
can feed it quite often but then
something<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.239> we<00:04:00.540> also<00:04:00.750> need<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.230> consider

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
something that we also need to consider

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.320 
something that we also need to consider
is<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.040> amount<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.430> oxalates

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
is the amount of oxalates

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.960 
is the amount of oxalates
and<00:04:03.480> oxalates<00:04:04.470> can<00:04:04.860> cause<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> different<00:04:05.700> kind

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
and oxalates can cause a different kind

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.970 
and oxalates can cause a different kind
of<00:04:06.120> bladder<00:04:06.390> or<00:04:06.750> kidney<00:04:07.200> stone<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.770> guinea

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
of bladder or kidney stone in guinea

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.949 
of bladder or kidney stone in guinea
pigs<00:04:08.250> now<00:04:08.760> they're<00:04:08.940> not<00:04:09.180> as<00:04:09.330> common<00:04:09.690> in<00:04:09.780> guinea

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
pigs now they're not as common in guinea

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.070 
pigs now they're not as common in guinea
pigs<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.430> other<00:04:11.550> type<00:04:11.850> of<00:04:11.880> stones<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:12.720> it's

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
pigs as the other type of stones so it's

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.500 
pigs as the other type of stones so it's
a<00:04:13.170> bit<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.500> gray<00:04:13.709> area<00:04:14.040> whether<00:04:14.550> plants<00:04:15.390> that

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
a bit of a gray area whether plants that

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.690 
a bit of a gray area whether plants that
are<00:04:15.600> high<00:04:15.780> in<00:04:15.810> oxalate<00:04:16.410> should<00:04:16.709> be<00:04:16.859> fed<00:04:17.130> or<00:04:17.400> not

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
are high in oxalate should be fed or not

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.240 
are high in oxalate should be fed or not
and<00:04:18.030> chard<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.690> high<00:04:19.080> in<00:04:19.320> these<00:04:19.440> oxalate<00:04:19.980> so

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
and chard is high in these oxalate so

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.320 
and chard is high in these oxalate so
it's<00:04:20.370> something<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:20.850> we<00:04:20.940> might<00:04:21.120> want<00:04:21.209> to

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
it's something that we might want to

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.390 
it's something that we might want to
think<00:04:21.540> about<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.710> definitely<00:04:23.130> recommend

read about what research has already
been<00:04:36.840> done<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:38.540> chad<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:39.810> high<00:04:40.050> in<00:04:40.110> oxalates

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
been done so chad is high in oxalates

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.490 
been done so chad is high in oxalates
along<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:41.820> things<00:04:42.270> like<00:04:42.510> spinach<00:04:43.050> same

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
along with things like spinach same

along with things like spinach same
family<00:04:43.950> kale<00:04:44.840> celery<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.380> beets<00:04:47.220> I'll<00:04:47.580> be

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
family kale celery and beets I'll be

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.910 
family kale celery and beets I'll be
true<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.960> one<00:04:49.170> of<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.320> things<00:04:49.500> that<00:04:49.710> is

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
true and one of the things that is

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.550 
true and one of the things that is
important<00:04:50.400> about<00:04:50.460> oxalates<00:04:51.180> is<00:04:51.450> it's<00:04:52.140> a<00:04:52.350> lot

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
important about oxalates is it's a lot

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.650 
important about oxalates is it's a lot
higher<00:04:52.770> content<00:04:53.310> in<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.730> leaves<00:04:53.970> than<00:04:54.480> it<00:04:54.600> is

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
higher content in the leaves than it is

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.930 
higher content in the leaves than it is
the<00:04:54.840> stem<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:55.500> that's<00:04:56.190> one<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.520> reasons

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
the stem and that's one of the reasons

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.000 
the stem and that's one of the reasons
why<00:04:57.120> it's<00:04:57.420> always<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.750> no-no<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.410> feed<00:04:58.620> celery

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
why it's always a no-no to feed celery

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.640 
why it's always a no-no to feed celery
leaves<00:04:59.280> but<00:05:00.030> now<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:00.360> I<00:05:00.390> also<00:05:00.600> know<00:05:01.050> celery

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
leaves but now that I also know celery

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.460 
leaves but now that I also know celery
is<00:05:01.800> quite<00:05:02.100> high<00:05:02.310> in<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.610> in<00:05:02.760> general<00:05:03.320> maybe<00:05:04.320> I

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
is quite high in it in general maybe I

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.260 
is quite high in it in general maybe I
shouldn't<00:05:04.800> be<00:05:04.920> feeding<00:05:05.100> celery<00:05:05.610> as<00:05:05.790> much<00:05:05.970> as<00:05:06.150> I

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
shouldn't be feeding celery as much as I

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.600 
shouldn't be feeding celery as much as I
do<00:05:06.330> now<00:05:06.450> so<00:05:07.110> that's<00:05:07.350> something<00:05:08.070> which<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.430> kind

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
do now so that's something which I kind

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.210 
do now so that's something which I kind
of<00:05:08.670> learned<00:05:08.850> from<00:05:09.120> our<00:05:09.240> research<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.710> for<00:05:10.890> me<00:05:11.040> I

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
of learned from our research so for me I

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.490 
of learned from our research so for me I
wouldn't<00:05:11.640> choose<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:11.940> feed<00:05:12.360> chard<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:12.870> often

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
wouldn't choose to feed chard that often

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.530 
wouldn't choose to feed chard that often
and<00:05:13.740> when<00:05:14.100> I<00:05:14.130> do<00:05:14.250> feed<00:05:14.700> it<00:05:14.880> I'm<00:05:15.030> only<00:05:15.210> gonna

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
and when I do feed it I'm only gonna

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.630 
and when I do feed it I'm only gonna
feed<00:05:15.870> the<00:05:16.080> stem<00:05:16.350> part<00:05:16.650> believes<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.340> not<00:05:17.460> the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
feed the stem part believes and not the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
contains at higher oxalates

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.200 
contains at higher oxalates
and<00:05:22.620> they<00:05:22.800> had<00:05:22.920> a<00:05:22.950> few<00:05:23.280> bits<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:23.760> in<00:05:24.000> their

for<00:05:31.770> you<00:05:32.010> and<00:05:32.190> now<00:05:32.460> I<00:05:32.490> kind<00:05:32.700> of<00:05:32.850> got<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.000> bit

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
for you and now I kind of got a bit

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.270 
for you and now I kind of got a bit
technical<00:05:33.390> talking<00:05:34.050> about<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.440> calcium<00:05:35.010> and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
technical talking about the calcium and

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.520 
technical talking about the calcium and
the<00:05:35.370> phosphorus<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.060> the<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.750> oxalates<00:05:37.290> but

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
the phosphorus and the the oxalates but

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.650 
the phosphorus and the the oxalates but
the<00:05:37.620> main<00:05:37.770> thing<00:05:37.980> is<00:05:38.100> to<00:05:38.130> remember<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:39.120> you

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
the main thing is to remember and you

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.330 
the main thing is to remember and you
can<00:05:39.870> look<00:05:40.020> up<00:05:40.170> the<00:05:40.230> calcium<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:40.830> phosphorus

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
can look up the calcium to phosphorus

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.490 
can look up the calcium to phosphorus
ratio<00:05:41.580> on<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.600> guinea<00:05:42.930> lengths<00:05:43.380> the

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
ratio on the guinea lengths the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.260 
ratio on the guinea lengths the
recommended<00:05:44.010> amount<00:05:44.280> and<00:05:44.490> you<00:05:44.580> can<00:05:44.730> also<00:05:44.880> see

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
recommended amount and you can also see

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.920 
recommended amount and you can also see
what<00:05:46.110> we<00:05:46.260> think<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:47.070> ratios<00:05:47.550> are<00:05:47.580> for<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.480> whole

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
what we think the ratios are for a whole

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.530 
what we think the ratios are for a whole
load<00:05:49.290> of<00:05:49.320> vegetables<00:05:50.010> so<00:05:50.490> if<00:05:50.580> you<00:05:50.700> are<00:05:50.850> worried

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
load of vegetables so if you are worried

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.420 
load of vegetables so if you are worried
about<00:05:51.630> excess<00:05:52.200> calcium<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.890> bladder<00:05:53.070> stones

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
about excess calcium and bladder stones

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.850 
about excess calcium and bladder stones
guinea<00:05:54.360> lynx<00:05:54.690> is<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.810> really<00:05:55.170> good<00:05:55.320> site<00:05:55.530> to<00:05:55.560> go

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
guinea lynx is a really good site to go

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.240 
guinea lynx is a really good site to go
on

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
on

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.340 
on
so<00:05:56.760> there's<00:05:57.210> thinking<00:05:57.510> about<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:57.840> calcium<00:05:58.230> -

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
so there's thinking about the calcium -

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.980 
so there's thinking about the calcium -
phosphorus<00:05:58.740> ratio<00:05:58.950> and<00:05:59.430> also<00:06:00.240> just<00:06:00.690> being

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
phosphorus ratio and also just being

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.410 
phosphorus ratio and also just being
aware<00:06:01.320> of<00:06:01.380> those<00:06:01.860> vegetables<00:06:02.550> like<00:06:03.000> chard

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
aware of those vegetables like chard

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.120 
aware of those vegetables like chard
that<00:06:03.720> are<00:06:03.960> high<00:06:04.260> in<00:06:04.290> oxalates

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
that are high in oxalates

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.950 
that are high in oxalates
which<00:06:05.490> can<00:06:05.730> cause<00:06:05.940> a<00:06:05.970> different<00:06:06.540> kind<00:06:06.780> of

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
which can cause a different kind of

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.420 
which can cause a different kind of
bladder<00:06:07.260> or<00:06:07.530> kidney<00:06:07.890> stone

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
bladder or kidney stone

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.560 
bladder or kidney stone
I<00:06:08.460> think<00:06:09.240> Annie's<00:06:09.570> going<00:06:10.110> on<00:06:10.320> a<00:06:10.350> wonderful<00:06:11.570> and
