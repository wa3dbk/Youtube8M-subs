00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
actually might have been that much

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.340 
actually might have been that much
damage<00:00:52.949> given<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> soil<00:00:54.480> content<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.230> this

region<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.980> 5.9<00:00:56.699> 5.7<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.719> 5.2<00:00:58.199> could<00:00:58.949> create

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
region a 5.9 5.7 or 5.2 could create

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310 
region a 5.9 5.7 or 5.2 could create
that<00:00:59.730> much<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.180> shake<00:01:00.449> out<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.109> just

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that much of a shake out there so just

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.540

continuing the watches here I am saying

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
continuing the watches here I am saying
it<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.890> unusual<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.790> unheard<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.390> an

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
5.9 usgs here called a 5.8 just north of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.990 
5.9 usgs here called a 5.8 just north of
the<00:01:58.140> console<00:01:58.530> area<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.310> jolted<00:01:59.850> me

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the console area this actually jolted me

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760 
the console area this actually jolted me
awake<00:02:00.030> earlier<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.320> trying<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.740> a

the<00:02:20.190> earthquakes<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.940> been<00:02:21.150> seeing<00:02:21.330> up

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
the earthquakes we have been seeing up

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.570 
the earthquakes we have been seeing up
here<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.200> case<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.560> am<00:02:22.740> asked<00:02:23.010> basically

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
here and in case I am asked basically

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.370 
here and in case I am asked basically
there<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.790> no<00:02:24.090> tsunami<00:02:24.420> warnings<00:02:24.990> out<00:02:25.140> there

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
check the PTW see site go back actually

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.880 
check the PTW see site go back actually

April in the morning we had the 7.1 off
the<00:02:34.950> northeast<00:02:35.340> coast<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.850> honshu<00:02:36.060> year<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:36.930> no

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
the northeast coast of honshu year so no

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.600 
the northeast coast of honshu year so no
tsunami<00:02:37.350> warnings<00:02:37.890> out<00:02:37.980> there<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.310> all<00:02:38.430> none

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
tsunami warnings out there at all none

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.770 
tsunami warnings out there at all none
of<00:02:38.670> these<00:02:38.760> earthquakes<00:02:39.030> could<00:02:39.360> generate<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
of these earthquakes could generate a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.080 
of these earthquakes could generate a
tsunami<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.740> we<00:02:40.830> continue<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.520> watch<00:02:41.790> this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
tsunami but we continue to watch this

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.450 
tsunami but we continue to watch this
really<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.570> do<00:02:42.840> need<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.080> 7<00:02:43.590> point<00:02:43.770> 0<00:02:43.950> or<00:02:44.130> higher

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
really you do need a 7 point 0 or higher

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.000 
really you do need a 7 point 0 or higher
just<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.450> generate<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.900> local<00:02:46.380> tsunami<00:02:46.710> maybe

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
just to generate a local tsunami maybe

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.490 
just to generate a local tsunami maybe
an<00:02:47.190> underground<00:02:48.000> al-ansar<00:02:48.870> excuse<00:02:49.320> me<00:02:49.440> an

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
an underground al-ansar excuse me an

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.320 
an underground al-ansar excuse me an
underwater<00:02:49.860> landslides<00:02:50.550> producing<00:02:51.240> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
underwater landslides producing a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.210 
underwater landslides producing a
localized<00:02:51.840> tsunami<00:02:52.230> could<00:02:52.530> happen<00:02:52.770> a<00:02:52.830> 7<00:02:53.100> point

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
localized tsunami could happen a 7 point

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.520 
localized tsunami could happen a 7 point
or<00:02:53.430> higher<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:54.030> nothing<00:02:54.360> below<00:02:54.660> us<00:02:54.870> 60<00:02:55.320> could

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
or higher but nothing below us 60 could

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.260 
or higher but nothing below us 60 could
really<00:02:55.740> generate<00:02:56.160> anything<00:02:56.490> like<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.820> and

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
really generate anything like that and

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.030 
really generate anything like that and
basically<00:02:57.510> if<00:02:57.959> look<00:02:58.170> at<00:02:58.290> eight<00:02:58.440> point<00:02:58.709> o's<00:02:58.860> are

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
basically if look at eight point o's are

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.680 
basically if look at eight point o's are
higher<00:02:59.190> for<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.580> pacific<00:02:59.970> wide<00:03:00.150> event<00:03:00.510> but

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
higher for the pacific wide event but

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.850 
higher for the pacific wide event but
that<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:00.900> all<00:03:01.020> for<00:03:01.170> now<00:03:01.230> everybody<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.770> you
