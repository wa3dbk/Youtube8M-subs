00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.959
 hi I'm alessia in this video 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.639
 I want to tell about a mother who has 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.800
 I attended a course of mine several months ago 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.900
 and who told me how he used it 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.970
 a linguistic model to manage a 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.280
 particular communication situation 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.860
 with his son in his mother's story 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.080
 the son had just finished doing i 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.060
 homework when he got up and went to 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.280
 take the ball and started to 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.249
 playing ball in the living room happens but 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.839
 especially with the little ones and the 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:39.519
 completely understandable reaction such as 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.370
 it would have been to scream to say no 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.230
 the ball is played at home, however 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.449
 Mom knew this sentence the most 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.339
 intuitive and also wrong from the point of 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.829
 view of linguistic intelligence the 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.139
 main reason is the most obvious is 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.479
 that the sentence contains only one 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.550
 ban a negative sentence instead 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.579
 during the courses we had reasoned about the 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 need to strive to find a 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.510
 alternative context in which the 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.840
 inappropriate behavior becomes 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.040
 appropriate 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.750
 in fact there are behaviors that 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 they work fine in a certain 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.270
 breaker but totally 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.470
 unacceptable in another situation 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.210
 then in front of the son he had 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.230
 started playing ball in the living room 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.150
 mom said put your jacket on and go 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.920
 to play in the garden 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.110
 using these words he transformed a 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.990
 ban is not played ball in a 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.060
 allowed to play ball in the garden 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.920
 suggesting the right place for the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.780
 desired behavior 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.850
 let us always remember that children 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.830
 exactly how we adults don't like it 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.380
 to be told that they cannot do 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.430
 something if instead we provide a valid one 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.340
 alternative 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.020
 we avoid direct confrontation e 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.390
 We encourage the behaviors of our 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.520
 child in the appropriate context 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.140
 one last tip is if it is not for you 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.790
 possible for example suggest 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.060
 immediately the appropriate context 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.409
 for example because it's raining outside and the idea 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.770
 to play ball in the garden is from 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.229
 discard anticipates where and how 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.500
 that behavior can be put into 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.660
 act postponing a specific moment 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.220
 the future therefore if for example in those 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.040
 perhaps more days had a mother would have 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.830
 could say tomorrow afternoon we go in 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.940
 gym and even if it rains then play at 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.540
 as much ball as you want 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.870
 Now let's play another game together 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.670
 remember providing a valid alternative 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.000
 avoid confrontation and encourage i 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.650
 behaviors in the appropriate contexts 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 now I leave you a few days to do 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.880
 Practice these methods six questions 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.920
