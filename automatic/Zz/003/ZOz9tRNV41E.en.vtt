00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
so just keep it in that boxy frame just

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.400 
so just keep it in that boxy frame just
as<00:00:55.559> simple<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.430> sounds

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
as simple as it sounds

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.139 
as simple as it sounds
taking<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.500> same<00:00:58.800> color<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.370> use<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> sketch

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
taking that same color we use to sketch

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.000 
taking that same color we use to sketch
it<00:01:00.359> in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.329 
it in
and<00:01:02.489> again<00:01:02.850> using<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> fatter<00:01:04.110> tip<00:01:04.440> you<00:01:05.220> would

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and again using a fatter tip you would

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.690 
and again using a fatter tip you would
get<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:05.670> coverage<00:01:06.090> faster<00:01:07.070> but<00:01:08.070> definitely

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
get more coverage faster but definitely

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.969 
get more coverage faster but definitely
want<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> keep<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:10.020> hand<00:01:10.229> movement<00:01:10.650> steady

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
so there's no paint buildup follow that

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
so there's no paint buildup follow that

just because of the lack of what you
could<00:02:33.239> do<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.020> would<00:02:34.200> say<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.739> V<00:02:35.370> is

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
could do with it and I would say a V is

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.940 
could do with it and I would say a V is
definitely<00:02:36.060> one<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.239> those<00:02:36.390> letters<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.680> can

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
definitely one of those letters that can

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.210 
definitely one of those letters that can
be<00:02:38.160> replaced<00:02:38.819> let's<00:02:39.660> say<00:02:40.080> it's<00:02:40.920> all<00:02:41.040> about

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
be replaced let's say it's all about

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220 
be replaced let's say it's all about
standing<00:02:41.700> ten<00:02:41.849> feet<00:02:41.880> back<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.599> taking<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.110> look

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
standing ten feet back and taking a look

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.400 
standing ten feet back and taking a look
at<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.470> piece<00:02:43.680> you're<00:02:44.489> reading<00:02:44.790> what<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.030> says

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
at the piece you're reading what it says

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.559 
at the piece you're reading what it says
so<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.530> got<00:02:46.709> just<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> little<00:02:47.760> pattern<00:02:48.450> of

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
so we got just a little pattern of

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.680 
so we got just a little pattern of
yellow<00:02:48.750> skipping<00:02:49.200> through<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.980> I'm<00:02:50.129> gonna

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
yellow skipping through and I'm gonna

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.589 
yellow skipping through and I'm gonna
inner<00:02:51.690> outline<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.790> kids<00:02:54.060> sometimes

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
inner outline it now the kids sometimes

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.420 
inner outline it now the kids sometimes
when<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.870> get<00:02:55.020> into<00:02:55.230> these<00:02:55.349> long<00:02:55.650> lines<00:02:56.190> you

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
when you get into these long lines you

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.520 
when you get into these long lines you
don't<00:02:56.550> want<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> go<00:02:56.970> off<00:02:57.180> especially<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:58.470> you

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
don't want to go off especially if you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.740 
don't want to go off especially if you
have<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> really<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> complex<00:02:59.550> fill<00:02:59.910> your<00:03:00.480> hand

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
have a really a complex fill your hand

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.690 
have a really a complex fill your hand
dips<00:03:01.379> off<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.800> doesn't<00:03:02.069> get<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> line<00:03:02.430> right

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
dips off it doesn't get the line right

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.699 
dips off it doesn't get the line right
you'd<00:03:02.849> end<00:03:03.060> up<00:03:03.120> having<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.480> fix<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.560> whole

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
you'd end up having to fix up a whole

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.290 
you'd end up having to fix up a whole
area<00:03:05.069> so<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.030> have<00:03:06.300> to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
area so if you have to

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.870 
area so if you have to
kind<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.540> pre-fill<00:03:08.290> out<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:09.070> line<00:03:09.310> before<00:03:09.610> you

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
kind of pre-fill out the line before you

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.060 
kind of pre-fill out the line before you
do<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.210> it<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:10.960> makes<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.410> easier<00:03:11.770> for<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:12.010> to

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
do it it just makes it easier for you to

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.990 
do it it just makes it easier for you to
get<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.310> sprayed<00:03:12.610> on<00:03:12.820> right<00:03:13.830> finish<00:03:14.830> this<00:03:15.010> V<00:03:15.730> up

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
get it sprayed on right finish this V up

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.060 
get it sprayed on right finish this V up
with<00:03:16.210> a<00:03:16.240> outer<00:03:16.600> outline<00:03:16.990> or<00:03:17.410> outer<00:03:17.650> gel<00:03:20.070> well

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
with a outer outline or outer gel well

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.900 
with a outer outline or outer gel well
just<00:03:21.460> like<00:03:21.640> that<00:03:21.880> whilst<00:03:22.300> I'll<00:03:22.630> be
