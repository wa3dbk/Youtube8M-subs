00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello gamer friends are today 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.880
 for that put we have this producer 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.190
 clear video with him may have in his 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.410
 TV on your tablet or on your cell phone 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 movies and digital content through 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.630
 of internet do not miss it is very 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.630
 good 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.910
 unpacking the product declared video 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.530
 the product clear and in a pretty box 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 small since it is a very team 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.650
 small inside 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.540
 let's find a user guide 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.160
 that in six steps teaches us how 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.300
 connect it and put it to work is 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.129
 quite always to follow 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.480
 a car warranty policy that does not 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.070
 I am very sure that it is valid with 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.370
 car should be rather guarantee with 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.680
 clear your seller here a stopwatch 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.960
 an HDMI cable 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.300
 by composite video cable for 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.540
 televisions let's say those of generation 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.540
 old woman 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.000
 a fairly simple remote control and 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.280
 beautiful 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.980
 our decoder if we want it 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 call well in our interface 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.549
 and the connector to the network 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.290
 it's a very small box as you can 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.030
 see very simple has no major 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.659
 complications has only one button 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.060
 of ignition 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.450
 a connector to the current a port of 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.579
 rotate 45 for the network a cable for 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.850
 white and infrared wireless control 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.319
 a port bird that is this port for 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.499
 the televisions as I already told you in 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.209
 old an hdmi port with its cable 

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:43.030
 included and a digital video output 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:45.640
 for our computer additionally 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.200
 It has two usb ports and one micro sd is 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.209
 pretty simple and let's look at a 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.359
 moment that connecting them is equal 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.359
 simple 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.680
 once we have connected to the TV 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.930
 our HDMI cable carries the current 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.220
 it is quite simple 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.070
 the current port 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.229
 and the hdn port are connected in their 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.229
 respective slots 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.980
 now we put our television or 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.990
 receiver 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.960
 in the indicated hdmi port 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.620
 we have in fact already been on and 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.210
 ready 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.650
 basically that's the biggest 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.070
 configuration that we will have to do 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.570
 now we just wait a while 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.890
 we hope that if our system clear 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.200
 video connect in that your system 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.230
 Android by the way has Android 4 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.600
 Boot installed and we can start 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.080
 configure it with our wireless network 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.080
 of the house 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.920
 first step 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.930
 understand the queen in america with the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.239
 remote control 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.730
 and he will show us on the screen the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.069
 wireless networks available for 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.540
 connect 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.040
 you can take as in all 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.930
 devices a prudential time but 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.930
 It is part of the process 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.490
 and we have our network 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.420
 let's give 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.420
 our travel 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.400
 fortunately it is only the one time 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.350
 it would not be very rich to have to do each 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.350
 Once we are installing the system 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.020
 once we have entered our password and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.420
 our user can have access to 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.569
 clear main menu there we have 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.610
 films 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.350
 as television series 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.350
 we have music 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.760
 movies for kids 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.849
 and pixbox 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.069
 in music for example we have concerts 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.049
 and inside the concerts we have one 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.049
 that I like a lot is timeless 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.640
 as expected, it is a process of 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.530
 normal load defined the band width that 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.890
 let's have, but as you saw, it's not 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.890
 letter 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.919
 at any time pressing just 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.650
 the return button in the control 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:52.880
 clear remote we can see again the 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.500
 menu once again return and make a 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.490
 new selection or change the selection 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.650
 it's pretty simple, there's no need to do 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.280
 great study of the team to be able 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.970
 use and is ready to use once 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.970
 leave the box 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.430
 well we already know the clear tv i the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.260
 I leave you in the program 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.570
 while I stay here with my little 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.040
 control and my little magic box watching 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.080
 some movies and series that I have 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.080
 delayed see you in the next
