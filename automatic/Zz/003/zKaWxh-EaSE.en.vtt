00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
video surveillance system I've got

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400 
video surveillance system I've got
installed<00:00:12.230> for<00:00:13.230> nighttime<00:00:13.920> viewing<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.410> you

you know yeah you gotta gotta what can
you<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:22.670> so<00:00:23.670> here<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.119> let<00:00:24.689> me<00:00:24.779> give<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
you see so here we go let me give you a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560 
you see so here we go let me give you a
quick<00:00:25.320> tour<00:00:25.970> I've<00:00:26.970> got<00:00:27.150> several<00:00:27.449> different

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
quick tour I've got several different

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.709 
quick tour I've got several different
angles<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:29.390> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.539> my<00:00:30.660> front<00:00:30.990> door<00:00:31.289> and

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
angles here this is my front door and

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.840 
angles here this is my front door and
now<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:33.899> videotaping<00:00:34.380> obviously<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> monitor

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
now I'm videotaping obviously a monitor

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
now I'm videotaping obviously a monitor
here<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.300> your<00:00:36.450> loop<00:00:36.630> you're<00:00:36.870> losing<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> little

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
here so your loop you're losing a little

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.049 
here so your loop you're losing a little
bit<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.149> I<00:00:39.860> thought<00:00:40.860> looks<00:00:41.070> pretty<00:00:41.250> good

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.729 

granted<00:00:45.059> you're<00:00:45.300> probably<00:00:45.629> talking<00:00:46.079> about

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
granted you're probably talking about

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.709 
granted you're probably talking about
maybe<00:00:47.219> 15<00:00:47.730> feet<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> huge

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
maybe 15 feet here so it's not a huge

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.529 
maybe 15 feet here so it's not a huge
huge<00:00:51.719> distance<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.590> think<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:54.510> not

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
huge distance I think if I'm not

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:02.020 
huge distance I think if I'm not
mistaken<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.460> cameras<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.820> our<00:00:57.059> 42<00:00:58.579> LED

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.060 

you<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> lighten<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> area<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
you know to lighten up the area and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.539 
you know to lighten up the area and
there's<00:01:05.970> 600<00:01:06.479> line<00:01:06.689> cameras<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.430> on

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
there's 600 line cameras and this is on

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.810 
there's 600 line cameras and this is on
a<00:01:08.580> 24<00:01:09.299> inch<00:01:09.330> monitor<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.770> get<00:01:10.950> my

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
a 24 inch monitor here so just to get my

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.780 
a 24 inch monitor here so just to get my
perspective<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:13.159> let's<00:01:14.159> look<00:01:14.520> at

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
perspective there let's look at

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.140 
perspective there let's look at
something<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.540> little<00:01:15.720> further<00:01:15.990> away<00:01:17.000> here<00:01:18.000> we

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
something a little further away here we

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.730 
something a little further away here we
go<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> back<00:01:20.189> patio<00:01:21.380> it's<00:01:22.380> kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
go this is the back patio it's kind of a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160 
go this is the back patio it's kind of a
protected<00:01:23.369> area<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
protected area it's in like a it's in

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.030 
protected area it's in like a it's in
like<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> deep<00:01:25.680> corner<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.310> an<00:01:26.430> L<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.590> I'll

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
like the deep corner of an L and I'll

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.440 
like the deep corner of an L and I'll
tell<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.310> why<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.549> important<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.270> when

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
tell you why that's important that when

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.440 
tell you why that's important that when
I<00:01:30.479> go<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> next<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:32.159> would<00:01:32.939> say<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I go to the next one I would say that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.999 
I go to the next one I would say that
the<00:01:33.869> two<00:01:34.200> grills<00:01:35.299> here<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:37.009> they're

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the two grills here and here they're

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.460 
the two grills here and here they're
probably<00:01:38.460> about<00:01:39.710> 40<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> 50<00:01:41.189> feet<00:01:41.220> away<00:01:42.470> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
probably about 40 to 50 feet away and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.940 
probably about 40 to 50 feet away and
and<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.579> walls<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> back<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:46.829> know

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and then the walls in the back you know

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.870 
and then the walls in the back you know
another<00:01:47.220> 10<00:01:48.060> feet<00:01:48.390> back<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> gives<00:01:50.729> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
another 10 feet back so so it gives it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.510 
another 10 feet back so so it gives it
pretty<00:01:51.090> good<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> width<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
pretty good and in the width is is

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.510 
pretty good and in the width is is
really<00:01:53.970> good<00:01:54.210> too<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> mean<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.079> long

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
really good too I mean that's a long

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.749 
really good too I mean that's a long
long<00:01:56.520> ways<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.180> between<00:01:57.540> shot<00:01:58.520> from<00:01:59.520> side<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
long ways in between shot from side to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.780 
long ways in between shot from side to
side<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.890> can<00:02:01.890> see<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.430> we've<00:02:02.579> got<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
side you can see here we've got a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.410 
side you can see here we've got a
spiderweb

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
spiderweb

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.270 
spiderweb
probably<00:02:03.990> spiderweb<00:02:04.469> something<00:02:04.860> kicking<00:02:05.159> in

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
probably spiderweb something kicking in

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.449 
probably spiderweb something kicking in
here<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:07.979> I'm<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> show<00:02:08.310> you

the next video the next shot whereas

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.710 
the next video the next shot whereas
even<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.090> important

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
even be more important

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.520 
even be more important
here<00:02:12.990> this<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.190> my<00:02:14.400> back<00:02:15.090> patio<00:02:15.630> if<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.380> can

I've got a shed over here and I'm not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.640 
I've got a shed over here and I'm not
sure<00:02:21.540> why<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.380> this<00:02:22.680> camera<00:02:23.340> angle<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.930> by

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
sure why but this camera angle is is by

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.860 
sure why but this camera angle is is by
far<00:02:25.980> my<00:02:26.160> worst<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.700> got<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.000> tower<00:02:27.270> over<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.980 
far my worst it's got the tower over the
top<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.410> camera<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.480> know<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.660> keep

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
top of the camera so you know to keep

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.240 
top of the camera so you know to keep
out<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.200> Sun<00:02:31.740> glare<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.370> whatnot<00:02:33.710> but<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.770> but

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
out the Sun glare and whatnot but I but

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.880 
out the Sun glare and whatnot but I but
I'm<00:02:35.370> guessing<00:02:35.970> it's<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:36.990> other<00:02:37.440> one<00:02:37.680> was

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
I'm guessing it's it the other one was

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.070 
I'm guessing it's it the other one was
inside<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.400> screen<00:02:38.760> enclosure<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.510> obviously

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
inside the screen enclosure so obviously

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.300 
inside the screen enclosure so obviously
less<00:02:40.380> bugs<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.790> one<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.830> spiders

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
less bugs so this one the the spiders

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.910 
less bugs so this one the the spiders
love<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.760> make<00:02:44.940> two<00:02:45.480> webs<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.140> nests<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.800> all

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
love to make two webs and nests and all

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920 
love to make two webs and nests and all
kinds<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> good<00:02:47.459> stuff<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:48.000> then<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.600> get<00:02:48.780> this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
kinds of good stuff and then I get this

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
kinds of good stuff and then I get this
haze<00:02:49.290> all<00:02:50.100> around<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.180> outside<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.760> is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
haze all around the outside and that is

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.800 
haze all around the outside and that is
really<00:02:55.100> really<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.190> shame<00:02:56.520> because<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.120> mean<00:02:57.720> you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
really really a shame because I mean you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.660 
really really a shame because I mean you
can't<00:02:58.050> even<00:02:58.110> tell<00:02:58.440> there's<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.770> shed<00:02:59.070> back<00:02:59.280> here

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
can't even tell there's a shed back here

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.960 
can't even tell there's a shed back here
and<00:02:59.880> there's<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.060> door<00:03:00.360> right<00:03:00.660> here<00:03:01.940> that<00:03:02.940> I

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
and there's a door right here that I

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.270 
and there's a door right here that I
would<00:03:03.209> love<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.930> know<00:03:04.020> watch<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.950> keep<00:03:05.130> an

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
would love to you know watch and keep an

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.170 
would love to you know watch and keep an
eye<00:03:05.400> on<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:06.540> now<00:03:06.959> how<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.470> effects<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.340> says

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
eye on so now how that effects it says

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.390 
eye on so now how that effects it says
it's<00:03:09.360> recording<00:03:09.959> right<00:03:09.990> here<00:03:11.209> um<00:03:12.950> but<00:03:13.950> even<00:03:14.250> at

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
it's recording right here um but even at

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.250 
it's recording right here um but even at
even<00:03:14.760> recording<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.390> guess<00:03:15.570> because<00:03:15.780> we<00:03:15.990> get<00:03:16.110> so

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
even recording I guess because we get so

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.250 
even recording I guess because we get so
much<00:03:16.380> movement<00:03:16.920> here<00:03:17.630> if<00:03:18.630> that's<00:03:18.959> why<00:03:19.080> it's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
much movement here if that's why it's

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.800 
much movement here if that's why it's
recording<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:21.120> it's<00:03:21.269> not<00:03:21.390> recording

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
recording but it's not recording

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.229 
recording but it's not recording
anything<00:03:22.019> really<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:25.489> like<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.580> said<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.820> lot<00:03:27.120> I

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
anything really so like I said a lot I

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.150 
anything really so like I said a lot I
think<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.450> lot<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.870> depends<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.380> camera

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
think a lot of it depends on camera

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.060 
think a lot of it depends on camera
placement<00:03:30.200> here<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.320> go<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.739> good<00:03:31.920> one

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
placement here you go this is a good one

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.550 
placement here you go this is a good one
that<00:03:33.200> Street<00:03:34.580> down<00:03:35.580> there<00:03:35.910> is<00:03:36.180> probably<00:03:36.780> both

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that Street down there is probably both

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:17.339 
lighting back there it gets dark back
there<00:05:15.400> quick<00:05:15.759> so<00:05:16.419> this<00:05:16.539> is<00:05:16.659> all<00:05:16.840> working<00:05:17.139> off

there quick so this is all working off

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.439 
there quick so this is all working off
the<00:05:17.469> LEDs<00:05:18.009> and<00:05:18.430> maybe<00:05:19.060> you're<00:05:19.240> getting<00:05:19.330> a

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
the LEDs and maybe you're getting a

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.540 
the LEDs and maybe you're getting a
little<00:05:19.569> light<00:05:19.840> off<00:05:20.050> from<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.710> streets<00:05:21.039> but

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
little light off from the streets but

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.610 
little light off from the streets but
you<00:05:24.550> know<00:05:24.699> if<00:05:25.569> there<00:05:26.050> are<00:05:26.080> some<00:05:26.229> people<00:05:26.469> back
