so this was kind of a challenge to do
but<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> used<00:01:48.420> my<00:01:48.540> bite<00:01:48.899> pomegranate<00:01:49.740> lipstick

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
but I used my bite pomegranate lipstick

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.810 
but I used my bite pomegranate lipstick
and<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:51.049> $24<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> full<00:01:52.710> size<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.549> again

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
and that's $24 for a full size so again

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520 
and that's $24 for a full size so again
the<00:01:53.939> grand<00:01:54.210> total<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.899> high-end<00:01:55.049> side<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the grand total for the high-end side of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.910 
the grand total for the high-end side of
my<00:01:55.619> face<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.750> 339<00:01:57.750> dollars<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.560> thought<00:01:58.770> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
my face is 339 dollars so I thought I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.950 
my face is 339 dollars so I thought I
bet<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.369> beat<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.759> price<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.479> drugstore

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
products on the other side the challenge

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.969 
products on the other side the challenge
was<00:02:03.090> really<00:02:03.119> finding<00:02:03.869> things<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.229> totally

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
was really finding things that totally

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.859 
was really finding things that totally
matched<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.939> now<00:02:06.119> I'll<00:02:06.329> take<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.689> through

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that side in tutorial fashion and I did

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.330 
that side in tutorial fashion and I did
put<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:09.929> drugstore<00:02:10.229> foundation<00:02:11.039> right

after I applied the double wear because

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.700 
after I applied the double wear because
I<00:02:13.200> thought

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
I thought

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.440 
I thought
if<00:02:13.770> that's<00:02:13.980> gonna<00:02:14.130> be<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.490> overall<00:02:14.880> base<00:02:15.120> for

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
if that's gonna be the overall base for

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.790 
if that's gonna be the overall base for
the<00:02:15.540> look<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.870> don't<00:02:16.050> want<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.380> completely

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
the look I don't want to like completely

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800 
the look I don't want to like completely
have<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:17.550> side<00:02:17.760> done<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.210> then<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.780> other

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
have one side done and then do the other

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.870 
have one side done and then do the other
I<00:02:19.410> use<00:02:19.620> Rimmel<00:02:20.010> lasting<00:02:20.160> finish<00:02:20.700> foundation

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880

foundation<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.790> do<00:02:26.850> think<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.210> looks

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
foundation but I do think it looks

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.360 
foundation but I do think it looks
pretty<00:02:27.540> nice<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.050> natural<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> skin<00:02:28.800> and
