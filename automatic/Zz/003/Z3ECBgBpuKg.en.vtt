00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.000
 apart from driving controls there are also 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 speed controls through a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 so-called are the radar on a certain 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 point along the road is a car with 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.589
 a radar device in it and only one 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.089
 hundreds of meters away 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.089
 any offender held 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.249
 we are here at a speed check 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.529
 of the central traffic part of 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.179
 the national police in axes and empire 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.949
 police force has a lot to do with the 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.919
 roads outside built-up areas 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.930
 the so-called 80 km roads statistically 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.289
 considering the road type where most 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.850
 and the serious accidents occur 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.519
 the man in the radar car 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.829
 ask if this is useful work I think 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.230
 sure it makes sense if you work 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.739
 looks at what is happening here 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.410
 the number of vehicles and what here 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.379
 passes an intersection that after an accident 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.420
 sensitive then I think it certainly 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.100
 it is important that the police regularly 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.100
 controls the speeds 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.140
 you are not done with a check 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.480
 it is also not the case that the police 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.720
 the police will stand somewhere 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.440
 select and search precisely for that location and 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.560
 alki 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.960
 imagine a very accidental war 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.190
 the happens at this intersection on a well 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.620
 moment an accident 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.920
 you come to it you think back to the 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.370
 moments that wake up time check that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.280
 I certainly think back and vice versa 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.530
 here is the check than you think 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.830
 back and accidents 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.440
 we also think back to you because you 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.460
 must imagine when there is one 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.640
 car 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.770
 This intersection is approaching and wants 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.410
 cross over and board someone with it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.479
 a speed of roughly 100 110 or 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.860
 maybe about the consequences 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.509
 of which can be 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.490
 they are often impossible to oversee and then it is 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.560
 it so that in nine out of ten cases 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.330
 the police can already be placed first 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.710
 and the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.710
 the case but we must redecorate 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.480
 some drivers react emotionally 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:13.840
 in a standing posture also be other 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.840
 held 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.690
 they get a ticket and become one 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.530
 chat with them made but really under 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.280
 the impression 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.280
 they do not appear 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.770
 Well we got the police report 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.680
 how fast I rode 97 kilometers 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.550
 why because i state her we had to 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.060
 him if I may ask 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.680
 I from school 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.420
 I have a daughter and I picked up 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.980
 went home 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.770
 but why do you also have a remark 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.880
 had much to do with the argument 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.320
 Police is yes, we are not here 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.760
 for our pleasure but if there is an accident 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.020
 happened where there is and that comes 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.280
 often by speeding what do you think 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.530
 thereof 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.030
 I can fully support that 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.410
 because I drove too fast and when you look 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.510
 here on the street I know the way to me 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.860
 about it is indeed a dangerous one 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.510
 away 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.730
 where is it actually then have to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.140
 its turning yes but i mean i 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.650
 nutty drive or you drive would be mine 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.900
 case 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.060
 97 mean those seven who make miles too 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.120
 not broadcast would think would 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:23.100
 the municipal police think like this 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.720
 renkum works mainly within the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.040
 built-up area 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.540
 This is also checked on roads 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.640
 but above average many accidents 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.720
 but also in response to 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.720
 complaints from the population 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.580
 kilometer has driven kilometer 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.350
 a few hundred meters away is the 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.910
 shelter team 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.380
 you are the one who takes care of the people and 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.690
 which she possibly writes down as I do 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.190
 have driven fast almost alone with it 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.020
 mileage per hour and it 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.000
 official report or busy with 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.440
 another institution opposite 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.740
 no stand there with a whole different one 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.900
 setting for always trying to find a place 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.270
 to look up but a lot in a short time 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.460
 Accidents usually happen by high 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.130
 speed and we explain that to the people 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.840
 even if wants to formalize 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.030
 and how does it work that people understand 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.100
 or may care so little about that moment 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.320
 often took me there can understand you 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.609
 often we get our excuse of yes no 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.580
 I am not so fast 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.980
 and that we always belong to the 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.750
 accidents that my actual unknowingly 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.310
 then drive fast and we will try to do that 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.930
 to point out 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.250
 have just contributed to a little further 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.980
 able to put a team around the people 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.090
 and possibly globalization 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.230
 a few hundred meters further 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.280
 hour at home 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.140
 what is your job name in this there are 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.630
 speeders who try the 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.220
 control miss that the radar 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.970
 passed by and that afterwards would 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.960
 take a side road to those people too 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.460
 to grab 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.810
 I am here I can quickly reach the fashion scene 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.010
 those people come and then gives the same 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.990
 his step against of he is one 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.370
 it then happens on an official site 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.570
 often that people do what we say 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.830
 pinch out 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.150
 it doesn't happen often at once 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.120
 happened in often it is too 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.440
 mopeds that do it a bit faster 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.850
 why would people do what you do 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.610
 you can still count on your fingers that you 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.290
 are sooner or later turn to 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.760
 of course its more to hide 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.930
 have that way try there 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.120
 It may also be that 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.080
 it in the reflex of the first reaction 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.880
 fright 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.880
 getting out can also occur 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:42.639
 good afternoon now, the extra margin stop 68 knows 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.500
 meters his shoulder come again 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.710
 In the meantime I may ask you something 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.120
 you know 68 where you are 50 you can adjust that 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.180
 conscious or not at all 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.539
 add 60 digits for nine years 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.069
 unrestrained ampersand so it had to 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.710
 looked well to date and got home 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:03.490
 against circular I drove warmly west 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.870
 why reduce too hard to unknowingly 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.710
 you just drive that far there is neck 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.710
 systems can be silent 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.450
 this gentleman here a guess 68 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:20.180
 km per hour what should she still be over 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.610
 the 70 have been he manages that 60w 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.890
 what do you think of it for yes he says 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.960
 against me of equipment will not 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.160
 good because I'm really going 60 miles 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.200
 per hour 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.810
 because he lives wine so you know someone 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.010
 advised to go to the garage 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.900
 as a speedometer 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.360
 because we have that 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.460
 noted with calibrated equipment that 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.660
 are really of an order so he would be the 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.270
 passing by 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.830
 Do you seriously think that man is really 60? 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.000
 array or gold innovation 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.590
 are inventing a story 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.090
 of course, people always search 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.710
 an excuse 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.090
 And yes the one who just admits it 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.740
 they say yes indeed I have not 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.770
 attention the front can be driven fast 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:07:00.380
 yes this man yes so that but in the middle 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.950
 but I have my own there 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.950
 ideas about 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.470
 then suddenly light panic someone hits 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.770
 to the high speed through the radar 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:16.000
 to be driven and they are off and on 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.000
 motorcycling routes sounds jabbing 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:46.170
 well this was a case of someone that one 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.460
 another road to the intention was what 

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.510
 was to the reason of turning off 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.430
 this sir 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.870
 it was my wife who would stand by us 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.700
 she knew she was driving too fast curing them 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.800
 knew she was checked but she 

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.740
 lives in that direction and that was chosen 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.150
 back home so she would not hit off 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.630
 step against going so something further is there 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.120
 nothing wrong 

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.930
 it's air case not an evil one I set up 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.310
 do not think so 

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.380
 she has normal police reports 

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:10.430
 for the speed she was driving 

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.430
 and with that the stocking is finished
