00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.740 
explanation point for Argentina look at
the<00:02:16.650> joy<00:02:16.890> on

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the joy on

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.950 
the joy on
two<00:02:17.900> phases

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.670 

United<00:02:21.290> States<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:22.930> think<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.020> let<00:02:24.200> our<00:02:24.320> country

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
United States I think we let our country

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.190 
United States I think we let our country
there<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:24.890> think<00:02:25.190> we<00:02:25.280> let<00:02:25.430> ourselves<00:02:25.580> down<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
there I think we let ourselves down the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.660 
there I think we let ourselves down the
United<00:02:27.560> States<00:02:27.890> will<00:02:28.160> not<00:02:28.400> win<00:02:28.760> gold

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
United States will not win gold

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.940 
United States will not win gold
so<00:02:30.670> for<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.000> first<00:02:31.239> time<00:02:31.599> since<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.590> NBA

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
so for the first time since the NBA

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.270 
so for the first time since the NBA
players<00:02:33.420> participated

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.170 

I<00:02:38.570> think<00:02:39.570> in<00:02:39.720> 92<00:02:40.350> we<00:02:41.070> had<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> Supreme<00:02:41.910> Team

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
I think in 92 we had that Supreme Team

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.930 
I think in 92 we had that Supreme Team
since<00:02:42.630> then<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.290> world<00:02:43.560> kept<00:02:43.950> coming<00:02:44.280> up<00:02:44.370> you

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
since then the world kept coming up you

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.700 
since then the world kept coming up you
know<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> don't<00:02:45.360> think<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.630> guys<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.810> 96<00:02:46.500> would

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
know I don't think the guys in 96 would

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.950 
know I don't think the guys in 96 would
have<00:02:46.800> won<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.100> year<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.790> guys<00:02:48.000> in<00:02:48.210> 2000

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
have won this year the guys in 2000

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.150 
have won this year the guys in 2000
wouldn't<00:02:49.170> know<00:02:49.230> won<00:02:49.410> they<00:02:49.560> would<00:02:49.710> not<00:02:49.950> have

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
wouldn't know won they would not have

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.710 
wouldn't know won they would not have
won<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.490> tournament<00:02:50.730> they<00:02:51.360> wouldn't<00:02:51.630> have

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
won this tournament they wouldn't have

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.950 
won this tournament they wouldn't have
done<00:02:51.780> any<00:02:52.020> better<00:02:52.140> than<00:02:52.350> these<00:02:52.470> guys<00:02:52.650> then<00:02:53.960> it

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
done any better than these guys then it

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.280

hurt to see us lose because they weren't

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.130 
hurt to see us lose because they weren't
