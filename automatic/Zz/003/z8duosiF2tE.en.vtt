00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello he likes to drink filter coffee 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.919
 But I do not want to know a whole lot 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.679
 because in the evening when he is from the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.690
 work comes home or at noon 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.179
 already from school is the coffee 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 cold again that's why I have one now 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.689
 Great idea for you just buy 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.769
 The filters are giving away 100 pieces 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.170
 for 1 euro 99 at all the example 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:37.280
 what you need even filter coffee around 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.280
 water in the grazer and bags out 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:52.400
 and makes three level tablespoons 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.400
 of coffee pure 1 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.820
 2 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:12.170
 and 3 look down there is the coffee 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.580
 and that she is so fine-grained this 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.100
 packet that the coffee is not 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.430
 can not be enough so listen later 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.720
 coffee set in the cup no fear then 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:28.570
 he simply hangs the bag in the cup 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:35.930
 is of course the buckle it up 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:40.790
 hot water over it and then we can 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.300
 Just yank him up and rumble like you 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.619
 do not want to bag or just wholly 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.340
 let it draw normally 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.630
 I leave my coffee three to five 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.880
 minutes about 10 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.190
 and how you like it, of course 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.660
 want to have stronger or weaker 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.910
 you have to stop with the time 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.410
 but definitely try it 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.149
 you then always freshly brewed 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.210
 filter coffee 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.400
 without you a big machine 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.580
 to buy the expensive in the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.620
 Purchase is therefore converted 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.070
 currently not even 20 cents for a cup 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.070
 to want
