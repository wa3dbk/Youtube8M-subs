to<00:01:35.690> change<00:01:35.930> its<00:01:36.080> color

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
to change its color

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.790

let's<00:05:27.910> take<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.150> look<00:05:28.419> at<00:05:28.600> some<00:05:28.900> of<00:05:28.990> these

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
let's take a look at some of these

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.220 
let's take a look at some of these
interface<00:05:29.470> elements<00:05:29.980> Maya<00:05:30.970> has<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.270> menu<00:05:31.630> just

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
interface elements Maya has a menu just

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.860 
interface elements Maya has a menu just
across<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.830> top<00:05:33.040> as<00:05:33.370> most<00:05:33.940> computer<00:05:34.450> programs

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
across the top as most computer programs

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.790 
across the top as most computer programs
do<00:05:35.200> but<00:05:35.919> because<00:05:36.070> Maya<00:05:36.460> has<00:05:36.700> so<00:05:37.060> many<00:05:37.360> tools<00:05:37.800> it

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
do but because Maya has so many tools it

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.640 
do but because Maya has so many tools it
won't<00:05:39.250> all<00:05:39.460> fit<00:05:39.490> on<00:05:39.760> one<00:05:39.940> menu<00:05:40.570> so<00:05:41.320> in<00:05:41.410> fact

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
won't all fit on one menu so in fact

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.530 
won't all fit on one menu so in fact
you've<00:05:41.800> got<00:05:41.980> lots<00:05:42.400> of<00:05:42.669> different<00:05:42.850> menus<00:05:43.389> to

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
you've got lots of different menus to

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.629 
you've got lots of different menus to
choose<00:05:43.780> from<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.320> you<00:05:44.350> can<00:05:44.740> choose<00:05:45.160> from<00:05:45.400> all

of these menu sets from this pulldown
list<00:05:49.180> here<00:05:49.450> so<00:05:49.479> you'll<00:05:49.780> see<00:05:49.990> a<00:05:50.020> polygons<00:05:50.710> menu

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.920 
you'll also note at the extreme lower
left-hand<00:06:12.669> corner<00:06:12.940> of<00:06:13.419> the<00:06:13.510> Maya<00:06:13.720> interface

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
left-hand corner of the Maya interface

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.110 
left-hand corner of the Maya interface
you<00:06:14.770> will<00:06:14.889> see<00:06:15.160> the<00:06:15.430> same<00:06:15.610> information

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
you will see the same information

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.480 
you will see the same information
displayed

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
displayed

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.370 
displayed
okay<00:06:18.940> so<00:06:19.000> this<00:06:19.240> is<00:06:19.389> called<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:19.720> status<00:06:20.139> line

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
okay so this is called the status line

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.070 
okay so this is called the status line
we<00:06:21.160> can<00:06:21.340> collapse<00:06:21.729> parts<00:06:22.270> of<00:06:22.389> the<00:06:22.479> status<00:06:22.870> line

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
we can collapse parts of the status line

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.100 
we can collapse parts of the status line
to<00:06:23.530> reduce<00:06:23.860> visual<00:06:24.310> clutter<00:06:24.639> on<00:06:24.910> the<00:06:25.569> screen<00:06:25.870> I

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
to reduce visual clutter on the screen I

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.279 
to reduce visual clutter on the screen I
can<00:06:27.039> close<00:06:27.460> some<00:06:27.759> of<00:06:27.789> these<00:06:28.050> collapse<00:06:29.050> them

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.289 
can close some of these collapse them

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.210 
can close some of these collapse them
down<00:06:29.470> or<00:06:29.710> reopen<00:06:30.160> them<00:06:30.280> as<00:06:30.430> needed

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
down or reopen them as needed

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.340 
down or reopen them as needed
directly<00:06:33.220> below<00:06:33.430> the<00:06:33.699> status<00:06:34.060> line<00:06:34.300> are<00:06:34.630> the

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
directly below the status line are the

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.710 
directly below the status line are the
shelves<00:06:35.729> each<00:06:36.729> one<00:06:36.940> of<00:06:37.030> these<00:06:37.120> tabs<00:06:37.479> is<00:06:37.690> a

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
shelves each one of these tabs is a

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.280 
shelves each one of these tabs is a
shelf

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
shelf

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.909 
shelf
so<00:06:38.770> you'll<00:06:38.919> see<00:06:39.130> surfaces<00:06:39.729> polygons

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 
so you'll see surfaces polygons

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.310 
so you'll see surfaces polygons
animation<00:06:41.919> and<00:06:42.160> so<00:06:42.759> on<00:06:42.940> these<00:06:43.630> are<00:06:43.690> all<00:06:43.840> visual

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
animation and so on these are all visual

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.219 
animation and so on these are all visual
icons<00:06:44.830> that<00:06:45.100> correspond<00:06:45.639> to<00:06:45.759> menus<00:06:46.360> so<00:06:47.110> in

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:47.229 
icons that correspond to menus so in

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:48.990 
icons that correspond to menus so in
fact<00:06:47.440> the<00:06:47.710> shelf<00:06:47.949> isn't<00:06:48.280> really<00:06:48.490> necessary

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
fact the shelf isn't really necessary

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.110 
fact the shelf isn't really necessary
it's<00:06:49.479> just<00:06:49.720> convenient<00:06:50.430> for<00:06:51.430> example<00:06:51.850> my

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
it's just convenient for example my

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.210 
it's just convenient for example my
polygon<00:06:52.509> shelf<00:06:52.990> will<00:06:53.500> allow<00:06:53.710> me<00:06:53.889> to<00:06:53.919> create

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
polygon shelf will allow me to create

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.180 
polygon shelf will allow me to create
objects<00:06:55.030> simple<00:06:55.660> primitives<00:06:56.199> such<00:06:56.470> as<00:06:56.680> cubes

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
objects simple primitives such as cubes

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.040 
objects simple primitives such as cubes
and<00:06:57.520> spheres<00:06:58.169> so<00:06:59.169> here's<00:06:59.590> the<00:06:59.800> polygon<00:07:00.340> sphere

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
and spheres so here's the polygon sphere

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.590 
and spheres so here's the polygon sphere
shelf<00:07:02.050> button<00:07:02.550> click<00:07:03.550> it<00:07:03.699> and<00:07:03.850> actually<00:07:04.360> get

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
shelf button click it and actually get

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.570 
shelf button click it and actually get
some<00:07:04.660> feedback<00:07:05.260> in<00:07:05.500> the<00:07:05.620> viewport<00:07:05.650> to<00:07:06.190> tell<00:07:06.400> me

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
some feedback in the viewport to tell me

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.150 
some feedback in the viewport to tell me
what<00:07:06.760> to<00:07:06.910> do<00:07:07.060> drag<00:07:07.690> on<00:07:07.870> the<00:07:07.960> grid<00:07:08.169> there<00:07:08.949> you<00:07:09.039> go

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
what to do drag on the grid there you go

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.950 
what to do drag on the grid there you go
I've<00:07:09.340> made<00:07:09.550> a<00:07:09.580> sphere<00:07:09.970> I<00:07:10.229> can<00:07:11.229> click<00:07:11.590> on<00:07:11.620> cube

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
I've made a sphere I can click on cube

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.120 
I've made a sphere I can click on cube
click<00:07:13.960> and<00:07:14.110> drag

click and drag
the<00:07:16.370> footprint<00:07:17.120> of<00:07:17.270> the<00:07:17.420> cube<00:07:17.830> release<00:07:18.830> the

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040 
the footprint of the cube release the

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.250 
the footprint of the cube release the
mouse<00:07:19.220> then<00:07:19.640> I<00:07:19.730> can<00:07:19.880> click<00:07:20.090> again<00:07:20.360> to<00:07:20.720> drag<00:07:21.020> up

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
mouse then I can click again to drag up

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.200 
mouse then I can click again to drag up
to<00:07:21.290> set<00:07:21.650> the<00:07:21.740> height

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
to set the height

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:34.590 
to set the height
so<00:07:23.810> those<00:07:24.020> are<00:07:24.139> your<00:07:24.289> shelves

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:34.600 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.660
