7 8 sit up so the next step is I like to
go<00:02:10.640> from<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.120> top<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:12.080> I'll<00:02:12.200> place<00:02:12.410> my<00:02:12.440> hand

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
go from the top and I'll place my hand

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.070 
go from the top and I'll place my hand
down<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.120> doesn't<00:02:14.150> slide<00:02:14.870> all

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
down here so that it doesn't slide all

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.050 
down here so that it doesn't slide all
over<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.470> play<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.950> pick<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.670> sections

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
over and play I pick up the sections

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.880 
over and play I pick up the sections
because<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.840> want<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.290> be<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> little<00:02:18.650> bit

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
because I want it to be a little bit

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.420 
because I want it to be a little bit
more<00:02:19.070> natural<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.760> going<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.239> towards<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> top

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
more natural to going up towards the top

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.740 
more natural to going up towards the top
and<00:02:22.430> then<00:02:22.580> I'll<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.880> kind<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.180> weave<00:02:23.480> it

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
and then I'll just kind of weave it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.110 
and then I'll just kind of weave it
through<00:02:23.780> with<00:02:24.230> my<00:02:24.380> comb<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.040> then<00:02:25.640> from<00:02:25.880> there

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
through with my comb and then from there

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.900 
through with my comb and then from there
you<00:02:26.420> want<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.720> start<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.290> from<00:02:27.620> about<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
you want to start in from about the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.820 
you want to start in from about the
middle<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.720> length<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.260> hair<00:02:30.500> and

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
middle of the length of the hair and

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.490 
middle of the length of the hair and
just<00:02:31.580> push<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.060> up<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.390> your<00:02:32.600> comb<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.320> want

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
just push it up with your comb you want

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.440 
just push it up with your comb you want
to<00:02:33.560> highlight<00:02:33.980> underneath<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.970> back<00:02:35.180> combing

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
to highlight underneath the back combing

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.690 
to highlight underneath the back combing
because<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> back<00:02:36.470> combing<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.280> going<00:02:37.610> to

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
because the back combing is going to

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.670 
because the back combing is going to
create<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:38.030> seamless<00:02:38.330> section<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.440> now<00:02:39.470> you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
create a seamless section so now you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.340 
create a seamless section so now you
just<00:02:39.980> want<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.280> place<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.730> foil<00:02:41.350> slightly

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
just want to place the foil slightly

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.399 
just want to place the foil slightly
underneath<00:02:42.980> where<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.580> want<00:02:43.910> to

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
underneath where you want to

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.050 
underneath where you want to
and<00:02:46.099> then<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:47.030> start<00:02:47.450> by<00:02:47.629> doing<00:02:47.840> this

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
and then you just a start by doing this

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.630 
and then you just a start by doing this
both<00:02:50.060> sides<00:02:50.450> make<00:02:50.840> sure<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.140> evenly

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
both sides make sure it's evenly

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.920 
both sides make sure it's evenly
saturated<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:58.610> can<00:02:58.760> either<00:02:58.939> fold<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.420> up<00:02:59.569> or

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
saturated you can either fold it up or

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:17.140 
saturated you can either fold it up or
you<00:03:00.290> can<00:03:01.690> place<00:03:02.690> another<00:03:02.989> foil<00:03:03.409> on<00:03:03.590> top

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.180 

so<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.300> next<00:03:18.510> tip<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:19.140> we're<00:03:19.740> going<00:03:20.010> towards

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
so the next tip is we're going towards

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.760 
so the next tip is we're going towards
the<00:03:20.550> bottom<00:03:20.790> now<00:03:21.150> because<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.959> want<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.620> be<00:03:22.739> a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
the bottom now because I want it to be a

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.860 
the bottom now because I want it to be a
little<00:03:22.950> bit<00:03:23.130> more<00:03:23.310> sullen<00:03:23.849> or<00:03:24.060> more<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.569> true

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
little bit more sullen or more of a true

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.680 
little bit more sullen or more of a true
ombre<00:03:25.410> look<00:03:25.680> I'm<00:03:26.220> not<00:03:26.459> going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:27.000> leave<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.450> I'm

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
ombre look I'm not going to leave it I'm

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.520 
ombre look I'm not going to leave it I'm
going<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.080> push<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.380> up<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:29.220> that

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
going to push it up like that

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.460 
going to push it up like that
one<00:03:31.530> two<00:03:32.040> that's<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.300> two<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.750> three<00:03:34.020> times<00:03:34.200> it's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.809 
one two that's a two to three times it's
good<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.830> then<00:03:34.950> I'm<00:03:35.069> going<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.340> start<00:03:35.640> from

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
good and then I'm going to start from
