00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.200
This is Rogue to any available ships: the cyno jammer is down.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.100
Regroup at the outpost until reinforcements arrive.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.900
Copy Rogue, Gulf in position.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.100
Repairs at only 30 percent, what’s the ETA on those reinforcements?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.600
We’re going as fast as we can… just a few more jumps.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.100
Copy that Talon, get here as quick as possible.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.400
Stealth recon uncloaking at 40.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.500
Gulf, that’s your primary!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.900
Copy, engaging.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.900
Heads up, he's lit a cyno.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.200
New contacts, hostile capital ships inbound!

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.900
All ships, focus fire on that supercarrier!

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.200
Target down.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.600
They lit a second cyno!

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.500
Enemy support bridging in.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.800
We’re outnumbered two to one.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.200
Austin, fall back to the gate and link up with Talon!

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.600
My shields can’t keep up, I need some help!

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300
Get shield transfers on Saint!

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.500
Gulf, primary those dictors!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.900
Unable, I’m jammed.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.900
Talon, where the hell are you? We are getting murdered!

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.100
Armor’s gone, this is it.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.900
Yes! Well done. Focus fire on the second carrier.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.600
Cyprus, this is Hammer: the fleet is through. Call a target.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600
Enemy support fleet at 80…

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.400
Hammer, your primary is that support fleet, we’ll assign fighters to cover you.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.200
Roger.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000
Dreadnoughts in position.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.400
Very good, start your siege cycle.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400
Copy. Engaging.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.000
Cyprus, support fleet is disengaging, request permission to pursue.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.400
Negative, maintain your attack.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
You don’t need our help for this.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.100
Don’t do it! We have no eyes out there...

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
Too late, already in warp.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.600
Talon, they’re following us to the gate, are you in position?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.500
Roger that Austin, we’re holding in the next system.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.400
Talon fleet, jump through now!

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.900
Understood, jumping in.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900
That’s a lot of hostiles in local.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900
Yeah, glad you could make it.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.300
Order targets by range...

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.800
Check scanners, here they come!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.900
Take down that command ship first!

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.400
Roger, engaging!

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.500
Austin, align to the outpost at speed. Talon will call your primaries.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.900
Primary those ECM boats next and target secondaries by range!

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.600
Copy.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.100
Prometheus, do you copy?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.100
Standing by.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.200
Cyno deployed, you’re clear to jump!

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.500
Roger that, jumping.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.000
Now let’s kick these bastards out of our system!
