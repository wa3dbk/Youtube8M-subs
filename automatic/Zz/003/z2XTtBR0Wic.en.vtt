00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.520
 yeah 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 the 320 mountain bikers present at summer barns 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.610
 confided in block to face the 35 or 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.860
 50 km that proposed the hiking 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.710
 four mines organized by the fun mountain bike 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.570
 bike to get a rendezvous 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 must in the calendar of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.070
 events it is the athlete algrangeois 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.809
 mister pascal mill g president of the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.020
 mtb fender give back four mines 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.760
 so 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.220
 with always our three courses 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.570
 usual so we usually 15km 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:50.060
 now it's 22 km 35 km 50 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.340
 km and for its different routes the 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.770
 accustomed to mountain bike hikes affiliated with a 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.559
 club or individual were 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.989
 so present we are independent and 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.710
 then to the flank rodo sometimes a 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.770
 great ok not bad not bad downhill 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.200
 technical and technical descent and 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.540
 the mountain bikers were spoiled because as 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.360
 at the hike tells the actress time a 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.970
 impossible climb especially on the 50km 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.890
 waiting for them at the connacht 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.790
 three courses that are very sturdy 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.920
 because given the difficulty of going out 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.920
 d'algrange is necessarily in a corner 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.229
 in a hole so you have to take out the 35 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.270
 km ago nine hundred and thirty meters from 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.910
 altitude difference so you have to go up 930 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.960
 meters and the 51 1100 meters so that's 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.000
 still represents a lot 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.520
 which is not insurmountable for 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.710
 pros like those mountain bikers as well 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.460
 that the oxygen of MoulÃ¨ne haucourt 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.130
 meurthe and moselle 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.020
 there are lots of elevation changes that 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.830
 I enjoy and then a lot of descents 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.840
 very nice 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.070
 so we want it regularly enough 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.500
 the fourth year I believe for myself 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.330
 then there are major difficulties 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.360
 to prepare for 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.000
 this hike here major difficulties 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.770
 yes yes and a lot of pretty downhill 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.500
 quite technical and for me that's the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.350
 more difficult so you have to prepare 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.040
 go there I think guaranteeing a 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.989
 certain security 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.850
 except more or less preparation 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.100
 intensive according to the motivations the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.130
 mountain bike hike is the surprise the 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.360
 discovery we discover is the interest 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.980
 hiking is discovering 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.410
 always the courses are new and 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.450
 then we're really going to discover 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.730
 rightly straddle our equity and 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.040
 let's discover a little bit about these courses 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.660
 elevation in the wood and wood under a 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.060
 great messenger angeville and thionville 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.560
 strange what can be said also 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.200
 we had to change our course 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.450
 a month ago everything pile we had to go through 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.489
 on the side of george michael but as he 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.019
 there is the hill climb that will fall again 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.780
 once as last year at the same time 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.790
 that we so on May 18th so we have 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.010
 flipped to thionville's side 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.480
 strange we are jubilant and where every corner 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.610
 there then to cabo with single bumps 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.220
 beautiful little paths cola cola did 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.660
 could catch up and found then to make 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.079
 to new attractions very beautiful 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.570
 course 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.150
 I said as a preamble to discover this 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.989
 course they were 320 a mountain biker 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.510
 moselle of meurthe-et-moselle 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.370
 from germany or luxembourg I 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.560
 come from luxembourg last month it's 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.320
 the first time I will accompany my 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.750
 boyfriend so we will discover the course 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.210
 that's it and that's the case 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.250
 and far away from sis at longwy the participants 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.840
 for now it's 8:30 am we can 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.600
 give an estimate there is more 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.460
 of 125 registered so the inscriptions 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.960
 are open to causes that deezer so 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.230
 I think we can largely double 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.090
 doubled or tripled tripled 7 was 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.459
 inscribed these inscriptions so otherwise he 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.470
 are people from Germany from 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.750
 club of sarre burg 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.130
 there are people who have contacted me from the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.270
 belgium good I have not seen them yet 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.920
 are people coming from luxembourg 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.380
 and people who come from the meurthe 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.270
 and moselle has little everywhere so we did not 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.860
 not done a lot of publicity but 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.230
 good with all internet networks where 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.310
 the sites that exist we should have 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.170
 a very good influence today 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.209
 what a very good influence indeed for 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.770
 this great meeting of mountain bike in algrange 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.840
 but also from the region and whatever 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.550
 the origin of the participants and 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.170
 tell him come from metz and then I like 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.290
 it says what the forest will have those 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.410
 enjoyed the super course 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:22.930
 great frankly nothing to say y'a good 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:29.140
 super difficult route but everything 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.729
 is feasible 35 km very good course not 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.110
 standing 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.430
 impeccable and good climbs good on 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.210
 had two three stragglers but it's not 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.100
 serious will not give you names 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.350
 today but follow my look they 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.610
 are right behind 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.470
 otherwise everything went very well and 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.260
 after the effort the comfort 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.150
 as usual and so vincent of saint 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.040
 nicolas in the forest speaks of comfort 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.200
 is that a barbecue was organized by 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.720
 the mountain bike fun bike at the end of the 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.900
 hiking and comfort for mountain bikes 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.180
 was also planned to know 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.800
 washing points beautiful success this 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.990
 year again that it was hiking 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.050
 4 min from the mountain bike fun bike d'algrange 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.450
 vintage 2000 to 14 other large 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.880
 sports events on which the 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.310
 fun bike is usually expected the 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.610
 downhill and four mines but for that 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.380
 it will be necessary to wait until 2015 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.550
 otherwise good no for the moment ago 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.570
 still not we still do not do it again 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.160
 the descent of the four mines 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.990
 good this year she was a little 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.500
 disturbed wanted to put it new 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.830
 calendar 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.230
 we wanted to make a 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.760
 an association with clubs clubs 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.890
 Germans to make a moselle sahara 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.090
 good it was not done because hey he 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.190
 had to be a cut of wood on 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.210
 finally we have real years and 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.680
 finally there was no cut of 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.360
 wood so well it'll be postponed to 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.030
 next year and we will finish 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.820
 by news of the cleds itself 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.080
 pascal the club so it's not happening 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.759
 too bad 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.349
 right now I mean good we did not 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:49.639
 the numbers that 4 5 years ago 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.159
 back we have a little less but we have 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.810
 many more people who are also 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.340
 motivated ie to help or whatever 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.039
 that was what we needed at 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.360
 club it was a team a team or 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.650
 on whom can I count what's this 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.889
 worse we know what we are watering this moment 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.870
 what may have sounded 55 at the club 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.610
 but hey it's an act and a workforce 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.830
 quite quite well what is 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.479
 moves back to the 2 alps for the 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.439
 free raid ie in a month any 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:17.180
 pile for the 22nd of June, and if not we have 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.319
 new as every year by in morzine 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.460
 a week to enjoy a park lease 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:25.090
 with young people in by a water by a 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.090
 dozen what
