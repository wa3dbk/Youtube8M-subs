which some portion of it is stranded I

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.490 
which some portion of it is stranded I
wanted<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.300> take<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> look<00:00:30.810> at<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> United

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
wanted to take a look at the United

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.180 
wanted to take a look at the United
States<00:00:31.800> version<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.399> copper<00:00:32.579> wire<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.690> have

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
States version of copper wire we have

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.620 
States version of copper wire we have
apparently<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.370> different<00:00:35.730> standard<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.239> use

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
apparently a different standard in use

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.490 
apparently a different standard in use
for<00:00:37.079> our<00:00:37.670> household<00:00:38.670> wiring<00:00:38.960> instead<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.170> any

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
for our household wiring instead of any

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.889 
for our household wiring instead of any
standard<00:00:41.160> wiring<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.649> three<00:00:43.649> solid

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
standard wiring we have three solid

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.619 
standard wiring we have three solid
lengths<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.050> wire<00:00:46.730> ones<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> ground<00:00:48.149> ones<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
lengths of wire ones the ground ones the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.770 
lengths of wire ones the ground ones the
hot<00:00:48.809> ones<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> common<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> did<00:00:51.180> was<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
hot ones the common so what I did was I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.860 
hot ones the common so what I did was I
stripped<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> insulation<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
stripped all of the insulation out I

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.819 
stripped all of the insulation out I
captured<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.289> bag

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
captured it in this bag

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.220 
captured it in this bag
I<00:00:56.090> think<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> probably<00:00:57.420> took<00:00:57.989> me<00:00:58.050> about

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
I think that it probably took me about

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.760 
I think that it probably took me about
10<00:00:58.680> minutes<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.840> wasn't<00:01:00.840> exactly<00:01:01.050> working

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
10 minutes but I wasn't exactly working

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410 
10 minutes but I wasn't exactly working
as<00:01:01.890> fast<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.399> possibly<00:01:02.850> could<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.149> suppose

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
as fast as I possibly could I suppose

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.890 
as fast as I possibly could I suppose
I've<00:01:04.320> laid<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> got<00:01:06.689> done

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
I've laid it all up and when I got done

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.250 
I've laid it all up and when I got done
weighing<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.680> what<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> found<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:09.260> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
weighing it this is what I found out the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.160 
weighing it this is what I found out the
weight<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.920> insulation<00:01:12.020> including<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
weight with insulation including the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.830 
weight with insulation including the
copper<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> ziplock<00:01:14.189> bag<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.790> 92<00:01:15.659> grams

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
copper in the ziplock bag is 92 grams

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.499 
copper in the ziplock bag is 92 grams
I'm<00:01:16.380> using<00:01:16.680> grams<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.759> my<00:01:18.090> international

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
I'm using grams so my international

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.770 
I'm using grams so my international
friends<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.530> follow<00:01:19.920> along<00:01:20.100> easily<00:01:20.780> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
friends can follow along easily the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.260 
friends can follow along easily the
weight<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.009> insulation<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
weight with the insulation and the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
weight with the insulation and the
copper<00:01:24.630> bag<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.680> no<00:01:25.860> copper<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:27.240> 38<00:01:27.840> grams<00:01:28.369> so

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
copper bag but no copper is 38 grams so

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.940 
copper bag but no copper is 38 grams so
that<00:01:29.790> gives<00:01:30.240> us<00:01:30.390> an<00:01:30.600> inferred<00:01:30.990> weight<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that gives us an inferred weight of the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
that gives us an inferred weight of the
copper<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.520> 54<00:01:33.030> grams<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.720> rejected<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
copper of 54 grams and I have rejected a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.690 
copper of 54 grams and I have rejected a
couple<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.619> times<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.070> that's<00:01:35.250> that's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
couple of times and that's that's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.080 
couple of times and that's that's
accurate<00:01:35.970> okay<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> look

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
accurate okay so if we're going to look

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.020 
accurate okay so if we're going to look
at<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> recovery<00:01:39.750> rate<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.850> recovery<00:01:41.850> rate

maybe<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.770> isn't<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.370> good<00:03:05.550> after<00:03:05.970> all

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
maybe this isn't so good after all

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.740 
maybe this isn't so good after all
because<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.740> takes<00:03:08.040> time<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.700> actually<00:03:09.120> get

better<00:03:24.750> believe<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.080> I'm<00:03:25.320> going<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.590> enter

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
better believe that I'm going to enter

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.260 
better believe that I'm going to enter
because<00:03:26.130> those<00:03:26.280> machines<00:03:26.700> are<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.910> little<00:03:27.180> bit

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
because those machines are a little bit

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.900 
because those machines are a little bit
pricey<00:03:27.920> especially<00:03:28.920> on<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.040> scrappers<00:03:29.520> budget

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
pricey especially on a scrappers budget

but<00:03:31.220> without<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.400> machine<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:33.450> takes<00:03:33.750> me

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
but without the machine it takes me

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.180 
but without the machine it takes me
maybe<00:03:34.590> oh<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:36.300> guess<00:03:36.960> if<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.260> was<00:03:37.470> really<00:03:37.890> going

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
maybe oh I guess if I was really going

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.230 
maybe oh I guess if I was really going
at<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.640> had<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.850> good<00:03:39.210> sharp<00:03:39.600> knife<00:03:39.690> uh<00:03:41.240> you

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
at it I had a good sharp knife uh you

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.660 
at it I had a good sharp knife uh you
know<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.660> was<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.740> in<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.070> zone

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670

take<00:03:48.570> me<00:03:48.780> about<00:03:48.810> two<00:03:49.320> minutes<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:50.070> strip<00:03:50.670> the
