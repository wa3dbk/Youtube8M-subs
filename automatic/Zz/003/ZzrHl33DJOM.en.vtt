so<00:00:13.309> it's<00:00:14.309> easy<00:00:14.490> because<00:00:14.759> it's<00:00:15.059> against<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
so it's easy because it's against the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.670 
so it's easy because it's against the
grain<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.770> mean<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:18.050> just<00:00:19.050> breaking<00:00:19.439> it

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
grain it's I mean it's just breaking it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.450 
grain it's I mean it's just breaking it
off<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.400> not<00:00:20.580> really<00:00:20.880> carving<00:00:25.250> we<00:00:26.250> don't

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
off it's not really carving we don't

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:39.970 
off it's not really carving we don't
need<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.539> I'm<00:00:28.289> gonna<00:00:28.730> be<00:00:29.730> chopped<00:00:30.090> off

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.340 

as<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.640> mentioned<00:00:41.030> earlier<00:00:42.640> it's

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.759 

this<00:00:49.250> is<00:00:49.460> not<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.329> right<00:00:50.570> size<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:51.410> that

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
this is not to the right size so that

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.180 
this is not to the right size so that
would<00:00:52.070> be<00:00:52.250> a<00:00:53.500> little<00:00:54.500> smaller<00:00:54.949> than<00:00:56.620> what<00:00:57.620> this

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
would be a little smaller than what this

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.930 
would be a little smaller than what this
would<00:00:58.370> be<00:00:58.640> in<00:00:58.969> a<00:00:59.149> normal<00:00:59.620> situation<00:01:00.940> let's

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
would be in a normal situation let's

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:17.270 
would be in a normal situation let's
look<00:01:02.210> at<00:01:02.359> that<00:01:02.510> here<00:01:02.750> again

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:36.090 

I'm<00:01:17.850> gonna<00:01:18.090> take<00:01:18.300> this<00:01:18.450> out

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.370

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.120 

and<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.490> indicated

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.010 

they<00:01:47.939> started<00:01:48.630> cutting<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:50.630> didn't<00:01:51.630> come

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
they started cutting it and didn't come

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.480 
they started cutting it and didn't come
out<00:01:52.079> all<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> way<00:01:52.649> through<00:01:54.649> gonna<00:01:55.649> chop<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:24.890 

and<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> other<00:02:00.060> side<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.600> well

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:41.290 

the<00:02:25.500> piece

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.759 

okay<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.360> at<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.780> point<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:45.420> almost<00:02:45.570> have

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
okay so at this point you almost have

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.280 
okay so at this point you almost have
pattern<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.670> fits

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.270 

okay<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:54.110> now<00:02:54.290> basically<00:02:54.560> we<00:02:54.890> can<00:02:55.010> start

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
okay so now basically we can start

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.240 
okay so now basically we can start
carving<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.530> what<00:02:57.530> we're<00:02:57.680> going<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:57.829> do<00:02:57.980> first

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
carving and what we're going to do first

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.470 
carving and what we're going to do first
is<00:02:58.519> we're<00:02:58.730> going<00:02:58.879> to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.020

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
drawing few of the lines that we're

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.459
