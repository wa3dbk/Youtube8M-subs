 what we worked on cms focus 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.480
 in the integration of modifying elements 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.280

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.219

 they thought it was not possible that 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.469
 I'll teach you how to do it. 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.689
 vestibular result 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.670
 My gosh, no, not to kick it. 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.249
 No, I will not show you that 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.240
 even if you can get a good 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.939
 part of text 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.529
 Can you get a sense of what? 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.990
 some items may be talking 

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:25.999
 there are certain elements that already draw 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.789
 for the right or wrong c item as well 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:30.109
 Teacher, please, join me. 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.490
 the first thing we talked about 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.529
 semester on the element of 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.049
 partiality 

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:38.719
 What I say about everything, nothing at all 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.389
 no one ever ever went to extremes 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:41.749
 he suspects that this is a statement 

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:43.939
 wrong 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:46.569
 the ease it already pulls to something right 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.799
 possible and probable some 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.579
 very common elements of being in 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.469
 English 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.969
 but I want you to understand people who 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.549
 it 's not a thing that has all the items 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.009
 it may appear in the 30 items only 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.810
 you can know the 10 but when the 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.060
 mds that does not look only language 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.549
 foreigner seems in the test as a whole 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.669
 you already have an idea of the answer does 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.780
 It makes sense, I'll show you now. 

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:11.270
 statistically boot on the move 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.970
 following partiality he does not 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.810
 extreme quality it's extremist everything 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.209
 and nothing like that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.209
 That's very strong, so I'm going to tell 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.610
 you flu kills big opa blanket 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.849
 generalization care influenza can kill the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.550
 can head shot machine not kill 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.319
 head shot can kill is not the same 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.489
 influenza property but it is a 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.330
 probability that gives an idea of 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.459
 facility 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.530
 so tell them you're aware of these 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.540
 elements in their proof as a whole in the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.709
 part of writing that pulls a reality 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.140
 totality 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.099
 You think this does not make sense. 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.170
 accompanies me I'll show 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.370
 you 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.440
 statistically speaking the singer caught 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.540
 several vestibulares from the past and 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.190
 quit selecting items have here who 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.900
 want to follow, you can check the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.690
 vestibular and won only in the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.180
 feedback accompanying me here resolution 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.890
 So people look, I just see with me then 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.099
 what are you talking about first 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.230
 I understand, what's up, guys? 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.760
 nor in the extremes what pulls 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.819
 the extremes so let's go 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.420
 in fact everything always never everything nothing 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.680
 or none certainly pulled extreme in 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.390
 day being wrong facility can 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.140
 Some do not even talk, everyone is like that. 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.260
 very strong 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.880
 some are like that, it's quite different 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.250
 Look what I'm talking about now, let's go. 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.930
 there want months are quite common foods to 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.299
 English test on interpretation page 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.100
 who give idea of ​​peace the unit meets 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.590
 chooses a little disdain with which in the middle 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.660
 the tendency of incidence to be certain 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.880
 looks at either the right public disk or 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.160
 more have buried it and clear text 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.290
 can bring evidence that you find 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.600
 it but the trend is statistically 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.910
 showing that a past testimony and 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.120
 have a day be certain is not that it goes 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.880
 be but already 90% sure that the item 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.769
 hello more items with whom in the middle of the 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.430
 people look at you so much people look at you so much 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.769
 the most certain the partiality it pulls 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.630
 pro except the teacher but will 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.530
 appears too much may be so it is 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.350
 very little 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.780
 look at 2005 oil so much elements 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.010
 of bias that appeared in 11 items 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.220
 and Guido had to talk about the myth of 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.389
 Cave pulls, yes, this is not going to happen. 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.019
 For God's sake, remember that you can not. 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.299
 miss 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.610
 but if you were to kick those items 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.490
 that the tendency is to 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.400
 quality with insistently all of them 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.960
 certain elements of partiality 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.500
 remembering that they are not the words of hello 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.360
 mind but the idea that the statement brings 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.120
 an idea of ​​partiality tends to 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.130
 being right and wrong tends to be right 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.699
 so much money that has already appeared with 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.490
 the general trend of these items is 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.110
 they are right, look, it did not appear 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.050
 no, I did not but I did not find 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.030
 I looked, it may seem, yes, it can. 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.190
 to have been wrong but look at the 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.380
 item with sam he was right 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.750
 not only because of blood but the idea 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.780
 of bias does not generalize 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.389
 here looks almost bigger than the guys look at you 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.530
 theologian both items looks both 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:12.020
 items galera ó means everything everything ne 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.090
 monster most galera tip for you guys 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.669
 everything is very strong when you make a 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.639
 majority business is not a totality but 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.889
 It's an exaggeration if you speak all 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.110
 world but not all college entrance exams 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.410
 world is not very strong, right? 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.300
 most do not very much soup many students 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.370
 will make vestibular unb most 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.510
 by majority of students what the total 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.460
 students that we have for example in 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.990
 Brasilia to know that most do 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.210
 so be careful with the idea of 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.580
 generalization or exaggeration 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.710
 many will see the football game in the 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.229
 Brazil stadiums sim 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.419
 the majority women 50% plus one 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.349
 then the trend of an item with 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:53.270
 The whole thing is wrong the nice but it has 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.409
 one certain he is right because the text 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.669
 which gave evidence 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.130
 I'm telling you that the 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.260
 this trend is always looking for 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.080
 elements exaggeration generalization of 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.330
 extreme at the time just are not born is neither 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.430
 anywhere or nowhere nothing 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.630
 gentlemen, you look at the elements already 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.220
 negativity 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.770
 look at the second one that he says is 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.720
 that it is permissible for the different 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.240
 African artistic trends have 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.039
 nothing in common they have at least 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.990
 one thing in common is African and the 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:24.080
 itself has also stated the 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.099
 of these items is to be wrong most 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.830
 trend 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:30.199
 hello to the show never ever never never 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.260
 say never ever say the philosopher one day 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.180
 drinking galley looks at so much elements 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.570
 that you find in various items to 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:41.180
 most of these items wrong the whole 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.110
 she pulls the item to be wrong guys and 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.030
 is the last 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.070
 not less important 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.460
 had not dropped ball of the two of those 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.980
 elements two items or law only soil 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.840
 law for those who do not know is a synonym 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.940
 only gives us an idea of limiting our 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.160
 when one appears only in item 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.260
 I suspect this item is wrong 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.530
 looks so much said that appeared the 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:06.320
 Most items are wrong 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.390
 So summarizing to you, she says 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.400
 An hour of fox in your head is 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.260
 desperate search for an element of 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.540
 totality binary chat gives a tip 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.100
 there are items of this here who want to give a 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.650
 then they will receive 80 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.510
 nor did he need to read the text the way 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.830
 he states is so extreme organized that 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.900
 not making sense as an engineer 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.610
 civil society has several differences that 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.010
 read the text responds clearly that you do not 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.980
 will do this look at the text but wait 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.900
 look for element found mark you 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.490
 have a notion and remember if this applies to 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.620
 proof as a whole portuguese history
