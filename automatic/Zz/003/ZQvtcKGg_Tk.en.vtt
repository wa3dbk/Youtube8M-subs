00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 good after the investigation that 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.950
 did c5n it's like the neighbors 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.420
 they took knowledge of what was 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.940
 happening in the neighborhood inside the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.960
 jail mainly first I want 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.139
 say that this is not a meeting 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.330
 politics or anything against the government are 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.740
 what we ask is security for example 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.270
 Here we were lucky that he came with the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.730
 two commissioners saw us speak and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.070
 tell us to count on your support 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.449
 not everything but there is no staff and if there is not 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.730
 personal means that from above 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.500
 you have to send us here, there is no 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.300
 a policeman we are three thousand people in 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.239
 one block that the towers are not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.710
 there is a police officer and then the whole world 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.899
 continuously counting the stamps that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.370
 happen can not currently sustain 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.140
 lady that with that meeting of 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.480
 when one walks the streets of the park 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.969
 patricians with total insecurity this 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 tomorrow I was coming for the convocation that 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.910
 We did the neighbors spend some ladies 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.920
 with some drums of water that you are going 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.840
 going they say we are from across 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 from jail says there's a girl 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.129
 pregnant we want us 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.809
 respect our rights but also 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.379
 those people are living in conditions 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.670
 subhuman and are producing 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.420
 diseases to all the people of the neighborhood 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.700
 his mother 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 to the great insecurity that we have not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 can walk with the grandchildren with the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 children one goes down from work from the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.549
 collective and it has to look like a stop 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.590
 because here in these places neither here nor in 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.720
 the ameghino park with all the history 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880
 and with all the principles that we had 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.229
 the neighbors of all life do not 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.060
 we have to take care of each other but 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.490
 we can not cope now they are very boys 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 you guys you saw them madam yes 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.979
 I've seen them are middle-aged 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.590
 they are young but it is a shame 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.319
 the lady said the insecurity see them 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.479
 thrown in the street 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:45.149
 smoking paco inclusive has already left by 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.190
 television and not just one one wants 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.069
 walk because patricio the square does not 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 can can not even go with fear going 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.229
 very scared I go with a lot of fear to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.229
 thousand corner of my house they grabbed me from 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.750
 neck they covered my mouth they stole me and 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.399
 good and so on to many 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.259
 neighbors let's go flying with the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.140
 testimony of another neighbor because today 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.430
 you saw something in front of your house I live it 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.260
 in front of the prison and unfortunately 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.659
 in the hours that we go back to work 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.879
 we can not even take out the garbage 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.819
 On Sundays it's no man's land they're 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:24.230
 all and they are not young there are of all 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.640
 the ages female men are drunk 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.560
 getting drunk on the avenue bothers 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.989
 those who pass steal this to all 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.489
 neighbors or the lady rome and they get 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.799
 quickly to jail and mind 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.359
 disappear inside the prison every time 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.579
 there are more people it is as if they will summon 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:48.030
 full bands are five or ten 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.889
 young people or people of both sexes in 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.400
 this moment did a little while when it came 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:55.049
 the call had three people 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.169
 drunk bothering neighbors in the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.530
 avenue and I was calling 911 for 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:04.019
 power to get it right and here 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.329
 we are on nards in a worker 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.269
 from the hospital garraham good lady you 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.620
 he also encounters insecurity 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.230
 permanently if we what 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.329
 we come to ask is that please someone 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.980
 people take charge of this situation 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.140
 the neighborhood has to live not survive 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.319
 has the right to enjoy a place and 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.819
 We the people who come to work 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.099
 we have to go back to our homes with 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.650
 security someone has to be done 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.450
 one of the situation 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.730
 knocks doors and can not find them and 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.769
 has to do this kind of measures that 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.870
 we do not like to have its high number of 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.510
 claws with the workers also this 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.000
 they live it daily with not just one case 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.280
 I cry if there is insecurity 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.379
 people who come to work who come by 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.120
 a salary and he goes without his money because 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.739
 because there are people who come and steal them in 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.980
 the stops of the buses in the 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.560
 taxi stops or when you leave the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.299
 the garage of the hospital that despite 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.120
 that we have private security once 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.470
 that one leaves the hospital is already part 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.769
 of the security of the police of the 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.629
 federal federal lady you region has 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.459
 been commenting that he has written a 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.680
 letter on behalf of all 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.090
 neighbors and you are a teacher a long time ago 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.400
 time you live in patricios park 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.519
 We can share your letter first that 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.489
 I do not want to thank CNA for giving us 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.070
 this opportunity to be heard 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.350
 someone listen to us please is a 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.160
 situation 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.830
 we are immersed in a catastrophe 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.840
 plagued by total and absolute impunity the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.290
 insecurity has completely taken over 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.110
 of our city actually from all the 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.560
 country this is not for or against 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.800
 nobody but let's be realistic to the government 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.380
 the opposition to the police has been 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.900
 drained like water between your hands something 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.350
 as valuable as security is in the 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.890
 citizens the million dollar question is what 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:01.490
 do we want better said we demand 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.490
 security
