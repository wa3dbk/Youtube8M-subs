00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
continental capacity and then there's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.920 
continental capacity and then there's
Pearson<00:01:17.729> talking<00:01:18.000> about<00:01:18.119> ostriches<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
don't need answers to that question and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.710 
don't need answers to that question and
I<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.220> ostrich

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
I think you you you you are an ostrich

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.910 
I think you you you you are an ostrich
widely<00:01:24.720> regarded<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> best<00:01:25.439> manager

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
widely regarded as the best manager

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560 
widely regarded as the best manager
we've<00:01:26.040> had<00:01:26.220> since<00:01:26.430> Martin<00:01:26.850> O'Neill<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.360> here

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
we've had since Martin O'Neill was here

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.899 
we've had since Martin O'Neill was here
so<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> fan<00:01:29.549> base<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so I think a lot of the fan base is

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.999 
so I think a lot of the fan base is
really<00:01:30.570> disappointed<00:01:31.170> seemed<00:01:31.380> leave<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
really disappointed seemed leave and

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.350 
really disappointed seemed leave and
while<00:01:32.310> they<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> sort<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> infrastructure

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
while they have a sort of infrastructure

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
while they have a sort of infrastructure
and<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> squad<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.130> cope<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and and the squad to to cope in the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.980 
and and the squad to to cope in the
Premier<00:01:35.909> League<00:01:35.939> they'll<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.600> hoping<00:01:36.810> to
