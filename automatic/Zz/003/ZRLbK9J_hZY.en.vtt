00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I tried this before because he is no

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.710 
I tried this before because he is no
harder<00:01:26.670> than<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> other<00:01:27.030> job<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.390> fact<00:01:27.600> he

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
harder than the other job in fact he

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560 
harder than the other job in fact he

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
might even be easier the reason i panted

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.999 
might even be easier the reason i panted
those<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.170> doubted<00:01:31.439> her<00:01:31.619> college
