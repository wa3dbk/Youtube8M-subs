00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
all the enemies and then as soon as one

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.570

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
of them gets close enough it just blows

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.309 
of them gets close enough it just blows
up<00:02:28.930> probably<00:02:29.930> kills<00:02:30.200> them<00:02:30.379> who<00:02:30.980> knows<00:02:32.260> if<00:02:33.260> that

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
that we all kind of knew that since the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.560 
that we all kind of knew that since the
story<00:04:43.400> fact<00:04:43.580> was<00:04:43.699> taking<00:04:44.000> place<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.330> Bludhaven

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
but it's great to see like an official

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.159 
but it's great to see like an official
confirmation<00:04:49.580> of<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.810> fact<00:04:51.080> that

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
confirmation of that and the fact that

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.320

he won't be fighting alongside us due to

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.570 
he won't be fighting alongside us due to
some<00:04:53.660> reason<00:04:54.080> but<00:04:54.530> we're<00:04:54.710> gonna<00:04:54.860> actually<00:04:55.160> be

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580

she's holding another gadget now I'm not
entirely<00:05:07.400> sure<00:05:07.669> if<00:05:07.820> it's<00:05:07.970> that<00:05:08.150> gadget<00:05:08.600> that

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
entirely sure if it's that gadget that

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.050 
entirely sure if it's that gadget that
she's<00:05:08.900> holding<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.740> makes<00:05:10.039> that<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.789> Green

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
she's holding that makes that the Green

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.640 
she's holding that makes that the Green
Smoke<00:05:11.300> in<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.660> background<00:05:12.050> that's<00:05:12.229> obviously

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
Smoke in the background that's obviously

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.070 
Smoke in the background that's obviously
pretty<00:05:13.400> much<00:05:13.639> like<00:05:13.940> it<00:05:14.180> seems<00:05:14.810> like<00:05:14.870> it's

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
pretty much like it seems like it's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.270 
pretty much like it seems like it's
probably<00:05:15.199> killing<00:05:15.560> these<00:05:15.770> dudes<00:05:15.949> because<00:05:16.130> if

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
probably killing these dudes because if

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.029 
probably killing these dudes because if
we<00:05:16.430> remember<00:05:16.520> how<00:05:16.970> Joker's<00:05:17.630> like<00:05:17.780> toxin<00:05:18.740> works

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039
