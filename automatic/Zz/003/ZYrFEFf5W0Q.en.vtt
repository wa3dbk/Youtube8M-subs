vessels out a little bit sooner and
that's<00:02:57.310> we'll<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:58.180> if<00:02:58.240> that<00:02:58.300> economic<00:02:58.840> switch

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
that's we'll see if that economic switch

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.290 
that's we'll see if that economic switch
pays<00:02:59.890> mental<00:03:00.340> did<00:03:00.520> get<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.760> spot<00:03:00.970> off<00:03:01.090> he<00:03:01.210> is

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
pays mental did get the spot off he is

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.790 
pays mental did get the spot off he is
going<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.540> see<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.720> factory<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.530> think<00:03:02.620> he

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
going to see the factory so I think he

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.230 
going to see the factory so I think he
is<00:03:02.920> going<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.160> be<00:03:03.220> prepared<00:03:03.490> for<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.820> and

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
is going to be prepared for this and

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.000 
is going to be prepared for this and
keep<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.540> mind<00:03:04.750> really<00:03:05.110> doesn't<00:03:05.530> have<00:03:05.620> any

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
keep in mind really doesn't have any

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.890 
keep in mind really doesn't have any
spot<00:03:06.400> at<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.000> moment<00:03:07.300> so<00:03:07.330> men<00:03:07.570> soul<00:03:07.720> might

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
spot at the moment so men soul might

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.300 
spot at the moment so men soul might
have<00:03:08.050> an<00:03:08.170> opportunity<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.680> deny<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.040> scout

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
have an opportunity to deny the scout

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.280 
have an opportunity to deny the scout
entirely<00:03:09.850> too<00:03:10.360> really<00:03:10.660> although<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.080> looks

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
entirely too really although it looks

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.930 
entirely too really although it looks
like<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.740> think<00:03:12.070> that's<00:03:12.280> really<00:03:12.460> Scout<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
like I think that's really Scout in the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.030 
like I think that's really Scout in the
upper<00:03:13.120> right<00:03:13.240> hand<00:03:13.330> corner<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:14.680> bi<00:03:14.830> that

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
upper right hand corner of the bi that

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.800 
upper right hand corner of the bi that
is<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.310> moving<00:03:16.000> around<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.450> looks<00:03:16.600> like<00:03:16.690> it's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
is it moving around it looks like it's

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.910 
is it moving around it looks like it's
going<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.960> come<00:03:17.080> across<00:03:17.260> men's<00:03:17.560> souls<00:03:17.710> base

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
going to come across men's souls base

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.770 
going to come across men's souls base
last<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.370> if<00:03:18.460> mental<00:03:18.730> can<00:03:18.880> get<00:03:19.030> three<00:03:19.270> two<00:03:19.630> or

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
last so if mental can get three two or

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.330 
last so if mental can get three two or
four<00:03:19.930> zerglings<00:03:20.350> out<00:03:20.500> you'll<00:03:20.950> have<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.160> good

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
old too quick to hatch tech here from

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.010 
old too quick to hatch tech here from
mental<00:03:24.790> seeing<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.150> factory<00:03:25.600> down<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:25.960> I

that quick tech route he's not going to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.410 
that quick tech route he's not going to
be<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.680> good<00:03:29.800> position<00:03:29.950> Oh<00:03:30.250> quick<00:03:30.550> quick

it to hatch lurk against this and I like

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.920 
it to hatch lurk against this and I like
that<00:03:36.370> option<00:03:36.580> because<00:03:37.030> first<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.840> all

detection<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.470> going<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.740> very<00:03:38.950> limited

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
detection is going to be very limited

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.370 
detection is going to be very limited
going<00:03:39.910> across<00:03:40.210> the<00:03:40.450> factory<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.840> don't<00:03:41.140> think

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
going across the factory I don't think

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.600 
going across the factory I don't think
that<00:03:41.620> really<00:03:41.860> is<00:03:41.920> going<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.100> be<00:03:42.190> upgrading

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
that really is going to be upgrading

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.190 
that really is going to be upgrading
mines<00:03:42.820> right<00:03:43.060> off<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.360> bat<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:44.020> his

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
mines right off the bat with his

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.500 
mines right off the bat with his
vultures<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:45.670> engineering<00:03:46.120> days<00:03:46.270> going<00:03:46.450> to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
vultures the engineering days going to

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.120 
vultures the engineering days going to
end<00:03:46.660> up<00:03:46.720> coming<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.050> lot<00:03:47.170> later<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
end up coming a lot later and the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.199 
end up coming a lot later and the
Academy<00:03:48.580> is<00:03:48.640> going<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.820> come<00:03:48.940> home<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.120> lot

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
Academy is going to come home a lot

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.550 
Academy is going to come home a lot
later<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:49.510> think<00:03:49.720> he's<00:03:49.840> depending<00:03:50.200> on<00:03:50.200> denying

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
later I think he's depending on denying

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.230 
later I think he's depending on denying
that<00:03:50.709> Scout<00:03:51.010> however<00:03:51.340> he's<00:03:51.820> not<00:03:51.880> gonna<00:03:52.180> be

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
that Scout however he's not gonna be

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.970 
that Scout however he's not gonna be
able<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.480> deny<00:03:52.570> that<00:03:52.750> scout<00:03:53.080> at<00:03:53.560> this<00:03:53.740> stage

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
able to deny that scout at this stage

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.560 
able to deny that scout at this stage
and<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.250> really<00:03:54.700> is<00:03:54.850> going<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.120> be<00:03:55.180> able<00:03:55.270> to<00:03:55.420> see

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
and I really is going to be able to see

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.420 
and I really is going to be able to see
this<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.870> hatch<00:03:56.050> rebuild<00:03:56.470> coming<00:03:56.860> so<00:03:57.280> I<00:03:57.310> think

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
this to hatch rebuild coming so I think

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.880 
this to hatch rebuild coming so I think
you<00:03:57.640> will<00:03:57.760> be<00:03:57.940> able<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.150> adapt<00:03:58.540> so<00:03:59.110> which<00:03:59.860> is

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
you will be able to adapt so which is

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.470 
you will be able to adapt so which is
unfortunate<00:04:00.520> but<00:04:00.610> at<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.790> very<00:04:00.820> least<00:04:01.000> even

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
unfortunate but at the very least even

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.699 
unfortunate but at the very least even
going<00:04:01.720> up<00:04:01.810> against<00:04:02.110> this<00:04:02.200> he's<00:04:02.380> going<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.590> lose

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
going up against this he's going to lose

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.220 
going up against this he's going to lose
a<00:04:02.980> degree<00:04:03.490> of<00:04:03.520> map<00:04:03.760> control<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.840> going<00:04:05.110> quick

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
a degree of map control and going quick

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.020 
a degree of map control and going quick
tech<00:04:05.470> he's<00:04:05.620> not<00:04:05.800> going<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:05.980> be<00:04:06.100> in<00:04:06.280> as<00:04:06.490> dominant

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
tech he's not going to be in as dominant

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.940 
tech he's not going to be in as dominant
up<00:04:07.150> position<00:04:07.510> well<00:04:08.230> actually<00:04:08.380> no<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.680> take<00:04:08.890> it

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
up position well actually no I take it

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.020 
up position well actually no I take it
back<00:04:09.040> he's<00:04:09.310> going<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.520> take<00:04:09.640> his<00:04:09.700> command

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
back he's going to take his command

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.120 
back he's going to take his command
center<00:04:10.240> alongside<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.930> upgrade<00:04:11.590> mines<00:04:11.860> it

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
center alongside and upgrade mines it

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.280 
center alongside and upgrade mines it
looks<00:04:12.310> like<00:04:12.490> with<00:04:13.060> those<00:04:13.209> vultures<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:14.020> try<00:04:14.230> to

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
looks like with those vultures to try to

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.800 
looks like with those vultures to try to
cap<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:15.610> actually<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.299> two<00:04:16.510> hatchery

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
cap this so actually the two hatchery

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.030 
cap this so actually the two hatchery
build<00:04:16.989> getting<00:04:17.260> caught<00:04:17.470> a<00:04:17.500> little<00:04:17.739> bit<00:04:17.920> in

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
build getting caught a little bit in

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.060 
build getting caught a little bit in
this<00:04:18.250> maybe<00:04:18.940> he<00:04:19.150> can<00:04:19.270> do<00:04:19.650> potentially<00:04:20.650> he

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
this maybe he can do potentially he

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.760 
this maybe he can do potentially he
could<00:04:21.100> still<00:04:21.520> put<00:04:21.700> down

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
could still put down

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.430 
could still put down
a<00:04:23.330> do-good<00:04:24.330> quick<00:04:24.569> switch<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.229> looks<00:04:25.379> like

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
a do-good quick switch and it looks like

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.600 
a do-good quick switch and it looks like
he's<00:04:25.620> getting<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.919> creep<00:04:26.099> colony<00:04:26.370> up<00:04:26.460> now

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
he's getting that creep colony up now

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.309 
he's getting that creep colony up now
maybe<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.300> could<00:04:27.419> do<00:04:27.509> a<00:04:27.539> quick<00:04:27.810> switcher<00:04:28.139> tech

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
maybe you could do a quick switcher tech

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.170 
maybe you could do a quick switcher tech
but<00:04:28.500> honestly<00:04:28.800> once<00:04:29.460> you're<00:04:29.639> kind<00:04:29.879> of<00:04:30.000> caught

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
but honestly once you're kind of caught

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.309 
but honestly once you're kind of caught
with<00:04:30.360> this<00:04:30.479> you<00:04:30.599> just<00:04:30.720> got<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.960> kind<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.139> roll

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
with this you just got to kind of roll

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.379 
with this you just got to kind of roll
with<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:32.430> vulture<00:04:32.639> needing<00:04:32.970> plant<00:04:33.210> mind

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
with it that vulture needing plant mind

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.520 
with it that vulture needing plant mind
sound<00:04:33.599> I<00:04:33.690> think<00:04:33.900> really<00:04:34.080> just<00:04:34.379> with<00:04:34.470> that

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
sound I think really just with that

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.680 
sound I think really just with that
Scout<00:04:34.919> has<00:04:35.099> taken<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.639> match<00:04:35.879> he's<00:04:36.449> got<00:04:36.599> that

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
Scout has taken this match he's got that

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.300 
Scout has taken this match he's got that
vulture<00:04:36.930> alongside<00:04:37.259> as<00:04:37.560> well<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.860> try<00:04:38.009> to<00:04:38.069> pin

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
vulture alongside as well to try to pin

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.100 
vulture alongside as well to try to pin
in<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.699> assumed<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.330> pin<00:04:39.479> in<00:04:39.569> his<00:04:39.659> ratings<00:04:39.960> or<00:04:40.050> at

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
in I assumed a pin in his ratings or at

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.809 
in I assumed a pin in his ratings or at
least<00:04:40.229> get<00:04:40.379> a<00:04:40.409> spot<00:04:40.680> out<00:04:40.830> when<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.580> rest<00:04:41.759> the

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
least get a spot out when the rest the

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.899 
least get a spot out when the rest the
units<00:04:42.060> are<00:04:42.150> coming<00:04:42.389> across<00:04:42.979> but<00:04:43.979> mind<00:04:44.159> soul<00:04:44.400> I

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
units are coming across but mind soul I

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.670 
units are coming across but mind soul I
think<00:04:45.509> mines<00:04:45.720> will<00:04:45.870> really<00:04:46.050> be<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.199> key<00:04:46.440> in<00:04:46.470> here

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
think mines will really be a key in here

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.140 
think mines will really be a key in here
inland<00:04:46.949> that<00:04:47.099> looks<00:04:47.310> like<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.490> second<00:04:47.789> factory

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
inland that looks like a second factory

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.119 
inland that looks like a second factory
yeah<00:04:48.330> second<00:04:48.659> factory<00:04:48.960> going<00:04:49.199> down<00:04:49.349> so<00:04:49.919> really

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
yeah second factory going down so really

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.430 
yeah second factory going down so really
going<00:04:50.729> for<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.030> factory-built<00:04:51.900> maybe<00:04:52.199> going

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
going for a factory-built maybe going

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.290 
going for a factory-built maybe going
for<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.650> fantasy<00:04:52.949> route<00:04:53.220> here<00:04:53.460> go<00:04:54.270> into

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
for the fantasy route here go into

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.270 
for the fantasy route here go into
Valkyries<00:04:54.870> here<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:55.080> like<00:04:55.380> seeing<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:55.770> mix<00:04:56.130> up

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
Valkyries here I like seeing this mix up

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.680 
Valkyries here I like seeing this mix up
and<00:04:56.430> tear<00:04:56.580> and<00:04:56.610> play<00:04:56.849> that<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.240> shift<00:04:57.419> towards

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
and tear and play that the shift towards

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.300 
and tear and play that the shift towards
mech<00:04:57.870> actually<00:04:58.530> called<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.770> shift<00:04:59.039> towards

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
mech actually called the shift towards

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.649 
mech actually called the shift towards
Frank<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.699> really<00:04:59.909> long<00:05:00.060> time<00:05:00.090> ago<00:05:00.360> and

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
Frank a really long time ago and

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.210 
Frank a really long time ago and
completely<00:05:00.990> incorrectly<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:01.889> was<00:05:02.009> kind<00:05:02.190> of

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
completely incorrectly it was kind of

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.589 
completely incorrectly it was kind of
country<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.580> specific<00:05:03.090> but<00:05:03.240> when<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:03.449> get

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
country is specific but when you get

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.899 
country is specific but when you get
that<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:04.409> gas<00:05:04.620> established<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:05.610> works<00:05:05.789> out

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
that to gas established it works out

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.610 
that to gas established it works out
really<00:05:06.060> well<00:05:06.150> single<00:05:06.930> hydrolyse<00:05:07.319> trying<00:05:07.560> to

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
really well single hydrolyse trying to

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.230 
really well single hydrolyse trying to
work<00:05:07.770> down<00:05:07.889> that<00:05:08.099> vulture<00:05:08.280> not<00:05:08.490> able<00:05:08.669> to<00:05:08.849> or

here pushing out to deal with some of
those<00:05:15.240> vultures<00:05:15.509> and<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:16.139> looks<00:05:16.319> like<00:05:16.380> yeah<00:05:16.650> at

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
those vultures and it looks like yeah at

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.260 
those vultures and it looks like yeah at
first<00:05:16.860> I'm<00:05:17.430> curious<00:05:17.639> if<00:05:17.849> that's<00:05:18.000> going<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.180> be

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
first I'm curious if that's going to be

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.240 
first I'm curious if that's going to be
speed<00:05:18.509> first<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:18.900> assume<00:05:19.199> not<00:05:19.380> gotta<00:05:19.949> go<00:05:20.099> with

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
speed first I assume not gotta go with

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.649 
speed first I assume not gotta go with
the<00:05:20.280> mines<00:05:20.520> first<00:05:20.819> but<00:05:21.300> if<00:05:21.419> there's<00:05:21.569> an

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
the mines first but if there's an

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.029 
the mines first but if there's an
overlord<00:05:21.990> in<00:05:22.110> position<00:05:22.469> which<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:22.770> looks<00:05:22.919> like

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
overlord in position which it looks like

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.619 
overlord in position which it looks like
there<00:05:23.190> might<00:05:23.310> be<00:05:23.370> oh<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:24.240> looks<00:05:24.419> like<00:05:24.539> the

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:24.629 
there might be oh it looks like the

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.059 
there might be oh it looks like the
vultures<00:05:24.930> able<00:05:25.169> to<00:05:25.229> sneak<00:05:25.409> down<00:05:25.620> for<00:05:25.860> really

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
vultures able to sneak down for really

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.129 
vultures able to sneak down for really
so<00:05:26.430> those<00:05:26.940> wow<00:05:27.270> that's<00:05:27.509> going<00:05:27.659> to<00:05:27.719> be<00:05:27.810> some<00:05:27.960> big

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
so those wow that's going to be some big

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.649 
so those wow that's going to be some big
economic<00:05:28.289> damage<00:05:28.889> early<00:05:29.509> absolutely<00:05:30.509> huge

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
economic damage early absolutely huge

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.180 
economic damage early absolutely huge

reeling he's only got a single vulture

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.510 
reeling he's only got a single vulture
to<00:05:34.139> try<00:05:34.380> to<00:05:34.440> assist<00:05:34.740> in<00:05:34.889> vultures<00:05:35.219> versus

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
hydralisk it's not a good combination

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.080 
hydralisk it's not a good combination
position<00:05:37.440> he<00:05:38.099> did<00:05:38.340> manage<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:38.610> get<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:38.759> bunker

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
position he did manage to get the bunker

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.249 
position he did manage to get the bunker
up<00:05:39.240> but<00:05:39.419> I<00:05:39.449> think<00:05:39.690> he's<00:05:39.810> only<00:05:39.930> got<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.110> single

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
up but I think he's only got a single

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.600 
up but I think he's only got a single
marine<00:05:40.469> in<00:05:40.710> there<00:05:40.830> are<00:05:40.889> a<00:05:40.919> lot<00:05:41.039> of<00:05:41.069> the<00:05:41.219> SUV's

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
marine in there are a lot of the SUV's

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.430 
marine in there are a lot of the SUV's
blink<00:05:41.880> down<00:05:42.060> so<00:05:42.509> economic<00:05:42.930> damage<00:05:43.169> working

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
blink down so economic damage working

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.809 
blink down so economic damage working
both<00:05:43.620> ways<00:05:43.830> we'll<00:05:43.979> see<00:05:44.130> if<00:05:44.190> those<00:05:44.279> hydraulics

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:44.819 
both ways we'll see if those hydraulics

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:46.610 
both ways we'll see if those hydraulics
just<00:05:45.090> decide<00:05:45.750> to<00:05:45.840> run<00:05:45.960> by<00:05:46.169> that<00:05:46.349> bunker

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
just decide to run by that bunker

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.719 
just decide to run by that bunker
doesn't<00:05:46.860> actually<00:05:47.099> it<00:05:47.310> looks<00:05:47.520> like<00:05:47.610> they're

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
doesn't actually it looks like they're

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.309 
doesn't actually it looks like they're
going<00:05:47.849> to<00:05:47.909> fully<00:05:48.090> engage<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.630> more<00:05:48.990> cities

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
going to fully engage it more cities

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:50.540 
going to fully engage it more cities
coming<00:05:49.529> up<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.680> line<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:49.919> bunkers<00:05:50.190> down<00:05:50.340> both

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
coming up to line the bunkers down both

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.040 
coming up to line the bunkers down both
Marines<00:05:50.819> killed<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:51.150> it<00:05:51.719> looks<00:05:51.840> like<00:05:51.900> the

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
Marines killed and it looks like the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.260 
Marines killed and it looks like the
hydraulics<00:05:52.500> continuing<00:05:53.069> to<00:05:53.159> push<00:05:53.340> in<00:05:53.550> so<00:05:53.789> wow

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
hydraulics continuing to push in so wow

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.120 
hydraulics continuing to push in so wow
really<00:05:54.539> taking<00:05:54.900> some<00:05:55.080> hits<00:05:55.259> early<00:05:55.500> men<00:05:55.889> souls

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
really taking some hits early men souls

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.820 
really taking some hits early men souls
early<00:05:56.759> hydrolysed<00:05:57.569> field<00:05:57.779> actually<00:05:57.990> working

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
early hydrolysed field actually working

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.379 
early hydrolysed field actually working
out<00:05:58.949> very<00:05:58.979> well<00:05:59.340> for<00:05:59.520> him<00:05:59.849> against<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:00.300> because

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
out very well for him against it because

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.879 
out very well for him against it because
again<00:06:00.659> just<00:06:00.870> vultures<00:06:01.259> there's<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.680> mines

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
again just vultures there's the mines

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.879 
again just vultures there's the mines
going<00:06:02.250> down<00:06:02.430> but<00:06:03.330> uh<00:06:03.360> looks<00:06:03.810> like<00:06:03.870> 10<00:06:04.229> nice

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
going down but uh looks like 10 nice

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.620 
going down but uh looks like 10 nice
mine<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.340> take<00:06:05.520> out<00:06:05.699> three<00:06:05.729> hydralisk<00:06:06.330> right

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
mine to take out three hydralisk right

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.300 
mine to take out three hydralisk right
there<00:06:06.840> that's<00:06:07.349> going<00:06:07.500> to<00:06:07.590> be<00:06:07.620> a<00:06:07.979> little<00:06:08.190> bit

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
there that's going to be a little bit

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.890 
there that's going to be a little bit
that's<00:06:08.580> going<00:06:08.789> to<00:06:08.849> help<00:06:08.940> really<00:06:09.270> out<00:06:09.389> a<00:06:09.419> lot<00:06:09.690> so

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
that's going to help really out a lot so

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.080 
that's going to help really out a lot so
now<00:06:09.990> just<00:06:10.139> a<00:06:10.319> single<00:06:10.529> hydralisk<00:06:11.090> otherwise

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
now just a single hydralisk otherwise

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.309 
now just a single hydralisk otherwise
but<00:06:12.419> that<00:06:12.690> could<00:06:12.810> have<00:06:12.900> been<00:06:12.960> a<00:06:13.020> lot<00:06:13.080> worse

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
but that could have been a lot worse

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:14.899 
but that could have been a lot worse
though<00:06:13.680> all<00:06:14.009> five<00:06:14.219> of<00:06:14.250> those<00:06:14.370> hydraulics

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
though all five of those hydraulics

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:16.249 
though all five of those hydraulics
remain<00:06:15.180> that<00:06:15.330> could<00:06:15.419> have<00:06:15.509> been<00:06:15.569> infinitely

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
remain that could have been infinitely

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.809 
remain that could have been infinitely
worse<00:06:16.560> this<00:06:17.069> is<00:06:17.159> going<00:06:17.279> to<00:06:17.340> give<00:06:17.460> them<00:06:17.550> time<00:06:17.669> to

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
worse this is going to give them time to

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.040 
worse this is going to give them time to
at<00:06:17.909> least<00:06:18.000> get<00:06:18.150> a<00:06:18.210> couple<00:06:18.509> more<00:06:18.539> troops<00:06:18.870> out

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
at least get a couple more troops out

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.350 
at least get a couple more troops out
but<00:06:19.710> mental<00:06:20.069> in<00:06:20.219> a<00:06:20.279> very<00:06:20.610> strong<00:06:20.909> actually

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
but mental in a very strong actually

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.089 
but mental in a very strong actually
economic<00:06:21.870> position<00:06:22.319> here<00:06:22.529> because<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.919> good

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
economic position here because the good

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:24.950 
economic position here because the good
catching<00:06:23.729> basically<00:06:24.120> really<00:06:24.360> in<00:06:24.449> a<00:06:24.509> tech<00:06:24.719> ship

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
catching basically really in a tech ship

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.019 
catching basically really in a tech ship
armory<00:06:25.770> down<00:06:25.949> now<00:06:26.159> to<00:06:26.219> try<00:06:26.490> to<00:06:26.610> produce<00:06:26.759> some

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:27.029 
armory down now to try to produce some

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.399 
armory down now to try to produce some
Goliath<00:06:27.419> I<00:06:27.509> soon<00:06:27.690> yeah<00:06:27.840> there's<00:06:28.050> a<00:06:28.080> Goliath

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
Goliath I soon yeah there's a Goliath

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.290 
Goliath I soon yeah there's a Goliath
right<00:06:28.590> now<00:06:28.740> so<00:06:29.219> Goliath<00:06:29.550> versus<00:06:29.849> hydralisk

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
right now so Goliath versus hydralisk

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.779 
right now so Goliath versus hydralisk
which<00:06:30.630> honestly<00:06:31.199> the<00:06:31.529> hydraulics<00:06:32.039> depends<00:06:32.699> on

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
which honestly the hydraulics depends on

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.010 
which honestly the hydraulics depends on
range<00:06:32.969> it<00:06:33.120> looks<00:06:33.240> like<00:06:33.360> they<00:06:33.449> do<00:06:33.570> have<00:06:33.779> range

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
range it looks like they do have range

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.510 
range it looks like they do have range
and<00:06:34.259> they're<00:06:34.409> outnumbering<00:06:34.889> here

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
and they're outnumbering here

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.520 
and they're outnumbering here
and<00:06:35.910> some<00:06:36.150> SUVs<00:06:36.330> coming<00:06:36.870> off<00:06:36.960> the<00:06:37.050> line<00:06:37.229> for

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
and some SUVs coming off the line for

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.900 
and some SUVs coming off the line for
really<00:06:37.770> to<00:06:37.860> try<00:06:38.009> to<00:06:38.069> defend<00:06:38.370> against<00:06:38.639> this<00:06:38.729> is

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
really to try to defend against this is

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.040 
really to try to defend against this is
what<00:06:39.060> I<00:06:39.120> was<00:06:39.210> talking<00:06:39.330> about<00:06:39.479> mental<00:06:39.870> with

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
what I was talking about mental with

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.779 
what I was talking about mental with
really<00:06:40.590> quick<00:06:40.860> really<00:06:41.340> good<00:06:41.610> with<00:06:41.759> the

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:41.789 
really quick really good with the

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:43.939 
really quick really good with the
adaptability<00:06:42.300> and<00:06:42.569> really<00:06:42.870> good<00:06:43.650> at<00:06:43.800> just

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949 
adaptability and really good at just

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.200 
adaptability and really good at just
kind<00:06:44.129> of<00:06:44.159> making<00:06:44.490> the<00:06:44.669> best<00:06:44.849> at<00:06:45.000> a<00:06:45.030> worse

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
kind of making the best at a worse

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.760 
kind of making the best at a worse
situation<00:06:45.389> things<00:06:45.930> like<00:06:46.080> this<00:06:46.229> for

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
situation things like this for

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.200 
situation things like this for
hydrolysis<00:06:47.280> working<00:06:47.580> back<00:06:47.759> against<00:06:48.060> the

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
hydrolysis working back against the

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.460 
hydrolysis working back against the
SUV's<00:06:48.569> just<00:06:48.750> trying<00:06:48.960> to<00:06:49.020> keep<00:06:49.139> them<00:06:49.289> off<00:06:49.440> the

SUV's just trying to keep them off the

more<00:07:03.810> hydralisk<00:07:04.199> stuff<00:07:04.500> gonna<00:07:04.979> take<00:07:05.190> and<00:07:05.310> this

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
more hydralisk stuff gonna take and this

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.860 
more hydralisk stuff gonna take and this
is<00:07:05.520> where<00:07:05.639> that<00:07:05.759> height<00:07:05.970> that<00:07:06.150> inverted<00:07:06.659> ramp

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
is where that height that inverted ramp

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.379 
is where that height that inverted ramp
really<00:07:07.139> playing<00:07:07.409> a<00:07:07.620> big<00:07:08.009> key<00:07:08.250> to<00:07:08.370> this<00:07:08.490> map<00:07:08.699> it

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389 
really playing a big key to this map it

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:10.879 
really playing a big key to this map it
looks<00:07:09.449> like<00:07:09.690> that<00:07:09.810> this<00:07:10.289> is<00:07:10.409> clever<00:07:10.680> actually

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
looks like that this is clever actually

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.080 
looks like that this is clever actually

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.130 
go down if those high posts doesn't look

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.020 
go down if those high posts doesn't look
like<00:07:32.250> they're<00:07:32.340> gonna<00:07:32.430> be<00:07:32.550> able<00:07:32.610> to<00:07:32.729> run<00:07:32.819> in<00:07:32.909> for

like they're gonna be able to run in for

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.369 
like they're gonna be able to run in for
a<00:07:33.060> pic<00:07:33.240> but<00:07:33.330> the<00:07:33.479> very<00:07:33.629> least<00:07:33.750> it's<00:07:33.990> burning

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:34.379 
a pic but the very least it's burning

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:36.050 
a pic but the very least it's burning
that's<00:07:34.830> more<00:07:35.039> resources<00:07:35.550> that<00:07:35.759> really<00:07:36.000> is

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.060 
that's more resources that really is

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.399 
that's more resources that really is
going<00:07:36.150> to<00:07:36.240> end<00:07:36.389> up<00:07:36.479> having<00:07:36.780> to<00:07:36.840> pour<00:07:37.080> into<00:07:37.229> this

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:37.409 
going to end up having to pour into this

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:40.159 
going to end up having to pour into this
really<00:07:37.860> in<00:07:38.039> a<00:07:38.099> very<00:07:38.430> bad<00:07:39.120> situation<00:07:39.479> here

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.169 
really in a very bad situation here

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.510

bringing<00:07:40.650> a<00:07:40.740> CB<00:07:41.009> as<00:07:41.219> you<00:07:41.310> can<00:07:41.400> see<00:07:41.490> just

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 
bringing a CB as you can see just

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.409 
bringing a CB as you can see just
doesn't<00:07:41.940> vary<00:07:42.120> no<00:07:42.690> se<00:07:42.990> V<00:07:43.110> saturation<00:07:43.289> speak<00:07:44.069> of

doesn't vary no se V saturation speak of
comparative<00:07:45.419> really<00:07:45.780> i<00:07:45.810> think<00:07:46.409> that's<00:07:46.710> still

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 
comparative really i think that's still

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:48.559 
comparative really i think that's still
just<00:07:46.949> one<00:07:47.310> st<00:07:47.550> v<00:07:47.669> on<00:07:47.789> gas<00:07:48.000> if<00:07:48.210> i<00:07:48.270> was<00:07:48.360> looking

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:48.569 
just one st v on gas if i was looking

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.420 
just one st v on gas if i was looking
that<00:07:48.659> maybe<00:07:48.870> two<00:07:49.139> I<00:07:49.349> didn't<00:07:50.039> get<00:07:50.099> a<00:07:50.159> really

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.430 
that maybe two I didn't get a really

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.370 
that maybe two I didn't get a really
good<00:07:50.460> long<00:07:50.729> look<00:07:50.909> at<00:07:51.060> that<00:07:51.210> but<00:07:51.719> the<00:07:51.990> factory

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 
good long look at that but the factory

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.719 
good long look at that but the factory
burning<00:07:52.680> down<00:07:52.770> the<00:07:52.919> hydel<00:07:53.219> escs<00:07:53.460> with<00:07:53.610> the

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729 
burning down the hydel escs with the

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.219 
burning down the hydel escs with the
height<00:07:53.849> advantage<00:07:54.029> going<00:07:54.449> to<00:07:54.539> have<00:07:54.630> it<00:07:54.900> with

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:55.229 
height advantage going to have it with

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:56.899 
height advantage going to have it with
that<00:07:55.349> mischance<00:07:56.099> advantage<00:07:56.460> really<00:07:56.729> going<00:07:56.849> to

00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:56.909 
that mischance advantage really going to

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.700 
that mischance advantage really going to
be<00:07:57.000> able<00:07:57.060> to<00:07:57.210> pour<00:07:57.419> into<00:07:57.539> that<00:07:57.690> well<00:07:57.900> so<00:07:58.469> really

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.710 
be able to pour into that well so really

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.490 
be able to pour into that well so really
is<00:07:58.770> going<00:07:58.860> to<00:07:58.949> have<00:07:59.039> to<00:07:59.159> really
