00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
we're going to take it for a bit of a

00:00:47.020 --> 00:01:03.850 
we're going to take it for a bit of a
spin

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.410 

the<00:01:04.860> big<00:01:05.040> feature<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.610> course<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.180> bike

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the big feature of course with this bike

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.749 
the big feature of course with this bike
is<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.869> thing<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.740> upgraded<00:01:08.280> engine<00:01:08.610> which

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
is this thing the upgraded engine which

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:09.800 
is this thing the upgraded engine which
is<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> little<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.330> bigger<00:01:09.509> than<00:01:09.659> its

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
is a little bit bigger than its

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.450 
is a little bit bigger than its
predecessor<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> course<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.280> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
predecessor and of course it's got this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.999 
predecessor and of course it's got this
fuel<00:01:11.909> injection<00:01:12.390> instead<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.810> carburation<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
fuel injection instead of carburation it

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.350 
fuel injection instead of carburation it
means<00:01:14.369> you're<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.700> slightly<00:01:14.880> crispa

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
means you're going to slightly crispa

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
means you're going to slightly crispa
throttle<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.869> slightly<00:01:16.680> better<00:01:16.920> fuel

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
throttle and slightly better fuel

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.430 
throttle and slightly better fuel
consumption<00:01:17.880> overall<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.840> engine<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> nice

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
consumption overall the engine is a nice

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.340 
consumption overall the engine is a nice
sharp<00:01:19.830> unit

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.010 

the<00:01:28.130> bike<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.490> surprisingly<00:01:29.299> like<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.810> throw

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
the bike you surprisingly like to throw

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.480 
the bike you surprisingly like to throw
around<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:30.560> it's<00:01:30.680> quite<00:01:30.830> good<00:01:31.040> in<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.250> city

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
around so it's quite good in the city

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.660 
around so it's quite good in the city
and<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:32.240> will<00:01:32.330> do<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.509> tour<00:01:32.810> all<00:01:33.530> up<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:34.070> lot<00:01:34.549> of

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and it will do a tour all up a lot of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:02:02.210 
and it will do a tour all up a lot of
value<00:01:35.000> for<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.240> money
