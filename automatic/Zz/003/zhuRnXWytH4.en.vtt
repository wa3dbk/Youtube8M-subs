00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello here suzanne leclerc of my 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.429
 virtual business point ca 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.650
 I wanted to watch with you two 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.349
 applications very useful for taking 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.599
 notes with your ipad 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 so if you are a professional in 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.789
 business or just someone 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.949
 who likes to take notes or even 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.630
 drawn two strong apps 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.460
 interesting and 2 application that you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.750
 also allows you to save your 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.910
 notes in the cloud or the cloud so the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.510
 advantage with these two applications note 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.250
 charles is huge that m they have some 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.110
 advantages and disadvantages but 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.850
 mainly these two excellent 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.420
 applications and it's up to you to decide 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.730
 and wherein where or which is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.260
 more interesting for you so in a 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.730
 first time let's look at our leader 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 I use by the way if luce gathemo 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.049
 bars an excellent stylus normally 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.010
 can get it 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.260
 the amazon shop and you have some 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.229
 different formats the thickness of this 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.150
 style us I took thicker stylus 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.259
 he is doing well in the mails but 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.580
 for that there are several of my 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.580
 colleagues who like the style is this one 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.130
 little bit more with notions you have 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.720
 different options you have an option 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.550
 still with a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.560
 with a fairly greasy point or a 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.000
 fine tip you have the choice to vary 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.940
 your points according to your 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.370
 preferences and you so you can 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.540
 settle your points you have different 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.640
 colors also you have a good 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.990
 color collection you feel 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.900
 a bit like if you have a box of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.500
 creo there in front of you so that's enough 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.550
 easy to write you will see that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.950
 it's the stylus slips very well me 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.760
 I find it particularly easy to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.869
 use in my opinion maybe it's 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.030
 the application that is easier to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.360
 write so 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.300
 so I prefer it because of it's 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.890
 agility or the way that the pen gets 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.400
 walk on the tablet without too much 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.540
 blood too many objects to change his method 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.530
 also benefit because 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.840
 we can also change the format 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.760
 do not see with it in creams and 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.030
 you can change to formula 1 6 point 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.519
 in very useful portrait format and you 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.320
 also have the protection for for 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.370
 the handles so could avoid 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.350
 to write do barbels in your 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.440
 hamburg nope with if you drop 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.060
 your your wrist on the table is 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.959
 so that's the number one application at 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.360
 CHUV 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.370
 the disadvantage is our leader it's 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.450
 that integration the backup of my 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.050
 notes is not done automatically 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.549
 so if I wanted to save the mines 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.530
 I will have to take an action 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.070
 very specific to be able to save 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.400
 mines 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.180
 so I'm going to have to 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.290
 to direct my notes 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.010
 that is, backup and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.690
 ask to be directed to the rented box 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:17.489
 via email or via my evernote account 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:20.340
 the second application while m you 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.959
 are our myth has it easy 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.519
 the tool to and from the other one suggests 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.299
 to use a world for life is a 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.420
 excellent excellent notepad very 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.280
 easy to write again 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.830
 we also can not have the choice of 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.230
 colors so that's wanting to see some 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.489
 designs change a little the color of the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.790
 drawing according to our interests or 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.230
 what we are trying to accomplish 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.890
 again the notes take enough 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.060
 easily 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:59.100
 I would say that the disadvantage is that 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:01.620
 the disadvantage scores being francon 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.620
 last the kids do not come as 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.069
 easily but the disadvantages is 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.150
 it looks like the slide is done 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.130
 less than bono that is to say that 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.419
 our leader 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.760
 yes a little see a little that 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.530
 format is smoother less well 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.850
 slightly less well it's not a big 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.910
 factor but that's also I would say 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.450
 it comes alive and less and number 2 I do not 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:41.120
 am not able to take notes 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:42.960
 in a in a landscape format so 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.419
 maybe not me who is aware 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.210
 but that's both of the benefits that 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:53.310
 I can see however the big advantage 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.729
 in my opinion it is for the reason for 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.530
 which I use I use penalty 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.150
 myth fairly regularly and 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:10.080
 recurrent big advantage but less 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:12.620
 an automatic synchronization at 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.620
 evernote 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.539
 amazing I do not even need to 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.000
 think but notes are automatically 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.220
 saved and the advantage and vernon 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.349
 is that I always have control over my 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.289
 notes so if exported but note a 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.840
 pdf have done and the second largest 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:37.099
 advantage and let's go back what my notes 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:42.060
 can be my notes are are 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:45.810
 digitized optimized to be able to have 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:54.210
 a text recognition so if I 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:56.780
 looking to see them came from 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.479
 recognize my writing by hand and 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.410
 recover my notes with handcuffs 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.530
 which you will see a little bit about 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:10.610
 so works in my case me I want 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:13.139
 just get out of my notebook 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.300
 and I will go to my county bruno you 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.729
 had come to see a little bit how to raise our 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.199
 automatically save minutes without 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.820
 even think about that same protection so 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:32.699
 in my notebooks 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:35.990
 I have a notebook head and in my 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:40.080
 case but did not note m 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:44.680
 go see all the non-households 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:47.139
 I write the sailboats automatically 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.610
 it's amazing it's such speed 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.740
 light I did not even take a break 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.690
 to be able to show you anyway 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.150
 did not get you ottoman automatically 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:59.620
 synchronized in the cloud 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:01.930
 so short the benefits for our leader 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.410
 and and vernon and penalty but these 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.270
 disadvantages very interesting I 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.729
 recommended two apps but 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:12.280
 obviously for those who love they are 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.740
 obsessively interested aso to do the 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.419
 save their notes 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.520
 I highly recommend penal 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.470
 committed but I must say that our 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.380
 leader wins the game for simplicity 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.550
 the ease that the glide of your style 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.470
 so on your tablet eee pad 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:32.310
 so good note 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.310
 thank you
