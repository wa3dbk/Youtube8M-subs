00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.180

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.490
 to be hot that's for sure but it's 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.490
 feasible it is feasible 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:42.000
 fucking then do go good sense that's it 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.860
 that's how they go 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.860

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:06.910
 others for the now to the waters to 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:11.080
 waters with ass hairs and hairs 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:16.359
 Ass exceeding price stayed much more 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:21.760
 easy then see here by cons but 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.990
 damn I'm gone alone doing 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.490
 move as you wish 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.220
 so frankly you have to play the game 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.420
 but what is this thing 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.470
 was expecting me what is this bullshit I 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.520
 get attacked by machines 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.310
 odd in time and what is it 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.680
 that it's good listening and I think it's 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.250
 time to tell you go there I have not too much 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.419

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.610
 can do 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.370
 but what can I do more 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.520
 apart from finding the exact angle to the degree 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:09.240
 here you have not a number of 87 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.240
 regret comes from us and you'll get there 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.879
 so go in fact I can not even 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:15.529

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.499

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.520
 haiti waited and in d1 but no but 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.999
 wait but no, but actually it wants 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.069
 to say that I can go down to Quebec 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:28.069
 have lost a choice now 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:37.080
 in fact we could go downstairs I 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.939

 so we stay on two pokÃ©mon the sacha 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.919
 I think I think that's it 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:54.509
 will take this thing from my mouth the scores 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:56.699
 who launch pokemon is down 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.490
 but little bugs there that have 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.749
 all a particular power 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.069
 I believed her to say their name 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:06.619

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:10.559

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:15.539
 already and other games I do not know in 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.599
 do I know copycats where I believe no 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:21.659
 if there is a species of turtle the ra 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.699
 bulbizarre this is a very weird 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.789
 also known I do not know why I 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:29.909

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:32.449

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:35.159
 delirious bulbizarre corner 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.659

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:40.490
 thing that always and it does not happen 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.419
 but seriously I'm doing the same thing 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:55.750
 all the time and it does not work 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:57.330

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:10.000

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:38.629
