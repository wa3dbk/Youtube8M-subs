00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that that can be a little bit messy

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
that that can be a little bit messy
because<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.810> starts<00:01:46.110> running

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
because if it kind of starts running

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.380 
because if it kind of starts running
down<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> side<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> bottle<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:48.000> going

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
down the side of the bottle it's going

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
down the side of the bottle it's going

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.490 
to get oil on your counter tops and it
just<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.540> little<00:01:51.780> bit<00:01:51.899> more<00:01:51.990> difficult<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
just it's a little bit more difficult to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.090 
just it's a little bit more difficult to
control<00:01:52.860> how<00:01:53.250> much<00:01:53.570> product<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:55.170> pour<00:01:55.860> out

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
control how much product you pour out

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
control how much product you pour out
basically<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.030> really<00:01:57.420> love<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
basically so I really love that it's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.260

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
packaged in a pump bottle I think that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.840 
packaged in a pump bottle I think that
4.2<00:02:00.930> ounces<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.219> less<00:02:02.430> than<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
4.2 ounces is a little bit less than you

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.389 
4.2 ounces is a little bit less than you

really<00:03:38.570> think<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:39.020> it<00:03:39.230> was<00:03:39.350> a<00:03:39.410> big<00:03:39.650> deal<00:03:39.680> that

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
really think that it was a big deal that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.650 
really think that it was a big deal that
it<00:03:40.070> was<00:03:40.160> a<00:03:40.190> little<00:03:40.400> bit<00:03:40.580> thicker<00:03:40.880> because<00:03:41.240> it

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
it was a little bit thicker because it

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.560 
it was a little bit thicker because it
still<00:03:41.930> worked<00:03:42.410> particularly<00:03:43.070> well<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.850> do<00:03:44.030> want

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
still worked particularly well I do want

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.120 
still worked particularly well I do want
to<00:03:44.660> note<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.110> didn't<00:03:45.620> feel<00:03:45.800> that<00:03:46.010> it

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
to note that I didn't feel that it

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.760 
to note that I didn't feel that it
worked<00:03:46.370> as<00:03:46.630> effectively<00:03:47.630> as<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.290> higher<00:03:48.500> end

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
worked as effectively as the higher end

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.050 
worked as effectively as the higher end
brands<00:03:49.630> once<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.900> had<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.650> lot<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.100> makeup<00:03:52.520> on<00:03:52.790> so

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
on the hand towels in my house so now

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.620 
on the hand towels in my house so now
let's<00:04:33.949> talk<00:04:34.160> about<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.610> cons<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:35.210> little<00:04:35.479> bit

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
let's talk about the cons a little bit

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.350 
let's talk about the cons a little bit
so<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.050> mentioned<00:04:36.410> that<00:04:36.979> it<00:04:37.310> was<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.940> little<00:04:38.180> bit

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
so I mentioned that it was a little bit

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.230 
so I mentioned that it was a little bit
of<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.630> thicker<00:04:38.930> product<00:04:39.560> i<00:04:39.800> did<00:04:40.310> also<00:04:40.580> notice

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
of a thicker product i did also notice

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.850 
of a thicker product i did also notice
that<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:41.630> took<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.930> little<00:04:42.199> bit<00:04:42.380> more<00:04:42.620> effort

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
that it took a little bit more effort

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.000 
that it took a little bit more effort
than<00:04:43.340> with<00:04:43.910> my<00:04:44.180> regular<00:04:44.780> cleansing<00:04:45.199> oils<00:04:45.560> to

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
than with my regular cleansing oils to

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.820 
than with my regular cleansing oils to
rinse<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.550> off<00:04:46.870> generally<00:04:47.870> with<00:04:48.380> any<00:04:48.650> other

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
rinse this off generally with any other

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.890 
rinse this off generally with any other
cleansing<00:04:49.280> oil<00:04:49.460> i've<00:04:49.639> used<00:04:49.910> once<00:04:50.510> it<00:04:50.720> comes

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
cleansing oil i've used once it comes

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.930 
cleansing oil i've used once it comes
into<00:04:51.139> contact<00:04:51.260> with<00:04:51.740> water<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.340> almost<00:04:52.639> turns

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
into contact with water it almost turns

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.790 
into contact with water it almost turns
like<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.120> milky<00:04:53.660> white<00:04:53.870> color<00:04:54.199> and<00:04:54.440> just<00:04:54.590> kind

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
like a milky white color and just kind

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.060 
like a milky white color and just kind
of<00:04:54.889> just<00:04:55.550> rinses<00:04:56.150> right<00:04:56.389> off<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:57.590> Garnier

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
of just rinses right off the Garnier

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.159 
of just rinses right off the Garnier
cleansing<00:04:58.610> oil<00:04:58.880> took<00:04:59.539> a<00:04:59.570> little<00:04:59.750> bit<00:04:59.960> of<00:05:00.080> extra

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
cleansing oil took a little bit of extra

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.159 
cleansing oil took a little bit of extra
effort<00:05:00.740> it<00:05:00.949> really<00:05:01.430> did<00:05:01.729> feel<00:05:02.180> more<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:03.050> me

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
effort it really did feel more to me

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.100 
effort it really did feel more to me
like<00:05:03.500> i<00:05:03.710> was<00:05:03.740> using<00:05:04.220> hobo<00:05:04.760> oil<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.300> that's<00:05:05.960> not

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
like i was using hobo oil and that's not

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.170 
like i was using hobo oil and that's not
surprising<00:05:06.260> considering<00:05:07.070> that<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.820> Garnier

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
surprising considering that the Garnier

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.689 
surprising considering that the Garnier
nourishing<00:05:09.020> cleansing<00:05:09.410> oil<00:05:09.560> does<00:05:10.130> contain<00:05:10.639> a

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
nourishing cleansing oil does contain a

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.480 
nourishing cleansing oil does contain a
hobo<00:05:11.180> oil<00:05:11.389> so<00:05:11.990> maybe<00:05:12.440> that's<00:05:12.680> why<00:05:12.860> I'm<00:05:13.160> seeing

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
hobo oil so maybe that's why I'm seeing

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.370 
hobo oil so maybe that's why I'm seeing
the<00:05:13.610> similarities<00:05:14.270> I<00:05:14.419> do<00:05:14.630> notice<00:05:14.990> that<00:05:15.260> it

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
the similarities I do notice that it

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.219 
the similarities I do notice that it
doesn't<00:05:15.710> emulsifies<00:05:16.460> easily<00:05:17.389> one<00:05:18.080> of<00:05:18.110> the

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
doesn't emulsifies easily one of the

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.779 
doesn't emulsifies easily one of the
first<00:05:18.500> things<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.889> noticed<00:05:18.919> was<00:05:19.340> that<00:05:19.490> it

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
first things I noticed was that it

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.040 
first things I noticed was that it
actually<00:05:20.000> says<00:05:20.479> it's<00:05:20.690> formulated

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
actually says it's formulated

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.340 
actually says it's formulated
specifically<00:05:22.039> for<00:05:22.430> dry<00:05:22.699> skin<00:05:22.729> I<00:05:23.330> ignored<00:05:24.199> it

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
specifically for dry skin I ignored it

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.890 
specifically for dry skin I ignored it
at<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.710> time<00:05:24.919> because<00:05:25.250> I've<00:05:26.000> never<00:05:26.060> heard<00:05:26.750> of

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
at the time because I've never heard of

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.750 
at the time because I've never heard of
a<00:05:26.990> cleansing<00:05:27.530> oil<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:27.950> wasn't<00:05:28.310> good<00:05:28.460> for<00:05:28.490> all

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
a cleansing oil that wasn't good for all

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.089 
a cleansing oil that wasn't good for all
skin<00:05:29.090> types<00:05:29.270> but<00:05:29.660> after<00:05:30.050> using<00:05:30.229> it<00:05:30.590> for<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> few

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
skin types but after using it for a few

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.370 
skin types but after using it for a few
weeks<00:05:31.250> I<00:05:31.520> understand<00:05:32.240> why<00:05:32.599> garni<00:05:33.229> is

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
weeks I understand why garni is

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.129 
weeks I understand why garni is
specifically<00:05:34.070> targeting<00:05:34.729> this<00:05:35.330> product<00:05:35.900> for

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
dry skin not only was it a little bit

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.990 
dry skin not only was it a little bit
more<00:05:39.050> difficult<00:05:39.289> to<00:05:39.620> rinse<00:05:39.950> off<00:05:40.190> but<00:05:40.520> once<00:05:40.760> I

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
more difficult to rinse off but once I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.480 
more difficult to rinse off but once I
actually<00:05:41.210> rinsed<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.169> off<00:05:42.349> there<00:05:42.979> was<00:05:43.160> still<00:05:43.430> a

actually rinsed it off there was still a

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.000 
actually rinsed it off there was still a
little<00:05:43.910> bit<00:05:44.180> of<00:05:44.360> residue<00:05:44.630> left<00:05:45.169> behind<00:05:45.380> on<00:05:45.860> my

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
little bit of residue left behind on my

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.909 
little bit of residue left behind on my
skin<00:05:46.340> it<00:05:46.610> actually<00:05:47.030> felt<00:05:47.660> like<00:05:47.810> a<00:05:48.020> moisture

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
skin it actually felt like a moisture

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.159 
skin it actually felt like a moisture
barrier<00:05:49.099> on<00:05:49.370> my<00:05:49.700> skin<00:05:50.000> which<00:05:50.389> is<00:05:50.570> great<00:05:50.840> if<00:05:50.870> you

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
barrier on my skin which is great if you

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
have dry skin it's absolutely wonderful

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.210 
have dry skin it's absolutely wonderful
but<00:05:53.539> if<00:05:53.750> you<00:05:53.900> don't<00:05:54.139> have<00:05:54.199> dry<00:05:54.530> skin<00:05:54.770> it<00:05:55.039> might

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
but if you don't have dry skin it might

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.950 
but if you don't have dry skin it might
feel<00:05:55.550> like<00:05:55.639> you're<00:05:56.180> just<00:05:56.449> left<00:05:56.690> with<00:05:56.810> a<00:05:56.900> little

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
feel like you're just left with a little

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.189 
feel like you're just left with a little
bit<00:05:57.410> of<00:05:57.470> oiliness<00:05:58.330> when<00:05:59.330> you're<00:05:59.539> done<00:05:59.720> so<00:06:00.020> that

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
bit of oiliness when you're done so that

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.020 
bit of oiliness when you're done so that
was<00:06:00.349> something<00:06:00.530> I<00:06:00.800> really<00:06:00.830> wasn't<00:06:01.490> a<00:06:01.699> fan<00:06:02.000> of

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
was something I really wasn't a fan of

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.909 
was something I really wasn't a fan of
because<00:06:02.479> of<00:06:02.720> that<00:06:03.050> there<00:06:03.530> was<00:06:03.680> a<00:06:03.710> learning

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
because of that there was a learning

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.890 
because of that there was a learning
curve<00:06:04.340> for<00:06:04.400> me<00:06:04.699> to<00:06:04.789> figure<00:06:04.970> out<00:06:05.210> what<00:06:05.539> worked

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
curve for me to figure out what worked

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.129 
curve for me to figure out what worked
best<00:06:06.110> for<00:06:06.470> me<00:06:06.830> it<00:06:07.400> took<00:06:07.460> me<00:06:07.849> about<00:06:08.150> three<00:06:08.930> days

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
best for me it took me about three days

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.040 
best for me it took me about three days
before<00:06:09.440> I<00:06:09.650> figured<00:06:10.010> out<00:06:10.190> that<00:06:10.550> if<00:06:10.729> I<00:06:10.940> used<00:06:11.810> the

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
before I figured out that if I used the

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.890 
before I figured out that if I used the
cleansing<00:06:12.440> oil<00:06:12.680> and<00:06:13.010> then<00:06:13.330> washed<00:06:14.330> my<00:06:14.690> face

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
cleansing oil and then washed my face

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.650 
cleansing oil and then washed my face
with<00:06:14.960> a<00:06:15.229> regular<00:06:15.590> cleanser<00:06:16.340> after<00:06:16.550> and<00:06:17.120> then

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
with a regular cleanser after and then

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.200 
with a regular cleanser after and then
used<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.169> little<00:06:18.530> less<00:06:18.979> of<00:06:19.280> my<00:06:19.820> nightly

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
used a little less of my nightly

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.420 
used a little less of my nightly
moisturizer<00:06:20.720> that<00:06:20.930> I'm<00:06:21.229> used<00:06:21.500> to<00:06:21.680> then<00:06:22.400> I

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
moisturizer that I'm used to then I

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.339 
moisturizer that I'm used to then I
wouldn't<00:06:22.880> break<00:06:23.090> out<00:06:23.300> so<00:06:23.539> I<00:06:23.570> kind<00:06:23.900> of<00:06:24.020> had<00:06:24.199> to

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
wouldn't break out so I kind of had to

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.409 
wouldn't break out so I kind of had to
adjust<00:06:24.770> my<00:06:25.039> routine<00:06:25.520> and<00:06:25.849> the<00:06:26.120> amount<00:06:26.330> of

some<00:06:39.200> adjustments<00:06:39.470> there<00:06:40.160> might<00:06:40.340> be<00:06:40.370> a

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
some adjustments there might be a

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.610 
some adjustments there might be a
learning<00:06:40.850> curve<00:06:41.270> so<00:06:41.810> for<00:06:42.080> me<00:06:42.230> although<00:06:42.470> I

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
learning curve so for me although I

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.270 
learning curve so for me although I
think<00:06:42.770> it<00:06:43.100> is<00:06:43.190> a<00:06:43.220> good<00:06:43.460> product<00:06:43.790> i<00:06:45.010> don't<00:06:46.010> think
