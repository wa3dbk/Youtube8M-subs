00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.690
 Today I'm on my 99 Nadery account. 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.810
 the account with the name of the star that you 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.810
 they are pulling the bag because from here we 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.369
 I do not know why more then that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 Today's video doll I want to give a 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.390
 tip for you is on the field as 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.260
 organize and create your own tim 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.230
 field 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.989
 so why am I on that account for? 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.410
 use this diamond account as an example 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.610
 2010 march with her highest highest on 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.809
 case 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.550
 she has only two pages of godah has 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:57.690
 four are two empty and we'll see 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:01:00.320
 how many champions even 6 9 10 and 8 40 feet 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.510
 when I learned that she had a 30 to 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.450
 1st conseg explaining why you have 16 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.010
 champions and play here the hypothesis almost 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.619
 it will never happen think this is the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.049
 the last peak of the game will have six vans 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.150
 and will have nine pixels if you study 15 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.580
 champions do not have to have 16 for 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 Show everyone the champions you have. 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.820
 pique in all the campaigns you have 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.689
 there will be at least one champion left to 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 So cry how I think 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.430
 easier to climb up enough people 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.970
 ask which is easier to ask for 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.970
 mine all because all because always 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.500
 You will have some good in your in touch ii by 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.909
 example will have a top will also of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.530
 angola also support 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.380
 so if I could play all 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.540
 Legends play well on the goal it never goes 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.060
 to be taking in addition to someone because 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.399
 generate net you get tops and still got the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.630
 Guy died once the guy is in a legend. 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.909
 who does not play well 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.040
 he's playing bad because're at MIT 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.290
 element play the clash of the expensive network and 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.700
 died on top would be won on top 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.439
 so that's why I'd rather play in 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.930
 all games not to have these fights 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.899
 I try to play as much as possible in law 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.129
 that my friends do not want to play 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.129
 not to the network is more organized 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.790
 this wants to focus on a law n not always 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.640
 it will remain 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.439
 It was like I was talking even more 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.329
 second Czech will not always be left 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.939
 champion who even lennix here is more 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.700
 but still difficult to mount a plate or 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.129
 little is what I find easier to do 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.099
 can learn to play with four 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.720
 champions for example for top dean gomide 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.609
 I can speak a few pikes that are 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.409
 learning to play with them already have 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.909
 champions for these three lines that will 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.439
 learn to play with four champions and 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.099
 will have two or three champions for each 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.069
 beyond 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.019
 how does this work is to train 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.239
 that you can use in more than one 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.269
 Law me for example the show I love beer 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.579
 It's very good to get on the link with him only. 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.650
 does not know how to play against you? 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.620
 make top limit and even hangu where 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.879
 the reasonable is a champion who 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.959
 if you learn to play if you can play in 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.139
 three patients 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.139
 so if you play very well show this is 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:08.629
 single top not over the top will left me 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.859
 at least the mechanics with the champion 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.629
 Shaweye Tuesday 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.489
 I always try to enjoy and play 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.769
 with the champ you can play more lenis 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.480
 a show would be the first one I 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.299
 I would recommend to you what you can do 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.760
 top jambo second would be morgana I am 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.269
 going for the champions that I like the most 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.919
 play 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.680
 morgana type because it's because you 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.000
 can do bid and even touch support 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.190
 with her on this top is not so viable 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.810
 so use it as support you limit 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.239
 There's a champion to support me. 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.310
 now as concerts and already have two champions 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.949
 to play in the media a champion project 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.549
 top a champion throwing the target is 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:46.400
 repeating and a transport adc does not have 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.340
 how you gonna have that other young man came down 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.680
 I do not play 4 rudders just do not play 10 and 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.470
 so I do not stress I did not 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.569
 show you how to play you are very 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.709
 rare from Saturday 10 and for me not 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:04.069
 matter which account the game continues 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.720
 we like the morgana pix show i like it 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.389
 also what you can do a media 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.280
 You can use the top can use the support 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.569
 I like him sandra because you can 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.150
 use the top media 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.639
 I like phantom to another very much 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.989
 good because you can do top django is 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.829
 a champion you can do three 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.659
 lenses 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.570
 it looks good but three games even more 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:25.190
 staff that works only on the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.020
 football ute is at the limit here 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.620
 The boat was playing with bosh too. 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.780
 animals 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.949
 the fact that kaka does not realize that he is 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.720
 speaking I 'm talking to the 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.000
 What champions do I have in this account? 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.880
 that I would dredge dredges for fashion 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.350
 hangu show for these three lenysson for 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.970
 these three teeth here I said three 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.949
 champions 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.020
 I have two champions to play give me 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.419
 two champions to play top and three 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.600
 champions to play played with two pics 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.490
 so this gives me a good variety of 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.350
 choices so do not stop talking 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.229
 that's all I can play with only this 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.800
 who saves is more for jango and top too 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.660
 medalist can make hangu media 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.380
 Support was what I said with this 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.720
 it ends up creating and outside that I was going to speak 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.479
 type only the two pages disclosed use 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.630
 two basic and so you can follow this 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.030
 account got md5 promises be only 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.030
 so the window apparatus fell to the 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.669
 because there are few champions 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.020
 transport is a political lottery of a 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.990
 good champion protesting until he had 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.150
 field to play love you also want 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.039
 learn to play easy but I 'm talking 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.830
 more to those who play on all lines 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.419
 that plays only a law does not do what I 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.669
 I talked about focusing on champions who can play 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.010
 in others because when left over 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.610
 less will not get lost because too much 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.610
 people do this 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.300
 another example bond champion that I did not 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.400
 I have here if you can use the 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.139
 mit laptop is also a champion works 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.940
 very well on both lenses 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.710
 so I hope this video has 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.120
 helped you guys was another short video 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.860
 I'm making it rather short now. 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.750
 next week will have more analysis and 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.699
 I'll try to do an analysis of a 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.860
 solo game from my master to 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.470
 show your main 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.199
 what a personal think different 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.449
 then this video was only as promised to 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.010
 string something to help you create 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.860
 a chance field that you do not need 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.169
 play with three champions of each law n 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.760
 If you can use champions that are used 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.030
 in more than one line longer 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.190
 then it ends up being chopped phantom ii 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.349
 flad already has three champions to play 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.860
 top-3 champions to play media and only with 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:32.900
 two champions is much more profitable of the 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:38.349
 to train a champion can only be that 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.349
 So thank you so much lei that watched 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:43.880
