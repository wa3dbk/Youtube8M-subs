but first of all I say the craftsmanship

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
but first of all I say the craftsmanship
on<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.240> scales<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.869> amazing

all you can tell it's a very long fiber
woven<00:01:12.390> carbon<00:01:13.170> fiber<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.270> can<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.509> know

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
woven carbon fiber and can you know

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.380 
woven carbon fiber and can you know
traditionally<00:01:16.259> see<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.070> i<00:01:17.100> got<00:01:17.340> my<00:01:17.520> cali<00:01:18.060> 3

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
here carbon fiber you see it what the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.289 
here carbon fiber you see it what the
difference<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.500> scale<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.820> scale<00:01:23.820> sorry

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
cali three here so now i believe this is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
cali three here so now i believe this is
called<00:01:35.850> arrow<00:01:36.090> carbon<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.200> name<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
called arrow carbon is the name of this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
called arrow carbon is the name of this
and<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:38.729> cuz<00:01:38.939> Scotty<00:01:39.150> has<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.720> very<00:01:39.810> many

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and now cuz Scotty has very very many

taken<00:03:07.080> apart<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.470> paramilitary<00:03:07.860> would<00:03:08.310> know

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
taken apart a paramilitary would know

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.900 
taken apart a paramilitary would know
that<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:09.840> metal<00:03:10.550> liners<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.700> here

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
that this the the metal liners in here

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.950 
that this the the metal liners in here
actually<00:03:12.390> recess<00:03:13.230> into<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:15.360> scales

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
actually recess into the the scales

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.720 
actually recess into the the scales
itself<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.530> g10<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> original<00:03:17.310> g10<00:03:17.610> scales

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
itself the g10 the original g10 scales

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.820 
itself the g10 the original g10 scales
so<00:03:18.540> think<00:03:18.870> about<00:03:18.930> how<00:03:19.080> hard<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.680> actually

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
so think about how hard is to actually

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.880 
so think about how hard is to actually
cut<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.370> cut<00:03:21.120> into<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.780> make<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.200> fit<00:03:22.470> just

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
cut the cut into it and make it fit just

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.090 
cut the cut into it and make it fit just
perfectly<00:03:23.570> for<00:03:24.570> these<00:03:24.750> metal<00:03:25.590> liners<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.950> mean

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
perfectly for these metal liners I mean

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.860 
perfectly for these metal liners I mean
on<00:03:26.700> other<00:03:26.940> liners<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.450> easy<00:03:27.600> because<00:03:27.750> it

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
on other liners is easy because it

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.420 
on other liners is easy because it
obviously<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.680> scale<00:03:28.860> sits<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.190> top<00:03:29.370> of

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
obviously that the scale sits on top of

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.800 
obviously that the scale sits on top of
the<00:03:29.550> line<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.910> i<00:03:29.940> gotta<00:03:30.150> do<00:03:30.240> is<00:03:30.270> cut<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.570> into

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the line so i gotta do is cut it into

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.290 
the line so i gotta do is cut it into
the<00:03:30.900> shape<00:03:30.990> of<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.380> of<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.920> liners<00:03:32.550> ray<00:03:32.730> this

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
the shape of the of the liners ray this

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.580 
the shape of the of the liners ray this
with<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> blunders<00:03:33.900> into<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.230> recessed

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
with all the blunders into a recessed

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.020 
with all the blunders into a recessed
into<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.830> scale<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.550> perfect<00:03:35.670> i<00:03:35.910> mean

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
into the scale so this is perfect i mean

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.910 
into the scale so this is perfect i mean
every<00:03:36.330> single<00:03:36.450> severy<00:03:36.959> single<00:03:37.230> apart<00:03:37.709> that's

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
every single severy single apart that's

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.130 
every single severy single apart that's
in<00:03:38.070> here<00:03:38.250> fit<00:03:38.910> right<00:03:39.180> back<00:03:39.390> into<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.930> scale

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
in here fit right back into the scale

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.020 
in here fit right back into the scale

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
and you can tell it is real carbon fiber

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.540 
and you can tell it is real carbon fiber
could<00:04:22.049> see<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.350> actual<00:04:22.740> layers<00:04:23.190> there

sharp corners anything I mean it's it's
exactly<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.450> same<00:04:30.660> as<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:30.990> g10<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.770> came<00:04:31.920> on

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
exactly the same as a g10 that came on

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.370 
exactly the same as a g10 that came on
here<00:04:32.250> in<00:04:32.670> every<00:04:33.030> way<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.840> know<00:04:33.960> except<00:04:34.350> for

here in every way you know except for

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.520 
here in every way you know except for
the<00:04:34.560> material<00:04:34.980> obviously<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:36.090> ya<00:04:36.690> see<00:04:36.870> perfect

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
the material obviously so ya see perfect

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.370 
the material obviously so ya see perfect
you<00:04:37.770> know<00:04:38.120> but<00:04:39.120> I'm<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.750> going<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.930> shut<00:04:40.230> off

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.960 
imagine what it is yeah if they do the
entire<00:05:09.180> scale<00:05:09.570> as<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:10.230> glow<00:05:10.590> scale<00:05:11.520> or<00:05:11.760> like<00:05:11.940> a

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
glowing backspacer it's got to be

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.140 
glowing backspacer it's got to be
freaking<00:05:13.830> awesome<00:05:13.980> look<00:05:14.310> at<00:05:14.400> this<00:05:14.460> look<00:05:14.940> how

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
freaking awesome look at this look how

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.650 
freaking awesome look at this look how
blue<00:05:15.540> this<00:05:15.900> thing<00:05:16.080> is<00:05:16.260> that's<00:05:17.070> crazy<00:05:17.570> think<00:05:18.570> of

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
blue this thing is that's crazy think of

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.910 
blue this thing is that's crazy think of
the<00:05:18.750> radiation<00:05:19.200> you're<00:05:19.470> getting<00:05:19.680> from<00:05:19.800> this

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
the radiation you're getting from this

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.030 
the radiation you're getting from this
thing<00:05:20.840> straight<00:05:21.840> out<00:05:21.930> at<00:05:22.050> Chernobyl<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:22.980> you

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
thing straight out at Chernobyl so you

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.200 
thing straight out at Chernobyl so you
can<00:05:23.130> tell<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.310> other<00:05:23.430> side's<00:05:23.640> not<00:05:23.820> glowing<00:05:24.030> at

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
can tell the other side's not glowing at

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.090 
can tell the other side's not glowing at
all<00:05:24.330> so<00:05:24.690> you<00:05:25.050> know<00:05:25.170> it's<00:05:25.440> because<00:05:25.650> it<00:05:25.920> hasn't

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
all so you know it's because it hasn't

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.380 
all so you know it's because it hasn't
got<00:05:26.310> enough<00:05:26.340> light<00:05:26.610> so<00:05:26.670> we'll<00:05:26.970> go<00:05:27.090> and<00:05:27.210> charge

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
got enough light so we'll go and charge

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.230 
got enough light so we'll go and charge
this<00:05:27.540> side<00:05:27.750> up<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:28.080> as<00:05:28.260> well<00:05:28.380> you<00:05:29.190> know<00:05:29.310> under

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
this side up to as well you know under

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.550 
this side up to as well you know under
under<00:05:30.570> better<00:05:30.750> lighting<00:05:31.050> this<00:05:31.320> thing<00:05:31.470> would

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
under better lighting this thing would

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.010 
under better lighting this thing would
of<00:05:31.800> course<00:05:31.920> gluons<00:05:32.340> own<00:05:32.580> one<00:05:33.000> when<00:05:33.720> you<00:05:33.810> drop

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
of course gluons own one when you drop

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.080 
of course gluons own one when you drop
in<00:05:34.200> the<00:05:34.290> darkness<00:05:34.560> though<00:05:34.950> I<00:05:35.160> think<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.850> think

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
in the darkness though I think I think

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.910 
in the darkness though I think I think
with<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> larger<00:05:36.990> spacer<00:05:37.470> it'd<00:05:37.650> be<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.800> lot

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
with a larger spacer it'd be a lot

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.740 
with a larger spacer it'd be a lot
easier<00:05:37.980> to<00:05:38.370> see<00:05:38.550> and<00:05:38.580> obviously<00:05:39.090> if<00:05:39.600> the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
easier to see and obviously if the

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.290 
easier to see and obviously if the
entire<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.140> I<00:05:40.230> scales<00:05:41.160> glow<00:05:41.520> it'd<00:05:41.940> be<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.180> lot

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
entire and I scales glow it'd be a lot

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.940 
entire and I scales glow it'd be a lot
