00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.020 
treat at the same time another reason
just<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.159> lightweight<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
just because it's really lightweight and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.219 
just because it's really lightweight and
I<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.390> products<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.049> lightweight

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the pink side for me this is in the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.459 
the pink side for me this is in the
shade<00:01:58.380> light/medium<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.570> what<00:02:00.990> I'm<00:02:01.079> gonna<00:02:01.229> do

shade light/medium so what I'm gonna do

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.850 
shade light/medium so what I'm gonna do
is<00:02:01.619> mix<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.399> one<00:02:02.939> drop<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.469> two<00:02:04.500> drops

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
this and 35 yes and 35 because this is a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.540 
this and 35 yes and 35 because this is a
neutral<00:02:10.869> undertone<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.130> can<00:02:12.280> see<00:02:12.520> just

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
neutral undertone so you can see just

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.120 
neutral undertone so you can see just
has<00:02:12.910> more<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.810> little<00:02:14.290> more<00:02:14.530> yellow<00:02:14.950> in

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
like a thin layer to stir and then you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.100 
like a thin layer to stir and then you
can<00:03:05.350> go<00:03:05.590> back<00:03:05.860> if<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.550> need<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:07.150> little<00:03:07.930> bit

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
can go back if you need a little bit

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.130 
can go back if you need a little bit
more<00:03:08.290> coverage<00:03:08.560> but<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:10.209> like<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.600> start<00:03:10.930> with

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
more coverage but I like to start with

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.970 
more coverage but I like to start with
less<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.000> don't<00:03:13.330> waste<00:03:13.540> product<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.680> then

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
less so I don't waste product and then

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.580 
less so I don't waste product and then
same<00:03:15.730> thing<00:03:15.910> goes<00:03:16.090> for<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.510> if<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.019> color<00:03:17.290> is

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
same thing goes for like if the color is

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.550 
same thing goes for like if the color is
not<00:03:17.970> super<00:03:18.970> right<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:19.870> length<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.260> little<00:03:20.350> bit

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
not super right on length a little bit

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.949 
not super right on length a little bit
like<00:03:20.769> right<00:03:20.980> now<00:03:21.100> so<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.640> might<00:03:22.269> go<00:03:22.450> back<00:03:22.480> with<00:03:22.930> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
like right now so I might go back with a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.290 
like right now so I might go back with a
little<00:03:23.260> bit<00:03:23.380> more<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:23.860> in<00:03:24.160> 35<00:03:24.730> but<00:03:25.180> the

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
you're already using so you can really

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.750 
you're already using so you can really
change<00:05:51.389> the<00:05:51.660> like<00:05:52.349> the<00:05:52.590> finish<00:05:53.099> that<00:05:53.400> your

within and keep your makeup from looking
cakey<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.360> then<00:06:00.810> my<00:06:00.900> second<00:06:01.229> reason<00:06:01.349> for

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
cakey and then my second reason for

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.550 
cakey and then my second reason for
liking<00:06:01.770> these<00:06:02.039> is<00:06:02.190> that<00:06:02.310> they<00:06:02.490> add<00:06:02.639> a<00:06:02.669> punch<00:06:03.150> of

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
liking these is that they add a punch of

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.900 
liking these is that they add a punch of
vitamins<00:06:04.560> and<00:06:04.800> essential<00:06:04.889> oils<00:06:05.430> to<00:06:05.580> any
