00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:20.928
The third attempt. It's the third attempt to record this 
 episode because we're having problems with the camera.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.010
Peace and good!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here he is, father Franciszek himself!

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.489
Not a paper figure. It wasn't that bad! 
 I know the artist who made him;).

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:47.674
Todays question was: why are children assessed for the way they pray in 
 RE classes but they aren't actually taught how to do it?

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:57.046
So, children should learn how to pray on those classes 
 and not be assessed for how they do it.

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:02.816
Let me give the floor to father Franciszek for a 
 minute and I'll go and check if it's recording.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:15.990
It must be said that in RE classes children should have a chance to gain some 
 knowledge and then demonstrate if they have mastered it, just like in any other class.

00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:28.983
This mark is actually the relfection of the extent in which 
 this knowledge has been mastered. Nobody's assessing anybody's faith.

00:01:31.034 --> 00:01:36.034
Some say that we should assess somebody's involvement in the life 
 of Church as this knowledge must be applied in life.

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:45.070
Just like in maths - you learn a formula and then 
 must be able to use it in some calculations.

00:01:46.976 --> 00:01:58.980
It's different with RE classes because when I teach students about the Church wedding, 
 then I cannot criticise anybody for not participating in such a ceremony.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:04.910
In RE classes we give marks for knowledge, just like in any other subject.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:15.920
On each stage of our education we learn different things, 
 we master the alphabet, numbers, basics of various sciences.

00:02:17.144 --> 00:02:26.140
We also learn how to remember chunks of text. Of course, in RE classes 
 it's not about learning anything by heart but about understanding what we learn.

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:31.230
But obviously there are certain prayers that a believer should master and remember.

00:02:33.265 --> 00:02:38.260
So we learn basic rules that we are obliged to follow 
 and then learn more and more of these rules.

00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:46.050
So I disagree with the opinion that we assess the way children 
 pray. We assess the degree to which they mastered the material.

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:54.150
Are children taught how to pray at school? I don't know. It probably 
 depends on their teacher and as you know they are very different.

00:02:56.624 --> 00:03:04.620
Sometimes it's enough to show children what God is like and 
 then the will to pray just comes by itself.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:18.080
I think it's just like with learning to read. You can learn to read but never 
 really use this ability to read any literature. Knowing letters will be enough for you.

00:03:21.914 --> 00:03:33.910
But if you have a good teacher, he will encourage you 
 to read more and more and develop your abilities.

00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:44.940
It's the same with RE classes. A teacher can just demonstrate how 
 to pray and require children to learn prayers by heart.

00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:58.700
But another teacher can fascinate young people so much with his life and deep faith that 
 he will encourage them to follow his example and live that way as well.

00:04:01.936 --> 00:04:07.940
For example father Leonard. So I should think very deeply 
 now whether I'm really successful in it or not.

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:18.300
Of one thing I'm sure. Students' faith should not 
 be the key element in RE classes.

00:04:20.121 --> 00:04:29.120
Anyway, I've noticed that sometimes students who object to the Church in a 
 way write tests better than those who regularly participate in masses.

00:04:31.143 --> 00:04:39.140
There are also altar boys who think that just because they serve 
 at the altar they should get a 5 right away.

00:04:40.437 --> 00:04:52.440
Even if you go on pilgrimages regularly or sing in a church choir, 
 you should deepen you knowledge so as to be an educated Catholic.

00:04:55.791 --> 00:05:07.790
We need to develop our religious knowledge so as not to be 
 surprised by those who learn a lot about the Church.

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:21.830
And let me stress once again that if an RE teacher assesses 
 students for anything more than their knowledge, it's just unfair.

00:05:22.828 --> 00:05:26.830
It's unfair towards those who are diligent and always prepared for classes.

00:05:27.548 --> 00:05:40.550
It's the same with attending extra biology classes - you can't be given 
 the highest mark in biology just because you attend extra classes.

00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:50.230
Such students should demonstrate their real knowledge during biology classes too.

00:05:53.027 --> 00:06:03.030
Such students are usually more active in regular biology classes. And, paradoxically, in RE 
 classes believers are often more disruptive than those whose faith is weak.

00:06:07.143 --> 00:06:09.140
I don't believe it but I know it.

00:06:10.557 --> 00:06:14.560
So I disagree with the approach to assess the way somebody prays. Me too.

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.060
Peace and good!
