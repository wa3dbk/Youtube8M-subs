 but what I would like today 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.079
 I bring you a secret zone an area 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.390
 hidden and good you know to pass 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:26.779
 the rest of today we have to 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.050
 get to the 700 likes so give it to 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.059
 button I like to exceed 700 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.000
 likes and meet the challenge of today 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.050
 good guys today I bring you what 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.199
 which is a very curious area and more 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.180
 because people said that behind that 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.250
 door was what what 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.190
 It could be the jetpack no people said 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.000
 not that there you can be here and asia your 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.730
 not theories but that's not the subject of 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.190
 this video I took a catch reaches to 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.590
 take a one shot of a video on the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.009
 that make a world bridge that is like 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.570
 to cross the wall or the ground and this one 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.000
 can appreciate that inside if it is 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.119
 created as if it were an area in which 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.850
 an item can be an object without 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.490
 However, you can not enter in a 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.950
 legal to her 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.399
 Many people also mentioned that if you 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.740
 used to make 4 are grenades the strong 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.689
 and it's going to explode and it was going to open or what 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.899
 that is something that does not happen because it arrives 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.280
 I tried what I tried, it's not true 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.250
 in no time it opens in any 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.090
 This moment explodes in no time 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.850
 you can access not what the system is 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.159
 it's to that area but it's a good zone 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.920
 quite quite curious and they know by 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.509
 what is curious by the simple fact of 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.119
 that when you pass by there is 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.819
 it's basically hidden not that area and the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.240
 why it 's created in is a 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.369
 I was also a bit weird 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.310
 I am commenting that with the qui was 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.929
 commenting that it could be that it could 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.819
 hide that is the place that is 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.739
 I'm not going to tell you, I'm not going to 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.290
 be inventing things that are 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.930
 soon it will be and the bread will not swim 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.760
 but there are many people who mentioned 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.620
 not that something was hidden there what 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.520
 which is a lie let's say this video 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.100
 it's like what I did from gta 6 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.000
 and that the thing was a 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.000
 an east 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.820
 and a gta 6 logo that was that in 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.800
 actually it was a padlock and then already 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.110
 After I denied it, I said 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.090
 I found this area that is quite 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.920
 curious and that many people had the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.590
 speculations that there are inside had 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.480
 something maybe it was a secret weapon something 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.550
 related to the aliens who knows a 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.650
 vehicle a motorbike many people in 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.030
 many forums I was reading what 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.790
 I mentioned that then I said good for 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.359
 what not to do this video and teach them to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.780
 people and ask them what it is that 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:10.659
 they think you think it's 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.329
 that should be there or what do they think 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.400
 rockstar is going to use this part to 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.370
 some video because I say for which 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.319
 asked for some d lc some mission 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.139
 extra that they are going to place some mission 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.060
 of the online because being honest because 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.620
 rockstar would create that place if it's not going to 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.439
 do nothing yes yes yes yes it seems like 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.209
 was going to be a mine but that mine as 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:35.409
 that they covered it even though they finished it 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.870
 do or of or to dig then maybe 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.629
 maybe there in some mission you have 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.419
 to pick up something hidden there or whatever 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:45.129
 but who knows you can give 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.389
 your theories do not go to the next I hope 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.480
 that you liked this little video 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:51.609
 I know it's not, it's not super cool 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.760
 but then if it makes you think a little 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:58.299
 no and more because it's an area 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.709
 that are almost in the middle of the good is 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:04.870
 in the middle of the desert practically but 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.180
 this one to see that it is created in to 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.459
 see that you can cool enough space 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.980
 so that there is something hidden there who 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.530
 You know maybe there is an unlockable 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.030
 that is going to be able to do I do not know if 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.620
 I have more information I will do 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.989
 know I hope you liked this 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.130
 video not until next time I am blog and 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.130
 I say goodbye goodbye
