00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
insides of my eyes to make them look a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.900 
insides of my eyes to make them look a
little<00:03:24.300> bit<00:03:24.510> bigger<00:03:24.660> because<00:03:24.990> this<00:03:25.350> color<00:03:25.530> is

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
little bit bigger because this color is

little bit bigger because this color is
it's<00:03:26.910> called<00:03:27.120> topaz<00:03:27.480> but<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:27.900> kind<00:03:28.110> of

it's called topaz but it's kind of
peachy<00:03:28.530> look<00:03:28.800> instead<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.310> using<00:03:29.490> white<00:03:29.760> you

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
peachy look instead of using white you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.940 
peachy look instead of using white you
could<00:03:30.120> use<00:03:30.270> this<00:03:30.480> color<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:31.020> make<00:03:31.350> your<00:03:31.500> eyes<00:03:31.650> a

could use this color to make your eyes a
little<00:03:32.100> bit<00:03:32.280> more<00:03:32.400> wide<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:34.950> what<00:03:35.100> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
little bit more wide so this is what the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.380 
little bit more wide so this is what the
eyeliner<00:03:35.520> should<00:03:35.760> look<00:03:35.910> like<00:03:35.940> when<00:03:36.270> you're

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
eyeliner should look like when you're

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.850
