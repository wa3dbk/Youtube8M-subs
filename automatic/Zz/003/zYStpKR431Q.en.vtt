guys<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.979> basically<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:23.970> start<00:01:24.210> off<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
guys but basically we start off at the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.480 
guys but basically we start off at the
Oryx<00:01:25.229> manner<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.590> already<00:01:25.830> cleared<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.280> out

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
Oryx manner I already cleared this out

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.580 
Oryx manner I already cleared this out
you<00:01:27.150> start<00:01:27.330> off<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.659> lyrics<00:01:28.200> manner<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
you start off at lyrics manner in

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.749 
you start off at lyrics manner in
imprisoned<00:01:31.590> angel<00:01:31.890> quest<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> once<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.640> get

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
imprisoned angel quest and once you get

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.760 
imprisoned angel quest and once you get
to<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.000> staircase<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.930> you'll<00:01:34.619> get

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
to this staircase right here you'll get

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.440 
to this staircase right here you'll get
a<00:01:34.829> checkpoint<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.579> sometimes<00:01:36.180> there's<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a checkpoint and sometimes there's a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.940 
a checkpoint and sometimes there's a
yellow<00:01:36.659> guy<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.110> room<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> there's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
yellow guy in this room and there's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.990 
yellow guy in this room and there's
always<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.520> least<00:01:39.079> another<00:01:40.700> elite<00:01:41.700> right

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
always at least another elite right

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
always at least another elite right
outside<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.630> gate<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.229> there's<00:01:43.560> two<00:01:43.950> right

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
outside the gate so there's two right

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.450 
outside the gate so there's two right
there<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.210> after<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> after<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
there so after that after you get that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
there so after that after you get that
checkpoint<00:01:47.700> you'll<00:01:48.119> start<00:01:48.390> every<00:01:48.720> time<00:01:48.960> here

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
checkpoint you'll start every time here

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
checkpoint you'll start every time here
as<00:01:49.409> long<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.189> don't<00:01:50.369> kill<00:01:50.430> butcher<00:01:50.939> and

teleport out and get back to the the

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.479 
teleport out and get back to the the
center<00:03:41.470> because<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:41.919> don't<00:03:42.159> want<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.400> go

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
center because I don't want to go

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.520 
center because I don't want to go
looking<00:03:42.819> around<00:03:43.000> each<00:03:43.209> one<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.870> see<00:03:44.049> oh<00:03:44.079> maybe

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
looking around each one to see oh maybe

looking around each one to see oh maybe
there's<00:03:44.769> two<00:03:44.919> in<00:03:45.040> here<00:03:45.069> I<00:03:45.400> try<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.819> be<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:46.030> little

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
there's two in here I try to be a little

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.920 
there's two in here I try to be a little
time<00:03:46.780> efficient<00:03:47.229> on<00:03:47.349> that<00:03:47.639> after<00:03:48.639> that<00:03:48.819> we<00:03:49.690> go

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
time efficient on that after that we go

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.000 
time efficient on that after that we go
to<00:03:50.129> cathedral<00:03:51.129> level<00:03:51.400> three<00:03:51.669> and<00:03:52.799> about<00:03:53.799> half

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
to cathedral level three and about half

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.750 
to cathedral level three and about half
the<00:03:54.220> time<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.489> found<00:03:55.000> man<00:03:55.810> latency<00:03:56.430> I've<00:03:57.430> found

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
the time I found man latency I've found

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.099 
the time I found man latency I've found
that<00:04:00.689> there's<00:04:01.689> a<00:04:02.099> necromancer<00:04:03.099> skeleton<00:04:03.879> guy

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
that there's a necromancer skeleton guy

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.849 
that there's a necromancer skeleton guy
yellow<00:04:05.109> right<00:04:05.709> around<00:04:05.919> here<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:08.500> can<00:04:08.650> end

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
yellow right around here and you can end

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.270 
yellow right around here and you can end
it<00:04:08.979> right<00:04:09.189> there<00:04:09.250> if<00:04:09.609> you<00:04:09.729> want<00:04:09.939> if<00:04:10.120> not<00:04:11.280> go

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
it right there if you want if not go

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.289 
it right there if you want if not go
back<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:13.229> cemetery<00:04:14.229> of<00:04:14.409> forsaken<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:15.129> go<00:04:16.090> down

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
back to cemetery of forsaken and go down

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.379 
back to cemetery of forsaken and go down
into<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.840> forest<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.669> use<00:04:18.669> your<00:04:18.820> five<00:04:19.030> stacks

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
into the forest to use your five stacks

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.750 
into the forest to use your five stacks
and<00:04:19.690> go<00:04:19.959> blow<00:04:20.229> up<00:04:20.260> three<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.219> elites<00:04:21.519> in

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
and go blow up three of the elites in

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.410 
and go blow up three of the elites in
the<00:04:22.510> forest<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.229> didn't<00:04:23.740> do<00:04:23.889> that

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
the forest I I didn't do that

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.630 
the forest I I didn't do that
because<00:04:25.810> it's<00:04:26.080> it's<00:04:26.320> not<00:04:26.500> exactly<00:04:27.010> time

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
because it's it's not exactly time

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.250 
because it's it's not exactly time
efficient<00:04:28.150> but<00:04:28.300> if<00:04:28.480> you<00:04:28.780> have<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.140> little

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
efficient but if you have that little

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.780 
efficient but if you have that little
extra<00:04:29.470> time<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.890> got<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.130> go<00:04:30.220> somewhere<00:04:30.460> but

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
extra time you got to go somewhere but

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.580 
extra time you got to go somewhere but
you<00:04:30.940> still<00:04:31.150> want<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.330> kill<00:04:31.480> some<00:04:31.660> elites<00:04:31.930> it's

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
you still want to kill some elites it's

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.910 
you still want to kill some elites it's
