00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.060

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.360

 practical in an individual group and with him the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.020
 attending her by sharing the 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.970
 how not to give ideas and know what 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.550
 the other people think of meeting people 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.930
 from other parties 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.510
 it is true as the most 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.330
 what I like the beauty of this 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.790
 place is exquisite this morning 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.540
 I was talking to a student who 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.910
 he said the silence that when he 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.970
 He holds up his hand and he knows it by singing and 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.250
 that's right here is the boys are there 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.280
 they wrap in this atmosphere of 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.040
 tranquility that helps us a lot 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:03.240
 creativity undoubtedly in places 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.240
 paradisiacal closeness all this 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.490
 the restaurants is all within two minutes 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.350
 to walk because it's his profile I like 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.890
 very much the environment as we are all 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.890
 as a family 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.460
 very father all Chabon is like the city 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.080
 of artists and inspiration the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.200
 true that the dynamics what it has is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.510
 that the place where they are 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.230
 in a place that is unique it seems to me that 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.170
 in the world of art design these 24 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.690
 hours as breathing beyond the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.090
 class time is that everything is at your 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.300
 disposition becomes your home and 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.209
 in your space that dynamic makes it 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.250
 make you easier to learn and that 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.920
 dynamic is what makes you not have the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.580
 energy to stay here you can 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.019
 learn more in less time and that I 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.260
 I think that's what makes the school 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.090
 is this special program that 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.950
 characterized by international summer that 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.910
 was carried out during the months of 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.239
 July and August and the program of 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.610
 masterclass that is defined as courses 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.650
 intensive for more professional groups 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.260
 It is during the month of January 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.520
 teachers are the heart of the program 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.680
 special 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.350
 I know we try to make a 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.020
 mix of Dominican professionals and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.120
 also international professionals 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.880
 that come from all over the world 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.790
 I feel that I have learned a lot 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.320
 much that I can especially as I already 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.570
 everything I learned and keep moving 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.270
 on my own that is the most important thing 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.690
 it is wrapping more observers and more 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.690
 critics and a desire to grow and 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.550
 learn they start to notice later 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.250
 we share as with the other courses 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.980
 then in many things that the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.030
 colleagues do they are also very very 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.090
 very interesting energy of 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.720
 hamas students work and how high 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:11.880
 the deal dir because the one is 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.880
 direct an agreement on the subject 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.039
 look at the equipment 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 anyway 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.300
 proud 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.880

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.690
 yours 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.540
 apart from the knowledge that goes to 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.790
 acquire is the ability to share 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:22.750
 with people from different parts of the 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:25.390
 world that are immersed in a topic in 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.250
 common and the possibility of sharing with 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:33.460
 high quality professionals who then 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.610
 by the intensity of the moment they live 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.010

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.140
