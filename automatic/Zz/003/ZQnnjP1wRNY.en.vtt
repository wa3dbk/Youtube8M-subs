00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.900
 the problem with tablets and smartphones 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.760
 is often that the devices only as 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.410
 pure the convenience and consumer 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.910
 products are perceived that is 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.920
 you do not even look at them anymore 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.359
 that there really is a computer with all 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.260
 his possibilities and risks 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.260
 behind it 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.969
 I do not know that was free 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.530
 as a consumer then you notice 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 that the installation of programs of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.000
 apps has very, very easy it is is 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.199
 with 23 click in the app store in the market 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.699
 done 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.289
 the program will be automatically removed from the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.059
 network installed and I can stop in 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.530
 very very short time very many 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.630
 install programs and that very much 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.189
 user friendly but sticks with it 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.140
 often the caution on the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.549
 that means you should get out of this 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.470
 app installation a very conscious 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.970
 and you should do it yourself 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.740
 just look at the provider 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.840
 of those apps in the store in the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.270
 Market has made reputable option 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.770
 ratings are good if people already 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.770
 or bad experiences 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 a thing we do not do so far 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.170
 should, for example, online banking 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.970
 because if, for example, your tan 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 Numbers for your transactions via sms 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.649
 get sent to the device with the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.210
 same device the online banking 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.399
 can serve applications yes 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.990
 malicious app before times 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.119
 sometime caught on the device 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.729
 have this information merge 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.350
 pass on to a third and this 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.009
 then has all options your account 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.009
 to get empty 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.430
 a secure password for tablet or 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.470
 smartphone should look the same as 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.150
 on a normal pc also that is called it 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.130
 should have at least eleven signs 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.380
 should be big and lower case digits 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.520
 and special signs should be taken 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.630
 not even from the small keyboard 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.280
 to be deterred 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.280
 because you have to stop by unfortunately 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.730
 smartphones are incredibly practical 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.260
 thing but like any technical 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.510
 toy that you carry around with you 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.290
 it depends on it is right 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.000
 use and the right one 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.540
 fingertip feeling for the risks 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 develop
