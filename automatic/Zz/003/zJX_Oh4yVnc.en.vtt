out<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> professional<00:00:06.480> motocross<00:00:06.720> racer

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
out to a professional motocross racer

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.310 
out to a professional motocross racer
Ryan<00:00:07.680> sites<00:00:08.069> his<00:00:08.280> house<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:09.480> today<00:00:09.960> we're

Ryan sites his house and today we're

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.720 
Ryan sites his house and today we're
going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.500> talk<00:00:10.740> about<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> control<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
going to talk about how to control a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.850 
going to talk about how to control a
motorcycle<00:00:12.450> alright<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.440> we're<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.620> rural

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
motorcycle alright so we're in rural

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.150 
motorcycle alright so we're in rural
Kentucky<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:15.030> we've<00:00:16.020> got<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.440> v10<00:00:16.949> high

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
Kentucky and we've got the v10 high

00:00:17.160 --> 00:01:09.200 
Kentucky and we've got the v10 high
speed<00:00:17.400> camera<00:00:17.789> again<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.890> a<00:00:19.890> bunch<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.279> jumps

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.850 

let's<00:01:10.210> say<00:01:10.330> that<00:01:10.510> you<00:01:10.810> go<00:01:11.170> over<00:01:11.440> on<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.680> bike

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
let's say that you go over on the bike

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.910 
let's say that you go over on the bike
and<00:01:12.270> you're<00:01:13.270> coming<00:01:13.570> up<00:01:13.690> too<00:01:13.870> high<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.410> you

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
and you're coming up too high and you

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.010 
and you're coming up too high and you
need<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.190> rocker<00:01:15.730> back<00:01:16.000> down<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.600> all<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.870> do

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
need to rocker back down so all you do

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.840 
need to rocker back down so all you do
is<00:01:17.050> if<00:01:17.470> you've<00:01:17.590> got<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.740> flywheel<00:01:18.220> going<00:01:18.580> here

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
is if you've got a flywheel going here

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.300 
is if you've got a flywheel going here
you've<00:01:19.720> got<00:01:19.900> rotational<00:01:20.470> energy<00:01:20.710> stored<00:01:21.160> up

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
you've got rotational energy stored up

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.540 
you've got rotational energy stored up
here<00:01:21.700> 1/2<00:01:22.420> I<00:01:22.630> Omega<00:01:22.720> square<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:24.310> what<00:01:24.460> you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
here 1/2 I Omega square and so what you

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.880 
here 1/2 I Omega square and so what you
do<00:01:24.670> there<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.120> just<00:01:25.360> tap<00:01:25.570> your<00:01:25.600> brakes<00:01:25.960> you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
do there is you just tap your brakes you

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.050 
do there is you just tap your brakes you
can<00:01:27.040> laughs<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:29.200> tap<00:01:29.440> your<00:01:29.470> brakes<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:30.250> once

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
can laughs you tap your brakes and once

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.760 
can laughs you tap your brakes and once
you<00:01:31.150> do<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.300> that<00:01:32.080> transfer<00:01:32.500> this

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
you do that that transfer this

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.830 
you do that that transfer this
rotational<00:01:33.340> energy<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.090> whole<00:01:34.300> body<00:01:34.600> of

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
rotational energy to the whole body of

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.140 
rotational energy to the whole body of
the<00:01:34.870> bike<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.410> once<00:01:35.650> you<00:01:36.100> do<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.280> then

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
the bike and once you do that then

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.300 
the bike and once you do that then
you'll<00:01:37.330> rock<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:37.690> back<00:01:37.960> over<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.500> Ryan's

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
you'll rock it back over and Ryan's

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.420 
you'll rock it back over and Ryan's
going<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.520> demonstrate<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:40.240> for<00:01:40.300> us<00:01:40.540> because

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
going to demonstrate that for us because

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.550 
going to demonstrate that for us because
he<00:01:42.430> does<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.790> intuitively<00:01:43.420> ok<00:01:44.140> ok<00:01:44.470> I'm

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
he does that intuitively ok ok I'm

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.080 
he does that intuitively ok ok I'm
filming<00:01:44.740> explain<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.250> again<00:01:45.369> I<00:01:45.700> didn't<00:01:45.970> get

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
filming explain that again I didn't get

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.730 
filming explain that again I didn't get
it<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:46.630> basically<00:01:46.840> what<00:01:47.290> you<00:01:47.410> weren't<00:01:47.560> going

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
it so basically what you weren't going

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.140 
it so basically what you weren't going
to<00:01:47.830> want<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.070> do<00:01:48.190> with<00:01:48.340> me<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.580> technical<00:01:49.030> term

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
to want to do with me the technical term

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.820 
to want to do with me the technical term
behind<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.720> you're<00:01:50.320> going<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.530> want<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.680> keep

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
behind it you're going to want to keep

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.040 
behind it you're going to want to keep
the<00:01:51.009> vertical<00:01:51.460> inertia<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:52.270> your<00:01:52.570> sprocket

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
the vertical inertia of your sprocket

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.070 
the vertical inertia of your sprocket
bearings<00:01:53.380> right<00:01:53.619> okay<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.580> your<00:01:55.479> front<00:01:55.720> swing

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
bearings right okay and your front swing

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.450 
bearings right okay and your front swing
arm<00:01:56.290> caliper<00:01:56.830> vertex<00:01:57.960> equal<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.320> X<00:01:59.470> Rick<00:02:00.160> oh

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
arm caliper vertex equal to X Rick oh

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.990 
arm caliper vertex equal to X Rick oh
wait<00:02:01.180> what<00:02:02.020> no<00:02:02.470> that's<00:02:02.740> that's<00:02:03.040> like<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.670> mean

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
wait what no that's that's like I mean

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.690 
wait what no that's that's like I mean
it<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.180> all<00:02:04.270> had<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.540> learn<00:02:04.570> it<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:09.280> right<00:02:09.459> so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
it we all had to learn it all right so

00:02:09.700 --> 00:03:00.130 
it we all had to learn it all right so
college<00:02:10.119> boys<00:02:10.300> get<00:02:10.479> made<00:02:10.660> fun<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.899> here

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:19.750
