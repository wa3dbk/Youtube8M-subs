00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.870
 Hi, guys and girls, I hope so 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.490
 well today I bring good good news 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.019
 news because in our complaint of 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.419
 last weekend more specifically 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.650
 on Sunday they have had an answer 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.719
 there is a pretty positive answer 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.160
 first of all I would like to thank you 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.390
 everyone who participates is sending 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.580
 messages to the official accounts of 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.320
 battlefield spain that had it not been 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.480
 for the huge volume of people that 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.040
 was mobilized then surely everything 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.540
 I was stuck in an anecdote like that 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.130
 Thank you very much to each and every one 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.420
 in case there is someone who does not know what 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.770
 I'm talking the summary number and it's 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.539
 it turns out that last weekend 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.489
 a series of videos with 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:36.769
 quite indignant since the community 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.600
 manager of battlefield e espaÃ±a then 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.100
 is behaving a way or was it 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.269
 behaving very differently than 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.550
 what the community was doing 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:46.489
 international waterfill managers 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.260
 Australian English battlefield 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.730
 Latin American et cetera and what 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.769
 We basically asked for this to be left 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.879
 If so, well, yesterday, Monday, 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.899
 community manager of battlefield e 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.699
 Spain decided to contact 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.399
 with me on the phone we were talking 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.690
 around 20 minutes and good to me 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.059
 I liked it like a greeting but I liked it 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.559
 said hello not the said hello tells me that 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.730
 we can do to improve and then 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.240
 many things 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.410
 and many things I will not go to try 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.640
 point by point what we talked about in 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.550
 that conversation because it would be very 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.260
 tedious but basically he told me not to 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.550
 had had the time that it should and he 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.350
 would like to have had to devote to the 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.190
 community manager function and neither 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.540
 I asked him why it's not from me 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.150
 incumbency but it is clear that someone 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.110
 they can not pay you exclusively for 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.970
 perform the functions he performed 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.190
 as a community manager of battlefield 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.710
 but hey one thing I would like 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.000
 we had all clear is that all 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.890
 we agree that things 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.300
 so far what has been done wrong 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 it does not matter how it's done until 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.330
 now they're done, you can not 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.220
 change what matters is how they go 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.450
 to do from now on one of the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.300
 things that I feel the most pressure on 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.040
 getting personally is the subject of him 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.780
 the contact with the community the contact 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.100
 with users who interact with 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.750
 them by social networks that stops 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.130
 that's how well he said because it's a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.510
 delicate moment for the franchise already 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.370
 that first fill 4 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.480
 he won a widespread hatred in second 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.040
 place we are approaching the date of 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.390
 launching of battlefield hard line a 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.680
 game that is not tasteful dish for 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.850
 all of me personally I like 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.740
 pretty but I understand that there are other 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.120
 people who do not like and is a 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.400
 moment in which it is very important that 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.660
 that contact exists we also treat 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.640
 topics like the famous videos 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.050
 English and is that apparently so 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.630
 come from bat the international end and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.400
 their job is to translate them well then to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.540
 from now on he told me to throw him 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.370
 a look at the channel community 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 dedicated to battlefield in spain and if 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.970
 there is some video that can replace the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.260
 of English because that's how it will be for another 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.610
 side he proposed to me to have a relationship 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.140
 closest to the largest channels 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.490
 dedicated to battlefield and Spain as 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.740
 through all the comments that 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.480
 we receive in all our videos 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.100
 we can have generalized ideas about 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.150
 some issues some aspects and that that 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.160
 could help you to make your 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.210
 work we also talk about what we 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.800
 I wish there was a little more 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.000
 official support by the company 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.560
 towards the channels dedicated to 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.480
 battlefield but hey it's pretty 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.860
 difficult to specify in what and how 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.870
 that for the moment he stays a little bit in the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.880
 ditch the important thing here really is 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.260
 that changes everything in general lines that 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.780
 any battlefield user 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.099
 a doubt or a complaint or a congratulation 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.510
 you also have to write when they are done 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.159
 things well not because I have where 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.629
 come to know that on the other side there is a 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.579
 person who is going to receive who is going to get 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.470
 your positive or negative criticism but that 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.180
 he's going to catch it he told me 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.920
 materially impossible I do not have time 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.510
 to answer all the messages that I 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.459
 the hello arrive through social networks 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.780
 I know perfectly well if I do not either 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.709
 he answered all the messages take me 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.180
 through the social networks of 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.159
 comments of the videos are many 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.079
 comments and there's no time really 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.670
 we would like to answer them all 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.500
 Of course I do but it is that it is 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.329
 that the days have 24 hours 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.310
 you can not spend the day answering 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.450
 comments and you how do you do it good 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.560
 I therefore I do is answer the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.590
 messages that I think are from 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.790
 general interest and some other doubt 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.109
 if someone with ingenuity then makes me a 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.030
 joke and thanks me for following him the 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.500
 roll and joke a little bit with him and little 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.480
 more you can not really spend the day 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.400
 answering those and letting people know that 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.510
 you are there in the end this has been a bit 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.690
 above the issues that we have discussed 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.590
 so roughly in general lines 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.329
 let's hope the thing changes from now on 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.099
 go ahead and I repeat that they have done us 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.359
 ok things so far no matter what 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.950
 it matters what happens from 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.659
 now there was an approach there was a 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.370
 step forward and what matters is what 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.840
 happens from now on and as I said yesterday 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.890
 in social networks let's not be 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.390
 impertinent 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.580
 impertinent ones if we do not wait for a 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.690
 radical change overnight 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.069
 that does not exist 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.209
 let's let the seeds bloom 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.100
 let's let the thing go catching 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.600
 body go taking shape that 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.680
 things settle and well inside 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.930
 of a time we will see if all this has 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.900
 well worth it and finally like 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.480
 leave a very clear thing clearly and clearly 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.530
 is that we can help advise 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.519
 lean your shoulder on whatever it takes 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.709
 with all the good intentions of the world 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.970
 but it is not our responsibility that 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.010
 things are done well from 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.390
 Now we are very willing to collaborate 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.590
 in what is needed to the extent of what 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.540
 possible to the extent of our 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.010
 possibilities but it's not our 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.710
 responsibility that things are done 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.780
 ok and now if I said that little more than 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.910
 add simply celebrate this little 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.480
 big step and collaborate for a future 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.950
 best 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.470
 damn it that sounded too 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.350
 disney marine finally nothing more to add 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.520
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.110
 thank you very much everyone for your support 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.800
 and until next time 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.800
 chao chao
