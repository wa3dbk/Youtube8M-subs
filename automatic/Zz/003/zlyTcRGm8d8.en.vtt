here just to make it look a bit bigger
and<00:04:59.900> more<00:05:00.470> full<00:05:01.100> I<00:05:01.400> just<00:05:01.880> wanted<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.450> be<00:05:02.570> a

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
and more full I just wanted it to be a

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.360 
and more full I just wanted it to be a
little<00:05:02.840> bit<00:05:02.990> more<00:05:03.140> full<00:05:03.380> because<00:05:03.710> you<00:05:04.190> guys

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
little bit more full because you guys

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.860 
little bit more full because you guys
saw<00:05:04.610> that<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.910> cows<00:05:05.120> were<00:05:05.330> very<00:05:05.630> very

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
saw that the cows were very very

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.400 
saw that the cows were very very
different<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:07.300> just<00:05:08.300> take<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:08.510> paddle<00:05:08.900> brush<00:05:09.020> or

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
different so just take a paddle brush or

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.440 
different so just take a paddle brush or
your<00:05:09.590> fingers<00:05:10.100> I<00:05:10.220> find<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:10.790> I<00:05:10.850> like<00:05:10.970> using

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
your fingers I find that I like using

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.750 
your fingers I find that I like using
the<00:05:11.660> paddle<00:05:11.990> brush<00:05:12.140> more<00:05:12.500> because<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.550> catches

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
the paddle brush more because it catches

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.050 
the paddle brush more because it catches
all<00:05:14.180> of<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.740> hair<00:05:15.740> that's<00:05:15.920> shedding<00:05:16.430> better

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
all of the hair that's shedding better

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.030 
all of the hair that's shedding better
than<00:05:17.420> if<00:05:17.570> you<00:05:17.720> like<00:05:17.960> using<00:05:18.200> your<00:05:18.440> hands<00:05:18.830> and

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
than if you like using your hands and

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.670 
than if you like using your hands and
okay<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:20.000> just<00:05:20.060> prefer<00:05:20.540> it<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:21.260> comes<00:05:21.500> out

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
okay I just prefer it and it comes out

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.160 
okay I just prefer it and it comes out
to<00:05:21.890> like<00:05:22.070> these<00:05:22.460> sort<00:05:22.700> of<00:05:22.790> fluffy<00:05:23.270> cows<00:05:23.840> that

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
to like these sort of fluffy cows that

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.870 
to like these sort of fluffy cows that
look<00:05:24.380> much<00:05:24.980> more<00:05:25.250> natural<00:05:25.460> on<00:05:25.790> me<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.150> think

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
look much more natural on me I think

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:34.950 
look much more natural on me I think
or<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:28.940> towel<00:05:29.240> begins<00:05:30.110> another<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.890> length

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
or a towel begins another is the length

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.660 
or a towel begins another is the length
it's<00:05:35.960> about<00:05:36.200> 18<00:05:36.800> inches<00:05:37.010> I<00:05:37.430> would<00:05:37.460> say

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
it's about 18 inches I would say

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.640 
it's about 18 inches I would say
actually<00:05:37.910> really<00:05:38.480> long<00:05:38.660> and<00:05:38.840> was<00:05:38.960> only<00:05:39.140> 13

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
actually really long and was only 13

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.510 
actually really long and was only 13
pounds<00:05:39.860> I<00:05:40.190> think<00:05:40.220> it's<00:05:40.580> like<00:05:41.020> $13<00:05:42.020> in<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:42.230> u.s.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
pounds I think it's like $13 in the u.s.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.030 
pounds I think it's like $13 in the u.s.
so<00:05:43.520> it's<00:05:43.880> really<00:05:44.150> really<00:05:44.480> pretty<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:45.110> don't

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
so it's really really pretty I don't

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.310 
so it's really really pretty I don't
expect<00:05:46.370> this<00:05:46.610> to<00:05:46.670> last<00:05:46.910> far<00:05:47.450> off<00:05:47.750> because<00:05:47.990> I

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
expect this to last far off because I

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.410 
expect this to last far off because I
mean<00:05:48.500> it<00:05:48.590> was<00:05:48.710> really<00:05:49.010> cheap<00:05:49.250> and<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:50.240> does

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
mean it was really cheap and it does

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.690 
mean it was really cheap and it does
shed<00:05:50.750> once<00:05:51.020> he<00:05:51.200> like<00:05:51.440> run<00:05:51.950> your<00:05:52.100> fingers<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.550> it

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
shed once he like run your fingers to it

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.330 
shed once he like run your fingers to it
um<00:05:52.940> and<00:05:53.570> I<00:05:54.320> think<00:05:54.380> we'll<00:05:54.620> probably<00:05:54.650> frizz<00:05:55.130> up

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
um and I think we'll probably frizz up

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.070 
um and I think we'll probably frizz up
maybe<00:05:55.610> after<00:05:56.000> a<00:05:56.030> few<00:05:56.270> weeks<00:05:56.390> so<00:05:56.660> like<00:05:56.810> a

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
maybe after a few weeks so like a

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.680 
maybe after a few weeks so like a
monthly<00:05:57.500> favorite<00:05:57.980> every<00:05:58.550> day<00:05:58.730> but<00:05:59.360> if<00:05:59.540> you

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
monthly favorite every day but if you

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.720 
monthly favorite every day but if you
wear<00:06:00.020> it<00:06:00.050> and<00:06:00.500> then<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:00.710> put<00:06:00.920> it<00:06:01.040> back<00:06:01.190> in<00:06:01.430> the

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
wear it and then you put it back in the

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.270 
wear it and then you put it back in the
net<00:06:02.540> and<00:06:02.810> put<00:06:03.260> it<00:06:03.440> somewhere<00:06:03.740> safe<00:06:03.890> so<00:06:04.190> it

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
net and put it somewhere safe so it

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.350 
net and put it somewhere safe so it
doesn't<00:06:04.550> get<00:06:04.640> all<00:06:04.670> tangled

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
doesn't get all tangled

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.120 
doesn't get all tangled
I<00:06:05.450> think<00:06:05.810> it'll<00:06:06.050> wear<00:06:06.260> this<00:06:06.350> on<00:06:06.590> and<00:06:06.770> off<00:06:06.890> for

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
I think it'll wear this on and off for

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.160 
I think it'll wear this on and off for
quite<00:06:07.220> a<00:06:07.340> while<00:06:07.580> if<00:06:08.390> that's<00:06:08.570> what<00:06:08.750> you<00:06:08.870> wanted

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
here from a distance so this is what it

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.640 
here from a distance so this is what it
looks<00:07:25.729> like<00:07:25.940> and<00:07:26.240> as<00:07:26.870> you<00:07:26.990> can<00:07:27.110> see<00:07:27.259> the<00:07:27.380> top

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
looks like and as you can see the top

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.580 
looks like and as you can see the top
bits<00:07:27.979> armed<00:07:28.490> like<00:07:29.030> the<00:07:29.180> whole<00:07:29.360> hair<00:07:30.289> pieces

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.590 
bits armed like the whole hair pieces

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.279 
bits armed like the whole hair pieces
later<00:07:30.949> so<00:07:31.370> as<00:07:31.970> you<00:07:32.150> can<00:07:32.270> see<00:07:32.330> this<00:07:32.600> is<00:07:32.750> short

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:33.289 
later so as you can see this is short

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:37.060 
later so as you can see this is short
when<00:07:34.100> it<00:07:34.190> goes<00:07:34.340> all<00:07:34.610> the<00:07:34.639> way<00:07:34.850> down<00:07:34.940> to<00:07:35.449> here<00:07:36.070> so

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.070 
when it goes all the way down to here so

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.830 
when it goes all the way down to here so
it's<00:07:37.190> actually<00:07:37.310> really<00:07:37.520> long<00:07:37.880> this<00:07:38.360> shot<00:07:38.720> if

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840
