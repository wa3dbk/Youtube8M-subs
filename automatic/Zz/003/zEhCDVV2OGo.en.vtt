00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.950
 and 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.590
 hi colimenses how is it in I am 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.189
 Karen and I had a long time that I did not 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.320
 taught how to prepare a recipe with gold 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.500
 I know that many of you do not have 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.380
 oven or do not like to use it but of 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.930
 this is really super rich and I think that 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.520
 for a special occasion it is super 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.350
 good for a birthday because sometimes 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.300
 many of you ask me in 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.550
 facebook from an action to prepare 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.200
 on a dad's birthday or the common and 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.780
 from his mom or some of his brothers 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.750
 so this is really an option 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.699
 very good for a special occasion if 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.469
 you do not like to use the oven but if you 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.449
 you use the oven very often you can 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.730
 use this recipe for a Sunday 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.530

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.230

 ingredients are super easy to 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.890
 get if I can see how it is prepared 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.920
 this delicious cheesecake churro 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.170
 and it's that we're going to need 350 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.450
 grams of cream cheese this has to 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.180
 be at room temperature 1 cup of 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.479
 sugar an egg a little cinnamon 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.280
 vanilla and 340 grams of dough for 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.710
 prepare bread is more can be 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.810
 get in the supermarket where 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.060
 they sell imported things or they also 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.220
 they can buy it at the bakery they do not go 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.259
 to find this brand but if the one 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.300
 they make the bakeries then nothing else 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.580
 life in mass to make bread before 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.259
 everything is going to preheat your oven to 170 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.270
 degrees let's start preparing 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.460
 our stuffing for that in a 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.289
 you're going to put the cream cheese in 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.289
 you add the egg but before you beat it 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.630
 mid afternoon of sugar and vanilla 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.430
 we are going to beat it very well until it 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.780
 mix all the ingredients and that one 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.340
 creamed like this 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.140
 let's make the base of our 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.180
 cheesecake what I'm going to do is clean 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.160
 the table to start stretching the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.340
 walls and I'm going to divide the whole mass into 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.340
 two 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.730
 yes no 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.330
 I 'm going to make you two rectangles 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.330
 size of my mold in this way 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.150
 what you are going to do is add half 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.130
 of the sugar that you left in the mold and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.550
 with a little cinnamon you are going to mix it 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.550
 very well 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.090
 is your biggest mass chart you're going to 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.090
 put over this way 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.989
 hear the whole edge of the mold mass 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.209
 to prevent them from shrinking now you're going to 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.299
 add all your cheese mixture for 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:10.430
 on top of this and with the spatula you go 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.200
 to spread very well with another part of 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.099
 mass you will do the same to cover it 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.220
 above 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.110
 in this way alive to gather the dough 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.760
 from above with the one below by pressing 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:26.530
 the shore in this way I get a lot 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.530
 over here I'm going to cut a little 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.340
 do not finish add sugar and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.340
 missing cinnamon 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.030
 and sprinkled in this way 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.320
 was subjected to the oven around 30 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.670
 at 35 minutes at 170 degrees you're going to know 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.620
 when the country is ready because the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.330
 cover is golden when there is 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.280
 after 30 minutes you will see that the 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.220
 shores of the country are golden brown is 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:04.110
 When you take it out, do it carefully and 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.110
 let it cool before serving 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.840
 A) Yes 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.570

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.940

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.740
 your face you have to save the seed 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.900
 try to crush the against the wall of 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.080
