00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.670 
for three years ya allah the hiccups
that<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.360> saw<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> second<00:02:04.140> half<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.500> last

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that we saw in the second half of last

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.260 
that we saw in the second half of last
year<00:02:05.009> was<00:02:05.159> really<00:02:05.430> them<00:02:05.579> beefing<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:06.060> their

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
year was really them beefing up their

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.700 
year was really them beefing up their
production<00:02:06.750> lines<00:02:06.960> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
production lines to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.790 
production lines to
ahead<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.020> facility<00:02:10.709> in

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
ahead of this and to get the facility in

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.770 
ahead of this and to get the facility in
order<00:02:11.100> for<00:02:11.280> them<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.430> produce<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.209> higher<00:02:12.360> level

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
order for them to produce a higher level

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.809 
order for them to produce a higher level
so<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.560> think<00:02:13.920> that's<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.250> pretty<00:02:14.400> conservative

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
so I think that's a pretty conservative

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.970 
so I think that's a pretty conservative
estimate<00:02:15.420> out<00:02:15.569> there<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.530> there's<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.800> lot<00:02:16.950> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
estimate out there now there's a lot of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.309 
estimate out there now there's a lot of
skepticism<00:02:17.340> get<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.120> again<00:02:18.420> yes<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.990> has<00:02:19.140> been

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
skepticism get and again yes it has been

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.290 
skepticism get and again yes it has been

could deliver 20,000 cars then we didn't

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.090 
could deliver 20,000 cars then we didn't
believe<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.510> can<00:03:27.720> deliver<00:03:27.959> 30,000<00:03:28.709> cars<00:03:28.890> we

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
don't believe we can deliver 50,000 cars

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.750 
don't believe we can deliver 50,000 cars
and<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.709> know<00:03:31.769> starting<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> new<00:03:32.519> car

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760

and so you know starting a new car
company<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.150> quite<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.420> big<00:03:33.720> thing<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.320> uh<00:03:34.350> and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
i think that you know the the car will

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.229 
i think that you know the the car will
have<00:03:37.470> many<00:03:37.650> features<00:03:38.130> are<00:03:38.370> new<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.209> the

have many features are new to the
marketplace<00:03:39.660> auto<00:03:40.170> pilot<00:03:40.290> one<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.890> them<00:03:41.010> if

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
marketplace auto pilot one of them if

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.100 
marketplace auto pilot one of them if
you<00:03:41.280> look<00:03:41.430> back<00:03:41.610> at<00:03:41.820> whether<00:03:41.970> malo<00:03:42.299> s<00:03:42.540> was<00:03:42.840> when

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
you look back at whether malo s was when

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.310 
you look back at whether malo s was when
it<00:03:43.230> first<00:03:43.260> came<00:03:43.590> out<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.040> where<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.549> is<00:03:44.670> today

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
it first came out and where it is today

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.660 
it first came out and where it is today
grossly<00:03:46.320> different<00:03:46.799> car<00:03:46.950> i<00:03:46.980> mean<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:47.430> it's

I<00:04:09.269> was<00:04:09.719> just<00:04:09.840> thinking<00:04:10.140> about<00:04:10.170> that

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
I was just thinking about that

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.619 
I was just thinking about that
transition<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.459> autonomous<00:04:11.969> vehicles<00:04:12.359> and

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
transition to autonomous vehicles and

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.179 
transition to autonomous vehicles and
what<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:12.930> want<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.349> think<00:04:13.590> it's<00:04:13.739> happening<00:04:14.040> much

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
what I want I think it's happening much

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.400 
what I want I think it's happening much
faster<00:04:14.219> than<00:04:14.909> we<00:04:15.030> really<00:04:15.269> imagine<00:04:15.689> so<00:04:16.169> when<00:04:16.380> I

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
faster than we really imagine so when I

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.249 
faster than we really imagine so when I
hear<00:04:16.709> about<00:04:16.949> these<00:04:17.160> cars<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.570> life<00:04:18.840> cycle

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
hear about these cars and the life cycle

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.390 
hear about these cars and the life cycle
amount<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.530> money<00:04:19.680> that's<00:04:19.769> being<00:04:19.889> put<00:04:20.100> into<00:04:20.280> it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
amount of money that's being put into it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.770 
amount of money that's being put into it
and<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.699> think<00:04:20.910> we'll<00:04:21.000> be<00:04:21.030> seeing<00:04:21.269> autonomous

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
and I think we'll be seeing autonomous

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.659 
and I think we'll be seeing autonomous
cars<00:04:21.959> in<00:04:22.139> five<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.500> ten<00:04:22.650> years<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.400> wonder

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
cars in five to ten years and I wonder

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.370 
cars in five to ten years and I wonder
what<00:04:23.940> will<00:04:24.240> happen<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> demand<00:04:25.199> for

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
what will happen to the demand for

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.740 
what will happen to the demand for
things<00:04:25.590> like<00:04:25.680> SUVs<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.580> clearly<00:04:27.210> all<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.660> the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
things like SUVs and clearly all of the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.629 
things like SUVs and clearly all of the
future<00:04:28.020> cars<00:04:28.259> will<00:04:28.500> be<00:04:28.650> having<00:04:28.979> be<00:04:29.460> much

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
future cars will be having be much

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.580 
future cars will be having be much
cleaner<00:04:29.850> fuels<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.479> be<00:04:30.810> very<00:04:31.020> dependent<00:04:31.530> on

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
cleaner fuels and be very dependent on

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.879 
cleaner fuels and be very dependent on
batteries<00:04:32.389> so<00:04:33.389> what<00:04:33.690> about<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:34.139> battery<00:04:34.440> then

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
batteries so what about the battery then

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.249 
batteries so what about the battery then
I<00:04:35.100> mean<00:04:35.250> he<00:04:35.820> addressed<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.150> criticism<00:04:36.810> it's

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
I mean he addressed the criticism it's

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.990 
I mean he addressed the criticism it's
gonna<00:04:37.410> be<00:04:37.590> double<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:37.979> power<00:04:38.160> but<00:04:38.550> still<00:04:38.820> is

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
gonna be double the power but still is

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.700 
gonna be double the power but still is
that<00:04:39.030> enough<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.750> criticism<00:04:40.259> was<00:04:40.350> correct

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
that enough the criticism was correct

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.939 
that enough the criticism was correct
and<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.849> know<00:04:41.940> people<00:04:42.090> comp<00:04:42.449> it<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:42.949> diesel

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
and you know people comp it to a diesel

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.370 
and you know people comp it to a diesel
generator<00:04:43.979> it<00:04:44.639> doesn't<00:04:45.090> work<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.360> same<00:04:45.389> you

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
generator it doesn't work the same you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.749 
generator it doesn't work the same you
know<00:04:46.410> if<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:46.680> pair<00:04:46.889> it<00:04:46.919> with<00:04:47.009> solar<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.550> makes

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
know if you pair it with solar it makes

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.850 
know if you pair it with solar it makes
sense<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.630> big<00:04:48.840> story<00:04:48.990> is<00:04:49.229> here<00:04:49.500> though<00:04:49.710> is

here's<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.720> thing<00:05:09.960> I<00:05:09.990> mean<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.259> Ben's<00:05:10.440> point<00:05:10.800> I

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
here's the thing I mean to Ben's point I

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.890 
here's the thing I mean to Ben's point I
think<00:05:11.430> it's<00:05:11.550> true<00:05:11.759> that<00:05:11.910> Elon<00:05:12.360> Musk<00:05:12.570> doesn't

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
think it's true that Elon Musk doesn't

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.950 
think it's true that Elon Musk doesn't
get<00:05:12.990> enough<00:05:13.320> credit<00:05:13.380> for<00:05:13.710> his<00:05:14.960> achievements

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
get enough credit for his achievements

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.230 
get enough credit for his achievements
but<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.289> reason<00:05:16.770> is<00:05:17.159> time<00:05:17.849> and<00:05:18.060> time<00:05:18.210> again

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
but the reason is time and time again

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.050 
but the reason is time and time again
every<00:05:19.229> product<00:05:19.530> that<00:05:19.800> he<00:05:20.010> delivers<00:05:20.550> he<00:05:20.880> comes

to market a little early with almost a

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.310 
to market a little early with almost a
beta<00:05:23.400> version<00:05:23.580> their<00:05:24.330> problems<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:25.020> need<00:05:25.199> to

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
beta version their problems that need to

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.140 
beta version their problems that need to
be<00:05:25.349> fixed<00:05:25.650> now<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.889> Model<00:05:26.250> S<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.520> perfected<00:05:27.060> it

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
be fixed now the Model S is perfected it

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.430 
be fixed now the Model S is perfected it
wasn't<00:05:27.389> like<00:05:27.510> that<00:05:27.539> when<00:05:27.780> it<00:05:27.930> came<00:05:28.050> out<00:05:28.229> the

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
wasn't like that when it came out the

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.890 
wasn't like that when it came out the
Roadster<00:05:28.889> certainly<00:05:29.699> wasn't<00:05:29.940> a<00:05:30.180> product<00:05:30.870> that

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
Roadster certainly wasn't a product that

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.379 
Roadster certainly wasn't a product that
was<00:05:31.110> ready<00:05:31.590> for<00:05:31.860> market<00:05:32.039> and<00:05:32.430> I<00:05:32.760> assume<00:05:33.300> the

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
was ready for market and I assume the

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.050 
was ready for market and I assume the
Model<00:05:33.659> X<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.830> powerwall<00:05:35.370> will<00:05:35.610> be

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
Model X and the powerwall will be

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.490 
Model X and the powerwall will be
similar<00:05:36.300> stories<00:05:36.860> he<00:05:37.860> /<00:05:38.460> promises<00:05:39.180> he<00:05:39.930> then

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
similar stories he / promises he then

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.649 
similar stories he / promises he then
delivers<00:05:40.919> too<00:05:41.159> late<00:05:41.400> i<00:05:41.430> think<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.120> look

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
delivers too late i think is and look

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.850 
delivers too late i think is and look
we're<00:05:42.870> still<00:05:42.990> here<00:05:43.349> so<00:05:43.470> we<00:05:43.530> could<00:05:43.620> see<00:05:43.770> the

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
we're still here so we could see the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.890 
we're still here so we could see the
product<00:05:44.220> it's<00:05:44.340> not<00:05:44.490> too<00:05:45.060> late<00:05:45.210> for<00:05:45.270> us<00:05:45.509> to<00:05:45.690> use

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
product it's not too late for us to use

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.480 
product it's not too late for us to use
them<00:05:46.169> but<00:05:46.380> just<00:05:46.560> later<00:05:46.770> than<00:05:46.979> his<00:05:47.099> deadline

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
them but just later than his deadline

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.980 
them but just later than his deadline
you'll<00:05:47.849> probably<00:05:48.120> see<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.389> same<00:05:48.659> thing<00:05:48.870> with

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
you'll probably see the same thing with

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.870 
you'll probably see the same thing with
the<00:05:49.020> gigafactory<00:05:49.349> it's<00:05:49.800> just<00:05:49.949> not<00:05:50.460> going<00:05:50.759> to

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
the gigafactory it's just not going to

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.719 
the gigafactory it's just not going to
meet<00:05:51.240> his<00:05:52.050> projections<00:05:52.770> in<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.130> time<00:05:53.370> limit

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
meet his projections in the time limit

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.490 
meet his projections in the time limit
that<00:05:53.820> he<00:05:53.940> sets<00:05:54.330> I'm<00:05:54.599> sure<00:05:54.780> that<00:05:55.020> in<00:05:55.199> the<00:05:55.289> long

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
that he sets I'm sure that in the long

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.610 
that he sets I'm sure that in the long
run<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:56.099> will<00:05:56.130> be<00:05:56.400> totally<00:05:56.940> awesome<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.930> he<00:05:58.169> it

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
run it will be totally awesome and he it

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.399 
run it will be totally awesome and he it
will<00:05:58.889> be<00:05:59.009> do<00:05:59.539> accommodations<00:06:00.539> for<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:01.020> but<00:06:01.229> I

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409 
will be do accommodations for it but I
