00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
on this bike now the people came in and

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.389 
on this bike now the people came in and
it<00:00:58.809> was<00:00:58.840> randomly<00:00:59.410> assigned<00:00:59.829> they<00:01:00.219> did<00:01:00.370> a

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
it was randomly assigned they did a

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.420 
it was randomly assigned they did a
pretest<00:01:00.940> with<00:01:01.600> standard<00:01:02.440> warmup<00:01:02.829> conditions

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
pretest with standard warmup conditions

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.880 
pretest with standard warmup conditions
and<00:01:03.640> then<00:01:04.119> in<00:01:04.269> another<00:01:04.570> warm-up<00:01:05.019> condition<00:01:05.560> we

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
and then in another warm-up condition we

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.580 
and then in another warm-up condition we
actually<00:01:06.310> overload<00:01:06.939> them<00:01:07.210> within<00:01:07.600> 10<00:01:07.960> seconds

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
actually overload them within 10 seconds

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.170 
actually overload them within 10 seconds
to<00:01:08.740> where<00:01:08.890> they<00:01:09.070> can't<00:01:09.369> pedal<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> bike

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
to where they can't pedal the bike

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.480 
to where they can't pedal the bike
there's<00:01:10.570> too<00:01:10.750> much<00:01:10.930> resistance<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.590> pedal<00:01:12.040> so

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
there's too much resistance to pedal so

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.789 
there's too much resistance to pedal so
they<00:01:12.610> hit<00:01:12.820> complete<00:01:13.270> fatigue<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.530> short

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
they hit complete fatigue in the short

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.580 
they hit complete fatigue in the short
term<00:01:15.159> we<00:01:15.790> then<00:01:16.000> have<00:01:16.299> them<00:01:16.540> sit<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.080> rest<00:01:17.290> for

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
term we then have them sit and rest for

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.499 
term we then have them sit and rest for
five<00:01:17.770> minutes<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.460> then<00:01:18.520> we<00:01:18.909> conduct<00:01:19.299> the

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
five minutes and then we conduct the

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.840 
five minutes and then we conduct the
power<00:01:19.689> test<00:01:20.049> again<00:01:20.439> so<00:01:20.710> we<00:01:20.830> have<00:01:20.950> randomized

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
power test again so we have randomized

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.539 
power test again so we have randomized
conditions<00:01:22.540> same<00:01:23.200> tasks<00:01:23.740> different<00:01:24.130> warm-up

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
conditions same tasks different warm-up

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.910 
conditions same tasks different warm-up
protocols<00:01:25.119> with<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.810> intent<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.350> see<00:01:26.680> whether

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
protocols with the intent to see whether

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.069

we<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.369> actually<00:01:27.580> elicit<00:01:28.180> a<00:01:28.509> higher<00:01:28.720> power

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
we can actually elicit a higher power

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.200 
we can actually elicit a higher power
output<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:30.070> our<00:01:30.189> paddle<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.670> paddle<00:01:30.850> paddle

you<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:10.799> get<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> quickly<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> burns

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
you can get to it quickly but it burns

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.199 
you can get to it quickly but it burns
up<00:02:12.540> fast<00:02:12.900> that's<00:02:13.500> really<00:02:13.830> cool<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.489> CSUMB

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
up fast that's really cool that to CSUMB

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.630 
up fast that's really cool that to CSUMB
students<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.170> research<00:02:16.739> was<00:02:17.010> peer-reviewed

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
students this research was peer-reviewed

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.250 
students this research was peer-reviewed
and<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:17.910> was<00:02:18.000> accepted<00:02:18.569> at<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.720> conference

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
and it was accepted at the conference

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.500 
and it was accepted at the conference
that<00:02:19.500> has<00:02:19.650> international<00:02:20.069> attendance<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.090> so

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
that has international attendance and so

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.509 
that has international attendance and so
it's<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.720> big<00:02:21.900> deal<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.140> them<00:02:22.440> they're<00:02:23.310> both

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
it's a big deal for them they're both

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.640 
it's a big deal for them they're both
working<00:02:24.180> with<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.660> undergraduate<00:02:25.290> research

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
working with the undergraduate research

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.100 
working with the undergraduate research
Opportunity<00:02:26.400> Center<00:02:26.580> here<00:02:26.880> at<00:02:27.030> CSUMB<00:02:27.569> as<00:02:27.840> well

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
Opportunity Center here at CSUMB as well

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.449 
Opportunity Center here at CSUMB as well
and<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.920> wonderful<00:02:29.250> opportunity

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
and so it's just a wonderful opportunity

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.360 
and so it's just a wonderful opportunity
for<00:02:30.239> good<00:02:30.690> science<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.470> good<00:02:31.680> opportunity

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
for good science and good opportunity

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.770 
for good science and good opportunity
for<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.670> students<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.239> get<00:02:33.330> out<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.660> present
