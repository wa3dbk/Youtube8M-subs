00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.970
 good people are like that and well I bring you 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.049
 this little video for 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.049
 but with this 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.869
 to say that they are already the hack 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.299
 of the been streets in the play 3 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.250
 surely they are a long time ago 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.789
 but I'm so dumb that I find out today 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.970
 yes today, this is a small tutorial 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.890
 to tell us how to do check 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.320
 very simple is never the projectile or 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.360
 Well first of all you should download a 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.130
 file that would download you giving it here but 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.110
 as I have already downloaded it is to leave 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.900
 in the description in bonds I will leave this 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.810
 link 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.090
 and you're doing well once downloaded 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.120
 this does not need winrar although it is very 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.540
 weird you have almost all the winners and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:53.370
 it will come out this weird but you have to extract 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:57.840
 where you want and you get a folder like 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.449
 this seems s3 open and you see that it's all 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.149
 that truth so bless blah blah blah 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.170
 it's all ok you'll need a pendrive 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.299
 you go out 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.510
 either 2 gigs the least 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.360
 have 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 It's good for you I'm going now, maybe 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.630
 to teach him everything 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.030
 once you will have the empty in the folder to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.340
 the root of the pendrive or nothing inside 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.289
 of the entire folder 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.850
 and then this pendrive goes inside the 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.679
 I'll explain how the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.920
 process of this engraving with the capture 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:33.040
 now this video is very short and I see you 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.010
 in the captive come 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.990
 good people we are already in the play well 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.240
 to follow the first thing to do 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.320
 before to not lose our data and 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.909
 keep them well create a new user 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.640
 that you can call it whatever you want, I'm going 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.740
 to leave just in case so I know that users 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.549
 each 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.830
 we give it to ok we go to the account that 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.200
 we have created 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.860
 no need to sign up for playstation 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.510
 network what you have to do is go here 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.960
 to saved data tools from 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.610
 play 3 usb device and copy the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.850
 game of storm 3 that comes out here 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:17.290
 copy copying 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.460
 will complete the copy and now we go to 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.460
 croft and wait for your moment 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.120
 I'm going to make it good to extract the disc I'm going to 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.120
 change it in a moment 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.720
 good people , I've changed it now 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.720
 We wait for the disk to this end 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.829
 well once it's gone we go to the game 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.500
 we will have to wait for the whole roll this 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.890
 of the brands that make the game the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.890
 table 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.010
 namco bandai that the uer cyberconnect2 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.030
 it's a new account, we'll have to wait 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.700
 to install the trophies but nothing 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.750
 It takes little or I hope so 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.750
 if the fast one 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.500
 a negative fact is that they are only 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.120
 playable in story mode are 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.190
 trying to put them in the versus mode 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.190
 but because of the complicated 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.160
 well let's go here be be 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.160
 to be to be to be to be to be to be 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.420
 loading 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.420
 Completed 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.340
 father dad dad 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.300
 let's go to the adventure mode definitively upload 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.300
 starting game 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.400
 we have to go to the side in the same 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.400
 Street 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.859
 I think I'm not sure 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.380
 loading 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.620
 if you see but not to finish to do 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.650
 a compact as soon as possible and look 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.039
 start and we have these three as 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.050
 supports that is as teammates and 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.830
 now a lot of trophies will come out but 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.830
 all in a row 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.510
 It's the first time I made this month the 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.600
 trophy followed 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.460
 to the top of the waves 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.790
 around here on this road we 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.830
 we will find 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.180
 Now that is a small spoiler 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.180
 when you pass the game you get a 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.460
 mission that is like the little machines 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.860
 damn of these two the white texts 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.100
 that you get a black flame and if the 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.170
 you find a fight with one as that 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.350
 now a little more palante comes a sale 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.350
 a 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.530
 look here you see investigate eye is 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.120
 found low low vale and now 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.340
 we can choose any educated who 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.870
 as a main character to me 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.840
 personally that I liked 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.200
 moment has been the third recharge we 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.990
 we put to this one and at the same time I think 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:51.360
 which is this as supports and now saves 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:54.750
 that a 66 quite is quite brutal 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.500
 look at you from this one 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.500
 look to you 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.160
 to jump loading and you see here mini is 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.680
 useful but good of equals 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.480
 and warn that this does not harm the 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.010
 game or do not have any fear in 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.230
 do it because this is just a game 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.750
 saved therefore does not affect the 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.400
 disk is worth 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.960
 and days as you can see I can play 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.750
 perfectly the bad the only thing that 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.840
 It changes is that I have known streets 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.240
 shuriken are thrown to the circle and stick 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.330
 squared let the square and the 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.860
 circle they exchange their functions but 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.910
 you see for the rest you can play 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.560
 perfectly with them happens 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.700
 and good people, this is all 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.790
 you want to play with all the details 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.160
 then repeat the same process 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.680
 and this does not have more complication 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.260
 they are trying to put the 2 short and 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.880
 support 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.530
 and it seems to me that they have already achieved 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.530
 done but I have not tried that hack yet 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:07:00.080
 and then, nothing, this is all, if it has 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:01.339
 liked and has been useful of alain live and 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.869
 do not forget to follow me on twitter 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.329
 to know when I'm going to record with 

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:06.820
 subscribers but you come complaining about 

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:09.250
 I do not notice 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.960
 good people this is all look how bad it is 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.090
 that this sugar or the pse I do not know if 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.370
 It was the same one that will not be his girl who 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.410
 it does not do anything it is already breaded the 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.490
 poor but he touches me that he does 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.490
 take out the copy is there 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:26.320
 to the people this is all and even the 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:30.000
 next video chao 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.000
 this house of the cojones
