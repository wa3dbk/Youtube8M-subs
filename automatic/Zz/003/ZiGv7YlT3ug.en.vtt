and<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.850> MRI<00:02:21.060> scan<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.780> your<00:02:21.900> brain

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
and on the MRI scan this is your brain

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.250 
and on the MRI scan this is your brain
and<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.550> spinal<00:02:23.820> cord<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.930> spinal

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
and this is your spinal cord the spinal

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.720 
and this is your spinal cord the spinal
cord<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.590> an<00:02:25.709> extension<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> brain<00:02:26.550> it's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
cord is an extension of the brain it's

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.229 
cord is an extension of the brain it's
made<00:02:26.880> out<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.209> same<00:02:27.480> basic<00:02:27.900> stuff<00:02:28.440> and

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
made out of the same basic stuff and

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.940 
made out of the same basic stuff and
normally<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.360> court<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.260> spinal<00:02:31.650> canal

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
normally the court is in a spinal canal

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.650 
normally the court is in a spinal canal
and<00:02:32.010> there's<00:02:32.280> plenty<00:02:32.550> of<00:02:32.700> room<00:02:32.790> around<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
and there's plenty of room around it so

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.150 
and there's plenty of room around it so
normally<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.200> spinal<00:02:34.560> cord<00:02:34.769> lives<00:02:35.010> at<00:02:35.100> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
normally the spinal cord lives at a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.310 
normally the spinal cord lives at a
channel<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:36.000> when<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.299> move<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:37.200> move

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
channel and when you move you move

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.960 
channel and when you move you move
around<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.190> designed<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.700> way

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
around and it's designed that way

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.490 
around and it's designed that way
because<00:02:39.299> when<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> spinal<00:02:39.840> cord<00:02:39.989> gets<00:02:40.200> touched

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
because when a spinal cord gets touched

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.110 
because when a spinal cord gets touched
it<00:02:40.739> essentially<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.310> get<00:02:41.459> damaged<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
it essentially can get damaged and

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.810 
it essentially can get damaged and
what's<00:02:42.959> happening<00:02:43.320> with<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.890> you're

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
what's happening with you is you're

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.120 
what's happening with you is you're
developing<00:02:45.120> arthritis<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.650> arthritis

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
developing arthritis and the arthritis

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.610 
developing arthritis and the arthritis
is<00:02:47.280> causing<00:02:47.760> bone<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.600> grow<00:02:48.780> into<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.320> spinal

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
is causing bone to grow into this spinal

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130 
is causing bone to grow into this spinal
canal<00:02:49.980> as<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.730> result<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.390> bone<00:02:51.570> growing<00:02:51.959> in

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
canal as a result of the bone growing in

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.600 
canal as a result of the bone growing in
the<00:02:52.290> spinal<00:02:52.709> cord<00:02:52.980> itself<00:02:53.100> is<00:02:53.459> getting

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the spinal cord itself is getting

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.420 
the spinal cord itself is getting
pinched<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:55.170> what's<00:02:55.320> happening<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.890> you're

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
pinched so what's happening is you're

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.360 
pinched so what's happening is you're
the<00:02:56.850> sensors<00:02:57.330> in<00:02:57.480> your<00:02:57.510> feet<00:02:57.930> are<00:02:58.739> trying<00:02:59.220> to

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
the sensors in your feet are trying to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.860 
the sensors in your feet are trying to
communicate<00:02:59.549> with<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> brain<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.299> tell<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
communicate with the brain and tell the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.960 
communicate with the brain and tell the
brain<00:03:01.080> where<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.470> feet<00:03:01.650> are<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> brain

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
brain where the feet are and the brain

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.400 
brain where the feet are and the brain
is<00:03:03.000> trying<00:03:03.299> to<00:03:03.420> tell<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> feet<00:03:03.930> where<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.230> go

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
is trying to tell the feet where to go

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.050 
is trying to tell the feet where to go
and<00:03:04.769> what's<00:03:04.950> happening<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.670> signals

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
and what's happening is the signals

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.090 
and what's happening is the signals
aren't<00:03:06.269> getting<00:03:06.600> there<00:03:06.750> fast<00:03:07.019> enough<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.590> when

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
aren't getting there fast enough so when

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.500 
aren't getting there fast enough so when
you<00:03:08.190> move<00:03:08.370> your<00:03:08.580> foot<00:03:08.760> your<00:03:09.060> brain<00:03:09.269> doesn't

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
you move your foot your brain doesn't

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.330 
you move your foot your brain doesn't
know<00:03:09.630> where<00:03:09.810> your<00:03:09.930> feet<00:03:10.080> are<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.590> as<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.890> result

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
know where your feet are and as a result

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.430 
know where your feet are and as a result
you<00:03:11.790> really<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.630> difficulty<00:03:13.080> coordinating

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
you really have difficulty coordinating

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.650 
you really have difficulty coordinating
your<00:03:13.950> movements<00:03:14.400> say<00:03:14.910> things<00:03:15.150> happening<00:03:15.540> with

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
your movements say things happening with

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.289 
your movements say things happening with
your<00:03:15.810> hands<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.709> goal<00:03:16.920> here<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.280> number<00:03:18.060> one

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
your hands the goal here is number one

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.259 
your hands the goal here is number one
to<00:03:18.780> get<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.590> pressure<00:03:19.890> off<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.610> spinal<00:03:21.030> cord

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
to get the pressure off the spinal cord

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.080 
to get the pressure off the spinal cord
in<00:03:22.230> other<00:03:22.350> words<00:03:22.590> we<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:22.980> tape<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
in other words we have to tape the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.259 
in other words we have to tape the
channel<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:25.220> here<00:03:26.220> which<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.640> normal<00:03:27.030> and

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
channel this here which is normal and

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.930 
channel this here which is normal and
make<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:28.200> area<00:03:28.650> where<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.430> cord<00:03:29.820> is

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
make that area where the cord is

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.660 
make that area where the cord is
severely<00:03:30.239> compressed<00:03:30.920> looks<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.340> area

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
severely compressed looks like that area

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.729 
severely compressed looks like that area
and<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.329> options<00:03:33.690> are<00:03:33.780> twofold<00:03:34.230> number<00:03:34.410> one

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
and the options are twofold number one

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.350 
and the options are twofold number one
we<00:03:34.980> can<00:03:35.100> go<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.370> from<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.850> front<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.120> your<00:03:36.209> neck

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
we can go in from the front of your neck

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.160 
we can go in from the front of your neck
and<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:36.930> can<00:03:37.110> remove<00:03:37.410> these<00:03:37.709> large<00:03:37.980> Spurs<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
and we can remove these large Spurs and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.440 
and we can remove these large Spurs and
fuse<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.319> bones<00:03:40.530> together<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:41.760> alternate<00:03:42.270> to

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
fuse the bones together the alternate to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.229 
fuse the bones together the alternate to
a<00:03:42.480> fusion<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.110> we<00:03:44.010> can<00:03:44.220> go<00:03:44.370> from<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.790> back<00:03:45.000> your

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
a fusion is we can go from the back your

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.620 
a fusion is we can go from the back your
neck<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.690> take<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.349> arch<00:03:46.700> which<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.910> pushing

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
neck and take the arch which is pushing

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.400 
neck and take the arch which is pushing
on<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> spinal<00:03:49.230> cord<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.709> move

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
on the spinal cord and move

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.010 
on the spinal cord and move
if<00:03:50.710> the<00:03:50.980> arch<00:03:51.250> over<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.330> back<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.750> court

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
if the arch over the back the court

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.650 
if the arch over the back the court
essentially<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.800> too<00:03:54.430> small<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.090> what<00:03:55.360> we<00:03:55.510> can

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
essentially is too small so what we can

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.070 
essentially is too small so what we can
do<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:56.140> cut<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.100> arch<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.580> hinge<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.810> like<00:03:59.050> a

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
do is cut the arch and hinge it like a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.100 
do is cut the arch and hinge it like a
drawbridge<00:03:59.530> and<00:04:00.280> if<00:04:00.670> we<00:04:00.820> can<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.180> make<00:04:01.600> enough

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
drawbridge and if we can to make enough

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.500 
drawbridge and if we can to make enough
room<00:04:02.320> for<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.830> spot<00:04:03.070> court<00:04:03.430> but<00:04:03.970> we<00:04:04.180> don't

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
room for the spot court but we don't
