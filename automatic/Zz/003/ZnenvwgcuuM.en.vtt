00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello everyone welcome to my 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.529
 chain today I present to you my 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.589
 new monster high purchases 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.170
 so I ordered two vague periods 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.650
 3 with spectra sale of a gallerist rbk 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.910
 steam so I did not take laguna because I 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 already have a going of the wave 1 so I 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.859
 did not want a second and I prefer 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.350
 have new ones so here is spectra 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.170
 so on the non stora logo there is one 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.039
 night mask on the skull logo 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 monster high 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.200
 here a spectra drawing in the process of 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.540
 yawn you can see her through the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.110
 box with his slippers there is no 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 pedestal nor brushes unfortunately 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.710
 so here is the back of the box so 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.390
 which is simple we have no text except 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.950
 his name 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.010
 here we find ball same design 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.760
 accompanied by the other two 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:57.000
 so that's spectral go I want down 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 as usual a purple I like 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.730
 his little shirt his nightgown this 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.770
 nightie 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:09.330
 here and look at these little slippers 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:12.930
 with chains so that's it then 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.729
 rebecka the one I already prefer 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.130
 I love the character of dresses and kaba 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.869
 spectra too but I prefer to bk in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.270
 this wave 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.930
 so here we find his name is a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.110
 super pretty drawing stretching 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.119
 and varied like the others so you 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 can see her 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.880
 I love his little night mask 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.659
 really beautiful and his slippers 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.909
 are superb 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.170
 so here we have as a choice it's a 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.630
 cheekbones station are 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.100
 mp3 player it seems to me if I'm wrong 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.500
 not that's what we have a kind of high 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.180
 skull-shaped speakers 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580
 so it's super nice it's a little 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.950
 older a little retro in fact the design 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.690
 here is the back of the box so that is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.580
 same except when they replaced here 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.560
 by at bk so here I am doing you the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.170
