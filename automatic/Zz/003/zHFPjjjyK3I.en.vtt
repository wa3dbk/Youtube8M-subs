00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
with Cleveland or just still other NBA

Cleveland<00:02:41.830> are<00:02:41.980> pretty<00:02:42.159> keen<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:42.790> if<00:02:43.480> yeah<00:02:44.409> it

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
Cleveland are pretty keen but if yeah it

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
that helped us to get I guess a large

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.210 
that helped us to get I guess a large
bit<00:04:13.540> into<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> NC<00:04:14.230> double-a<00:04:14.590> tournament<00:04:14.620> and
