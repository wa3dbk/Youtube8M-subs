00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.550
 such a cooling can be found in the summer people especially accept 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.840
 But by no means every horse rides us this used and goes voluntarily 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.889
 into the water 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.849
 it is all the more important that they take the quadruped piece by piece 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.749
 get used to not only in the versatility Luftwaffe prevail 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.159
 We also meet when riding on creeks and rivers 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.199
 you do not have to 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.119
 The MZ's have been specially designed to wet the MFPs in order to get in 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.119
 Reken for her experienced with the camera 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630
 1 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.120
 JU 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.120
 image 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.100
 In principle, of course, the water is through further major rally 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.129
 To have them at all times in the field water protect large puddles of water 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.969
 and is just very very uncomfortable if it is now in the from the right to the 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.270
 Stands I explained that must run through a puddle of water but one man 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.080
 Of course, this can be so terribly bad in waters practice 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.409
 Prerequisite to it is the market that the unhappy is very much under 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.909
 heavier are very afraid of the muddy ground just when you him 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.250
 are the feet of the freestyle slip and a sink so far we are quite aware 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.030
 taken for a paved area which gently goes down into the water 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.710
 and Sam Vossen Basel out comes so the basic equipment you 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.220
 In any case, you need to fall so that it has an abundance of leads 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.600
 possibly a lover at 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.659
 That reasonable glove has almost normal manual work needs that now 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.820
 does not withdraw then points is attracted 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.370
 and in any case if I go the water safety interfered with shoes 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.979
 Stahlkappen 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.360
 this extremely important 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.210
 now he leads ahead means an experienced horse goes ahead the young 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.340
 or only trained nothing drives the descendants may join fat 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.330
 Percent if that did not work out might have been reached too 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.570
 Great fear has such a great effect on the hand or too bad 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.080
 Actions seat then we are very happy to take this metal train craft 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.330
 with and for the Ehinger 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.870
 In an emergency, it may even be that it would be on his hand now 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.619
 introduce 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.479
 that means with safety shoes into the water into the factory 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.690
 lead the water 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.690
 and now the preparation is more pragmatic, that is, you make yourself 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.550
 no thoughts about how the sun is standing, how is the surface? 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.810
 But it is the prerequisite to take the situation out of which light 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.579
 that the preparation has to vote 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.650
 then the second em-gold is that the rider is afraid because they are afraid 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.290
 Before that, he suddenly makes a big bet in the water always 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.819
 It is said that they regulate youthful sins too much 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.569
 then let the horse copy keys 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.219
 but wait for the right points from the point 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.019
 that they then forgot to drive Timo India to the Herforder 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.670
 Act as she is always too timid to be Japan to mom in the story and 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.599
 Maybe that's what makes Milan go down the drain, though 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.739
 then in the water it can be praised for vigorous and there are many riders hesitating 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.319
 way too long one goes sometimes the very very bad experiences 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.719
 have collected 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.779
 around and they just want to convince me then in the ear with me percent want 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.569
 if you can hear it very difficult because the course guests only give you a few 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.099
 Days since they are only two or three days so we try very carefully 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.789
 I want to be backwards to the water to what they call him I whole 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.289
 but like to make an opportunity and if the weather slows backwards 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:05.849
 Bit by bit, going into the water nouns always do it every time 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.519
 to praise one two steps backwards as he already effect 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.029
 praise 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:12.109
 Under death, I think we have been saved from the bodies 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.809
 when her father sent simply because the water ride first 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:19.989
 and there is the water 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.250
 So it is already known where trust is built and it is then 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.279
 Full of good tension, the coach wants to drive the water today 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.359
 Guaranteed 50 percent easier
