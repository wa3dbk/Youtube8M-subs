00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
creative type and you smash that up you

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.740 
creative type and you smash that up you
see<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.039> value<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.700> using<00:02:12.360> three

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
see the value in using three

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.480 
see the value in using three
tivity<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.320> build<00:02:13.530> something<00:02:13.710> of<00:02:13.920> value<00:02:14.040> okay

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
tivity to build something of value okay

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.790 
tivity to build something of value okay
and<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:14.970> what<00:02:15.240> is<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.600> point<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.140> spending<00:02:16.380> all

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and so what is the point of spending all

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.920 
and so what is the point of spending all
of<00:02:16.830> your<00:02:17.010> effort<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.720> supporting<00:02:18.720> the
