00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.560
 south. 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.879
 and 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.860
 a game 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.430
 with us 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.939
 I greet dear friends with you again 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.400
 escape and after a week would be so 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.529
 March 8 holiday and in honor of this 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.600
 Today I wanted to show a couple of ideas how 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.790
 can decorate our house and make 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.890
 sweet to our mom so let's 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.260
 let's start the first thing we will do it 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.059
 is colored sand for you with 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.830
 artificial flowers for me personally 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.290
 it looks very beautiful and unusual 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.820
 for this you need a container and the most 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.650
 main degree I for our color 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.089
 sand is salt and the more the better 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.890
 the next thing we need is a glass with 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.330
 water and best of all if water 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.790
 there will be a glass glass so that later 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.589
 could see his light following 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.720
 and so time I took your helmets which 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.420
 I have been and also added watercolors to 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.119
 have more colors and one flat container 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.380
 Well now we take our salt and fill 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.630
 her container and also we can 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.759
 use more after the container to 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.439
 our salt then dried faster 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.600
 but if you don't have that option then 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.560
 can use jar and also i 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.450
 Well, now we fill the dye 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.310
 for our statement the first color is white 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.710
 because although the use of color more 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.600
 gentle than just a bright gradient and 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.999
 stir so that the water is completely 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.710
 turned white the next color I take and 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.979
 watercolor and because gouache is no such 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.140
 good red and all that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.009
 color and just take and fill our 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.119
 salt is the next goal I did 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.759
 this is turquoise eliza turquoise and im i 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.619
 I fill our jar with salt and me the color 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.970
 very pleasant and already immediately visible as 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.640
 our salt is staining 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.090
 and adding our dye until 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.010
 until all the salt is in that paint 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.200
 the next color i made is blue same 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.660
 painted our salt also if you 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.530
 use a deeper container and 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.670
 more salt 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.380
 then you will most likely need 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.300
 several times make one dye 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.100
 the same color to the whole salt 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.990
 completely immersed solution well here 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.000
 these four colors have turned out 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.160
 and you can see that the salt is already 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.870
 stained even though it is not completely dry 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.350
 but I will say right away that she will be at the bank 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.560
 dry 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.480
 very long so it's better you networking more 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.190
 after the container because so is our sand 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.140
 faster dry and the very next day 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.480
 Our sand is ready and before 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.760
 fill our rose i use my 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.890
 old teapot teapot which we generally 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.990
 do not use and fell asleep our 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.730
 colored sand and using bench press 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.980
 just squeezing it harder to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.610
 there were no lumps left and our 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.860
 sand it consisted of small grains and that 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.930
 same time true north just every 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.270
 better color start to fall asleep in our 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.370
 glass vase with 1 use light 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.680
 which I have had the most 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.390
 turquoise on I began to fill my 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.970
 teapot in purple because its 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.120
 I, too, many in turn begin 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.120
 fall asleep 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.640
 at your place 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.799
 and it should look like this 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.030
 so notice that a couple when you 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.859
 fall asleep vase 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.750
 sand falls to one side 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.700
 more so learn to correct everything 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.340
 him or rattle him over so that sand 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.689
 the vase became more even and that 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.310
 interesting vase of sand with us 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.409
 It turned out I like it very much and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.629
 looks very cool and now there 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.670
 we insert our artificial flowers in 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.980
 me these are roses and in fact they 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.530
 pretty easy to get into this sand 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.870
 and it looks very nice of course 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.389
 my bouquet is too magnificent for this vase 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.049
 therefore it is better to apply a little bit smaller 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.790
 and everything will look very organic 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.090
 what did the first scenery we did and 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.889
 can proceed to 2 2 scenery which 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.169
 we will do i i called the sea in 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.480
 the bottle is actually in a can 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.639
 just a bottle sounds better and to her 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.609
 make on your like a soda pot and 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.519
 which attribute and paint that 1 1 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.199
 take our jar and fill it with soda 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.900
 for this you just have a couple of canteens 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:24.110
 spoons to pretend that it is sand on 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.659
 the bottom of the ocean the next thing I drive there 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.449
 so paint paraphernalia a couple of seashells 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:32.440
 which I just had on the table and 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.570
 principle did not carry any functionality and 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.220
 farther there and throw such small 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.630
 glass beads are just the same 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.220
 coming to sea ​​color well now 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.440
 take our max attributes and 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.690
 very, very slowly fill it with water 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.740
 so that our vessels are not raging and not 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.570
 began to dissolve 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.550
 Why is such a bank filled with water 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.320
 and already inside the cheese of the boutique and we 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.199
 it turned out now we can only 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.000
 make her color more mask for this 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.800
 we will need paint and you can 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.720
 use any but it seems to me more 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.550
 just fit the paint on batik fabric 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.039
 because the light is more transparent and 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.289
 made from water more naturally stolen 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.630
 I just paint a couple of times 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.759
 water and then gradually start 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.860
 stir and add until asked 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.190
 exactly the color that you want and 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.659
 above I add a couple of droplets 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.840
 sunflower oil to create effect 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:26.479
 bubbles well that's all now just 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.880
 hooks close our jar and our sea 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.580
 you are ready and in the sun it looks 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.120
 just awesome because the color of the water 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.699
 to stick 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.800
 so of course I never been to Orsk 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.840
 the sea but it seems to me that this is exactly 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.340
 colors it should be what I think is 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.919
 the jar will be a very beautiful decoration 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.510
 for our room and principle it is possible 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.580
 it would even give someone like 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.380
 Present what's next for decoration 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.240
 you can just buy a couple of flowers and 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.970
 put them in ram 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.889
 but since we love to spend a little 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.690
 they can serve us good functions 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.419
 for this you need a cardboard and 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.100
 stencil you can download the link in 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.590
 description now what do we take 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.090
 stationery knife and our stencil 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.370
 we start to cut everything so that 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.860
 stencil turned on this stencil 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.510
 I fasten to a white blank sheet with 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.250
 using clothespins and in places where we have 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.889
 much pen did it and English 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.050
 needles now what are we getting water and 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.570
 find konen flat cardboard or from 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.789
 plastic and apply red to it 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.650
 paint and in the middle I add white 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:30.229
 so that it will be where 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.300
 next I take a rose and prune it to 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.430
 it was more convenient and using it 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.240
 now we just dip it in this 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.400
 paint and start to put on top of our 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.110
 stencil and thanks to rosa color will be 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.300
 applied not quite even and in 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.060
 chaotic order but it looks 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.970
 very unusual and actually to 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.090
 the effect was more better you cost much 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.530
 walk more often than i did it and here 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.660
 now when we remove the stencil we 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.700
 we see that in principle our drawing is already 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.070
 ready, I decided to white couple frames 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.470
 so I take electrical tape and around the edges 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.539
 shoals and equal lengths on glue and and 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.720
 our list is no longer afraid 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:11.030
 I paint it all with a brush in the same 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.479
 colors and after that we just 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.699
 remove our tape we get 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.349
 flat frames and that's all our mini 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:20.000
 drawing is ready and it looks very 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:22.580
 cool and so the result of you 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.590
 satisfied even more then you need much 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.260
 walk more roses 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.260
 so stencil 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.690
