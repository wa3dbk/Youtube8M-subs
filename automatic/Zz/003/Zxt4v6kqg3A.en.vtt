00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.400
 Hello, my name is Alina and today 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.580
 I want to take off 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.320
 unexpectedly for me the letter of the mind and 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.040
 unexpected purchases because i'm sort of 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.740
 bureau removed 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.259
 September book purchases then me 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.760
 the books arrived earlier than I expected 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.920
 and so I got some more 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.340
 September purchases and so you look 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.430
 one more September shopping video repeat 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.860
 this is again ten olya and let's rather 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.230
 I will show you what books I decided 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.480
 buy yourself back this month 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.309
 in general, I can call this month 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.340
 month classic literature because 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.800
 that first forever with Jerome then I 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.170
 read Anna Karenina most of the month 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.899
 and because it seems to me she borrowed from 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.390
 me all September and probably exactly 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.149
 Because of her, I decided to buy all 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.070
 these books that I will show you now not 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.989
 I know what we have discovered in me as I have already 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.170
 many times it was September. 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.200
 he inspired me to many Russian 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.490
 literature that I decided to buy 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.210
 finally to even buy 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.090
 rather decided for myself to start counting and 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.479
 so I'm probably in a crowd now 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.939
 show these books bought a full five 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:30.490
 books Fedor Dostoevsky yes I bought 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:34.100
 imagine the crime of punishment double 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.430
 player scraps from the dead house and 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.290
 humiliated and offended 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.729
 why the bottom was offended in 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.100
 pocketbook and so I had to buy 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.740
 and you have other classics in fact I 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.829
 love the paperback so no difference 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.140
 what kind of book will i have as a result 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.640
 I have a lot of Dostoevsky me 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.430
 Dostoevsky most likely on 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.290
 shelves worth and and she is already 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.329
 anticipating know what my next 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.070
 annual book challenge will probably 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.820
 more consists precisely of Russian 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.000
 literature 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.610
 I will dedicate I dna beach from matured 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.619
 before she walked to that age when necessary 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.440
 I read Russian literature 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.650
 because after school I remember this 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.120
 period of the year reluctantly 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.739
 generally touches the Russian 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.230
 literature not by any Russian author 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.370
 whatever it is but the words have passed 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.239
 how many 6 years 7 6 7 years old I graduated from school 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.640
 I realized that everything I found again in this 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.709
 rut and I again want to read Russian 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.200
 Literature but both as Fedor Mikhailovich 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.659
 Dostoevsky will decorate my wand and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.870
 remind myself that he rather sooner 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.359
 I must read while I go school 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.269
 literature I finally bought my own 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.150
 copy of war and peace I read more by 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.250
 Grandpa Tom who were in 4 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.480
 editions no one will ever believe when 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.340
 i say i'm really dining 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.530
 Room twice now I want to once again 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.690
 you reread especially after anna 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.389
 karenina i'm so again 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.519
 Tolstoy fell in love all the cracks then one 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.060
 of my probably my favorite so far 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.090
 authors 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.519
 probably Dostoevsky may still be 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.549
 will turn my world around again but for now the lion 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.879
 Nikolayevich thick his war and peace will 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.340
 wait for me once again reread war and peace 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.310
 and again re-read my karenin on this 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.980
 Russian purchases are over and I started 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.139
 puts it in the basket already 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.730
 foreign foreign literature on 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.349
 strange foreign literature as 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.079
 hand I spoke foreign 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.209
 classical literature and one such 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.340
 authors instead of all denis his dideau 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.790
 nun I love similar literature 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.199
 some of this genre about the partisans 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.150
 of course they call it some 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.750
 erotic novels most likely 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.120
 I will see them a little bit as if 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.849
 other 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.639
 explain but for some reason here is foreign 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.169
 it does not cause a classic of this genre 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.690
 some kind of disgust lived here 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.000
 modern erotic books and probably 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.489
 I remember how I tried to read 50 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.889
 grayscale and I read it with such 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.919
 I never finished reading me 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.049
 enough to finish reading the book I just threw out 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.750
 and and melt into the firebox and anything 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.080
 if only my eyes and not seen but here 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.000
 classic literature 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.650
 I am ready to read and reread, but I 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.959
 got fuzzy and let's move on to 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.370
 next book I also bought myself another 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.640
 two books and a guide and a kid's life and our 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.350
 heart i love pasan but because 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.850
 after so i read his dear friend 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.260
 which vector soon again 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.630
 I will reread 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:39.340
 I fell in love with him after 3 read him 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.350
 biography what kind of man is just why I 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.630
 Now I buy all of his books you 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.460
 find yourself two big ones there and I really donâ€™t 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.020
 I remember what books I get there and 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.640
 so I'm starting here like this 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.650
 little by little because we have something 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.930
 there are some books just some 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.410
 stories because life is our heart 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.020
 small novels rather than a big one 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.180
 a full-fledged novel and yes I have it in 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.300
 different editions as always everything and go 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.490
 fight but then I am at the most minutes in this 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.220
 I have a lot more building in it 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.750
 Only the first book is so sorry 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.940
 finally advise more books from 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.340
 classics and with pleasure i will all 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.930
 I really want to read the classics 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.030
 I don't know why I'm just visiting 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.700
 as I said at the beginning of the video finally 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.530
 did come to age hope that 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.150
 It will not work for me and so I will post 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.160
 year read classics year read 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.380
 modern literature will then again be 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.380
 so alternately right and need to interfere 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.180
 all this so that the brain does not boil too 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.060
 bought myself another one of my very beloved 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.120
 author and bought myself a zola emile zola 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.000
 conquering the plaza on and honestly admit 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.720
 I know nothing about the tour will pass this 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.370
 new novel I bought it because of its chic 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:54.550
 the cover I really like this cover and 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.830
 here I am parallel reading in Ramallah 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.669
 outlines the whole history of mankind 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.870
 pull it yourself city stale cynicism 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.520
 unintelligible temperamental means 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.900
 adventure the author is not the slightest doubt 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.430
 is that the power hungry will do anything 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.960
 some kind of unusual book on 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.570
 at least compared to previous ones 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.330
 which I bought turgenev wrote a letter 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.610
 Author and finished phrases in Russia now 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.620
 I only read you all the same 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.020
 we love the world Zola not only had 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.120
 me but the whole of russia at that time therefore 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.250
 how can you not read it ? 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.650
 finally, I do not know what came over me but 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:34.030
 I bought myself three tammeks of Shakespeare 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:37.189
 the house said 3 works of Shakespeare 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.469
 taming of an obstinate summer night's sleep 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:42.139
 and the storm taming the obstinate I once 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:46.449
 watched italian film seems by 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:50.150
 Shakespeare is certainly not the setting itself and 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:53.960
 storm I saw that once in the play 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.539
 played one evil played one of mine 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.370
 favorite doctors david tennant and i 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.680
 I'll think about what to read first and then 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.750
 already try to find this staging 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.520
 see how he plays there but 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.919
 glorifies a little bit sorry i'm nothing 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.900
 don't know so i will be dedicated to 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.120
 it's time to dream of shakespeare too 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.039
 well then i feel lagged behind 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.250
 modern world that everyone knows everything about 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:18.590
 Shakespeare and I don't know anything about him 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.810
