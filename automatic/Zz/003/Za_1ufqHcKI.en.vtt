00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
super shine in there so it's stays

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.260 
super shine in there so it's stays
malleable<00:00:56.520> um<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.230> first<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.820> way<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
back get everything all nice and lined

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.120 
back get everything all nice and lined
up<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.770> uniform<00:01:23.960> then<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.200> take<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> rat<00:01:25.830> tail

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
up in uniform then you take the rat tail

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.719 
up in uniform then you take the rat tail
and<00:01:26.420> then<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.439> into<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.400> comb

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and then you go into one of these comb

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330 
and then you go into one of these comb
lines<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.310> your

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
lines and then that's how you make your

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.179 
lines and then that's how you make your
part<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.970> then<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.840> hold<00:01:34.140> down<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.680> opposite

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
part and then you hold down the opposite

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.640 
part and then you hold down the opposite
side<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.430> isn't<00:01:36.000> getting<00:01:36.180> parted<00:01:36.570> then<00:01:37.229> push

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
side that isn't getting parted then push

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.960 
side that isn't getting parted then push
the<00:01:37.890> part<00:01:38.130> upwards<00:01:39.500> now<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> am<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.430> very<00:01:41.460> good

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the part upwards now I am not very good

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.330 
the part upwards now I am not very good
at<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.570> technique<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:44.070> part

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
at this technique as you can see my part

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
at this technique as you can see my part
isn't<00:01:44.820> exactly<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> cleanest<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> world

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
isn't exactly the cleanest in the world

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.280 
isn't exactly the cleanest in the world
but<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.549> some<00:01:47.759> practice<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.570> know<00:01:48.990> some

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
but with some practice I know some

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.870 
but with some practice I know some
people<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.770> get<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.430> really

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
people that can get some really really

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.020 
people that can get some really really
deep<00:01:51.210> deep<00:01:51.479> parts<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.799> method<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.820> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
deep deep parts with this method but it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.600 
deep deep parts with this method but it
has<00:01:54.360> never<00:01:54.659> been<00:01:54.869> my<00:01:55.590> favorite<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> not

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
has never been my favorite and not

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.569 
has never been my favorite and not
something<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.369> is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
something that I like to do so that is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.350 
something that I like to do so that is

do this one either

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.780 
do this one either
you<00:02:58.730> should<00:02:58.849> take<00:02:59.000> bigger<00:02:59.329> comb<00:02:59.629> and<00:03:00.790> this

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
you should take bigger comb and this

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.789 
you should take bigger comb and this
works<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.180> lot<00:03:02.269> better<00:03:02.329> with<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.930> ion<00:03:03.440> combs

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
works a lot better with the ion combs

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.970 
works a lot better with the ion combs
but<00:03:04.579> I<00:03:04.700> don't<00:03:04.940> own<00:03:05.090> an<00:03:05.269> ion<00:03:05.540> comb<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.709> what<00:03:06.890> you

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
but I don't own an ion comb so what you

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.920 
but I don't own an ion comb so what you
do<00:03:07.129> is<00:03:07.340> pretty<00:03:07.760> much<00:03:07.909> same<00:03:08.209> thing<00:03:08.450> as<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:08.810> last

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
do is pretty much same thing as the last

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.349 
do is pretty much same thing as the last
one<00:03:09.290> but<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:10.159> comb<00:03:10.400> your<00:03:10.519> hair<00:03:10.670> back<00:03:10.940> get<00:03:11.269> your
