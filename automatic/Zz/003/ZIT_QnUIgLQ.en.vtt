00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
piccolo and what makes these models

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.480 
piccolo and what makes these models
particularly<00:00:21.750> special<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:22.949> have<00:00:23.279> an

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
particularly special is that we have an

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.550 
particularly special is that we have an
amplitude<00:00:23.880> chamber<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.199> I'll<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:25.529> through

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
amplitude chamber so I'll go through

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.259 
amplitude chamber so I'll go through
some<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.980> those<00:00:26.189> sounds<00:00:26.609> as<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:26.849> go<00:00:27.000> through

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
some of those sounds as we go through

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.450 
some of those sounds as we go through
first<00:00:27.869> which<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.410> our<00:00:28.619> bassoon<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.310> is

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
first which is our bassoon now this is

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.130 
first which is our bassoon now this is
double<00:00:29.760> chambered<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:30.750> I'll<00:00:30.869> also

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
double chambered and then I'll also

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.500 
double chambered and then I'll also
explain<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:35.360> amplify<00:00:36.360> turn<00:00:36.630> off<00:00:38.510> it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
explain with the amplify turn off it

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540 
explain with the amplify turn off it
sounds<00:00:39.780> more<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.260> normal<00:00:40.440> tone<00:00:41.160> chamber

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
sounds more like a normal tone chamber

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.319 
sounds more like a normal tone chamber
accordion<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.239> more<00:00:42.420> time

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.690 

just<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.960> subtle<00:00:48.170> little<00:00:48.410> difference

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.340 

and<00:00:52.270> I'll<00:00:52.510> go<00:00:52.630> through<00:00:52.810> some<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.230> other

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
and I'll go through some of the other

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:03.960 
and I'll go through some of the other

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
is our L in three metals or three middle

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.350 
is our L in three metals or three middle
for<00:01:18.340> continental<00:01:19.060> French<00:01:19.390> music<00:01:21.210> then<00:01:22.210> our

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
for continental French music then our

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.250 
for continental French music then our
two<00:01:22.510> middle<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.610> it's<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.820> little<00:01:25.000> drier<00:01:25.300> than
