00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.280
 Image 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.650
 as a prerequisite for anything else you want 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.650
 the project 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.950
 from Brazil and Turkey 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.790
 the power on your part 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.230
 that is the project 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.590
 but for a reason 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.590
 he said that it is fundamental to 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.250
 the establishment 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.240
 of a new park 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 everything you've ever had 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.620
 with a title 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.530
 substituted 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.310
 this correction 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.300
 six carriages 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.369
 unigel 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.450
 the doubts are many 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.690
 three set of black africa 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.020
 Why do you think you like the sport? 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.740
 after all the group 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 in a general way 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.140
 international 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.560
 so lucky 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.250
 that raised from the ground that installation remained a single film file was 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 open raised from the ground with a bridge 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.730
 if setting input does not have very clearly configured frames 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.520
 I mean 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.810
 rarely configured 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.319
 such as the dismissal of a monumental tent 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.469
 an entry 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.960
 It was an internal joke that repeated 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.589
 the product all registered in the company 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.010
 already the production that they will become I am in the bookstores 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.129
 ie it is a reconfiguration 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.619
 quiquiqui with exit 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.109
 the geography 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:26.740
 and to the historical morphology the urban doping of the city of lisbon as 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.549
 one question 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.480
 Only one there is not very difficult to treat the city there 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.079
 but a Kennedy space disposition 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.199
 the sharp line 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.379
 even though all 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.739
 and beyond that 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.990
 the unusual question that appears 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.359
 by cp 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.669
 it's Kenya 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.969
 disappears an automobile transport 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.109
 the attempt on how long to be there 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.819
 and make of the state in the sights of the own museum the praiense black silver and black has 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.029
 that be that way 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:00.579
 particularly 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.219
 It's there that says that with the port 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.399
 the navigation 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:09.659
 the turismetrÃ´ the day in which the navigation made the possibility of the bishop and 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.979
 on the side working from home 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:17.669
 this river transport and of this necessity everything why not do 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:18.879
 and for this 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.089
 considered 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.569
 engineering the inconvenience of the subsoil 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.390
 not have won the sea 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.189
 when groundwater is there or 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.279
 The place is making the car 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.729
 subject to suppression of the Atlantic Forest 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.819
 costs more than the square meter of any government 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.019
 then he was to build 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.100
 one is doing 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.079
 stipulate that you understand 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.219
 no one blame continues to play a role of a people 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.019
 bad weather 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.129
 and here it is already gone 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.019
 under the tomato sleeve 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.870
 if you want to leave something too 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.649
 with much property 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:58.249
 cielo de collapse for everything 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.110
 of the priority product 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.489
 down there 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.729
 and stayed 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:03.699
 thereby 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.909
 clearly from the place set up the remainder 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.709
 the bar of the street of junqueira the painted 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.449
 Your name is Ladeira 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.719
 this help 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.489
 in front of the square 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.520
 worse than complaining 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.490
 dobal the possibility of geometric configuration 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.210
 many arrested the two events 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.219
 which close to the administration and why I said it though 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:34.389
 this passage 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.340
 is from pedestrians to 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.180
 the attacker knocked on the door and the pope's arrival I think we lost said 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.270
 while telling the mayor that she would be doing cover from door to door and 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.110
 jaw 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.360
 the accused by t-bone to beijing 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.150
 the damaged structures 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.159
 and was 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.930
 that's why this mayor 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.439
 is almost certain 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.860
 we make access 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.439
 pedro du modesto administration of the annex rest ruler 27 years old 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.550
 as concrete structure 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.150
 which is not quite a building 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
 is a structural part of power situation 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.930
 from the beginning of the end of the old port 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.509
 able to impose the administration of the motel on a 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.400
 in large pavilion exhibitors who have the right foot 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.969
 such free 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.819
 It's all an aerial bridge. 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:24.729
 that runs 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.950
 for administration particularly 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.520
 everybody saw 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.370
 support mentalities life 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.830
 sustained 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.650
 so the fall is more than the blue hill that was missing 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.219
 for another cut, who? 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:43.689
 there are 90 people that a day is another thing because counterpoint without response 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:44.960
 said sometimes 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.110
 in front of one or any other type of a body 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.219
 with a beauty that 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.189
 the other hand is the case 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.589
 Lisbon with the maximum title of the day 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.520
 It's a close relationship. 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.600
 paris type
