00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.910
 good morning with this intervention we will briefly talk about the foot of the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.969
 horse 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.619
 the horse's foot because it is a real fundamental organ 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.340
 important if they only have walking, but for health, everything 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.089
 of the animal actually collects both the support functions 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.390
 on the ground that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.399
 a 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.569
 specific function and horse that of a blood circulation pump 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.640
 in order to facilitate the challenge of the heart and therefore 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.130
 to improve the athletic performance of the subject himself to do this 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.470
 we must be able to better assess the foot yes to its conformation yes 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.340
 the characteristics of the nail and the school of the horse itself are not yours 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.440
 text features was not. which represents that pump of which 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.560
 we mentioned free we approach then on horseback we evaluate the foot in his 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.010
 support on the ground 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.010
 lol we try to evaluate better 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.530
 we evaluate the compactness, the characteristics and the conformation 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.950
 considering just the symmetries of the foot 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.480
 having done this we place ourselves next to my mother and after we have warned of 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.530
 our presence we give ourselves 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 foot 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 let's start the evaluation again 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 jacket at this first moment we evaluate 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.240
 the sun situation is 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.700
 we evaluate the heels for fibroids infection 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 the seats are the visions 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.900
 to the school 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.850
 if they have been stuck in unusual positions. if by chance there is not 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.480
 even a few nails that poorly hurt the foot of the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.080
 horse 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.380
 it goes without saying you keep the pearl of the sea especially for your feet 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.660
 the health of the litter boxer g the hygiene and the police of the environment where 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.839
 lives 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:24.569
 this too is enough to lift your foot you immediately see if a foot is treating cough 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.649
 the animal is on the clean if the animal is rather abandoned to itself 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.779
 same and crown fire 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.169
 evaluated the sun part is so fast 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.469
 with positions that are identical to those used by the proud farrier 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:46.459
 begin the shoeing operations suppose the horse's foot on 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.089
 our knees and evaluate the structure 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.449
 of the wall 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.919
 of the wall in the pdl 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:01.569
 we estimate that there is no hurting us that there is no deep injury 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.959
 itouch and iphone so split 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.129
 in the wall there are not there then you have to invest breaking the fractures of the 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.799
 wall itself and also the good compactness and shine of the 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.590
 both from this function and from the side 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.839
 siae gerardo 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.839
 on the average production of the horse's foot 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.769
 if we have no problems 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:32.999
 we can intervene 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.479
 calling 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:41.479
 the vet if the lessons are profound and important or with one 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:46.819
 of routine operations and good stable use of products that 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.939
 improve the condition of the wall of the shine of the foot wall 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:52.269
 of the horse 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.199
 these products can be either of natural origin 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.249
 chemical origin feet 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:05.149
 under my modest bar rt products of natural origin net is strange a 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:06.840
 greater interest 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.989
 why 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.279
 engineer from no less collateral problems picnik the flip side of the 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:14.180
 medal 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.500
 sometimes instead it could be that of an environmental pollution means that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.650
 now of a danger for the operator we think of the same thing as i 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.650
 natural products and much much more 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.590
 hard 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.150
 the product over the others the beeswax can sometimes give results 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.330
 magnificent on the creek of a foot on a horse 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.229
 let's go back to the evaluation of the foot we give again 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.550
 the foot and composition always farrier we go 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.590
 to evaluate the part are the ares 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.590
 this is lost people must be soft 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.740
 it must work as a key for the blood circulation pump 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.580
 we evaluate as before 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.580
 the elasticity of the foot itself 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.949
 we evaluate 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.740
 integrity of the sun part to you and also on the solar side as on the wall yes 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.210
 can intervene 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.070
 with specific products 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.800
 wart improve its firmness to solidity and health 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.569
 we support 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.909
 gently foot 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.509
 we leave and the horse calms down a moment and we repeat the latest analysis 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.419
 because the doors of Rome 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.870
 the horse 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.870
 very slowly 

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.620
 convinces to collaborate 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.979
 we still evaluate a side wall 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.619
 with the same 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:00.199
 val bed previous we can evaluate the part 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.209
 average of those inside the wall 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:07.129
 yet 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.550
 We can 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.309
 slowly 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:14.490
 go to evaluate 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.619
 the structure of the school 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.419
 of the horse's foot 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.409
 also in this case 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.409
 read the cleanliness and are the masters 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.689
 did this 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.339
 thank you for your cooperation 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.339
 our 4-legged friend 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.550
 remember 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.869
 without the collaboration, he can handle all these operations 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:49.409
 they become really difficult sometimes even risky
