00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello my love I have one again 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.460
 few things used up and show you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 the course and start to depart in 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.429
 krems it should be different that's yes 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.170
 a bit too short in the last 12 months 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.810
 come 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.789
 I think that was true, I think so 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.310
 knows why it was that was because of me 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.930
 I had such a hand cream completely 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.180
 So terrible was where I found the smell 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.070
 just did not like it and then up 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.199
 used my shins where 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.000
 I always applied those otherwise 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.559
 because they are just great against 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 dry skin is i say easy now 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.040
 times for the previously set up my 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.600
 as I did not see it I use 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.450
 she's great for everything 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.370
 rich and just great so 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.829
 really one of my absolute 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.680
 favorite products and yes and then have 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.239
 I that yes then I am not to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.770
 come to use up like me though 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.629
 every month but on need one 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.129
 now another one has become empty because 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.199
 the hand cream was then too 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.059
 at some point I learn completely 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.670
 Many hair products are used up once 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.700
 here from l'oreal this rinse that is 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.470
 I believe her anti-hurgh conditioner 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.000
 anti harburg cultivate and play 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.720
 dry damaged or brittle 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.250
 hair is just super good and if that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.630
 I bought them and had them 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.509
 In between times a few months 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.860
 not bought after me somehow 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.119
 I thought I have 1000 new things 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.290
 Try and now I am to the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.580
 come back and find the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.340
 just done the hair well 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
 nice and supple and you do not have to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 let it act forever there is still of it 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.040
 such a mask I've been there too 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.299
 I often too lazy to use that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.100
 because then I have to do that for so long 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.600
 let it act and therefore yes 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.280
 The course was great too 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.310
 I use them every time by industry 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.960
 so when washing your hair then I have something 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.790
 I still had used up the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.630
 Last rest found here from Valea 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.579
 trend off that on plus your push up 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.110
 it does not exist anymore and I am 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.110
 so sad that it does not exist anymore 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.610
 was so good and I have one too 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.229
 Rest found so I have this bottle 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.540
 yet been found and have so shaken and 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.549
 hp does not have much in it and yes 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.020
 then used up and can not 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.450
 buy very sad then I have something 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.250
 bought later 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.370
 exhausted that I could meet 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.310
 that's from takkt the hairspray ultra 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.150
 hair lacquer strength number four 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.099
 I use since I am 16 years old 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.550
 I think supergroup is good 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.500
 Brush out top hairspray no insane 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.900
 and can not do anything great right now 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.560
 But that's just a solid one 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.870
 hair spray 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.640
 then I have dry shampoo 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.650
 used up to which I have often 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.580
 This is also shown by Barea Tredup 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.709
 the spray and dry shampoo and is 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.140
 use my favorite dry shampoo 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.090
 I'm also part of it regularly 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.069
 already on the second day when my hair 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.319
 Although not ready yet but such a 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.709
 I could feel that way 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.780
 need a bit of refresher 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.269
 That's good for the volume though 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.069
 you make that approach and I like it 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.390
 I like to buy too 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.370
 I always hope for it 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.739
 So you may try every now and then 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.099
 Something out but then always come 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.200
 back to the back then continue with 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.350
 harnos is now the last product of 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.299
 daft a volume of spray what you to 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.100
 the approach to the hair I have 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.980
 you also I think somewhere at some 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.850
 video already shown 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:27.459
 yes that was okay but that was not great 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.230
 and that was better, but there is 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.040
 no more 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.430
 then from kneipp oil almond blossoms how did 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.989
 one of my absolute favorite products 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.730
 just for the winter and i have here 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:48.819
 a few and a lint and so grooms 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.739
 enormously grooms insanely well does not pull 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.530
 You have to know a good one before you 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.220
 something does not like then rather something else 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.730
 to take 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.319
 But the smell is so great I could 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.599
 put me there so pure 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.569
 and apropos to trick them still exist 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.940
 a bath additive is available as bath oil 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.989
 that's just to rub in and that 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.609
 But there is also still to bathe 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.310
 and I unfortunately has no bathtub 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.810
 we would have that but I envy you 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.340
 the people who have a bathtub and 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.919
 then in this stuff so in the 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.799
 related tracks can and that 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.799
 latest 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.750
 no penultimate product that is a body 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.009
 splash what has become empty of h &amp; m me 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.060
 I think that last summer 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:32.360
 bought and the beast is called spring 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.139
 blossom I realized that it was 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.250
 I said skin shop in the 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.330
 May not in any case I do not know 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.889
 not what I said before 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.629
 Every case I noticed that it 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.819
 At H &amp; M again and again this body splash 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:48.169
 so there are always but there are me 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.360
 I noticed that somehow always 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.400
 similarly smell that always a fragrance 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.550
 it always smells very similar 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.889
 so a bit strawberry I explain 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.789
 flowery and that was the case here and so 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.680
 this is always in the background 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.210
 is that also that I have the 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.759
 I did not buy at the same time 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.000
 they were available at different times 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.830
 and it smells totally similar and me 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.240
 hope if I empty this then 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.650
 I did that in the summer then 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.349
 again 1 find something similar again 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.539
 right because they are not there then 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.770
 standard range but are yes then 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.389
 so to speak, this is always new 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.219
 rausbringen but as always as one 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.190
 he's kind of bearish 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.840
 fruity I'm happy yes and yes 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.340
 That's why he was not so panicky 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.099
 to use up because I stop here 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.930
 still a very similar but if 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.900
 h &amp; m not produced after or 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.610
 both, and similar fragrant then makes 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.620
 I recognize myself then I use that 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.870
 not for a long time and annoy me 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.159
 then about myself because then stand 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.020
 about all the things around me 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.789
 I think I can not 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.770
 I have to buy it on everyone 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.270
 for a very special day and the 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.469
 special day comes somehow 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.330
 Not the last one I did either 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.610
 was needed here is such a small 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.469
 pack was lea nourishing 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.810
 cleaning cloths 31 and that for 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.610
 dry and sensitive skin I have 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.020
 Anyway since I buy whatever to 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.779
 uses it to make-up 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.610
 and that's a smaller one 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:13.340
 pack there is still in bigger and 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.789
 I was already there because I think about it 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:19.330
 weekend away i was in dresden 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.650
 I also had you on facebook and stuff 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.270
 I told and I had anyway 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.129
 bought again because I do not have one 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.339
 wanted to lug and pack 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.370
 have in the meantime 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:30.750
 one hundred percent again a big one 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.100
 pack up and me for sure 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.940
 because it's been a long time ago 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.020
 and I do not think so any more 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.430
 I guess maybe I forgot then 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.630
 that my stuff always collects 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.830
 and threw them away but on everyone 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.500
 case of this are, so to speak, a small one 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.180
 and a big pack went away well 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.010
 my dear that's it i wish you 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.630
 a wonderful day and we hope 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.630
 See you soon again, then bye
