 this st 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.549
 I'm afraid to make a mistake. It seems that 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.150
 this is this brand chinese 2 draws 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.809

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.890
 the goal to hide from Kyivstar Ivan 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.199
 let us down 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.210
 checking means there are people here 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.029
 which we are here the gate of Minsk to me so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.380
 it seemed 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 Yana sold the Koran poem km

 yes so here chertel lacquers 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.040
 if you look and radicalism 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.050
 I do not know why it is from the flow of apples 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.530
 caps straight but consistent 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.809
 impossible as cattle to others 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.480
 Olenegorsk Olympiad for half a year 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.010
 I do not take in hand and 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.710
 no less they occur as well 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.090
 like from teams 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.280
 anyway 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.320
 I have two shades recognized 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.950
 recalled how old though like circles 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.530
 the answer is there the rocket men in the box 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.720
 and net pay is also impossible to understand before 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.730
 what color 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.410
 so, let's begin 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 continental ag I have answer frost bright 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 color by the people 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.660
 i still have traces of crime there not 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.660
 will be 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.490
 second iowa ova give colors but 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.610
 camera why is there more of him? 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.610
 gives away 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.159
 so I'm tour operators right away 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.270
 after acquired 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.640
 film strip 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.130
 and here after I already motivated the case 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.590
 coin with such varnish 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 barely kim we il want peace alone 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.340
 then begins to spend there a lot 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 so do not care is due to the fact that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.740
 constantly me washing the dishes constantly me 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.580
 arms 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.690
 at work the dynamics and I visit 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.260
 constantly experienced let's say you still 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.830
 not always used at home 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.240
 we cleaned my dishes in the summer so 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.680
 my purse sneakers me dynamics since 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.680
 city ​​dissolve in the dough for the week 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.080
 role conquered libraries on camera 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.910
 from white apple in this i'm a little bit language and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.719
 launder lilac looks 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.199
 how strong 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.199
 in fact, the other shades 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.099
 of the five relatively online 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.730
 good condition except from this 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.639
 enough 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.099
 yes yes do you see telescopes here 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.699
 no one cleared his prices 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.799
 he died school this week he is not easy 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.119
 beautiful voice happened and what is it 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.389
 a half dollar thing so there is 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.429
 sense to lay more though bordeaux yourself 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:37.859
 loiter and eat 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.989
 and renamed the pink color therefore 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.099
 I will give you this 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.049
 order don't be afraid latin us 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.219
 that's good he 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.949
 the only thing he 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.149
 here look 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.769
 drawing like him 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.589
 red replacement is valid 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.129
 color but it’s already sent to bases 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.389
 semi final 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.669
 and in this mess the first nails of the whip are whole 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:59.999
 when youth ministry optimism 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.049
 the poster collects in the middle ie he 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.129
 rolls to the middle 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.379
 that's what nail king 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.029
 make up then quick again 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.249
 more relevant sticks and descendants of plaid 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.759
 the benefit of someone is in east london at two 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.109
 layer gives a good movie dense color 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.529
 even see the complexion it was in that un but 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:19.889
 OK 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.239
 read such as in late May to 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.829
 the middle 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.049
 whether it does not depend on not acting 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.409
 only level shortages 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.379
 i don't have dennis governments he even 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.689
 120 believe 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.229
 And we, too, it knocks down the accent therefore it 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.189
 say let's say China 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.599
 it seems like torture 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.929
 before this post is a feature car 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.589
 let's say setup we have 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:51.759
 but she has it to understand the features 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.699
 dollars in general, nothing 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.459
 palette brisk around 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.149
 she is very modest 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.839
 but again you need to put it in the data 

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:03.199
 on the internet because he 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.339
 cit they are responding to a palette which 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.799
 put rubles on the way to the given 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.239
 a half dollar yes you can buy 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.219
 and try 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.249
 that's why I would advise atkin me 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.560
 really liked and as I said 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.219
 I will still buy 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:19.289
 so again third
