they'd put the fabric cable all

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.720 
they'd put the fabric cable all

metal<00:03:44.299> not<00:03:45.139> the<00:03:45.349> silver<00:03:45.980> it'd<00:03:46.250> be<00:03:46.519> nice<00:03:46.700> if

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
metal not the silver it'd be nice if

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.470 
metal not the silver it'd be nice if
they<00:03:47.090> had<00:03:47.230> matching<00:03:48.230> that<00:03:48.410> your<00:03:48.560> buds<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:50.209> I

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
they had matching that your buds but I

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.300 
they had matching that your buds but I
don't<00:03:51.169> know<00:03:51.260> why<00:03:51.500> they<00:03:51.709> didn't<00:03:52.010> do<00:03:52.130> that

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
don't know why they didn't do that

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.250 
don't know why they didn't do that
doesn't<00:03:53.060> really<00:03:53.389> matter<00:03:53.599> you<00:03:53.780> won't<00:03:54.019> notice

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
doesn't really matter you won't notice

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.870 
doesn't really matter you won't notice
it<00:03:54.620> blends<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.669> with<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:55.880> cable<00:03:56.239> this<00:03:56.570> way<00:03:57.880> you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
it blends in with a cable this way you

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.860 
it blends in with a cable this way you
have<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.060> 45<00:03:59.690> degree<00:03:59.900> angle

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
have a 45 degree angle

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.070 
have a 45 degree angle
tip<00:04:01.200> very<00:04:01.680> nice<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:03.180> have<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.690> little

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
tip very nice and you have that little

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.850 
tip very nice and you have that little
red<00:04:04.860> acts<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.489> looks<00:04:06.000> pretty<00:04:06.330> cool<00:04:06.599> and<00:04:06.959> its

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
red acts and looks pretty cool and its

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.240 
red acts and looks pretty cool and its
overall<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.310> nice<00:04:09.650> plug<00:04:11.659> gold-plated<00:04:12.659> although

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
overall a nice plug gold-plated although

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.800 
overall a nice plug gold-plated although
that's<00:04:14.250> been<00:04:14.459> shown<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.760> not<00:04:15.150> really<00:04:15.510> matter

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
that's been shown to not really matter

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.620 
that's been shown to not really matter
too<00:04:16.169> much<00:04:18.320> it's<00:04:19.320> pretty<00:04:19.590> much<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.889> same<00:04:20.250> as

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
too much it's pretty much the same as

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.050 
too much it's pretty much the same as
most<00:04:21.630> 45<00:04:22.260> degree<00:04:22.680> angles<00:04:23.100> but<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.580> my<00:04:23.880> opinion

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
most 45 degree angles but in my opinion

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.140 
most 45 degree angles but in my opinion
it<00:04:24.570> looks<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:25.020> little<00:04:25.169> bit<00:04:25.350> cooler<00:04:25.729> 45<00:04:26.729> degree

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
it looks a little bit cooler 45 degree

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.450 
it looks a little bit cooler 45 degree
angles<00:04:27.570> are<00:04:27.780> good<00:04:27.960> for<00:04:28.169> gaming<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.919> they<00:04:29.130> are

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
angles are good for gaming and they are

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.340 
angles are good for gaming and they are
good<00:04:29.790> for<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.900> cable<00:04:31.320> goofing<00:04:31.889> around<00:04:32.240> I'd

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
good for the cable goofing around I'd

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.529 
good for the cable goofing around I'd
say<00:04:34.350> they're<00:04:34.710> better<00:04:35.370> than<00:04:35.520> L<00:04:35.850> jacks<00:04:36.210> and

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
say they're better than L jacks and

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.230 
say they're better than L jacks and
better<00:04:36.870> than<00:04:37.199> I<00:04:37.500> jacks<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:41.550> can<00:04:41.729> see<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.090> fee

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
better than I jacks you can see the fee

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.529 
better than I jacks you can see the fee
models<00:04:42.630> are<00:04:42.840> pretty<00:04:43.650> similar<00:04:44.150> this<00:04:45.150> will<00:04:45.389> work

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
models are pretty similar this will work

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.430 
models are pretty similar this will work
on<00:04:45.780> life<00:04:46.050> on<00:04:46.229> first<00:04:46.560> generation<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:48.289> you<00:04:49.289> can

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
on life on first generation and you can

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.629 
on life on first generation and you can
notice<00:04:50.300> well<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:52.560> there's<00:04:52.800> some<00:04:53.160> patterns

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
notice well that there's some patterns

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.110 
notice well that there's some patterns
there<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.690> its<00:04:54.930> overall<00:04:55.580> really<00:04:56.580> nice

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
there and its overall really nice

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.100 
there and its overall really nice
speakers<00:04:57.780> in<00:04:58.020> there<00:04:58.880> ok<00:04:59.880> base<00:05:00.120> not<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.810> best

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
speakers in there ok base not the best

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.620 
speakers in there ok base not the best
base<00:05:01.380> that<00:05:01.710> base<00:05:02.280> effort<00:05:02.729> but<00:05:02.880> you're<00:05:03.090> not<00:05:03.240> if

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
base that base effort but you're not if

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.610 
base that base effort but you're not if
you're<00:05:03.720> not<00:05:04.289> like<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.590> bass-heavy<00:05:05.810> guy<00:05:06.810> then

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
you're not like a bass-heavy guy then

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.810 
you're not like a bass-heavy guy then
these<00:05:08.580> will<00:05:08.639> be<00:05:09.030> fine<00:05:09.270> if<00:05:09.990> you<00:05:10.169> want<00:05:10.380> more

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
these will be fine if you want more

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.060 
these will be fine if you want more
balanced<00:05:11.820> noise<00:05:12.240> then<00:05:12.570> these<00:05:12.900> are<00:05:13.110> good<00:05:13.289> v

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
balanced noise then these are good v

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.800 
balanced noise then these are good v
modas<00:05:14.490> are<00:05:14.729> more<00:05:15.360> base<00:05:16.139> happy<00:05:16.530> than<00:05:16.710> these<00:05:16.950> and

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
modas are more base happy than these and

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.870 
modas are more base happy than these and
why<00:05:18.810> am<00:05:18.840> i<00:05:19.080> comparing<00:05:19.470> these<00:05:19.830> three<00:05:20.520> motors

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
why am i comparing these three motors

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.629 
why am i comparing these three motors
again<00:05:21.210> but<00:05:21.470> still<00:05:22.470> they're<00:05:23.130> really<00:05:23.460> good

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
again but still they're really good

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.260 
again but still they're really good
