00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
three tablespoons in here this is the

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.680 
three tablespoons in here this is the
tablespoon<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:33.019> tablespoon<00:03:33.049> side<00:03:36.220> all<00:03:37.220> right

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
and then it calls for two teaspoons of

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.150 
and then it calls for two teaspoons of
water<00:03:43.120> we'll<00:03:44.120> bring<00:03:44.299> that<00:03:44.359> in<00:03:44.980> there's<00:03:45.980> the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
water we'll bring that in there's the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.039 
water we'll bring that in there's the
teaspoon<00:03:46.609> side<00:03:46.880> that's<00:03:47.359> a<00:03:47.480> little<00:03:47.660> less<00:03:47.840> I

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
teaspoon side that's a little less I

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.220 
teaspoon side that's a little less I
might<00:03:48.230> have<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.470> tap<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.859> off<00:03:49.780> put<00:03:50.780> just<00:03:51.049> a

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
might have to tap this off put just a

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.110 
might have to tap this off put just a
little<00:03:51.500> extra<00:03:52.430> okay<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:54.440> then<00:03:55.250> mix<00:03:55.609> so<00:03:55.880> let's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
little extra okay and then mix so let's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.800 
little extra okay and then mix so let's
get<00:03:56.769> let's<00:03:57.769> use<00:03:57.950> this<00:03:58.100> as<00:03:58.280> our<00:03:58.400> mixing<00:03:58.790> spoon

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.759 

wherever<00:04:02.810> we<00:04:02.930> have<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:06.019> we're<00:04:06.109> mixing<00:04:06.290> so<00:04:06.620> that

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
wherever we have so we're mixing so that

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.069 
wherever we have so we're mixing so that
we<00:04:06.859> can<00:04:07.040> knead<00:04:07.370> this<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:08.480> we<00:04:08.540> want<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.810> dough

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
we can knead this so we want a dough

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.590 
we can knead this so we want a dough
consistency<00:04:09.489> then<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.609> actually<00:04:11.000> put<00:04:11.450> that

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
consistency then you actually put that

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.420 
consistency then you actually put that
on<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.959> tray<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.650> we're<00:04:12.859> gonna<00:04:12.950> bring<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.340> to

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
on the tray and we're gonna bring it to

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.670 
on the tray and we're gonna bring it to
the<00:04:13.519> microwave<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.420> cook<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.989> well<00:04:15.440> we<00:04:15.530> got

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
the microwave and cook that well we got

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.740 
the microwave and cook that well we got
to<00:04:15.829> get<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.100> dough<00:04:16.280> first<00:04:16.579> so<00:04:16.880> and<00:04:17.329> you're

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
to get to the dough first so and you're

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.779 
to get to the dough first so and you're
gonna<00:04:17.840> have<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.169> make<00:04:18.320> this<00:04:18.470> twice<00:04:18.859> so<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.400> bet

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
gonna have to make this twice so I bet

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.849 
gonna have to make this twice so I bet
you<00:04:19.910> they<00:04:20.000> just<00:04:20.200> instead<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.320> doing<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.620> all<00:04:21.709> at

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
you they just instead of doing it all at

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.730 
you they just instead of doing it all at
one<00:04:22.010> time<00:04:22.039> so<00:04:22.580> let's<00:04:23.479> see<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.289> kneadable

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
one time so let's see is it kneadable

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.480 
one time so let's see is it kneadable
yet<00:04:25.099> I<00:04:25.280> don't<00:04:25.970> think<00:04:26.120> so

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.680 

definitely<00:04:31.490> not<00:04:31.610> need<00:04:31.819> of<00:04:31.940> all<00:04:32.060> still<00:04:32.330> too<00:04:32.479> wet

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
definitely not need of all still too wet

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:40.629 
definitely not need of all still too wet
so<00:04:37.539> to<00:04:38.539> me<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:39.259> looks<00:04:39.500> like<00:04:39.560> we<00:04:40.250> need<00:04:40.400> to<00:04:40.430> add<00:04:40.610> a

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
so to me it looks like we need to add a

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.850 
so to me it looks like we need to add a
little<00:04:40.789> more<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.300> powder<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.979> this<00:04:43.250> one

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
little more of the powder and this one

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.200 
little more of the powder and this one
that's<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.979> thing<00:04:46.159> with<00:04:46.340> with<00:04:46.699> baking<00:04:47.090> you

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
always got to be ready to make

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.320 
always got to be ready to make
adjustments<00:04:49.220> so<00:04:49.729> that<00:04:49.819> looks<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.240> little

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
adjustments so that looks a little

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.279

mentioned it little holes where we poked

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.870 
mentioned it little holes where we poked
it<00:07:35.990> with<00:07:36.050> a<00:07:36.139> fork<00:07:36.530> that<00:07:36.770> just<00:07:37.430> helps<00:07:37.760> the

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:37.880 
it with a fork that just helps the

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.580 
it with a fork that just helps the
bubbling<00:07:38.300> they<00:07:38.630> also<00:07:38.780> said<00:07:39.050> it's<00:07:39.199> happened

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:39.590 
bubbling they also said it's happened

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.930 
bubbling they also said it's happened
it's<00:07:39.680> not<00:07:39.800> that<00:07:40.070> bad<00:07:40.220> and<00:07:40.370> it<00:07:40.460> looks<00:07:40.610> like<00:07:40.699> the

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:40.940 
it's not that bad and it looks like the

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.570 
it's not that bad and it looks like the
pizza<00:07:41.300> dough's<00:07:41.479> themselves<00:07:42.220> come<00:07:43.220> right<00:07:43.400> off

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.580 
pizza dough's themselves come right off

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.189 
pizza dough's themselves come right off
so<00:07:43.760> there's<00:07:43.909> gonna<00:07:44.030> be<00:07:44.180> more<00:07:44.360> cooking<00:07:44.780> that's

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 
so there's gonna be more cooking that's

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.600 
so there's gonna be more cooking that's
just<00:07:45.409> to<00:07:45.470> probably<00:07:45.740> get<00:07:45.889> them<00:07:46.010> so<00:07:46.159> we<00:07:46.280> can<00:07:46.430> put

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:46.610 
just to probably get them so we can put

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.000 
just to probably get them so we can put
the<00:07:46.970> sauce<00:07:47.270> and<00:07:47.539> the<00:07:47.630> cheese<00:07:47.900> on<00:07:48.199> there<00:07:48.470> so

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.010 
the sauce and the cheese on there so

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.129
