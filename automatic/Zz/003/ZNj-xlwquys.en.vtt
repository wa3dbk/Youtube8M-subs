00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
and all right so I'm gonna build my

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.230 
and all right so I'm gonna build my
bench<00:01:45.220> over<00:01:45.490> here<00:01:45.729> it's<00:01:46.540> gonna<00:01:46.630> be<00:01:46.840> um<00:01:48.240> no

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
bench over here it's gonna be um no

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.870 
bench over here it's gonna be um no
probably<00:01:49.600> about<00:01:49.689> you<00:01:50.110> know<00:01:50.140> four<00:01:50.470> feet<00:01:50.880> high

and to make it so that's in real
economic<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:55.750> gonna<00:01:55.930> figure<00:01:56.200> out<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.909> whole

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
economic I'm gonna figure out the whole

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.219 
economic I'm gonna figure out the whole
electrical<00:01:58.810> situation<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.930> mean<00:02:02.140> this

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
electrical situation which I mean this

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.289 
electrical situation which I mean this
is<00:02:02.320> an<00:02:02.439> old<00:02:02.530> house<00:02:02.829> built<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.310> 1929<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.149> there's

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
is an old house built in 1929 so there's

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.300 
is an old house built in 1929 so there's
really<00:02:04.420> not<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.259> whole<00:02:05.380> hell<00:02:05.829> of<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.979> lot<00:02:06.009> here

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
really not a whole hell of a lot here

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.120 
really not a whole hell of a lot here
for<00:02:06.430> electrical<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.259> will<00:02:08.619> be<00:02:08.709> able<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.890> fix

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
for electrical but I will be able to fix

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.370 
for electrical but I will be able to fix
that<00:02:09.340> because<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.959> breaker<00:02:11.440> box<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:13.380> right

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
that because the breaker box is right

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.170 
that because the breaker box is right
over<00:02:14.500> there<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.780> we're<00:02:16.989> gonna<00:02:17.850> I'm<00:02:18.850> gonna<00:02:18.940> run

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.250 
over there so we're gonna I'm gonna run
on<00:02:19.299> wire<00:02:19.480> from<00:02:19.750> there<00:02:20.190> over<00:02:21.190> here<00:02:21.549> and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
on wire from there over here and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.390 
on wire from there over here and
No<00:02:23.650> okay<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:25.260> some<00:02:26.260> lighting<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.830> couple
