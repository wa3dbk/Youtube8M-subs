hey everybody after my second

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.390 
hey everybody after my second
experiments<00:00:03.270> with<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.540> Kumbha<00:00:04.319> effect<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:05.009> had

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
experiments with the Kumbha effect I had

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.730 
experiments with the Kumbha effect I had
a<00:00:05.430> brainstorm<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.480> maybe<00:00:07.200> I<00:00:07.649> could<00:00:08.610> somehow

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
a brainstorm that maybe I could somehow

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.140 
a brainstorm that maybe I could somehow
whatever<00:00:10.740> what<00:00:11.280> would<00:00:11.400> happen<00:00:11.730> if<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.940> put

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
whatever what would happen if I put

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.480 
whatever what would happen if I put
coloring<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> water<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:14.040> would<00:00:14.190> affect

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
coloring in the water if it would affect

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.080 
coloring in the water if it would affect
the<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.570> snow<00:00:16.279> after<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.310> throw<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
the the snow after I throw it up in the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.150 
the the snow after I throw it up in the
air<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> could<00:00:18.449> color<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> snow<00:00:19.199> too<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.770> today

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
air I could color the snow too so today

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.560 
air I could color the snow too so today
we're<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.520> try<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.730> experiment<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
we're going to try that experiment and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.400 
we're going to try that experiment and
I'm<00:00:21.630> going<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.810> take<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> through<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.320> we're

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
I'm going to take you through it we're

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.660 
I'm going to take you through it we're
going<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> add<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.890> food<00:00:23.039> coloring<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
going to add some food coloring to the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.340 
going to add some food coloring to the
boiling<00:00:24.060> water<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.720> take<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.019> outside<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
boiling water and I take it outside and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.089 
boiling water and I take it outside and
throw<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:26.779> okay<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.170> can<00:00:28.320> see<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.740> water's

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
throw it okay as you can see the water's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.030 
throw it okay as you can see the water's
begun<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.699> boil<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.199> our<00:00:31.410> red<00:00:31.740> food

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
begun to boil and we have our red food

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.310 
begun to boil and we have our red food
coloring<00:00:32.550> standing<00:00:33.120> by<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.690> I'm<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
coloring standing by and I'm going to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.729 
coloring standing by and I'm going to
add<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.739> now<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:39.420> show<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.379> I'm<00:00:40.500> adding

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
add it now and show you that I'm adding

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.260 
add it now and show you that I'm adding
it<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:43.670> don't<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.760> how<00:00:44.879> many<00:00:44.940> it's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it in so I don't know how many it's

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.119 
it in so I don't know how many it's
going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> take<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.320> want<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> water<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.039> be

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
going to take but I want the water to be

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.479 
going to take but I want the water to be
nice<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.579> red<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:54.690> four<00:00:54.989> drops<00:00:55.350> five<00:00:55.949> six

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
nice and red it's four drops five six

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.840 
nice and red it's four drops five six
seven<00:00:57.590> see<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.859> turning<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.250> read<00:00:59.579> yet

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
seven see it's not turning to read yet

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
seven see it's not turning to read yet
but<00:01:00.180> hopefully<00:01:00.719> we'll<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> desired

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
but hopefully we'll get the desired

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:13.880 
but hopefully we'll get the desired
effect<00:01:02.219> outside

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.890 

while<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.550> got<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.880> water<00:01:15.030> nice<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> red<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
while we got the water nice and red and

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.200 
while we got the water nice and red and
we'll<00:01:18.900> make<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.350> transition<00:01:19.980> take<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.490> take

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
we'll make the transition take the take

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.610 
we'll make the transition take the take
it<00:01:21.330> outside<00:01:21.480> throw<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.230> in<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.410> air<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
it outside throw it up in the air and

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:34.310 
it outside throw it up in the air and
see<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:22.860> happens<00:01:32.480> alright<00:01:33.480> here<00:01:33.690> we<00:01:33.750> go

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
see what happens alright here we go

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.480 
see what happens alright here we go
experiment<00:01:35.190> three<00:01:35.430> colored<00:01:35.880> water<00:01:37.580> one<00:01:39.140> two
