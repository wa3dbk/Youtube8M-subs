00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
can see this yeah so the I mean the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.870 
can see this yeah so the I mean the
headphone<00:00:35.780> themselves<00:00:36.530> are<00:00:36.680> all<00:00:37.070> plastic

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
headphone themselves are all plastic

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.850 
headphone themselves are all plastic
construction<00:00:38.090> which<00:00:38.810> is<00:00:38.990> which<00:00:39.470> isn't<00:00:39.770> the

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
construction which is which isn't the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.470 
construction which is which isn't the
greatest<00:00:40.010> because<00:00:40.580> they<00:00:40.730> can't<00:00:40.940> break<00:00:41.150> quite

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
greatest because they can't break quite

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.310 
greatest because they can't break quite
easily<00:00:41.630> if<00:00:41.870> you<00:00:42.290> bend<00:00:42.500> them<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:43.610> know<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.730> can

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
easily if you bend them you know you can

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.480 
easily if you bend them you know you can
break<00:00:45.320> them<00:00:45.470> pretty<00:00:45.650> easily<00:00:45.740> there<00:00:46.220> so<00:00:46.460> i
