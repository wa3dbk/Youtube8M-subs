automatic filling valve this valve keeps

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.040 
automatic filling valve this valve keeps
an<00:02:49.680> even<00:02:49.920> pressure<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> boiler<00:02:50.930> above<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
an even pressure in the boiler above the

an even pressure in the boiler above the
filling<00:02:52.350> valve<00:02:52.560> there<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> lever<00:02:53.220> this

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
filling valve there is a lever this

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.730 
filling valve there is a lever this
should<00:02:53.880> always<00:02:54.060> be<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:54.780> position<00:02:55.110> like
