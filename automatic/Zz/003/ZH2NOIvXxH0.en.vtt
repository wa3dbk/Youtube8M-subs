than this bullet resistant glass we've

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100 
than this bullet resistant glass we've
realized<00:00:08.760> that<00:00:08.970> if<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.150> put<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> piece<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.570> 3/4

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
realized that if you put a piece of 3/4

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.839 
realized that if you put a piece of 3/4
inch<00:00:10.230> plywood<00:00:10.410> directly<00:00:11.250> behind<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.639> glass

inch plywood directly behind the glass
it<00:00:12.210> stops<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.630> penetration<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:13.950> would

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
it stops the penetration so one would

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.890 
it stops the penetration so one would

though<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.829> had<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> knife<00:01:32.429> today<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
though I had a knife today is that a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.719 
though I had a knife today is that a
chunk<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> lead<00:01:36.860> now<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> don't<00:01:38.220> believe<00:01:38.459> it<00:01:38.580> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
chunk of lead now I don't believe it is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.249 
chunk of lead now I don't believe it is
I<00:01:39.590> think<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.740> sucker<00:01:41.009> made<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.399> through<00:01:41.670> and

I think that sucker made it through and
kissed<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> plywood<00:01:44.360> but<00:01:45.360> again<00:01:45.659> ah<00:01:47.780> there's

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
kissed the plywood but again ah there's

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.819 
kissed the plywood but again ah there's
the<00:01:48.840> gas<00:01:49.170> check<00:01:49.500> oh<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:52.140> other<00:01:52.259> -<00:01:52.500> checks

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the piece of glass and we're finding

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.149 
the piece of glass and we're finding
that<00:02:03.209> there's<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> there's<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.349> gas<00:02:04.590> check<00:02:04.979> from

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
one of the previous shots as well it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.859 
one of the previous shots as well it
just<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.560> lot<00:02:07.679> minute<00:02:08.009> ago<00:02:08.220> pretty<00:02:09.149> good<00:02:09.389> so

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.979 
just a lot minute ago pretty good so
this<00:02:10.440> stuff<00:02:10.679> has<00:02:10.859> an<00:02:10.979> incredible<00:02:11.489> ability<00:02:11.989> to

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
this stuff has an incredible ability to

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.860 
this stuff has an incredible ability to
reflect<00:02:13.290> things<00:02:13.620> back<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:15.209> if<00:02:15.569> you're<00:02:15.720> the
