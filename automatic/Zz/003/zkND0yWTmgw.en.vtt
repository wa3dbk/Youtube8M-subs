00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.899 
around and sneak up behind him and then
sign<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.420> take<00:01:03.600> down<00:01:03.870> end<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.890> story<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.760> put

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
sign I take down end of story you put

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510 
sign I take down end of story you put
him<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> cage<00:01:06.439> you<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:07.740> caged<00:01:07.950> anyways

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
him in a cage you just got caged anyways

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.289 
him in a cage you just got caged anyways
so

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.330 
so
he's<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.380> cage<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.100> pretty<00:01:11.280> much

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
he's in this cage and that's pretty much

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.450 
he's in this cage and that's pretty much
it<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.799> can<00:01:13.799> he<00:01:13.920> escape<00:01:14.040> from<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> cage<00:01:16.460> okay

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it and can he escape from the cage okay

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.950 
it and can he escape from the cage okay
I<00:01:17.670> could<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.060> both<00:01:18.270> ways<00:01:18.420> he<00:01:18.630> can't

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I could see this both ways he can't

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.440 
I could see this both ways he can't
escape<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.350> he's<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:19.799> skinny<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
escape because he's really skinny and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.410 
escape because he's really skinny and
the<00:01:21.450> bars<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.860> big<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> feel

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the bars are kind of like big so I feel

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.469 
the bars are kind of like big so I feel
like<00:01:24.450> he<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.750> slip<00:01:25.020> through<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.500> somehow

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
like he can slip through there somehow

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.390 
like he can slip through there somehow
but<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.600> reality<00:01:27.780> probably<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.799> because<00:01:29.189> he

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
but in reality probably not because he

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
but in reality probably not because he
doesn't<00:01:29.579> really<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.880> powers<00:01:30.150> he<00:01:31.049> doesn't

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
doesn't really have powers he doesn't

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.069 
doesn't really have powers he doesn't
have<00:01:31.799> anything<00:01:32.220> except<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:32.909> he's<00:01:33.240> psycho<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
have anything except for he's psycho and

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.710 
have anything except for he's psycho and
he<00:01:34.619> had<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.220> he<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.790> cuts<00:01:36.060> himself<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
he had like he just cuts himself and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.429 
he had like he just cuts himself and
cuts<00:01:37.290> other<00:01:37.470> people<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:39.000> don't<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.290> see

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
cuts other people so I don't really see

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
cuts other people so I don't really see
