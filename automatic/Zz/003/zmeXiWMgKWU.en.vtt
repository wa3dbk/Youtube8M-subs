00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
bolts to machine this shoulder and go in

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.750 
bolts to machine this shoulder and go in
there<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.230> just<00:02:32.470> with<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.160> number<00:02:33.490> three

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
little overhang on the tailstock so we

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.610 
little overhang on the tailstock so we
got<00:02:47.420> more<00:02:47.690> room<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.049> move<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.319> carriage

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
got more room to move the carriage

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.089 
got more room to move the carriage
around<00:02:49.900> lock<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.080> down<00:02:51.349> put<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.739> nice<00:02:54.099> left

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.330 

you<00:03:00.170> know<00:03:00.290> we'll<00:03:00.470> measure<00:03:00.650> our<00:03:00.920> original

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
you know we'll measure our original

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.550 
you know we'll measure our original
shoulder<00:03:01.730> belt<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:04.370> get<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.150> shoulder

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
shoulder belt and get that shoulder

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.250 
shoulder belt and get that shoulder
dimensioned<00:03:07.299> take<00:03:08.299> our<00:03:08.480> calipers<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.170> we'll

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
dimensioned take our calipers and we'll

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.860 
dimensioned take our calipers and we'll
just<00:03:09.440> run<00:03:09.709> our<00:03:09.860> tool<00:03:10.099> up<00:03:10.310> within<00:03:10.610> about<00:03:10.750> 10<00:03:11.750> or

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
just run our tool up within about 10 or

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.339 
just run our tool up within about 10 or
15<00:03:11.989> thousands<00:03:12.799> of<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.989> then<00:03:15.109> we'll<00:03:15.230> just

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
15 thousands of that and then we'll just

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.020 
15 thousands of that and then we'll just
put<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.530> witness<00:03:15.920> mark<00:03:16.160> in<00:03:16.340> our<00:03:16.430> part<00:03:16.790> and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
put a witness mark in our part and

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.380 
put a witness mark in our part and
that'll<00:03:17.239> give<00:03:17.420> us<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.629> place<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:18.019> go<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.379> stop<00:03:18.620> -

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.330 

they're<00:03:23.390> come<00:03:23.930> back<00:03:24.109> touch<00:03:24.410> off<00:03:24.650> on<00:03:24.920> this<00:03:25.129> so

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
they're come back touch off on this so

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.890 
they're come back touch off on this so
we'll<00:03:25.459> make<00:03:25.609> a<00:03:25.640> couple<00:03:25.879> three<00:03:26.209> cuts<00:03:26.480> on<00:03:26.690> this

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
we'll make a couple three cuts on this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.580 
we'll make a couple three cuts on this
and<00:03:27.140> get<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.260> down<00:03:28.690> close<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.959> our<00:03:30.140> final

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
and get it down close to our final

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.619 
and get it down close to our final
dimension<00:03:31.540> this<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.599> a<00:03:32.780> 3/8<00:03:33.290> Whitworth<00:03:33.769> thread

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
dimension this is a 3/8 Whitworth thread

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.569 
dimension this is a 3/8 Whitworth thread
which<00:03:35.629> is<00:03:35.840> 24<00:03:36.590> threads<00:03:36.920> per<00:03:37.129> inch<00:03:37.160> it's<00:03:37.489> the

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
which is 24 threads per inch it's the

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.610 
which is 24 threads per inch it's the
same<00:03:37.849> as<00:03:38.090> an<00:03:38.209> American<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:38.959> we<00:03:39.109> can<00:03:39.290> use<00:03:39.470> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
same as an American so we can use the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.440 
same as an American so we can use the
American<00:03:40.780> die<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.500> tap<00:03:42.799> on<00:03:43.069> this<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:44.269> only

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
American die and tap on this the only

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.120 
American die and tap on this the only
difference<00:03:44.780> between<00:03:44.930> those<00:03:45.290> two<00:03:45.349> threads<00:03:45.859> is

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
difference between those two threads is

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.770 
difference between those two threads is
the<00:03:46.549> 55<00:03:47.150> degree<00:03:47.510> Whitworth<00:03:49.150> thread<00:03:50.150> form<00:03:50.510> and

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
the 55 degree Whitworth thread form and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.500 
the 55 degree Whitworth thread form and
it's<00:03:50.900> also<00:03:51.410> got<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.709> rounded<00:03:52.220> root<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:52.849> top<00:03:53.239> on

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
it's also got a rounded root and top on

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.309 
it's also got a rounded root and top on
it<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:53.900> it's<00:03:55.120> all<00:03:56.120> intents<00:03:56.569> and<00:03:56.630> purposes<00:03:57.109> it's

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
it so it's all intents and purposes it's

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.680 
it so it's all intents and purposes it's
the<00:03:57.440> same<00:03:57.650> thing<00:03:57.950> we'll<00:03:58.340> get<00:03:58.549> our<00:03:58.700> shoulder

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
the same thing we'll get our shoulder

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.680 
the same thing we'll get our shoulder
dimension<00:04:00.910> same<00:04:01.910> we'll<00:04:02.180> take<00:04:02.329> a<00:04:02.359> little<00:04:02.540> bit

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
dimension same we'll take a little bit

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.670 
dimension same we'll take a little bit
more<00:04:02.959> off<00:04:03.139> of<00:04:03.169> that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.130 

get<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.400> nice<00:04:08.700> back<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.569> mention<00:04:09.959> what

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
get that nice back to the mention what

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.160 
get that nice back to the mention what
we<00:04:10.290> want<00:04:11.000> then<00:04:12.000> we'll<00:04:12.330> check<00:04:12.540> our<00:04:12.780> diameter

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
we want then we'll check our diameter

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.140 
we want then we'll check our diameter
again<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.860> take<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.069> few<00:04:14.280> more<00:04:14.459> thought<00:04:14.760> of

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
again and take a few more thought of

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.640 
again and take a few more thought of
that<00:04:17.449> we're<00:04:18.449> good<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.720> go<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:18.900> usually<00:04:19.440> cut

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
that we're good to go I usually cut

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.530 
that we're good to go I usually cut
these<00:04:19.829> about<00:04:20.250> five<00:04:20.669> or<00:04:20.850> ten<00:04:21.000> thousand

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
these about five or ten thousand

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.530 
these about five or ten thousand
disciples<00:04:22.100> of<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.130> threads<00:04:23.580> I'm<00:04:23.820> gonna<00:04:24.000> cut

disciples of the threads I'm gonna cut

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.120 
disciples of the threads I'm gonna cut
it<00:04:24.720> seems<00:04:24.990> they<00:04:25.199> do<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.380> little<00:04:25.620> better<00:04:25.830> job<00:04:25.919> a

it seems they do a little better job a

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.860 
it seems they do a little better job a
threading<00:04:26.760> it's<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:26.970> little<00:04:27.180> easier<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.600> thread

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
threading it's a little easier to thread

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.430 
threading it's a little easier to thread
that<00:04:28.110> way<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:30.240> don't<00:04:30.360> seem<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.720> tear<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.169> tops

threads<00:04:46.590> these<00:04:47.490> finished<00:04:47.940> parts<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:50.000> that's

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
threads these finished parts and that's

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.779 
threads these finished parts and that's

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
gonna do any kind of threading if you

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.590 
gonna do any kind of threading if you
want<00:04:58.949> professional<00:04:59.520> results<00:05:00.210> that's<00:05:00.449> what

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
want professional results that's what

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.340 
want professional results that's what
you<00:05:00.720> need<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:01.020> use<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:02.389> little<00:05:03.389> demo<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.020> on

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
you need to use a little demo of that on

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.900 
you need to use a little demo of that on
there<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.650> doesn't<00:05:04.830> take<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.100> whole<00:05:05.190> lot<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.520> give

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
there it doesn't take a whole lot I give

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.550 
there it doesn't take a whole lot I give
it<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.060> couple<00:05:06.270> of<00:05:06.479> spins<00:05:06.690> on<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.110> way<00:05:07.289> that

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
it a couple of spins on the way that

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.310 
it a couple of spins on the way that
I'll<00:05:07.710> take<00:05:07.889> it<00:05:08.070> over<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.960> device<00:05:09.960> and

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
I'll take it over to the device and

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.670 
I'll take it over to the device and
finish<00:05:11.630> threading<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.810> on<00:05:12.900> this<00:05:13.169> gives<00:05:13.410> a<00:05:13.500> nice

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
finish threading it on this gives a nice

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.870 
finish threading it on this gives a nice

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
the die down on there with the taper end

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.670 
the die down on there with the taper end
first<00:05:21.060> just<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.810> make<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:21.960> easier<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.349> start

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
first just to make it easier to start

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.540 
first just to make it easier to start
and<00:05:22.979> I'll<00:05:23.099> flip<00:05:23.370> it<00:05:23.400> over<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:24.470> use<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.740> the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
and I'll flip it over and use the the

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.520 
and I'll flip it over and use the the
other<00:05:26.729> side<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.240> die<00:05:27.419> which<00:05:27.780> will<00:05:27.990> run<00:05:28.410> it

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
other side of the die which will run it

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.900 
other side of the die which will run it
right<00:05:28.650> down<00:05:28.860> to<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.130> shoulder<00:05:29.580> will<00:05:29.760> get

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
right down to the shoulder will get

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.080 
right down to the shoulder will get
threads<00:05:30.240> right<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.599> these<00:05:30.720> shoulder<00:05:32.090> then

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
threads right to these shoulder then

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.640 
threads right to these shoulder then
we'll<00:05:33.300> put<00:05:33.479> this<00:05:33.599> back<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.169> lathe<00:05:34.349> with

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
we'll put this back in the lathe with

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.260 
we'll put this back in the lathe with
that<00:05:34.800> extra<00:05:35.070> little<00:05:35.310> piece<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.789> threading<00:05:36.150> we

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
that extra little piece of threading we

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.620 
that extra little piece of threading we
had<00:05:36.419> on<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.690> end<00:05:36.870> hold<00:05:37.770> in<00:05:37.949> the<00:05:38.039> Chuck<00:05:38.310> and

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
had on the end hold in the Chuck and

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.770 
had on the end hold in the Chuck and
we'll<00:05:39.630> just<00:05:39.780> Park<00:05:40.590> this<00:05:40.770> off<00:05:41.039> to<00:05:41.370> our<00:05:41.780> finished

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
we'll just Park this off to our finished

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:50.680 
we'll just Park this off to our finished
length<00:05:43.310> plus<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.340> few<00:05:46.220> thousand<00:05:47.220> users

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.719 

protector<00:05:51.690> around<00:05:52.289> the<00:05:52.770> head<00:05:53.130> so<00:05:53.430> we<00:05:53.550> don't

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
protector around the head so we don't

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.500 
protector around the head so we don't
chew<00:05:53.940> up<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.120> head<00:05:54.419> from<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.780> Chuck<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:56.510> file

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
chew up the head from the Chuck and file

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.180 
chew up the head from the Chuck and file
off<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:57.900> end<00:05:58.080> and<00:05:58.229> then<00:05:58.410> we'll<00:05:58.560> radius<00:05:58.979> the

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
off the end and then we'll radius the

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.710 
off the end and then we'll radius the
end<00:05:59.340> of<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.580> so<00:05:59.610> it's<00:05:59.940> like<00:06:00.510> the<00:06:00.690> original

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
end of it so it's like the original

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.070 
end of it so it's like the original
original<00:06:03.720> parts<00:06:04.320> make<00:06:05.010> some<00:06:05.190> look<00:06:05.340> real<00:06:05.580> nice

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
original parts make some look real nice

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.480 
original parts make some look real nice
and<00:06:07.080> then<00:06:07.139> I<00:06:07.380> usually<00:06:07.590> chase<00:06:08.010> these<00:06:08.220> with<00:06:08.460> a

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
and then I usually chase these with a

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.010 
and then I usually chase these with a
die<00:06:08.760> again<00:06:09.090> just<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:09.419> make<00:06:09.539> sure<00:06:09.570> we<00:06:09.900> don't

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
die again just to make sure we don't

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.070 
die again just to make sure we don't
have<00:06:10.139> any<00:06:10.289> burrs<00:06:10.650> on<00:06:10.979> there<00:06:11.539> and<00:06:12.539> there<00:06:12.780> you<00:06:12.930> go

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
have any burrs on there and there you go

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.020 
have any burrs on there and there you go
there's<00:06:14.039> your<00:06:14.130> piece<00:06:14.430> we'll<00:06:14.610> make<00:06:14.760> another

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
there's your piece we'll make another

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.110 
there's your piece we'll make another
one<00:06:15.240> just<00:06:15.270> like<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:16.310> so<00:06:17.310> I've<00:06:17.460> taken<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:17.820> frame

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
one just like it so I've taken the frame

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.119 
one just like it so I've taken the frame
and<00:06:18.419> we're<00:06:18.539> setting<00:06:18.780> it<00:06:18.960> up<00:06:19.050> here<00:06:19.530> and

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:20.129 
and we're setting it up here and

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.699 
and we're setting it up here and
vice<00:06:20.279> just<00:06:20.699> kind<00:06:20.879> of<00:06:20.939> plumb<00:06:21.239> it<00:06:21.529> and<00:06:22.529> then

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:22.709 
vice just kind of plumb it and then

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:26.059 
vice just kind of plumb it and then
we'll<00:06:22.889> take<00:06:23.099> our<00:06:23.129> pieces<00:06:23.699> of<00:06:24.919> cleaned<00:06:25.919> up

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
we'll take our pieces of cleaned up

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.699 
we'll take our pieces of cleaned up
Center<00:06:26.879> stand<00:06:27.179> we'll<00:06:27.509> put<00:06:27.959> them<00:06:28.050> on<00:06:28.319> the<00:06:28.469> frame

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:28.709 
Center stand we'll put them on the frame

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:31.759 
Center stand we'll put them on the frame
bolt<00:06:29.339> them<00:06:29.489> with<00:06:29.610> the<00:06:29.699> shoulder<00:06:30.029> bolts<00:06:30.679> and<00:06:31.679> we

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:31.769 
bolt them with the shoulder bolts and we

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:33.229 
bolt them with the shoulder bolts and we
just<00:06:31.949> want<00:06:32.099> to<00:06:32.159> make<00:06:32.309> sure<00:06:32.339> that<00:06:32.639> we<00:06:32.759> have<00:06:32.999> the

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:33.239 
just want to make sure that we have the

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:35.839 
just want to make sure that we have the
stops<00:06:34.110> all<00:06:34.439> even<00:06:34.830> in<00:06:34.949> and<00:06:35.099> everything's<00:06:35.550> nice

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
stops all even in and everything's nice

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.179 
stops all even in and everything's nice
and<00:06:35.929> level<00:06:36.929> when<00:06:37.139> we<00:06:37.259> put<00:06:37.439> it<00:06:37.529> together<00:06:37.649> so

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:38.189 
and level when we put it together so

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:43.779 
and level when we put it together so
visually<00:06:38.699> it<00:06:38.819> looks<00:06:39.029> good<00:06:39.769> from<00:06:40.769> the<00:06:40.860> back

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:49.689 

there's<00:06:44.789> our<00:06:45.059> finished<00:06:46.339> stand<00:06:47.339> all<00:06:47.610> welded<00:06:47.999> up

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:49.699 
there's our finished stand all welded up

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.339 
there's our finished stand all welded up
these<00:06:50.699> little<00:06:50.909> stops<00:06:51.360> here<00:06:51.659> but<00:06:51.899> one<00:06:52.139> of<00:06:52.169> these

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
these little stops here but one of these
