hey<00:00:01.979> I'm<00:00:02.280> replacing<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.120> chain<00:00:03.419> on<00:00:03.629> my<00:00:03.810> bike

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hey I'm replacing the chain on my bike

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.550 
hey I'm replacing the chain on my bike
here<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:05.580> thought<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.270> will<00:00:06.420> do<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> quick

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
here and I thought I will do a quick

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.370 
here and I thought I will do a quick
comparison<00:00:10.099> right<00:00:11.099> here<00:00:11.340> have<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> used<00:00:12.380> SRAM

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
comparison right here have a used SRAM

PC 1051 that I took off my bike some
time<00:00:18.090> ago<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.740> kind<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.770> kept<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.160> a

backup this one here is a KMC x10 that
i've<00:00:27.359> been<00:00:27.510> running<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.900> i<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.170> took<00:00:28.349> off<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
i've been running and i just took off a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.220 
i've been running and i just took off a
few<00:00:29.099> minutes<00:00:29.220> ago<00:00:29.460> off<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> bike<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> I'm

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
few minutes ago off the bike and I'm

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.120 
few minutes ago off the bike and I'm
replacing<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> brand<00:00:32.790> new<00:00:34.130> upgrading

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
replacing it with a brand new upgrading

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.229 
replacing it with a brand new upgrading
to<00:00:35.309> brand<00:00:35.670> new<00:00:36.350> KMC<00:00:37.760> x10<00:00:38.760> SL<00:00:39.510> gold<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:41.730> I

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to brand new KMC x10 SL gold and I

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.979 
to brand new KMC x10 SL gold and I
wanted<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> do<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> quick<00:00:43.020> comparison<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
wanted to do a quick comparison here to

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.209 
wanted to do a quick comparison here to
see<00:00:45.989> if<00:00:46.079> there's<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.379> actual<00:00:46.500> weight

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
see if there's an actual weight

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.549 
see if there's an actual weight
difference<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
difference and if so if is it is it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
difference and if so if is it is it
worth<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:51.379> extra<00:00:52.379> cost<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> turn<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.100> gram

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
worth the extra cost so turn on the gram

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.020 
worth the extra cost so turn on the gram
scale<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:59.059> let's<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.370> SRAM<00:01:02.370> PC

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
package this has been a good chain but I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.950 
package this has been a good chain but I
will<00:01:19.259> say<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.740> did<00:01:19.979> wear<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.570> rather<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
will say it did wear out rather and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.350 
will say it did wear out rather and
surprisingly<00:01:22.710> quickly<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.180> need

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
surprisingly quickly and it was in need

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
surprisingly quickly and it was in need
a<00:01:24.659> replacement<00:01:27.470> remember<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.590> many<00:01:28.650> miles<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a replacement remember how many miles I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
a replacement remember how many miles I
got<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.479> need<00:01:30.720> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
got out of it but it was in need of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.390 
got out of it but it was in need of
replacement<00:01:31.110> way<00:01:31.590> sooner<00:01:31.950> than<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.369> have

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
replacement way sooner than I would have

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.380 
replacement way sooner than I would have
expected<00:01:33.799> which<00:01:34.799> kind<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.270> disappointed<00:01:36.270> me

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
expected which kind of disappointed me

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.160 
expected which kind of disappointed me
about<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.950> used<00:01:38.930> some<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.990> the

about that one I have used some of the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.859 
about that one I have used some of the
more<00:01:40.470> expensive<00:01:40.799> higher<00:01:41.189> ends<00:01:41.869> surrounding

specifically the 1071 which has hollow

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.300 
specifically the 1071 which has hollow
pins<00:01:48.380> basically<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> same<00:01:49.710> chain<00:01:50.009> with

hollow pins and it did seem to provide

hollow pins and it did seem to provide
quite<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.530> longer<00:01:56.100> service<00:01:56.939> life<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:58.170> KMC

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.939 

weighs<00:05:01.250> in<00:05:01.460> at<00:05:01.550> 235<00:05:02.449> grams<00:05:03.849> so<00:05:04.849> that's<00:05:05.060> or<00:05:05.949> 230

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
weighs in at 235 grams so that's or 230

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.760 
weighs in at 235 grams so that's or 230
grams<00:05:07.190> here<00:05:07.569> so<00:05:08.569> that's<00:05:08.719> 15<00:05:09.139> grams<00:05:09.469> lighter

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
grams here so that's 15 grams lighter

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.689

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
for on eBay retail price in a store I

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.800 
for on eBay retail price in a store I
think<00:05:27.590> they're<00:05:27.740> around<00:05:27.949> 80<00:05:28.279> to<00:05:28.370> 90<00:05:28.819> dollars<00:05:28.969> so

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
think they're around 80 to 90 dollars so

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.080 
think they're around 80 to 90 dollars so
you<00:05:29.870> have<00:05:30.289> to<00:05:30.380> make<00:05:30.529> that<00:05:30.740> call<00:05:30.979> it's<00:05:31.880> that

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
you have to make that call it's that

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.680 
you have to make that call it's that
difference<00:05:32.449> in<00:05:32.599> cost<00:05:33.520> worth<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:34.849> you<00:05:35.000> to

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
difference in cost worth it to you to

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.890 
difference in cost worth it to you to

this<00:05:42.139> gold<00:05:42.590> one<00:05:42.830> also<00:05:43.039> says<00:05:43.550> that<00:05:43.610> it<00:05:43.849> has<00:05:44.000> a

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
this gold one also says that it has a

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.439 
this gold one also says that it has a
titanium<00:05:44.750> nitride<00:05:45.199> coating<00:05:45.830> on<00:05:46.099> it<00:05:46.610> which<00:05:47.210> I

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
titanium nitride coating on it which I

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.100 
titanium nitride coating on it which I
guess<00:05:47.750> is<00:05:47.930> what<00:05:48.050> explains<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.860> gold<00:05:49.099> color<00:05:50.110> I

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
guess is what explains the gold color I

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.529 
guess is what explains the gold color I
haven't<00:05:51.560> used<00:05:51.710> one<00:05:52.009> of<00:05:52.039> these<00:05:52.190> before<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:52.669> we

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
haven't used one of these before so we

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.279 
haven't used one of these before so we
will<00:05:53.719> see<00:05:53.960> if<00:05:54.229> that<00:05:55.069> lends<00:05:55.400> itself<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:55.969> an<00:05:56.539> even

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
will see if that lends itself to an even

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.469 
will see if that lends itself to an even
longer<00:05:57.560> lifespan<00:05:58.340> I<00:05:58.610> was<00:05:58.969> really<00:05:59.240> impressed

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
longer lifespan I was really impressed

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.409 
longer lifespan I was really impressed
with<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.379> x10<00:06:00.860> again<00:06:01.610> one<00:06:01.789> of<00:06:01.909> their<00:06:02.000> basic

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
KMC models in terms of its lifespan I

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.749 
KMC models in terms of its lifespan I
was<00:06:06.229> able<00:06:06.349> to<00:06:06.500> put<00:06:06.710> quite<00:06:06.889> a<00:06:06.919> few<00:06:07.129> miles<00:06:07.370> on<00:06:07.580> it

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:07.759 
was able to put quite a few miles on it

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.240 
was able to put quite a few miles on it
with<00:06:08.690> a<00:06:08.719> minimum<00:06:09.199> of<00:06:09.349> maintenance<00:06:09.529> and<00:06:10.039> it

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
with a minimum of maintenance and it

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.029 
with a minimum of maintenance and it
just<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.990> impressed<00:06:11.990> me<00:06:12.110> how<00:06:12.289> long<00:06:12.500> it<00:06:12.620> lasted

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
just it impressed me how long it lasted

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.450 
just it impressed me how long it lasted
we'll<00:06:13.490> see<00:06:13.759> if<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:15.050> gold<00:06:15.319> version<00:06:15.650> lasts<00:06:16.370> even

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
we'll see if the gold version lasts even

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.110 
we'll see if the gold version lasts even
longer<00:06:16.639> yet<00:06:17.210> if<00:06:17.389> not<00:06:18.129> then<00:06:19.129> I<00:06:19.550> don't<00:06:19.789> really

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
longer yet if not then I don't really

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.420 
longer yet if not then I don't really
see<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.990> justification<00:06:21.889> and<00:06:21.979> spending<00:06:22.340> the

see the justification and spending the
extra<00:06:22.550> money<00:06:22.759> just<00:06:23.000> for<00:06:23.990> something<00:06:24.259> that

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
extra money just for something that

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.379 
extra money just for something that
looks<00:06:24.379> cool<00:06:25.069> because<00:06:25.639> it's<00:06:25.759> gold<00:06:25.969> I'll

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
looks cool because it's gold I'll

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.889 
looks cool because it's gold I'll
probably<00:06:26.779> go<00:06:26.990> back<00:06:27.020> to<00:06:27.969> the<00:06:28.969> standard<00:06:29.210> x10

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:29.899 
probably go back to the standard x10

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.930 
probably go back to the standard x10

it<00:06:52.580> of<00:06:52.640> course<00:06:52.820> you<00:06:53.060> run<00:06:53.240> the<00:06:53.360> risk<00:06:53.510> of<00:06:53.840> really

it of course you run the risk of really

it of course you run the risk of really
