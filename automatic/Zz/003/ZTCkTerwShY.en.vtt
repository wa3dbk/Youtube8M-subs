00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
know I'm optimistic I think we've got a

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.269 
know I'm optimistic I think we've got a
completely<00:00:16.199> different<00:00:16.680> team<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.130> had

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
completely different team that we had

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.670 
completely different team that we had
last<00:00:17.520> year<00:00:17.789> i<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.230> team's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.650> little

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
last year i think this team's a little

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920 
last year i think this team's a little
tougher<00:00:20.189> than<00:00:20.310> last<00:00:20.550> year's<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.240> got<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> lot

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930

of<00:00:21.960> talent<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.710> again<00:00:23.519> either<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.630> first<00:00:24.990> or

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
of talent and again either the first or

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.410 
of talent and again either the first or
i<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> youngest<00:00:26.939> team<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you're a thief I think the most most

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.969 
you're a thief I think the most most
importantly<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> grown<00:01:04.680> ship

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
importantly is that we have a grown ship

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.399 
importantly is that we have a grown ship
though<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.909> players<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.450> confidence<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
though the players have confidence and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.020 
though the players have confidence and
then<00:01:07.500> leaving<00:01:07.799> him<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:08.430> he's<00:01:08.610> been<00:01:08.820> there
