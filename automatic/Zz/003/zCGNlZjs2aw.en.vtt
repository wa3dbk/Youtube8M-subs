00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
we're going to be looking at the

infection
yesterday<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.930> had<00:00:07.170> done<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.379> video<00:00:07.560> where<00:00:07.919> I

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
yesterday I had done a video where I

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.919 
yesterday I had done a video where I
said<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> thought<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.820> landscaper<00:00:09.420> was<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
said I thought the landscaper was the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.959 
said I thought the landscaper was the
worst<00:00:10.110> gun<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.590> game<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.460> guys<00:00:11.580> gave

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
worst gun in the game and you guys gave

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.310 
worst gun in the game and you guys gave
me<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.179> whole<00:00:12.300> bunch<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.570> ideas<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:13.170> other

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
me a whole bunch of ideas of other

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.530 
me a whole bunch of ideas of other
weapons<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.920> go<00:00:14.070> ahead<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.670> experiment<00:00:15.420> with

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
weapons to go ahead and experiment with

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.630 
weapons to go ahead and experiment with
as<00:00:15.809> potentially<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.039> know<00:00:17.070> some<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
as potentially you know some of the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.820 
as potentially you know some of the
worst<00:00:17.850> weapons<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.539> game<00:00:18.570> now<00:00:19.470> someone

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
worst weapons in the game now someone

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.500 
worst weapons in the game now someone
had<00:00:19.949> brought<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> infection<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.390> had

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
had brought up the infection and I had

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.300 
had brought up the infection and I had
actually<00:00:21.660> never<00:00:22.050> used<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.769> weapon<00:00:23.010> before

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
actually never used this weapon before

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.150 
actually never used this weapon before
because<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.210> thought<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.320> gimmick<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.920> kind

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
because I thought it's gimmick was kind

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.849 
because I thought it's gimmick was kind
of<00:00:26.250> stupid<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.510> deal<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> infection<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
of stupid the deal with the infection is

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.189 
of stupid the deal with the infection is
that<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.099> has<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:29.730> low<00:00:30.119> base<00:00:30.480> damage<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
that it has a very low base damage but a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.380 
that it has a very low base damage but a
very<00:00:31.560> high<00:00:31.890> corrosive<00:00:32.579> damage<00:00:32.880> over<00:00:33.120> time

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
very high corrosive damage over time

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.470 
very high corrosive damage over time
it's<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.230> malwan<00:00:34.739> Seraph<00:00:35.340> pistol<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.239> comes

hunt<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.410> never<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:43.950> used<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
hunt now I have never actually used this

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.670 
hunt now I have never actually used this
weapon<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.360> we'll<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.780> how<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> works<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.530> in

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
weapon so we'll see how it works here in

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.490 
weapon so we'll see how it works here in
this<00:00:46.890> loader<00:00:47.250> only<00:00:47.760> area<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:49.020> using<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
this loader only area I will be using a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.110 
this loader only area I will be using a
corrosive<00:00:49.950> bone<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> Ancients<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
corrosive bone of the Ancients to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.279 
corrosive bone of the Ancients to
further<00:00:51.360> boost<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.840> corrosive<00:00:52.260> damage

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
further boost the corrosive damage

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
further boost the corrosive damage
hopefully<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.309> we'll<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.149> actually

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
hopefully and we'll see if it's actually

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.389 
hopefully and we'll see if it's actually
able<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.960> past<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.559> ultimate<00:00:56.190> vault

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
able to get past the ultimate vault

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.610 
able to get past the ultimate vault
under<00:00:56.699> health<00:00:56.910> regeneration<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:58.350> all<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
under health regeneration that all of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.990 
under health regeneration that all of
these<00:00:58.770> enemies<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.940> do

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
these enemies are going to have I do

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.779 
these enemies are going to have I do
expect<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.160> significantly<00:01:02.160> dampen<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
expect that to significantly dampen the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
expect that to significantly dampen the
effect<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.510> gun<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.930> everything<00:01:04.019> like

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
effect of this gun and everything like

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
effect of this gun and everything like
that<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.339> we'll<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.610> ahead<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> test<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.330> out

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that but we'll go ahead and test it out

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.620 
that but we'll go ahead and test it out
here<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.260> how<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.409> works

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
here and see how it works

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.060 
here and see how it works
there<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:10.080> loader<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> first<00:01:10.860> room

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
there is one loader in the first room

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.700 
there is one loader in the first room
and<00:01:11.280> we'll<00:01:11.400> watch<00:01:11.610> how<00:01:12.390> quickly<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:13.020> slowly<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and we'll watch how quickly or slowly it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.990 
and we'll watch how quickly or slowly it
happens<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> kill<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.490> guy<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> said

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
happens to kill this guy like I said

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.499 
happens to kill this guy like I said
I've<00:01:15.299> never<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.750> used<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.380> gun<00:01:16.560> before

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
I've never actually used this gun before

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.149 
I've never actually used this gun before
the<00:01:18.509> corrosive<00:01:18.930> damage<00:01:18.990> over<00:01:19.380> time<00:01:19.409> does<00:01:19.860> seem

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the corrosive damage over time does seem

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
the corrosive damage over time does seem
to<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.400> eating<00:01:20.759> through<00:01:20.970> his<00:01:21.299> health<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> his

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
to be eating through his health and his

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
to be eating through his health and his
health<00:01:22.530> regeneration<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:23.640> decently

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
health regeneration actually decently

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.140 
health regeneration actually decently
quickly<00:01:24.900> now<00:01:25.500> obviously<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.970> as

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
quickly now obviously it's it's not as

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
quickly now obviously it's it's not as
quick<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.049> killing<00:01:28.380> him<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.799> actual

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
quick as just killing him with an actual

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.359 
quick as just killing him with an actual
damaging<00:01:29.880> corrosive<00:01:30.360> damage<00:01:30.409> gun<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:32.009> we'll

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
damaging corrosive damage gun but we'll

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.240 
damaging corrosive damage gun but we'll
go<00:01:32.490> ahead<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.850> test<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:34.100> one<00:01:35.100> thing

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
go ahead and test it out here one thing

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
go ahead and test it out here one thing
I<00:01:35.369> definitely<00:01:35.430> am<00:01:35.970> thinking<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.689> avoid

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I definitely am thinking I want to avoid

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560 
I definitely am thinking I want to avoid
is<00:01:37.320> having<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.100> power<00:01:38.340> loader<00:01:38.700> reflexes<00:01:39.360> back

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810 
is having a power loader reflexes back
on<00:01:39.810> me<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> bull<00:01:40.650> loader<00:01:40.890> shield<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.610> think

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
on me or a bull loader shield I think

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.219 
on me or a bull loader shield I think
those<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.210> reflect<00:01:42.420> bullets<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:42.990> well<00:01:43.200> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
those can reflect bullets as well I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
those can reflect bullets as well I
could<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.710> wrong<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.610> definitely<00:01:45.540> if

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
could be wrong on that but definitely if

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
could be wrong on that but definitely if
any<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.560> powerful<00:01:46.829> corrosive

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
any of this really powerful corrosive

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
any of this really powerful corrosive
damage<00:01:47.640> over<00:01:48.090> time<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> reflect

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
damage over time is going to reflect

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.800 
damage over time is going to reflect
upon<00:01:49.829> me<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.579> expect<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.450> kill<00:01:51.659> me

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
upon me I do expect that to kill me

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
upon me I do expect that to kill me
because<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.409> know<00:01:52.530> obviously<00:01:53.130> damage<00:01:53.490> over

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
because you know obviously damage over

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
because you know obviously damage over
time<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.090> very<00:01:54.270> powerful<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> over<00:01:55.079> power

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
time is very powerful and over power

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.959 
time is very powerful and over power
level<00:01:55.619> eight<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.549> would<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.729> something

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
level eight and that would be something

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.520 
level eight and that would be something
to<00:01:57.119> watch<00:01:57.299> out<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.049> gun<00:01:58.259> most

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to watch out for with this gun most

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.440 
to watch out for with this gun most
likely

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
likely

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.010 
likely
so<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.500> not<00:02:00.740> doing<00:02:01.070> too<00:02:01.280> bad<00:02:01.549> um<00:02:01.880> it's<00:02:02.869> not

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
so it's not doing too bad um it's not

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.550 
so it's not doing too bad um it's not
doing<00:02:03.290> good<00:02:03.500> by<00:02:03.799> any<00:02:03.830> means<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:06.380> know

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
doing good by any means but you know

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.680 
doing good by any means but you know
it's<00:02:07.310> not<00:02:07.460> doing<00:02:07.729> too<00:02:07.909> bad<00:02:08.090> it's<00:02:08.420> eating

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
it's not doing too bad it's eating

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.270 
it's not doing too bad it's eating
through<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.050> guy<00:02:09.200> there<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.679> think<00:02:09.920> it<00:02:10.190> will

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
through that guy there I think it will

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.390 
through that guy there I think it will
be<00:02:10.429> able<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.729> get<00:02:10.849> me<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> second<00:02:11.450> wind<00:02:12.400> with

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
be able to get me a second wind with

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.370 
be able to get me a second wind with
this<00:02:13.610> shield<00:02:13.970> here<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.599> this<00:02:14.750> guy<00:02:14.930> has<00:02:15.170> I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this shield here that this guy has I

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.380 
this shield here that this guy has I
expected<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.950> do<00:02:16.100> very<00:02:16.340> poorly<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.150> it's

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
expected to do very poorly but it's

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.940 
expected to do very poorly but it's
actually<00:02:17.780> eating<00:02:18.020> through<00:02:18.200> his<00:02:18.350> shield<00:02:18.620> kind

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
actually eating through his shield kind

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.790 
actually eating through his shield kind
of<00:02:19.040> quickly<00:02:19.340> as<00:02:19.459> well<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.600> it's<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.560> shame<00:02:21.739> that

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
of quickly as well so it's a shame that

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.710 
of quickly as well so it's a shame that
this<00:02:22.069> gun<00:02:22.280> has<00:02:22.489> such<00:02:22.700> low<00:02:22.970> base<00:02:23.270> damage

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
this gun has such low base damage

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.780 
this gun has such low base damage
because<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.440> damage<00:02:24.830> over<00:02:24.920> time<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.459> actually

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
because the damage over time is actually

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.960 
because the damage over time is actually
pretty<00:02:26.060> nice<00:02:26.739> which<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> very<00:02:28.190> rare<00:02:28.610> thing

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
pretty nice which is a very rare thing

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.930 
pretty nice which is a very rare thing
in<00:02:29.180> Borderlands<00:02:29.720> 2<00:02:30.430> usually<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.580> corrosive

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
in Borderlands 2 usually the corrosive

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.120 
in Borderlands 2 usually the corrosive
or<00:02:32.300> any<00:02:32.720> damage<00:02:33.080> over<00:02:33.260> time<00:02:33.290> for<00:02:33.739> many<00:02:33.890> weapons

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
or any damage over time for many weapons

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.790 
or any damage over time for many weapons
usually<00:02:34.730> isn't<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.180> powerful<00:02:35.390> but<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.560> seems

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
usually isn't that powerful but it seems

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.140 
usually isn't that powerful but it seems
to<00:02:36.890> be<00:02:37.010> working<00:02:37.160> all<00:02:37.430> right<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.850> here

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
to be working all right in here

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.270 
to be working all right in here
as<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:39.170> can<00:02:39.260> see<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.620> eats<00:02:39.799> through<00:02:40.069> their

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
as you can see it eats through their

as you can see it eats through their

health decently quickly and stuff like

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.400 
health decently quickly and stuff like
that<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:43.810> definitely<00:02:44.810> getting<00:02:45.019> multiple

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
stacks of it and stuff like that is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.330 
stacks of it and stuff like that is
helping<00:02:47.150> me<00:02:47.440> try<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.500> get<00:02:48.620> those<00:02:48.739> transfusion

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
helping me try to get those transfusion

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.449 
helping me try to get those transfusion
grenades<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:49.850> don't<00:02:50.090> die<00:02:50.269> there<00:02:54.400> when<00:02:55.400> I

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
grenades so I don't die there when I

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.460 
grenades so I don't die there when I
phase<00:02:55.700> locking<00:02:55.940> into<00:02:56.180> me<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.510> has<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:56.900> very<00:02:57.260> high

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
phase locking into me it has a very high

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.860 
phase locking into me it has a very high
fire<00:02:57.739> rate<00:02:58.040> unfortunately<00:02:58.880> like<00:02:59.150> all<00:02:59.360> malwan

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
fire rate unfortunately like all malwan

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.750 
fire rate unfortunately like all malwan
pistols<00:03:00.319> this<00:03:00.500> gun<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.830> going<00:03:01.069> to<00:03:01.160> use<00:03:01.310> up<00:03:01.519> two

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
pistols this gun is going to use up two

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.270 
pistols this gun is going to use up two
rounds<00:03:02.239> per<00:03:02.420> shot<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:02.989> so<00:03:03.590> because<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.130> that

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
rounds per shot and so because of that

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.099 
rounds per shot and so because of that
you<00:03:04.640> don't<00:03:04.670> really<00:03:05.120> get<00:03:05.359> as<00:03:05.480> many<00:03:05.660> shots<00:03:05.900> out

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
you don't really get as many shots out

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.140 
you don't really get as many shots out
of<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.350> magazine<00:03:06.769> as<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.010> would<00:03:07.160> like<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.579> that

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
of the magazine as I would like and that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.150 
of the magazine as I would like and that
would<00:03:08.269> definitely<00:03:08.420> increase<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.290> potency

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
would definitely increase the potency

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.900 
would definitely increase the potency
and<00:03:10.430> potential<00:03:11.000> of<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.299> weapon<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.640> there<00:03:13.790> we

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
and potential of this weapon so there we

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.050 
and potential of this weapon so there we
go

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
go

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.060 
go
um<00:03:14.630> it's<00:03:15.019> even<00:03:15.290> through<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.620> bull<00:03:15.829> loader

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
um it's even through that bull loader

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.099 
um it's even through that bull loader
it's<00:03:16.400> alright<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.209> seems<00:03:17.540> like<00:03:17.690> it's<00:03:17.840> working

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
it's alright it seems like it's working

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.720 
it's alright it seems like it's working
okay<00:03:18.380> with<00:03:18.530> chain<00:03:18.739> reaction<00:03:19.190> too<00:03:19.370> because

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
okay with chain reaction too because

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.819 
okay with chain reaction too because
we're<00:03:19.880> applying<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.480> damage<00:03:21.230> over<00:03:21.410> time<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.799> a

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
we're applying the damage over time to a

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.000 
we're applying the damage over time to a
lot<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.160> enemies<00:03:22.489> at<00:03:22.640> once<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.680> know<00:03:24.799> it

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
ate through that guy eventually and it

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.910 
ate through that guy eventually and it
was<00:03:26.540> able<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.840> kill<00:03:27.109> him<00:03:27.260> I<00:03:27.380> guess<00:03:27.620> we'll<00:03:27.799> go

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
was able to kill him I guess we'll go

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.670 
was able to kill him I guess we'll go
ahead<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.519> test<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.940> out<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.810> badass

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.280 
ahead and test it out on the badass
loader<00:03:31.040> up<00:03:31.250> here<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.670> see<00:03:31.820> how<00:03:31.910> we<00:03:31.970> do<00:03:32.209> there

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.599 

it's<00:03:36.290> unfortunate<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:36.950> we<00:03:37.100> can't<00:03:37.370> kill

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
it's unfortunate that we can't kill

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.170 
it's unfortunate that we can't kill

censorship<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.560> really<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:54.980> answer<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.489> I'd

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
censorship is really the answer and I'd

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:56.979 
censorship is really the answer and I'd

badass<00:04:31.200> with<00:04:31.770> Maya<00:04:32.240> isn't<00:04:33.240> going<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.540> kill<00:04:33.750> you

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
badass with Maya isn't going to kill you

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.840 
badass with Maya isn't going to kill you
because<00:04:34.260> you'll<00:04:34.530> just<00:04:34.950> phase<00:04:35.220> lock<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.700> and

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
because you'll just phase lock it and

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.050 
because you'll just phase lock it and
usually<00:04:36.000> kill<00:04:36.480> it<00:04:36.660> before<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:37.790> before<00:04:38.790> it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
usually kill it before it before it

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.610 
usually kill it before it before it
takes<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.360> out<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.720> stuff<00:04:39.930> like<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.380> but

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
takes you out and stuff like that but

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.010 
takes you out and stuff like that but
this<00:04:40.800> weapon<00:04:41.220> with<00:04:41.850> its<00:04:42.060> extremely<00:04:42.480> low<00:04:42.600> base

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
this weapon with its extremely low base

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.290 
this weapon with its extremely low base
damage<00:04:43.470> was<00:04:43.770> not<00:04:43.800> enough<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.490> do<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.820> so

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
damage was not enough to do that so

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.450 
damage was not enough to do that so
we'll<00:04:46.050> head<00:04:46.230> back<00:04:46.260> over<00:04:46.710> there<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.100> try<00:04:47.430> it

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
we'll head back over there and try it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:57.020 
we'll head back over there and try it
again

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.580 

all<00:04:58.030> right<00:04:58.419> so<00:04:58.629> I<00:04:58.660> guess<00:04:58.930> I'll<00:04:59.050> go<00:04:59.199> ahead<00:04:59.319> and

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
all right so I guess I'll go ahead and

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.279 
all right so I guess I'll go ahead and

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
because like I said I think it will be a

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.890 
because like I said I think it will be a
decent<00:05:16.840> little<00:05:17.139> series<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:18.720> finish<00:05:19.720> off

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
decent little series to finish off

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.070 
the first episode with the landscapers
seemed<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:57.819> go<00:05:57.909> over<00:05:58.210> pretty<00:05:58.360> well<00:05:58.659> and<00:05:58.840> stuff

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
seemed to go over pretty well and stuff

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.620 
seemed to go over pretty well and stuff
like<00:05:59.259> that<00:05:59.500> so<00:06:00.130> as<00:06:00.370> always<00:06:00.610> guys<00:06:01.150> I<00:06:01.360> thank<00:06:01.539> you

this last loader overall if I had to

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.850 
this last loader overall if I had to
rate<00:06:06.159> the<00:06:06.310> infection<00:06:06.880> it<00:06:07.090> would<00:06:07.300> be<00:06:07.479> a<00:06:08.139> bottom

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860

junk<00:06:13.960> water<00:06:14.169> would<00:06:14.349> shoot<00:06:14.560> me<00:06:14.680> from<00:06:14.889> up<00:06:15.039> there

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
junk water would shoot me from up there

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.019 
junk water would shoot me from up there
maybe<00:06:16.630> the<00:06:17.430> converge<00:06:18.430> pulled<00:06:18.789> him<00:06:18.909> in<00:06:19.000> a

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:19.029 
maybe the converge pulled him in a

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.309 
maybe the converge pulled him in a
little<00:06:19.180> bit<00:06:19.300> close<00:06:19.599> and<00:06:19.870> so<00:06:20.020> now<00:06:20.139> he's

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 
little bit close and so now he's

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.230 
little bit close and so now he's
shooting<00:06:20.500> at<00:06:20.770> me<00:06:21.090> anyway

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
shooting at me anyway

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.120

I<00:06:22.270> would<00:06:22.509> rate<00:06:22.750> the<00:06:23.020> damage<00:06:23.409> over<00:06:23.469> time<00:06:23.620> effect

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
I would rate the damage over time effect

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.249 
I would rate the damage over time effect
be<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.370> complete<00:06:24.849> novelty<00:06:25.419> it<00:06:25.750> would<00:06:25.930> be<00:06:26.020> better

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
be a complete novelty it would be better

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.370 
be a complete novelty it would be better
just<00:06:26.380> to<00:06:26.710> have<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:27.159> raw<00:06:27.400> damage<00:06:27.699> a<00:06:28.380> standard

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
just to have the raw damage a standard

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.990 
just to have the raw damage a standard
mallow<00:06:29.590> Wan<00:06:29.830> pistol<00:06:30.250> would<00:06:30.340> do<00:06:30.490> a<00:06:30.520> lot<00:06:30.729> better

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
mallow Wan pistol would do a lot better
