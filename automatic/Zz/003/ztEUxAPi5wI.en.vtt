i'm<00:00:07.790> broke<00:00:08.210> three<00:00:08.660> controllers<00:00:09.050> doing<00:00:09.440> this

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
i'm broke three controllers doing this

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.420 
i'm broke three controllers doing this
crap<00:00:11.620> there's<00:00:12.820> second<00:00:13.820> one<00:00:15.039> here's<00:00:16.039> the<00:00:16.129> third

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
crap there's second one here's the third

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.029 
crap there's second one here's the third
one<00:00:16.699> that<00:00:17.180> one's<00:00:17.360> jacked<00:00:17.750> up<00:00:17.990> shine<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.680> whole

cap off of that one and here's the good

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.320 
cap off of that one and here's the good
controller<00:00:23.740> all<00:00:24.740> right<00:00:24.910> that's<00:00:25.910> what<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:26.180> do

finger along the back this thumb up here
along<00:00:34.460> this<00:00:34.609> case<00:00:34.940> make<00:00:35.210> sure<00:00:35.359> you<00:00:35.479> don't

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:35.659 
along this case make sure you don't

and then you shine like this okay and
you're<00:01:09.560> moving<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:10.579> gun<00:01:10.990> up<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.380> down<00:01:12.530> also

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
you're moving the gun up and down also

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.770 
you're moving the gun up and down also
okay<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:14.770> like<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.890> do<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:16.130> like<00:01:16.280> this<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.789> lot<00:01:16.909> of

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
okay I like to do it like this a lot of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.330 
okay I like to do it like this a lot of
people<00:01:18.049> they<00:01:18.170> do<00:01:18.320> it<00:01:18.409> like<00:01:18.530> this<00:01:18.710> hold<00:01:19.039> it<00:01:19.189> up

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
people they do it like this hold it up

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.330 
people they do it like this hold it up
in<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.670> air<00:01:19.820> point<00:01:20.359> your<00:01:20.479> palm<00:01:20.689> out<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.340> shine

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
in the air point your palm out and shine

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.889 
in the air point your palm out and shine
like<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:24.039> real<00:01:25.039> fast<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.729> takes<00:01:25.880> practice<00:01:26.179> so

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
like that real fast it takes practice so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.319 
like that real fast it takes practice so
you<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.109> stay<00:01:27.259> on<00:01:27.289> the<00:01:27.500> rim<00:01:27.710> but<00:01:28.130> what<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.060> found

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
you can stay on the rim but what I found

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.389 
you can stay on the rim but what I found
out<00:01:29.539> is<00:01:29.600> smaller<00:01:30.140> circles<00:01:30.590> work<00:01:30.770> better<00:01:31.009> but

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
out is smaller circles work better but

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.830 
out is smaller circles work better but
it's<00:01:31.579> kind<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.820> hard<00:01:32.060> because<00:01:32.179> sometimes<00:01:32.479> your

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
it's kind of hard because sometimes your

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.730 
it's kind of hard because sometimes your
jolt<00:01:33.670> also<00:01:34.670> your<00:01:34.909> fingertips<00:01:35.539> work<00:01:35.869> better<00:01:36.109> so

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
jolt also your fingertips work better so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.289 
jolt also your fingertips work better so
like<00:01:36.950> sometimes<00:01:37.369> when<00:01:37.490> i'll<00:01:37.609> shine<00:01:37.850> I'll

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
like sometimes when i'll shine I'll

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.480 
like sometimes when i'll shine I'll
shiny<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:38.780> fast<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:39.350> then<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.070> controller

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
shiny so fast and then the controller

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.940 
shiny so fast and then the controller
starts<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.999> slide<00:01:41.240> down<00:01:41.299> like<00:01:42.109> my<00:01:42.350> hand<00:01:42.679> starts

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
starts to slide down like my hand starts

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.980 
starts to slide down like my hand starts
to<00:01:43.009> slide<00:01:43.189> down<00:01:43.249> like<00:01:43.579> that<00:01:43.729> but<00:01:44.299> I<00:01:44.329> still<00:01:44.659> is

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
to slide down like that but I still is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.480 
to slide down like that but I still is
still<00:01:45.259> between<00:01:45.560> my<00:01:45.649> fingers<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.039> I<00:01:46.100> can<00:01:46.249> still

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
still between my fingers and I can still

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.830 
still between my fingers and I can still
shy<00:01:46.700> all<00:01:47.479> right<00:01:48.909> so<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:49.969> just<00:01:50.179> get<00:01:50.359> going<00:01:50.630> to

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
shy all right so you just get going to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.090 
shy all right so you just get going to
practice<00:01:51.049> mode

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
practice mode

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.280 
practice mode
and<00:01:52.220> look<00:01:52.670> at<00:01:52.790> your<00:01:52.970> circles<00:01:53.570> along<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.080> mint

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
and look at your circles along the mint

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.289 
and look at your circles along the mint
on<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.470> long<00:01:54.710> side<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:55.759> don't<00:01:55.790> want<00:01:56.060> them<00:01:56.180> to

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
on the long side you don't want them to

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.450 
on the long side you don't want them to
be<00:01:56.420> choppy<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:57.259> want<00:01:57.439> each<00:01:57.680> individual

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
be choppy you want each individual

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.090 
be choppy you want each individual
circle<00:01:58.909> to<00:01:59.479> look<00:01:59.750> like<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.140> spinning<00:02:00.470> by

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
circle to look like it's spinning by

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.820 
circle to look like it's spinning by
itself<00:02:01.400> fast<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.659> once<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.049> do<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.440> once<00:02:03.470> you

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
itself fast and once you do it once you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.920 
itself fast and once you do it once you
practice<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.340> you'll<00:02:04.759> see<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.690> going

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
practice it you'll see that it's going

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.109 
practice it you'll see that it's going
faster<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.350> faster<00:02:06.440> all<00:02:07.310> right<00:02:07.460> those<00:02:07.700> those

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
faster and faster all right those those

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.449 
faster and faster all right those those
when<00:02:08.450> each<00:02:08.660> individual<00:02:09.289> arrow<00:02:09.500> looks<00:02:10.310> like

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
when each individual arrow looks like

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.949 
when each individual arrow looks like
it's<00:02:10.610> spinning<00:02:10.850> then<00:02:11.270> you're<00:02:11.420> doing<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.810> right
