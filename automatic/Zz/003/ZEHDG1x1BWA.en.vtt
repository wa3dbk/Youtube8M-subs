hi this is George from high-tech Legion

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.849 
hi this is George from high-tech Legion
today<00:00:04.200> we're<00:00:04.290> going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.470> take<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.589> look<00:00:04.740> at<00:00:04.799> the

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
today we're going to take a look at the

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.129 
today we're going to take a look at the
noctua<00:00:05.450> NHC<00:00:06.450> 14<00:00:07.049> cpu<00:00:07.680> cooler<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.849> NHC<00:00:09.389> 14<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.110> a

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
noctua NHC 14 cpu cooler the NHC 14 is a

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.930 
noctua NHC 14 cpu cooler the NHC 14 is a
very<00:00:10.469> interesting<00:00:10.679> piece<00:00:11.160> which<00:00:11.790> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
very interesting piece which the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.549 
very interesting piece which the
packaging<00:00:12.450> really<00:00:12.719> only<00:00:12.870> kind<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.200> handset

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
packaging really only kind of handset

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.650 
packaging really only kind of handset
taking<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.490> look<00:00:14.700> at<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.910> front<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> box<00:00:15.389> we

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
taking a look at the front of the box we

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.400 
taking a look at the front of the box we
can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:16.220> there's<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.340> picture<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.300> NHC<00:00:18.960> 14

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
can see there's a picture of the NHC 14

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.010 
can see there's a picture of the NHC 14
but<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.520> only<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.730> partial<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.480> concede<00:00:21.810> it's

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
but it's only a partial we concede it's

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.480 
but it's only a partial we concede it's
dual<00:00:22.260> fan<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.609> not<00:00:24.240> much<00:00:24.480> else<00:00:25.189> do<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.279> see

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
dual fan but not much else do you see

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
dual fan but not much else do you see
that<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.000> c-type<00:00:27.449> flow<00:00:27.779> design<00:00:28.019> which

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
that it's a c-type flow design which

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.439 
that it's a c-type flow design which
basically<00:00:29.010> means<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> cooler<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
basically means that the cooler is

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.049 
basically means that the cooler is
shaped<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.230> sea<00:00:31.529> formation<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> air

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
shaped in a sea formation with the air

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.479 
shaped in a sea formation with the air
blowing<00:00:33.390> through<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.930> way<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> dual

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
blowing through this way it is a dual

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
blowing through this way it is a dual
fan<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:36.030> obviously<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:36.960> from<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
fan which obviously we can see from the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.190 
fan which obviously we can see from the
picture<00:00:37.559> he<00:00:38.399> uses<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> secure<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.600> firm<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
picture he uses the secure to firm to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.430 
picture he uses the secure to firm to
mounting<00:00:40.620> system<00:00:41.329> now<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.570> also<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> low

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
mounting system now it also has a low

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
mounting system now it also has a low
profile<00:00:43.920> mode<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> high<00:00:44.700> clearance<00:00:45.120> mode

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
profile mode and a high clearance mode

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.799 
profile mode and a high clearance mode
basically<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.860> lose<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> themes

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
basically if you lose one of the themes

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.880 
basically if you lose one of the themes
either<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> bottom<00:00:49.170> fam<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
either the bottom fam you're going to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.040 
either the bottom fam you're going to
get<00:00:50.010> much<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.000> clearance<00:00:51.329> underneath<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
get much more clearance underneath the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.770 
get much more clearance underneath the
unit<00:00:52.350> where<00:00:52.829> moves<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> top<00:00:53.820> fan<00:00:54.149> you're

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
unit where moves the top fan you're

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.150 
unit where moves the top fan you're
going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> wind<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> low<00:00:55.649> profile

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
going to wind up with a low profile

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.479 
going to wind up with a low profile
cooler<00:00:56.930> typically<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.050> think<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
cooler typically you don't think of a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.549 
cooler typically you don't think of a
dual<00:00:59.760> fan<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.300> low<00:01:00.480> profile<00:01:01.050> going

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559

166<00:01:12.450> high<00:01:12.810> by<00:01:13.320> 140<00:01:14.220> wide<00:01:14.869> by<00:01:15.869> 1<00:01:16.229> 30<00:01:16.560> deep<00:01:16.950> that's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
166 high by 140 wide by 1 30 deep that's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.550 
166 high by 140 wide by 1 30 deep that's
a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.880> misleading<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.080> actual

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
a little misleading because the actual

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
a little misleading because the actual
height<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.159> listed<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.790> depth<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
height is listed as the depth here and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.480 
height is listed as the depth here and
it's<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> hundred<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.560> thirty<00:01:22.890> millimeters

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
it's a hundred and thirty millimeters

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.300 
it's a hundred and thirty millimeters
with<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> fan<00:01:24.840> attached<00:01:25.290> without<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> fan<00:01:26.130> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
with the fan attached without the fan it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.590 
with the fan attached without the fan it
stands<00:01:26.549> only<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.909> hundred<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> five

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
stands only a hundred and five

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.090 
stands only a hundred and five
millimeters<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.259> it'll<00:01:28.470> fit<00:01:28.650> into<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.979> about

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
millimeters so it'll fit into just about

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.179 
millimeters so it'll fit into just about
any<00:01:29.369> case<00:01:29.720> also<00:01:30.720> you've<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> details<00:01:31.740> on
