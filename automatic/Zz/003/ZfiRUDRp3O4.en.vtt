don't know which ones exactly things

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.120 
don't know which ones exactly things
like<00:00:08.670> x<00:00:08.940> 45<00:00:09.719> or<00:00:09.990> whatever<00:00:10.820> anyway<00:00:11.820> um<00:00:12.059> he<00:00:12.330> has<00:00:12.480> a

like x 45 or whatever anyway um he has a

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.470 
like x 45 or whatever anyway um he has a
problem<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:15.410> this<00:00:16.410> particular<00:00:17.010> wire<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
problem with this particular wire and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.310 
problem with this particular wire and
it's<00:00:19.020> wire<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:20.630> decided<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> take<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.080> apart

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
it's wire I decided to take one apart

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.140 
it's wire I decided to take one apart
because<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.369> second<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.880> we<00:00:24.000> bought

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
because we is the second one we bought

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.630 
because we is the second one we bought
the<00:00:24.330> first<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.779> took<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.109> crap<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.460> got

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the first one took a crap in so we got

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
the first one took a crap in so we got
another<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.029> they're<00:00:28.019> relatively<00:00:28.590> cheap<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
another one they're relatively cheap to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.350 
another one they're relatively cheap to
so<00:00:29.519> not<00:00:30.090> too<00:00:30.269> much<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.570> deal<00:00:31.610> turtle<00:00:32.610> beach<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
so not too much we deal turtle beach you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.229 
so not too much we deal turtle beach you
can<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.780> your<00:00:34.380> force<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
can see your force this is just the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
can see your force this is just the
outside<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.260> know<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.739> will<00:00:37.950> switch<00:00:38.219> by

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
outside of it you know it will switch by

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.610 
outside of it you know it will switch by
my<00:00:38.579> side<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.590> got<00:00:40.590> popped<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.640> anyway

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
my side really got popped out but anyway

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
my side really got popped out but anyway
took<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> apart<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.610> I've<00:00:44.700> found<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
took it apart and I think I've found the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
took it apart and I think I've found the
source<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.200> problem<00:00:47.120> let's<00:00:48.120> see<00:00:48.450> wait<00:00:49.110> wire<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
source of problem let's see wait wire it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.350 
source of problem let's see wait wire it
supposed<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.430> soldered<00:00:50.789> into<00:00:51.090> that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
supposed to be soldered into that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.160 
supposed to be soldered into that
connection<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> does<00:00:53.969> say<00:00:54.300> Mike<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.989> he

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
connection and it does say Mike and he

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
connection and it does say Mike and he
has<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> problem<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.699> connection

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
has a problem with my connection

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.010 
has a problem with my connection
connecting<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.530> static<00:00:59.010> problems<00:00:59.460> on<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
connecting like static problems on this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.709 
connecting like static problems on this
case<00:01:01.829> would<00:01:02.160> hold<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.570> would

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
case would hold it in there so it would

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.010 
case would hold it in there so it would
be<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.049> barely<00:01:04.409> connected<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.540> any<00:01:06.540> movement

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
be just barely connected so any movement

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020 
be just barely connected so any movement
would<00:01:07.140> make<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> rub<00:01:07.770> causing<00:01:08.340> lots<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.610> static

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
would make it rub causing lots of static

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.380 
would make it rub causing lots of static
or<00:01:09.510> sometimes<00:01:10.260> no<00:01:10.970> connection<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.060> all<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:14.390> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
or sometimes no connection at all so it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.899 
or sometimes no connection at all so it
could<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.140> kind<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.890> defect<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.610> looks<00:01:17.759> like

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
could be a kind of defect it looks like

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.100 
could be a kind of defect it looks like
they<00:01:18.030> didn't<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.299> give<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.600> enough<00:01:18.810> why

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
they didn't really give it enough why

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.330 
they didn't really give it enough why
are<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.439> because<00:01:19.590> any<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.159> movement

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
are there because any kind of movement

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.910 
are there because any kind of movement
would<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.259> break<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.770> that's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
would just break that and that's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.999 
would just break that and that's
probably<00:01:23.400> what<00:01:23.700> happened<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:24.240> because

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
probably what happened there because

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.210 
probably what happened there because
it's<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.220> much<00:01:26.430> water<00:01:26.729> left<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.570> so

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
it's not much water left there so

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
it's not much water left there so
luckily<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> cheap<00:01:29.970> wire<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
luckily this is a cheap wire what I

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.749 
luckily this is a cheap wire what I
could<00:01:31.409> try<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> fix<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.909> oh<00:01:34.009> yeah<00:01:36.680> here<00:01:37.700> it's<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
could try to fix it oh yeah here it's a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.560 
could try to fix it oh yeah here it's a
metal<00:01:40.159> I'll<00:01:41.159> try<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.400> zoom<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.299> says

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
metal I'll try the zoom in on or says

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:52.429 
metal I'll try the zoom in on or says
Mike

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:02.450 

so<00:01:53.439> anyway<00:01:53.859> that's<00:01:53.950> why<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.189> found<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:54.640> this

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.469 

here's<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.670> end<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:03.939> goes<00:02:04.119> into<00:02:04.329> the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
here's the end that goes into the

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.609 
here's the end that goes into the
controller<00:02:06.569> and<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.840> end<00:02:07.959> it<00:02:08.110> goes<00:02:08.259> into<00:02:08.560> the

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
controller and the end it goes into the

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.140 
controller and the end it goes into the
headphones<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.879> I<00:02:11.280> looked<00:02:12.280> at<00:02:12.430> all<00:02:12.459> these<00:02:12.760> ends

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
headphones so I looked at all these ends

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.309 
headphones so I looked at all these ends
here<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.739> any<00:02:14.950> sign<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:16.049> pulling<00:02:17.049> on

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
here and there is any sign of pulling on

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.229 
here and there is any sign of pulling on
them<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:19.510> any<00:02:19.810> excessive<00:02:20.650> twisting<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.370> it's

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
them or any excessive twisting so it's

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:30.990 
them or any excessive twisting so it's
only<00:02:22.360> thing<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.750> found<00:02:28.709> over<00:02:29.709> here<00:02:29.950> though<00:02:30.130> just

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
only thing I found over here though just

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000 
only thing I found over here though just
looks<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.269> lot<00:02:31.390> better<00:02:31.599> give<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.440> enough<00:02:32.739> wire

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
looks a lot better give it enough wire

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.270 
looks a lot better give it enough wire
on<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:34.480> side<00:02:36.660> but<00:02:37.660> not<00:02:37.690> over<00:02:38.110> here

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.130 

everything<00:02:42.280> else<00:02:42.430> looks<00:02:42.579> okay<00:02:43.000> just<00:02:43.299> that<00:02:43.510> one

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
everything else looks okay just that one

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.280 
everything else looks okay just that one
part<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.510> would<00:02:46.599> be<00:02:46.629> really<00:02:46.930> hard<00:02:47.200> to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
part and it would be really hard to

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.869 
part and it would be really hard to
repair<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.769> because<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.129> got<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.310> be<00:02:48.400> really
