00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.470
 the galaxy delegation of the angels 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.630
 one of the icons did not arrive alone 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.150
 Salvadorans are also present with 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.639
 the angelino team is about mauricio 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.610
 without fires that among other things spoke 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.620
 also from the Salvadoran team 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.130
 we have been with the 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.410
 team this actually not directly 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.380
 with the inferiors they have given me a 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.220
 position as consulting as ambassador 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.200
 so I took him with a lot of love and 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.559
 which is one of the teams that in 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.269
 I left a lot many years and I 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.739
 they treated well so glad to be 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.749
 with them and I heard they came to the savior 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.030
 Well, the least we could do is 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.370
 accompany them we all know the situation 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.710
 where is the national football and 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.319
 we all know medicine what happens 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.260
 that we do not want to take medicine like that 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:55.269
 which is sad because being Salvadoran 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.089
 one who is out of the country hits you 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.760
 always be exposed to criticism with the 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.329
 other countries and you know in the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.940
 angels 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.460
 We know of any nationality and it hurts 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.120
 but I think the least guilty as 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.280
 it's always him 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.340
 and unfortunately he is the one who always gives the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.920
 cienfuegos face also touched the topic of 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.760
 match sizes and about the case 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.460
 of the 2009 Uncaf Cup a situation that 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.130
 I in my life had seen it in 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.330
 realities of match-fixing when 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.550
 one played because it was not given 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.960
 even what we have fallen is the same 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.360
 situation where there is not a 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.880
 organization to ensure that so 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.060
 what else can I tell you and all of you 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.600
 they know it and osaka that at some point 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.070
 very far so we can change and put 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.570
 strong foundations so that our football in 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.780
 reality take off because right now we're 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.300
 actually in a hole that I do not see him 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.370
 exit being one of the main 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.980
 figures in the history of football 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.230
 Salvadoran Maurice Cienfuegos thinks 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.260
 in the future with the possibility of power 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.670
