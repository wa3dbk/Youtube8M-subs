andrew<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:00.900> working<00:00:01.469> on<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.149> engine<00:00:03.560> this

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
andrew is working on is this engine this

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.369 
andrew is working on is this engine this
as<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.859> can<00:00:05.040> see<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.580> weight<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.379> transparent

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
as you can see a weight of transparent

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.360 
as you can see a weight of transparent
plastic<00:00:07.589> so<00:00:08.130> there<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.820> like<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:10.530> there<00:00:11.280> is

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
plastic so there is like it is there is

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.560 
plastic so there is like it is there is
no<00:00:11.580> power<00:00:11.880> source<00:00:12.240> connected<00:00:13.309> this<00:00:15.379> engine<00:00:16.379> is

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
no power source connected this engine is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.470 
no power source connected this engine is
basically<00:00:18.570> magnets<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:20.990> are<00:00:23.029> tating<00:00:24.029> within

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
basically magnets that are tating within

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.910 
basically magnets that are tating within
these<00:00:25.230> coils<00:00:26.240> or<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:29.210> producing<00:00:30.210> electricity

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
these coils or and producing electricity

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.819 
these coils or and producing electricity
this<00:00:31.920> wouldn't<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> right<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.559> this<00:00:34.559> wall

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
this wouldn't it right down this wall

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.540 
this wouldn't it right down this wall
size<00:00:35.100> produces<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.090> 44<00:00:36.660> volt<00:00:37.520> and<00:00:40.010> 10<00:00:41.010> volts<00:00:41.340> of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
size produces a 44 volt and 10 volts of

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.740 
size produces a 44 volt and 10 volts of
AC<00:00:41.760> power<00:00:42.739> it<00:00:43.739> rotates<00:00:45.770> about<00:00:46.940> 500<00:00:47.940> rounds<00:00:48.539> a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
AC power it rotates about 500 rounds a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.160 
AC power it rotates about 500 rounds a
minute

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
minute

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.290 
minute
and<00:00:51.440> yeah<00:00:54.469> provides<00:00:55.469> electricity<00:00:56.309> without

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
and yeah provides electricity without

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.080 
and yeah provides electricity without
any<00:00:57.930> sources<00:00:58.859> connected<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:02.090> non-stop

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
any sources connected to it and non-stop

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.350 
any sources connected to it and non-stop
for<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.629> 15<00:01:04.080> years<00:01:04.820> after<00:01:05.820> 15<00:01:06.150> years

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
for about 15 years after 15 years

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.910 
for about 15 years after 15 years
probably<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.990> magnets<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> be

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
probably the magnets would have to be

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.370 
probably the magnets would have to be
replaced<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.909> thing<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.450> rotate<00:01:09.659> oh<00:01:09.869> so

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
replaced and the thing will rotate oh so

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.969 
replaced and the thing will rotate oh so
basically<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.810> this<00:01:12.810> thing<00:01:13.260> size<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:15.979> like

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
basically and this thing size of like

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.499 
basically and this thing size of like
sleeping<00:01:17.430> room<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:18.689> provide<00:01:20.450> quite<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
sleeping room would provide quite a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.440 
sleeping room would provide quite a
large<00:01:21.810> building<00:01:22.700> when<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.939> infinite

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
large building when you infinite

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.320 
large building when you infinite
electricity<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.290> making<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.310> size<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
electricity and making this size of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.840 
electricity and making this size of
building<00:01:27.810> we'll<00:01:28.020> tries<00:01:28.549> something<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.820> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
building we'll tries something like a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.460 
building we'll tries something like a
city<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:32.280> quite<00:01:32.610> big<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:35.430> not

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
city so that's quite big but it's not

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.039 
city so that's quite big but it's not
the<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.040> wanted<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> show

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the thing I wanted to show

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.190 
the thing I wanted to show
the<00:01:40.770> thing<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.659> go<00:01:42.780> back<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the thing is this we go back to the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.620 
the thing is this we go back to the
engine<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.859> marks<00:01:44.520> mana<00:01:44.789> balances<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
engine the marks mana balances the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
engine the marks mana balances the
external<00:01:45.750> rotation<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> moment<00:01:47.250> just

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
external rotation at the moment just

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.999 
external rotation at the moment just
future<00:01:48.210> long<00:01:49.700> let's<00:01:50.700> although<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.929> always<00:01:52.439> LMS

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
future long let's although we always LMS

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.609 
future long let's although we always LMS
are<00:01:53.159> connected<00:01:53.899> but<00:01:54.899> we'll<00:01:55.109> speed<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.380> again

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
are connected but we'll speed up again

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.340 
are connected but we'll speed up again
and<00:01:56.240> continue<00:01:57.240> providing<00:01:57.750> stop<00:01:58.170> with

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and continue providing stop with

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.340 
and continue providing stop with
electricity<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:01.259> course<00:02:01.319> if<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:03.350> centrum

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
electricity of course if the centrum

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
electricity of course if the centrum
will<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:05.270> much<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.659> fine<00:02:07.289> nice<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.950> will<00:02:08.160> also

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
will be much more fine nice it will also

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.509 
will be much more fine nice it will also
rotate<00:02:08.849> faster<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.560> concept<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
rotate faster but the concept is the

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.170 
rotate faster but the concept is the
tainted<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.590> guess<00:02:14.370> most<00:02:14.549> important<00:02:15.090> to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
tainted and I guess most important to

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:40.420 
tainted and I guess most important to
show<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:16.140> see<00:02:16.380> running<00:02:16.670> doing<00:02:17.670> fine

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.610 

that's<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.480> meaning<00:02:41.959> mold<00:02:42.140> oh<00:02:42.230> really

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
that's like the meaning mold oh really

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.740 
that's like the meaning mold oh really
so<00:02:43.750> imagine<00:02:44.750> what<00:02:44.900> bigger<00:02:45.560> oil<00:02:45.769> will<00:02:45.950> do<00:02:49.750> okay

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
so imagine what bigger oil will do okay

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.679 
so imagine what bigger oil will do okay
so<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.379> guess<00:02:51.980> this<00:02:52.099> is<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.310> move<00:02:52.689> be

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
so I guess this is it move be

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.110 
so I guess this is it move be
interesting
