00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.050
 ingame 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.150
 I am heartfelt and welcome in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.740
 this new video is now Tuesday then 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.289
 a beautiful final video about hosting 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.119
 game and today we will talk about the k7 yes 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.949
 the survey on facebook really was 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.970
 interesting this time it was a lot 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.260
 fierce 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.449
 I love it so much I thank you 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.769
 because anyway you are also part i 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.970
 yours the game with your votes 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.949
 what are you doing 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.719
 on the facebook page it is essentially 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.280
 the survey was floor and in fact 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.410
 the votes for the field from you for half 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.079
 ris were the same what to do then 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.059
 guys to be able to contact a little 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.190
 all not decided in this case for 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.739
 start doing k 7 since 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 however the old poll was still 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.300
 on the k7 you have voted again then 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 somehow he wanted to thank 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.360
 to with this video 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.890
 but rest assured for all those who 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.170
 voted the metallic week 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 next to the lemme darix network the analyzes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.300
 weapon that will then come from week 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.340
 next will be more or less particular 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.560
 so we will no longer deal with the single weapon 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 but we will deal with various categories of armani 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.790
 the same video so as to make upside down 5 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.860
 top 3 so that you immediately know what they are 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.600
 the best weapons in each category that 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 for now we have not covered everything 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.340
 this to go out a little to improve the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 video visual video video experience not 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.509
 I know about the canal and let's not split up 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.729
 too much and then he wanted this k7 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.560
 then guys this k7 like someone 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.299
 has already said from the facebook page is a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.799
 a bit strange and so maybe it was really 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.689
 necessary to make a weapon analysis of 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.430
 this weapon because for those who have 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.520
 very interesting features but 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.380
 one and essentially only now really 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.990
 negative I say we are talking then 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360
 we are talking about the damage the damage of 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.280
 this weapon is one of the lowest of the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.710
 category if not the lowest among the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 machine guns and this really makes it 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.329
 a weapon difficult to use especially 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.700
 because it is a bit at the beginning because it is not 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.070
 both the damage is fine or a number 34 15 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.290
 however it is difficult to understand 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.460
 look at the time to kill puts us 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.410
 from the three has ris 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.390
 seven shots on the distance boys 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.000
 you know that means seven strokes on the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.620
 distance ie that it takes too long 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.860
 and that connection that Italy drink 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.870
 with a fake computer not really at the top 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.930
 it's really hard so i'm boys 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.090
 but really be careful, then 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.850
 many times along the video when 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.330
 you are on the distance when the target 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.820
 and over 22 23 vehicles, however, within no 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.100
 he sees that it is distant, you do not shoot him 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.140
 come closer because the kids really do 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.150
 dying members for those who are normal seven 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.740
 blows while one guy bye pretend or 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.390
 in the budgets that in any case against four 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.370
 strokes takes you home a hood 12 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.380
 the same is really difficult therefore 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.600
 we must always be in those environments 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.920
 pretty tight gips because then later 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.930
 we will see there is the very feature 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.430
 interesting and above all when 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.990
 would have used the distance you don't have to 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.640
 hope you don't have to warn him that you are 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.830
 there because if he didn't live shoot shot 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.220
 of shots that died for this first thing 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.560
 to say 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.900
 then another very interesting point like 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.690
 already I had a little anticipated before was the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.280
 fire rat 895 shot per minute 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.080
 guys is really very fast if not 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.270
 the faster the category 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.920
 this here as always is the speed with 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.750
 which I hope you will project this 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.940
 which is he said a double-edged sword 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.230
 because on the one hand when they sell 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.110
 narrowly you have an enemy 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.550
 point blank is easy to fuck 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.320
 because anyway two three shots per 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.690
 kill it the gun shoots very fast 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.580
 you have to give yourself a fan of so many problems 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.870
 the problem comes when you have a 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.360
 pour over the distance as I said 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.460
 because we have a good recoil e 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.230
 central however it is quite felt 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.930
 because precisely this crime of fire is 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.300
 very fast and then in the ass that 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.310
 however quite high you hear the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.500
 fast fire rat then blows 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.210
 they run away from the hands and the damage that 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.860
 however low on the distance 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.800
 you don't have to shoot because you really do 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.410
 impossible I recommend you every time 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.300
 to be able to pass through secondary roads 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.190
 get where you think you are in the camper 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.260
 or those that are on the distance e 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.450
 fuck in environments where you are 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.980
 advantage or in any case where yours 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.660
 Submachine gun can make the touch of the 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.360
 years therefore in tight environments such as 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.920
 rooms houses where the target st 5 10 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.180
 meters 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.800
 maximum handle other than the other is 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.780
 the charging speed is very positive 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.030
 that should be faster 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.769
 category with 3 seconds and two for the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.090
 empty magazine and two seconds and 5 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.190
 those the charger still with some 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.760
 blow this guy is a very good one 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.110
 factor that has especially a 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.139
 improve the general characteristics 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.730
 of this weapon and we might even think 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.590
 not to use prefer 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.600
 preferably conjuring up 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.980
 this weapon as light anyway 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.650
 recharge is very fast 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.480
 but in my opinion that being anyway 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.130
 a rush one that you want to throw in the 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.990
 melee conjurer always the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.660
 put however you might even think of 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.910
 don't put it anyway then from them i 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.560
 normal kids live show 1.5 is 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.570
 normal machine gun category a 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.540
 charger 32 and a recoil like vi 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.160
 I said good central but with the rat 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.790
 very fast fire goes to feel 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.669
 quite 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.680
 this guys said wing analysis but 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.870
 ends here I leave the direct link from 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.430
 some parts or similar videos for 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.780
 classic hosting in advice for you 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.310
 with the k 7 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.900
 next week you will have half 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.160
 rics regarding weapon analysis 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.810
 and see you soon with a neighbor 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.810
 video on the hosting and stay tuned
