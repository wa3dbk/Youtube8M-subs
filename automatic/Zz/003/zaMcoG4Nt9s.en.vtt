00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:06.000
 Asos poker 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Pokertape vol.1 

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:16.001
 01. Breathe 

00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:26.363
 (Move) I write at night when the consciences sleep. As a rule I get deformed in the way you want 

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:31.779
 I take the dust to the memories with a glass of what is It's a vice how to call you when I feel alone 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.796
 I'm not Jeannete, I already know why you're going full of shit but a classic like my beach 

00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:42.516
 Suo of the tie of your "treasure", I am "the Notes" That has hit you so many times that the fleet has already sunk you 

00:00:42.517 --> 00:00:47.126
 Inside my glass I see what I'm taking The Moon by NASA, I aspire to much more 

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:52.972
 Every 3 months, Poker D'Asos, breaking incomprehensible bones, not false that under the focus are like the others 

00:00:52.973 --> 00:00:57.913
 Oh, I make music to not feel empty Rap is the Big Bang that pushes me to infinity 

00:00:57.914 --> 00:01:02.959
 I write, and I write, and I write. We are not friends but you know me if you understand what I say 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.000
 Yes, silence in bed and your body a self-taught staple, my solfeo is not for sale 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:13.702
 After being undressed, the desire is worn out. Being calm is to remember how you break me 

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:19.086
 In a second the world is melted, there is no goat that has it so that we try it if we can not even save the neighborhood 

00:01:19.087 --> 00:01:24.251
 They are not songs, they are watchtimes This is not Sicily but I leave the heart for the family 

00:01:24.252 --> 00:01:34.957
 (Kim) Nightmares, they are delusions of your head If you look for the exit you will not find it 

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:45.192
 Breathe, breathe, the night is still young Find a new life and start writing your story 

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:50.578
 (Alver) I stopped being the one of yesterday to be the one of tomorrow And forget about everything that we will go together of the hand 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.084
 From the uncle neighborhood ... always carrying the cream dreaming and flying far away from planet earth 

00:01:56.085 --> 00:02:01.436
 Let yourself be carried by this couple of stars The stars of this game for very different reasons 

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:06.209
 Additions and remnants, you are my story A further defeat in my memory 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.935
 The streets are deserted, I inspire and catch the air I look for you everywhere so as not to fall into disaster 

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:17.708
 There is no trace of that night that I fell away from home, placed on what kills me ... oh 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.099
 The bartender puts me in a bad hand He says that he does not drink more or will have to do me off 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.868
 Marxo dodging lanterns, from sidewalk to sidewalk I feel good and bad, it is as if it were the first 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:33.070
 Cup at night, but really ... I'm not sad. I did not want to end like that, but it's fate 

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:38.152
 I'm like Sony paying my toll Seeing how that image fades little by little 

00:02:38.153 --> 00:02:43.730
 Neither "tratje" nor "xandal", I dress with rhymes Tired of what they think those that underestimate me 

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:48.870
 And for all of them I have a clear message: I live life and I leave it written the next day, already 

00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:59.267
 (Kim) Nightmares, they are delusions of your head If you look for the exit you will not find it 

00:02:59.268 --> 00:03:09.874
 Breathe, breathe, the night is still young Find a new life and start writing your story 

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:20.465
 Nightmares, they are delusions of your head. If you look for the exit you will not find it 

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:31.208
 Breathe, breathe, the night is still young Find a new life and start writing your story
