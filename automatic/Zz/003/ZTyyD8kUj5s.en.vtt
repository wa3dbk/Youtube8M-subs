00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
hi Jeff barber here for RC universe with

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.490 
hi Jeff barber here for RC universe with
Mikhail<00:00:10.370> Graham<00:00:10.670> from<00:00:11.630> blade<00:00:11.900> and<00:00:12.170> we're

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
Mikhail Graham from blade and we're

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.730 
Mikhail Graham from blade and we're
going<00:00:12.710> to<00:00:12.740> talk<00:00:12.980> about<00:00:13.130> the<00:00:13.250> new<00:00:13.429> blade<00:00:13.730> 450<00:00:14.740> 3d

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
going to talk about the new blade 450 3d

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.130 
going to talk about the new blade 450 3d
Mikael<00:00:16.460> what<00:00:16.670> do<00:00:16.730> you<00:00:16.789> got<00:00:16.910> for<00:00:16.940> us<00:00:17.180> today<00:00:17.270> well

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
Mikael what do you got for us today well

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.939 
Mikael what do you got for us today well
we<00:00:18.770> have<00:00:19.010> as<00:00:20.000> you<00:00:20.210> said<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.600> new<00:00:20.720> blade<00:00:20.960> 450<00:00:21.380> 3d

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
we have as you said the new blade 450 3d

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.700 
we have as you said the new blade 450 3d
the<00:00:22.580> newly<00:00:22.820> developed<00:00:23.270> helicopter<00:00:23.960> we've

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
the newly developed helicopter we've

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.500 
the newly developed helicopter we've
made<00:00:24.830> a<00:00:24.890> lot<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.160> improvements<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:26.240> really

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
made a lot of improvements to really

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.570 
made a lot of improvements to really
take<00:00:27.140> this<00:00:27.230> helicopter<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:27.830> the<00:00:27.920> next<00:00:28.220> level

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
take this helicopter to the next level

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.029 
take this helicopter to the next level
so<00:00:29.390> so<00:00:29.630> main<00:00:29.840> some<00:00:30.109> of<00:00:30.170> the<00:00:30.230> main<00:00:30.410> improvements

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
so so main some of the main improvements

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.879 
so so main some of the main improvements
are<00:00:31.220> in<00:00:31.519> the<00:00:31.640> electronics<00:00:32.300> we<00:00:32.659> have<00:00:33.260> included

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:33.889 
are in the electronics we have included

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:36.520 
are in the electronics we have included
a<00:00:33.979> 35<00:00:34.460> m<00:00:34.670> speed<00:00:34.999> controller<00:00:35.420> with<00:00:35.690> a<00:00:35.719> switching

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
a 35 m speed controller with a switching

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.149 
a 35 m speed controller with a switching
switch<00:00:37.129> mode<00:00:37.399> VEC<00:00:38.269> this<00:00:39.139> is<00:00:39.409> combined<00:00:40.010> with

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
switch mode VEC this is combined with

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.039 
switch mode VEC this is combined with
brand-new<00:00:40.639> developed<00:00:41.120> servos<00:00:41.569> for<00:00:41.600> the

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:42.049 
brand-new developed servos for the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:44.739 
brand-new developed servos for the
cyclic<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:42.649> tail<00:00:43.100> as<00:00:43.370> well<00:00:43.819> as<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.089> new<00:00:44.239> gyro

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:44.749 
cyclic and tail as well as the new gyro

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:49.329 
cyclic and tail as well as the new gyro
we're<00:00:45.709> also<00:00:45.799> including<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.760> 3s<00:00:47.589> 2230<00:00:48.589> see<00:00:48.889> lipo

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
we're also including a 3s 2230 see lipo

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.579 
we're also including a 3s 2230 see lipo
battery<00:00:49.699> to<00:00:49.819> take<00:00:49.999> advantage<00:00:50.269> of<00:00:50.659> the<00:00:50.989> 35<00:00:51.379> m

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
battery to take advantage of the 35 m

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.770 
battery to take advantage of the 35 m
speed<00:00:51.889> controller<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:52.969> with<00:00:53.659> this

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
speed controller so with this

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.020 
speed controller so with this
combination<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.589> actually<00:00:54.889> get<00:00:55.039> more<00:00:55.789> power

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
combination you actually get more power

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.479 
combination you actually get more power
and<00:00:56.449> longer<00:00:56.929> flight<00:00:57.199> times<00:00:57.499> you've<00:00:58.279> made<00:00:58.459> a

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
and longer flight times you've made a

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.119 
and longer flight times you've made a
lot<00:00:58.789> of<00:00:59.049> changes<00:01:00.049> and<00:01:00.289> improvements<00:01:00.469> to<00:01:01.039> the

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
lot of changes and improvements to the

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.489 
lot of changes and improvements to the
rotor<00:01:01.339> head<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:01.909> allow<00:01:02.089> higher<00:01:02.839> flip<00:01:03.199> rates

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:03.499 
rotor head to allow higher flip rates

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.730 
rotor head to allow higher flip rates
more<00:01:03.889> aggressive<00:01:04.399> 3d<00:01:04.789> flying<00:01:05.149> as<00:01:05.869> well<00:01:06.590> as

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
more aggressive 3d flying as well as

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.770 
more aggressive 3d flying as well as
some<00:01:06.950> changes<00:01:07.310> in<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.549> tail<00:01:07.789> as<00:01:08.090> you<00:01:08.509> can<00:01:08.630> see

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
some changes in the tail as you can see

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.929 
some changes in the tail as you can see
you<00:01:08.810> have<00:01:08.960> integrated<00:01:09.439> weights<00:01:09.859> to<00:01:10.670> reduce

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
you have integrated weights to reduce

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.639 
you have integrated weights to reduce
the<00:01:11.119> load<00:01:11.240> to<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.539> tester<00:01:12.020> but<00:01:12.229> allowing<00:01:12.380> you

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
the load to the tester but allowing you

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.649 
the load to the tester but allowing you
to<00:01:12.829> get<00:01:13.009> more<00:01:13.159> performance<00:01:13.340> out<00:01:13.909> of<00:01:14.180> your<00:01:14.359> tail

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
to get more performance out of your tail

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.770 
to get more performance out of your tail
so<00:01:15.530> overall<00:01:16.090> everything<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.390> we've<00:01:17.509> done

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
so overall everything that we've done

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.749 
so overall everything that we've done
here<00:01:18.049> is<00:01:18.109> really<00:01:18.469> to<00:01:18.619> take<00:01:19.070> this<00:01:19.219> helicopter

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
here is really to take this helicopter

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.109 
here is really to take this helicopter
to<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.060> next<00:01:20.359> level<00:01:20.689> it's<00:01:21.679> 450<00:01:22.280> 3d<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.939> it

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
to the next level it's 450 3d and it

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.240 
to the next level it's 450 3d and it
actually<00:01:23.299> has<00:01:23.570> 3d<00:01:23.990> in<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.289> name<00:01:24.469> for<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.799> reason

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
actually has 3d in the name for a reason

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.209 
actually has 3d in the name for a reason
this<00:01:25.850> helicopter<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.539> fully<00:01:26.810> 3d<00:01:27.289> capable<00:01:27.829> but

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
this helicopter is fully 3d capable but

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.749 
this helicopter is fully 3d capable but
to<00:01:28.369> take<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:28.759> from<00:01:29.350> your<00:01:30.350> first<00:01:30.619> hovering<00:01:31.130> or
