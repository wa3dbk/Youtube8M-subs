sections there is one issue that we

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.740 
sections there is one issue that we
haven't<00:03:37.769> gone<00:03:37.980> over<00:03:38.130> yet<00:03:38.519> dubs

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
watching in subtitles I say this because

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.440 
watching in subtitles I say this because
not<00:03:49.049> every<00:03:49.680> single<00:03:49.920> anime<00:03:50.549> gets<00:03:50.820> dubbed<00:03:51.150> over

not every single anime gets dubbed over

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.180 
not every single anime gets dubbed over
and<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.019> not<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.350> because<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.799> anime

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
and it's not just because the anime

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.100 
and it's not just because the anime
wasn't<00:03:53.489> good<00:03:53.670> enough

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
wasn't good enough

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.210 
wasn't good enough
sometimes<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.320> original<00:03:55.739> creator<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.130> the
