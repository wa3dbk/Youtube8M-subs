how<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.480> works<00:00:51.890> now<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> first<00:00:53.399> thing<00:00:53.550> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
how it works now the first thing I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.040 
how it works now the first thing I
wanted<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.059> look<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.750> patch

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
wanted to have a look at with this patch

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.979 
wanted to have a look at with this patch
was<00:00:55.590> moving<00:00:56.250> objects<00:00:56.789> around<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.600> obviously

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
was moving objects around and obviously

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
was moving objects around and obviously
this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.289> great<00:00:58.379> way<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.980> speeding<00:00:59.280> up

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
this is a great way of speeding up

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.939 
this is a great way of speeding up
building<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.329> construction<00:01:00.899> once<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.680> sort

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
building a construction once that sort

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
building a construction once that sort
of<00:01:02.010> stage<00:01:02.219> comes<00:01:02.520> out<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> be

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
of stage comes out so if it has to be

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.450 
of stage comes out so if it has to be
over<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:03.899> grabs<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.350> barrel<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
over there grabs that barrel and it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
over there grabs that barrel and it
means<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.729> could<00:01:05.850> actually<00:01:05.970> carry<00:01:06.299> both<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
means we could actually carry both of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.090 
means we could actually carry both of
these<00:01:06.840> objects<00:01:07.290> onto<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> top<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> hill

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
these objects onto the top of the hill

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.950 
these objects onto the top of the hill
if<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> nice<00:01:09.090> firm<00:01:09.390> grip<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.780> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
if you can get a nice firm grip on it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.450 
if you can get a nice firm grip on it
now<00:01:10.110> you'll<00:01:10.409> turn<00:01:10.590> yourself<00:01:10.920> around<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> walk

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.080 
bigger ball before we move on to some
fine<00:03:30.989> how<00:03:31.769> do<00:03:31.829> people<00:03:31.920> would<00:03:32.190> reach<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.609> though

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
fine how do people would reach it though

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.289 
fine how do people would reach it though
oh<00:03:33.120> yeah<00:03:33.930> maybe<00:03:34.139> you're<00:03:34.349> right<00:03:35.060> we<00:03:36.060> barely

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
oh yeah maybe you're right we barely

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.759 
oh yeah maybe you're right we barely
reached<00:03:36.630> without<00:03:36.750> if<00:03:37.109> we<00:03:37.170> roll<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.440> up<00:03:37.590> this

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
reached without if we roll it up this

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.410 
reached without if we roll it up this
hill<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.459> hey<00:03:38.849> it<00:03:39.030> will<00:03:39.209> hit

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
hill and but it hey it will hit

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.970 
hill and but it hey it will hit
something<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.200> make<00:03:40.349> sure<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.680> move<00:03:40.799> it<00:03:40.920> up

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
something so make sure you move it up

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.009 
something so make sure you move it up
the<00:03:41.099> hill<00:03:41.220> then<00:03:41.430> yeah<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.419> think<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:42.989> use

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
the hill then yeah I think if we use

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.949 
the hill then yeah I think if we use
this<00:03:43.410> key<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.950> I'm<00:03:44.160> correct<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.730> we<00:03:44.819> can<00:03:45.000> drive

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
this key if I'm correct so we can drive

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:46.690 
this key if I'm correct so we can drive
it

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
it

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.740 
it
tell<00:03:47.700> me<00:03:47.819> if<00:03:47.880> I'm<00:03:47.970> telling<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.269> right<00:03:48.359> way<00:03:48.540> oh

well first of all they show this block

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.349 
well first of all they show this block
thing<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.459> works<00:04:20.609> now<00:04:20.789> percent<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.180> time

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
thing that works now percent of the time

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.870 
thing that works now percent of the time
right<00:04:22.289> what's<00:04:23.099> Hauser's<00:04:23.370> doing<00:04:23.580> here<00:04:23.729> now

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
right what's Hauser's doing here now

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.920 
right what's Hauser's doing here now
he's<00:04:24.030> blocking<00:04:24.300> with<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.659> right<00:04:24.780> mouse

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
he's blocking with the right mouse

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.960 
he's blocking with the right mouse
button<00:04:24.990> if<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:25.830> swing<00:04:26.130> get<00:04:26.280> him

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
button if I swing get him

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.510 
button if I swing get him
he<00:04:27.330> actually<00:04:27.480> take<00:04:28.200> any<00:04:28.350> damage<00:04:28.470> yes<00:04:29.490> oh

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
he actually take any damage yes oh

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.410 
he actually take any damage yes oh
that's<00:04:30.030> weird

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
that's weird

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.910 
that's weird
I<00:04:30.450> think<00:04:30.780> maybe<00:04:30.900> it's<00:04:31.080> like<00:04:31.170> absenting<00:04:31.470> so

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
I think maybe it's like absenting so

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.080 
I think maybe it's like absenting so
swing<00:04:32.100> at<00:04:32.220> me<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.430> I'll<00:04:32.520> see<00:04:32.640> if<00:04:32.730> I<00:04:32.790> take<00:04:32.940> any

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
swing at me and I'll see if I take any

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.540 
swing at me and I'll see if I take any
damage<00:04:33.860> okay<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.890> didn't<00:04:35.160> take<00:04:35.280> any<00:04:35.430> damage

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
damage okay I didn't take any damage

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.910 
damage okay I didn't take any damage
that<00:04:35.820> time<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.240> maybe<00:04:36.390> it's<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:37.140> base

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
that time so maybe it's a base

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.020 
that time so maybe it's a base
percentage<00:04:38.580> spacing<00:04:38.910> swing<00:04:39.120> at<00:04:39.210> me<00:04:39.270> again

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
percentage spacing swing at me again

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.190 
percentage spacing swing at me again
okay<00:04:42.030> so<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.210> took<00:04:42.270> damage<00:04:42.510> with<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:42.810> dent<00:04:43.020> blog

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
okay so I took damage with a dent blog

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.180 
okay so I took damage with a dent blog
so<00:04:43.350> that's<00:04:43.500> an<00:04:43.590> interesting<00:04:43.920> thing<00:04:44.010> maybe

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
so that's an interesting thing maybe

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.170 
so that's an interesting thing maybe
that's<00:04:44.340> mechanic<00:04:44.670> that<00:04:44.700> needs<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.000> be<00:04:45.030> worked

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
that's mechanic that needs to be worked

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.560 
that's mechanic that needs to be worked
on

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570
