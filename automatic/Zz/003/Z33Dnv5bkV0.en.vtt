about the properties also kind of want

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.799 
about the properties also kind of want
to<00:00:31.590> review<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> tablet<00:00:32.279> cases<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.329> little<00:00:33.630> bit

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.350 
to review the tablet cases a little bit
even<00:00:34.710> though<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.640> might<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.820> better<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> wait

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
even though it might be better to wait

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.840 
even though it might be better to wait
till<00:00:36.410> next<00:00:37.410> time<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:37.950> anyway<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:38.790> this

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
till next time but anyway so here this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.690 
till next time but anyway so here this
is<00:00:38.940> why<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.110> dark<00:00:40.440> brown<00:00:40.739> kind

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
is why this is the the dark brown kind

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.650 
is why this is the the dark brown kind
of<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.940> chocolate<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
of like a chocolate and I have to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.330 
of like a chocolate and I have to
mention<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.960> had<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.500> burgundy<00:00:43.890> tint<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
mention it had a little burgundy tint to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.660 
mention it had a little burgundy tint to
it<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:45.020> will<00:00:46.020> let<00:00:46.649> me<00:00:46.770> move<00:00:46.920> exposure<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it I will let me move exposure up and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.660 
it I will let me move exposure up and
down<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> little<00:00:47.969> bit<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:49.670> so

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
down a little bit just so you can see so

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.529 
down a little bit just so you can see so
that's<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> zero

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
that's and then this is a zero

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.270 
that's and then this is a zero
apparently<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> white<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.190> black

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
apparently and that's the white in black

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.630 
apparently and that's the white in black
you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.390> kind<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.949> different<00:00:59.280> shades

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
you can kind of see the different shades

you can kind of see the different shades
that<00:00:59.910> come<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.300> let<00:01:01.170> me<00:01:01.199> show<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:02.399> close

that come up let me show you up close
like<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> graduate<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.339> texture<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
like a graduate of the texture so that

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.710 
like a graduate of the texture so that
is<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> texture<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.460> leather<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.479> actual

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
is the texture of the leather the actual

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
is the texture of the leather the actual
has<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.140> nice<00:01:10.290> feel<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
has a really nice feel to it it's the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
has a really nice feel to it it's the
oil<00:01:11.790> time<00:01:12.119> does<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> show<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
oil time does that I want to show you is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.410 
oil time does that I want to show you is
what's<00:01:13.920> called<00:01:14.159> pull<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:14.580> pull<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.820> just<00:01:15.299> a

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
what's called pull up pull up just a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.700 
what's called pull up pull up just a
couple<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.780> other<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> show<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
couple of other and I want to show you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
couple of other and I want to show you
was<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:19.350> Bend<00:01:19.710> issue<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.880> were<00:01:21.030> talking

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
was that Bend issue we were talking

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.830 
was that Bend issue we were talking
about<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> way<00:01:24.119> pull<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.420> leather<00:01:24.600> works

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
about so the way pull up leather works

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.300 
about so the way pull up leather works
is<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.770> make<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> scratch<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:28.189> with<00:01:29.189> your

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
is if you make a scratch on it with your

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.660 
is if you make a scratch on it with your
fingernail<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.970> guess<00:01:30.360> its<00:01:30.540> life<00:01:30.720> spot<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
fingernail you guess its life spot and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.450 
fingernail you guess its life spot and
usually<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:34.079> apply<00:01:34.590> heat<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:36.350> oil<00:01:37.460> you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
usually if you apply heat and oil you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.480 
usually if you apply heat and oil you
can<00:01:38.610> actually<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.810> eat<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> spatula<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
can actually they eat the spatula so the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.950 
can actually they eat the spatula so the
same<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> bend

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
same thing with the bend

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.080 
same thing with the bend
so<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> leather<00:01:44.100> empty<00:01:44.460> will<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.759> bending

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
so the leather empty will be bending

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660 
so the leather empty will be bending
back<00:01:45.299> completely<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
back completely like this with the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.330 
back completely like this with the
tablet<00:01:48.210> stand<00:01:48.540> design<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:49.799> concern<00:01:50.189> was

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
tablet stand design and my concern was

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.580 
tablet stand design and my concern was
she<00:01:50.700> would<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.110> this<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:54.350> some<00:01:55.350> people<00:01:55.439> like

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
she would get this now some people like

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.130 
she would get this now some people like
this<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.759> leather<00:01:57.329> Aware's<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.020> gonna

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
this as the leather Aware's it's gonna

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.050 
this as the leather Aware's it's gonna
actually<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:58.770> nice<00:01:58.950> wear<00:01:59.759> mark

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
actually have a really nice wear mark

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.090 
actually have a really nice wear mark
and<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.719> other<00:02:01.079> parts<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.799> leather

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and you know other parts of the leather

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
textural you look at this nice marbling

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.710 
textural you look at this nice marbling
effect<00:02:48.540> kind<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.880> but<00:02:50.880> I<00:02:50.910> do<00:02:51.000> want<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.269> be<00:02:51.569> aware

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
effect kind of but I do want to be aware

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.089 
effect kind of but I do want to be aware
of<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.560> didn't<00:02:52.739> want<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.920> show<00:02:53.040> you

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
of that and I didn't want to show you

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.729 
of that and I didn't want to show you
the<00:02:53.190> texture<00:02:53.579> this<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:55.019> pull<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:55.319> effect<00:02:55.620> is

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
the texture this that pull up effect is

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.339 
the texture this that pull up effect is
actually<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.190> common<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.959> settle

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
actually really common to that settle

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.330 
actually really common to that settle
back<00:02:58.700> comm<00:02:59.700> if<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.450> look<00:03:00.810> around<00:03:01.129> at<00:03:02.129> their

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
back comm if you look around at their

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.160 
back comm if you look around at their
leather<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.450> actually<00:03:03.599> does<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.989> same

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
leather that it actually does the same

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.199 
leather that it actually does the same
same<00:03:04.680> thing<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.370> only<00:03:05.489> difference<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:06.000> I

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
same thing the only difference is I

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.660 
same thing the only difference is I
don't<00:03:06.299> believe<00:03:06.900> there's<00:03:07.680> has<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.220> kind<00:03:08.579> of

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
don't believe there's has this kind of

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.030 
don't believe there's has this kind of
texture<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:11.840> anyway<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.920> edge

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
texture to it so anyway this is the edge

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.119 
texture to it so anyway this is the edge
piece<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.519> it's<00:03:14.670> gonna<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:15.000> scarring<00:03:16.129> okay

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
piece so it's gonna have scarring okay

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.740 
piece so it's gonna have scarring okay
so<00:03:17.190> that's<00:03:17.790> one<00:03:17.910> piece<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.359> other<00:03:18.540> part<00:03:18.720> I

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
so that's one piece the other part I

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.140 
so that's one piece the other part I
want<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.930> talk<00:03:19.109> about<00:03:19.230> really<00:03:19.530> quick<00:03:19.859> was<00:03:20.150> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
want to talk about really quick was the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.910 
want to talk about really quick was the
case<00:03:21.420> design<00:03:21.840> we're<00:03:22.470> gonna<00:03:22.560> find<00:03:22.859> that

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
case design we're gonna find that

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.729 
case design we're gonna find that
template<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.790> made<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> template<00:03:25.139> of<00:03:25.290> cardboard

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
template I made a template of cardboard

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.379 
template I made a template of cardboard
really<00:03:25.920> quick<00:03:27.319> so<00:03:28.319> my<00:03:28.819> understanding<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
really quick so my understanding of the

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.660 
really quick so my understanding of the
case<00:03:30.540> I'm<00:03:31.139> using<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:32.220> calendar<00:03:32.549> or<00:03:32.579> something

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
case I'm using the calendar or something

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.770 
case I'm using the calendar or something
is<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.480> case<00:03:33.660> would<00:03:33.989> open<00:03:34.260> up<00:03:34.319> like<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:35.780> yeah

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
is the case would open up like this yeah

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.170 
is the case would open up like this yeah
well<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> guess<00:03:37.859> we're<00:03:38.430> gonna<00:03:38.549> pretend<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
well I guess we're gonna pretend this is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.479 
well I guess we're gonna pretend this is
the<00:03:39.470> actually<00:03:40.470> this<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.739> back<00:03:40.980> piece<00:03:41.220> that's

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the actually this is a back piece that's

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.640 
the actually this is a back piece that's
attached<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.900> template<00:03:43.349> will<00:03:43.500> be

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
attached to the template will be

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.280 
attached to the template will be
attached<00:03:44.040> here<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.880> plastic<00:03:45.269> holder<00:03:45.419> will<00:03:46.200> be

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
attached here the plastic holder will be

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.059 
attached here the plastic holder will be
attached<00:03:46.590> here<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.940> when<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.389> open<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.690> up

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
attached here so when you open it up

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.949 
attached here so when you open it up
there's<00:03:50.069> gonna<00:03:50.130> be<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> band<00:03:50.609> in<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.690> case

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
there's gonna be a band in the case

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.720 
there's gonna be a band in the case
itself<00:03:53.239> and<00:03:54.239> we<00:03:54.540> could<00:03:55.040> stitch<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.280> bend<00:03:56.579> in

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
itself and we could stitch that bend in

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.030 
itself and we could stitch that bend in
and<00:03:56.910> basically<00:03:57.480> my<00:03:58.200> understanding<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.950> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
and basically my understanding of the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.099 
and basically my understanding of the
first<00:03:59.250> design<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.849> it<00:04:00.419> was<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.780> various

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
first design is it was to the various

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.940 
first design is it was to the various
angles<00:04:02.120> yeah<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:04.680> how<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:04.829> was

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
angles yeah that that's how I was

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.440 
angles yeah that that's how I was
understanding<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:05.910> then<00:04:06.180> would<00:04:06.329> have

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
understanding it and then would have
