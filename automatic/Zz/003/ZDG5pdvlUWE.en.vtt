00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
all right I'm gonna do a quick little

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.950 
all right I'm gonna do a quick little
demo<00:00:04.700> see<00:00:05.700> if<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:05.940> works

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.549 

all<00:00:09.960> right<00:00:10.080> so<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.980> new<00:00:11.790> 3d<00:00:12.210> mouse

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
all right so this is the new 3d mouse

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.250 
all right so this is the new 3d mouse
got<00:00:13.559> radar<00:00:13.799> box<00:00:14.130> open<00:00:14.519> here<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.809> Google

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
got radar box open here this is Google

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.179 
got radar box open here this is Google
Earth<00:00:17.029> there's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> secret<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.960> getting<00:00:19.529> Google

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
Earth there's a secret to getting Google

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.099 
Earth there's a secret to getting Google
Earth<00:00:21.710> to<00:00:22.710> show<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> plug-in<00:00:24.480> normally

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
Earth to show what the plug-in normally

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.109 
Earth to show what the plug-in normally
shows<00:00:26.090> what<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:28.789> this<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> an

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
shows what you do this is an

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.110 
shows what you do this is an
undocumented<00:00:31.279> secret<00:00:32.279> video<00:00:34.340> ad

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.950 

network<00:00:38.960> leak<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:40.060> then<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.330> network<00:00:41.540> link

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
network leak and then the network link

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.590 
network leak and then the network link
you<00:00:42.290> do<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:43.600> localhost<00:00:44.710> port<00:00:46.300> seven<00:00:47.300> eight

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
you do the localhost port seven eight

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:56.260 
you do the localhost port seven eight
nine<00:00:48.590> five<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:50.690> aircraft<00:00:53.440> dot<00:00:54.760> KMZ<00:00:55.760> and

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
nine five and then aircraft dot KMZ and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.630 
nine five and then aircraft dot KMZ and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
aircraft HW dot k MZ that will open up

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.620 
aircraft HW dot k MZ that will open up
what<00:01:02.630> normally<00:01:03.200> as<00:01:03.350> shown<00:01:03.590> in<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.920> 3d<00:01:04.370> view

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
what normally as shown in the 3d view

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.940 
what normally as shown in the 3d view
here<00:01:05.630> but<00:01:05.660> it<00:01:05.960> will<00:01:06.020> show<00:01:06.230> it<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.470> Google<00:01:06.800> Earth

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
here but it will show it in Google Earth

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.190 
here but it will show it in Google Earth
so<00:01:07.220> right<00:01:07.640> now<00:01:07.790> I<00:01:07.820> have<00:01:07.970> two<00:01:08.330> network<00:01:08.750> links

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
so right now I have two network links

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.719 
so right now I have two network links
already<00:01:10.540> created<00:01:11.540> here<00:01:11.810> that<00:01:11.990> are<00:01:12.080> showing

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
already created here that are showing

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.060 
already created here that are showing
the<00:01:13.729> hardware<00:01:14.180> in<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.479> network<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.830> that's

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
the hardware in the network so that's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.100 
the hardware in the network so that's
why<00:01:16.280> thank<00:01:16.729> you<00:01:16.790> for<00:01:16.940> showing<00:01:17.090> up<00:01:17.360> here<00:01:19.000> so

why thank you for showing up here so
here<00:01:21.110> is<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.590> 2d<00:01:21.920> let's<00:01:22.369> go<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.750> LA<00:01:24.430> since

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
here is the 2d let's go to LA since

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.620 
here is the 2d let's go to LA since
that's<00:01:25.670> pretty<00:01:26.000> close<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:28.520> here's<00:01:28.850> LA<00:01:29.240> and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
that's pretty close so here's LA and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.840 
that's pretty close so here's LA and
this<00:01:29.750> is<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.110> 3d<00:01:30.650> no<00:01:31.190> so<00:01:31.460> I'm<00:01:31.550> going<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.700> use

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
this is the 3d no so I'm going to use

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.690 
this is the 3d no so I'm going to use
this<00:01:32.119> it's<00:01:32.960> only<00:01:33.680> works<00:01:34.009> with<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.369> Google

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
this it's only works with the Google

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.760 
this it's only works with the Google
Earth<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.000> far<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.960> won't<00:01:36.290> work<00:01:36.440> with<00:01:36.680> the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
Earth so far and it won't work with the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.710 
Earth so far and it won't work with the
plug-in<00:01:37.040> yet<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:37.850> will<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:40.210> go<00:01:41.210> over<00:01:41.240> here

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
plug-in yet but it will so go over here

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.889 
plug-in yet but it will so go over here
to<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.140> Google<00:01:42.470> Earth

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.289 

I've<00:01:45.740> got<00:01:45.979> everything<00:01:46.219> set<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.729> maximum

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
I've got everything set to maximum

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.270 
I've got everything set to maximum
settings<00:01:48.200> right<00:01:48.409> now<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:48.829> it<00:01:48.950> will<00:01:49.009> be<00:01:49.250> a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
settings right now so it will be a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.190 
settings right now so it will be a
little<00:01:49.549> bit<00:01:49.729> slow<00:01:51.969> zoom<00:01:52.969> in<00:01:53.240> right<00:01:53.539> now<00:01:53.719> it's<00:01:54.020> a

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
little bit slow zoom in right now it's a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.620 
little bit slow zoom in right now it's a
busy<00:01:54.979> time<00:01:55.189> for<00:01:55.250> FedEx<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.060> UPS<00:01:56.270> in<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.960> US

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
busy time for FedEx and UPS in the US

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:18.490 
busy time for FedEx and UPS in the US
this<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.689> a<00:01:59.869> living

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.170 

takes<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.100> little<00:02:19.250> bit<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.550> getting<00:02:19.760> used<00:02:19.880> to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
takes a little bit of getting used to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.850 
takes a little bit of getting used to
but<00:02:22.120> once<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:24.110> get<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.320> hang<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:24.740> you

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
but once you get the hang of it you

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.080 
but once you get the hang of it you
don't<00:02:24.980> even<00:02:25.160> think<00:02:25.400> about<00:02:25.610> what<00:02:25.970> you're<00:02:26.060> doing

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
don't even think about what you're doing

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.380 
don't even think about what you're doing
just<00:02:26.660> sort<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:26.960> look<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.650> think<00:02:28.300> where<00:02:29.300> you

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
just sort of look and think where you

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.180 
just sort of look and think where you
want<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.690> go<00:02:29.870> in<00:02:30.110> your<00:02:30.260> hand<00:02:30.590> just<00:02:30.830> sort<00:02:31.100> of

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
want to go in your hand just sort of

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.430

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
does it so there's my mouse here there

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.800 
does it so there's my mouse here there
were<00:02:36.650> they<00:02:37.640> work<00:02:38.890> completely<00:02:39.890> independently

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
were they work completely independently

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.970 
were they work completely independently
so<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.900> can<00:02:42.110> click<00:02:43.040> on<00:02:43.250> things<00:02:43.490> with<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.030> mouse

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
so I can click on things with the mouse

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.830 
so I can click on things with the mouse
if<00:02:45.980> I<00:02:46.130> want
