00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.750
 we asked ki 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:13.679
 need to hem the bottom of knitwear 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:18.470
 I don't know how to chop up 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.010
 how many 03 and 04 are from the hem 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:26.779
 because the line will go over the face and 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:35.480
 here is an outline to let in the middle of the foot 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:35.480
 we lower we start scribbling 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.820
 let's say the lines need to go out like this 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.969
 zastil passes even if there are small 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
 here are left from the millimetric and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.140
 nothing terrible 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.140
 perfect then of course when 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.760
 zastil overlaps edge but here 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.510
 lines come out when we get to the end 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.490
 it will be easier as if all the same means 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.270
 here you need to remember this first 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.790
 first of all, raise the foot first 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.479
 we raise the foot so the needles should 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.020
 to be in the highest position 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.490
 little thing 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.220
 there is in each set of cars 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.820
 clean and she has a sharp end 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.970
 here so I get under threads and I pull out 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.060
 strings up to your chest tina strings 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.670
 it seems so much but nonetheless 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.580
 you can now easily make a fabric 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.580
 it goes much easier this way 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.330
 so take out the threads 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.410
 I will show you the method described in 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.180
 car instructions 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:06.950
 look now finish these golden 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.940
 lines so ending lines in 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.740
 instructions written 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.750
 raise the presser foot and pull back so she 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.989
 top and pull see how fabric 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.140
 stretches from from very hard stretches fabric 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.820
 these 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.190
 the delay went here such a delay went and 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:32.330
 that's when I went out all very clean yet 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.780
 again, let me show you 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.780
 I want to 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.530
 raise the needle the highest position not 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.900
 it's important I have one needle tucked in two 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.540
 needles or three needles it doesn't matter in the very 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.480
 top position means the very first 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:55.520
 I raise my foot a second run up to 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.959
 Raise rather take the strings and 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.910
 I drag them away but only then 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.910
 clean the commission like this
