the review of the Sony kit lens that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.880 
the review of the Sony kit lens that
comes<00:00:29.149> with<00:00:29.599> the<00:00:29.779> camera<00:00:30.140> that<00:00:30.169> I<00:00:30.349> reviewed

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
comes with the camera that I reviewed

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.490 
comes with the camera that I reviewed
last<00:00:31.759> week<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:32.449> link<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.199> that<00:00:33.320> in<00:00:33.470> the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
last week so link to that in the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.930 
last week so link to that in the
description<00:00:33.920> if<00:00:34.220> you<00:00:34.309> haven't<00:00:34.550> seen<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.820> yet

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
description if you haven't seen it yet

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.610 
description if you haven't seen it yet
but<00:00:35.379> without<00:00:36.379> further<00:00:36.739> ado<00:00:37.659> here<00:00:38.659> it<00:00:38.750> is<00:00:38.900> so

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
but without further ado here it is so

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.149 
but without further ado here it is so
the<00:00:39.949> lens<00:00:40.129> is<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.760> 18<00:00:41.360> to<00:00:41.570> 55<00:00:42.110> millimeter<00:00:42.890> lens

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
the lens is the 18 to 55 millimeter lens

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.100 
the lens is the 18 to 55 millimeter lens
and<00:00:43.989> it<00:00:44.989> has<00:00:45.140> an<00:00:45.260> aperture<00:00:45.589> that<00:00:46.010> ranges<00:00:46.460> from

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
and it has an aperture that ranges from

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.299 
and it has an aperture that ranges from
3.5<00:00:48.110> at<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:49.489> furthest<00:00:50.180> out<00:00:50.299> zoom<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.960> 5.6<00:00:51.920> and

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
3.5 at the furthest out zoom to 5.6 and

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.200 
3.5 at the furthest out zoom to 5.6 and
the<00:00:52.970> furthest<00:00:53.449> in<00:00:54.010> zoom<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:55.909> it<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:56.930> an<00:00:57.229> SI<00:00:57.739> M

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
the furthest in zoom so it is an SI M

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.999 
the furthest in zoom so it is an SI M
lens<00:00:59.210> so<00:00:59.869> that<00:00:59.900> means<00:01:00.229> that<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.470> focus<00:01:00.650> is

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:01.009 
lens so that means that the focus is

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.549 
lens so that means that the focus is
going<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:01.400> be<00:01:01.489> coming<00:01:02.119> from<00:01:02.150> the<00:01:03.049> camera<00:01:03.409> body

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
going to be coming from the camera body

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.380 
going to be coming from the camera body
itself<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.400> there's<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.790> little<00:01:04.939> screw<00:01:05.269> in

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
itself and there's a little screw in

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.920 
itself and there's a little screw in
there<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:06.229> drives<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.799> focus<00:01:07.390> gears<00:01:08.390> inside

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
there that drives the focus gears inside

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.520 
there that drives the focus gears inside
the<00:01:09.170> lens<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:09.970> because<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.659> focus<00:01:12.259> is

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
the lens so because of that the focus is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.609 
the lens so because of that the focus is
going<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.770> be<00:01:13.240> louder<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.630> it's<00:01:15.079> going<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.470> be

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
going to be louder and it's going to be

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.800 
going to be louder and it's going to be
maybe<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.549> little<00:01:16.610> bit<00:01:17.119> slower<00:01:17.479> than<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.560> SSM

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
maybe a little bit slower than the SSM

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.780 
maybe a little bit slower than the SSM
are<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.260> motors<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:21.590> are<00:01:21.830> actually<00:01:22.250> inside

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
are the motors that are actually inside

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.090 
are the motors that are actually inside
the<00:01:23.000> lens<00:01:23.380> themselves<00:01:24.380> on<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.740> more

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
the lens themselves on the more

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.720 
the lens themselves on the more
expensive<00:01:25.190> lenses<00:01:26.680> but<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.890> my<00:01:28.010> use<00:01:28.220> I'd<00:01:28.460> say

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
expensive lenses but in my use I'd say

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.690 
expensive lenses but in my use I'd say
that<00:01:29.000> it's<00:01:29.810> pretty<00:01:30.020> fast<00:01:30.230> from<00:01:31.159> what<00:01:31.550> I've

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
that it's pretty fast from what I've

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.680 
that it's pretty fast from what I've
done<00:01:31.909> already<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:33.670> when<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.760> buy<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.000> lens

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
done already and when you buy the lens

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.140 
done already and when you buy the lens
in<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.200> kit<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.890> doesn't<00:01:37.310> come<00:01:37.550> with<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> rear

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
in the kit it doesn't come with a rear

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.830 
in the kit it doesn't come with a rear
lens<00:01:38.479> cap<00:01:38.650> so<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.880> has<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> little<00:01:41.570> plastic

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
lens cap so it has a little plastic

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.090 
lens cap so it has a little plastic
thing<00:01:42.350> or<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.520> packaging<00:01:44.590> plastic<00:01:45.590> not

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
the camera all the time then you don't

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.300 
the camera all the time then you don't
need<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.750> lens<00:01:59.990> cap<00:02:00.229> for<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.860> back

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
doesn't come with a lens hood so you're

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.449 
doesn't come with a lens hood so you're
gonna<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:09.049> getting<00:02:09.289> more<00:02:09.530> flares<00:02:09.950> from<00:02:10.280> this

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
gonna be getting more flares from this

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.520 
gonna be getting more flares from this
if<00:02:10.879> then<00:02:11.659> if<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.900> would<00:02:12.080> have<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.200> lens<00:02:12.409> hood

if then if you would have a lens hood
but<00:02:12.890> from<00:02:13.280> reviews<00:02:14.060> I've<00:02:14.239> seen<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:15.530> lens<00:02:15.769> hood

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
but from reviews I've seen the lens hood

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.729 
but from reviews I've seen the lens hood
that<00:02:16.159> you<00:02:16.220> can<00:02:16.580> buy<00:02:16.790> from<00:02:17.000> Sony<00:02:17.299> for<00:02:17.659> this<00:02:17.810> lens

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
that you can buy from Sony for this lens

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.119 
that you can buy from Sony for this lens
is<00:02:19.099> not<00:02:19.549> that<00:02:20.540> great<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.080> I'm<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.739> gonna<00:02:21.830> say

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
is not that great so I'm just gonna say

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.740 
is not that great so I'm just gonna say
might<00:02:22.459> as<00:02:22.549> well<00:02:22.670> not<00:02:22.849> waste<00:02:22.879> your<00:02:23.299> money<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.599> it

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
might as well not waste your money on it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.080 
might as well not waste your money on it
the<00:02:24.230> flare<00:02:24.500> actually<00:02:24.980> isn't<00:02:25.280> too<00:02:25.459> bad<00:02:25.670> from

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
the flare actually isn't too bad from

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.920 
the flare actually isn't too bad from
the<00:02:26.180> lens<00:02:26.390> itself

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the lens itself

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.020 
the lens itself
now<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.799> picture<00:02:29.340> quality<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.819> actually

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
now the picture quality is actually

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030 
now the picture quality is actually
pretty<00:02:30.480> good<00:02:30.720> considering<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
pretty good considering it's the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.410 
pretty good considering it's the
cheapest<00:02:32.430> lens<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.849> you're<00:02:33.000> probably<00:02:33.180> ever

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
cheapest lens that you're probably ever

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.470 
cheapest lens that you're probably ever
gonna<00:02:33.629> buy<00:02:34.220> for<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.489> extra<00:02:35.970> hundred<00:02:36.209> dollars

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
gonna buy for that extra hundred dollars

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.929 
gonna buy for that extra hundred dollars
and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.140> kit<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.579> camera

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
and the kit you get that with the camera

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.319 
and the kit you get that with the camera
pretty<00:02:39.750> simple<00:02:40.549> it's<00:02:41.549> pretty<00:02:42.000> good<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
pretty simple it's pretty good the

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.020 
pretty simple it's pretty good the
images<00:02:42.659> are<00:02:42.810> sharp<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.470> there's<00:02:44.370> little<00:02:44.849> to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
images are sharp and there's little to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.229 
images are sharp and there's little to
no<00:02:45.060> color<00:02:45.689> fringing<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.879> can<00:02:47.879> see<00:02:48.060> that's

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
no color fringing I can see that's

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.140 
no color fringing I can see that's
noticeable<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.109> at<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.189> wide<00:02:50.549> end<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:51.030> that

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
noticeable and at the wide end of that

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.809 
noticeable and at the wide end of that
18<00:02:51.540> millimeter<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.859> there's<00:02:53.430> some<00:02:53.670> pretty

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
18 millimeter the there's some pretty

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.949 
18 millimeter the there's some pretty
heavy<00:02:54.090> barrel<00:02:54.510> distortion<00:02:54.799> but<00:02:56.180> that's<00:02:57.180> what

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
heavy barrel distortion but that's what

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.449 
heavy barrel distortion but that's what
you're<00:02:58.109> always<00:02:58.230> gonna<00:02:58.439> get<00:02:58.650> at<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:58.980> wide<00:02:59.189> end

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
you're always gonna get at that wide end

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.500 
you're always gonna get at that wide end
on<00:02:59.909> any<00:03:00.420> lens<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.370> with<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.730> built-in<00:03:02.879> camera

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
on any lens and with the built-in camera

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.740 
on any lens and with the built-in camera
lens<00:03:04.200> Corrections<00:03:04.920> they<00:03:05.879> compensate<00:03:06.720> that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
lens Corrections they compensate that

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.319 
lens Corrections they compensate that
for<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.290> really<00:03:07.620> really<00:03:07.799> nicely<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.849> also

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
for that really really nicely and also

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.349 
for that really really nicely and also
in<00:03:09.599> camera<00:03:10.109> you<00:03:10.739> can<00:03:11.129> compensate<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
in camera you can compensate for the

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.179 
in camera you can compensate for the
chromatic<00:03:12.810> abrasion<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.560> that's<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:13.920> color

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
chromatic abrasion so that's that color

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.660 
chromatic abrasion so that's that color
fringing<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.819> also<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:16.079> vignetting<00:03:16.670> around

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
fringing and also the vignetting around

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.670 
fringing and also the vignetting around
the<00:03:17.790> edges<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.810> edges<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.139> get<00:03:19.319> darker

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the edges so the edges that get darker

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.250 
the edges so the edges that get darker
it'll<00:03:20.040> brighten<00:03:20.400> them<00:03:20.579> up<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.510> it's<00:03:21.720> really

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
it'll brighten them up so it's really

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.119 
it'll brighten them up so it's really
nice<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.090> think<00:03:24.359> those<00:03:24.950> Corrections<00:03:25.950> do<00:03:26.099> a

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
nice and I think those Corrections do a

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.149 
nice and I think those Corrections do a
really<00:03:26.370> nice<00:03:26.489> job<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:27.120> make<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.480> image<00:03:27.720> more

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
really nice job to make the image more

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.520 
really nice job to make the image more
even<00:03:29.159> and<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:30.329> think<00:03:30.359> this<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.840> great<00:03:31.079> lens<00:03:31.290> for

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
even and I think this is great lens for

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.409 
even and I think this is great lens for
the<00:03:31.590> price<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.160> if<00:03:32.549> you're<00:03:32.699> just<00:03:32.730> buying<00:03:33.150> like

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
the price and if you're just buying like

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.490 
the price and if you're just buying like
