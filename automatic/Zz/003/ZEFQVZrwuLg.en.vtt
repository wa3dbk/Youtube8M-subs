to the oil cooler before I put the front

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.499 
to the oil cooler before I put the front
wheel<00:00:24.189> on<00:00:24.430> while<00:00:24.640> I've<00:00:24.759> got<00:00:24.789> the<00:00:24.939> room<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.240> do

it what I've run into is one little snag

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.479 
it what I've run into is one little snag
in<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.300> fittings<00:00:29.079> that<00:00:29.169> they<00:00:29.410> sent<00:00:29.680> us<00:00:29.800> it's

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
in the fittings that they sent us it's

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.979 
in the fittings that they sent us it's
something<00:00:30.699> that<00:00:30.910> I<00:00:30.939> can<00:00:31.150> work<00:00:31.300> around<00:00:31.480> but<00:00:31.960> I

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
something that I can work around but I

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:33.390 
something that I can work around but I
wanted<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.290> show<00:00:32.379> you<00:00:32.529> exactly<00:00:32.710> what's<00:00:33.190> going

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
on so you'll have some understanding of

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.720 
on so you'll have some understanding of
what<00:00:35.650> it's<00:00:35.769> going<00:00:35.830> to<00:00:35.980> take<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.430> how<00:00:36.580> long

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
what it's going to take and how long

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.119 
what it's going to take and how long
it's<00:00:36.970> going<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.239> take<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:38.410> we've<00:00:38.559> got<00:00:38.769> we've

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
it's going to take what we've got we've

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.560 
it's going to take what we've got we've
installed<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.640> oil<00:00:39.790> cooler<00:00:40.059> mounted<00:00:40.449> it<00:00:40.540> to

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
installed the oil cooler mounted it to

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.540 
installed the oil cooler mounted it to
the<00:00:40.750> frame<00:00:41.050> we've<00:00:41.739> hooked<00:00:41.920> up<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.220> return

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
the frame we've hooked up the return

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.220 
the frame we've hooked up the return
line<00:00:42.820> which<00:00:43.059> goes<00:00:43.089> around<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:43.750> connects<00:00:44.110> to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
line which goes around and connects to

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.319 
line which goes around and connects to
the<00:00:44.320> side<00:00:44.530> of<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.739> engine<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.190> that's<00:00:46.059> fine

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
the side of the engine and that's fine

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.090 
the side of the engine and that's fine
when<00:00:46.960> we<00:00:47.019> want<00:00:47.199> to<00:00:47.290> install<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.800> pressure

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
when we want to install the pressure

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.790 
when we want to install the pressure
feed<00:00:48.430> line<00:00:48.699> to<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.120> oil<00:00:49.270> cooler<00:00:49.780> what<00:00:50.620> they

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
feed line to the oil cooler what they

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.610 
feed line to the oil cooler what they
use<00:00:51.579> is<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:51.969> port<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.449> same<00:00:52.660> port<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.350> your

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
use is the port the same port that your

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.799 
use is the port the same port that your
rocker<00:00:53.829> feed<00:00:54.219> now<00:00:54.520> attaches<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.149> and<00:00:55.629> that's

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
rocker feed now attaches to and that's

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.180 
rocker feed now attaches to and that's
the<00:00:55.989> modification<00:00:56.649> that<00:00:56.739> feeds<00:00:56.980> to<00:00:57.160> the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
the modification that feeds to the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.189 
the modification that feeds to the
rockers<00:00:57.640> from<00:00:57.789> the<00:00:58.000> engine<00:00:58.239> case<00:00:58.480> down<00:00:58.750> here

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
rockers from the engine case down here

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.529 
rockers from the engine case down here
now<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.399> fitting<00:01:00.730> that<00:01:00.820> they<00:01:00.969> gave<00:01:01.210> me<00:01:01.390> is<00:01:01.510> a

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
now the fitting that they gave me is a

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.840 
now the fitting that they gave me is a
banjo<00:01:02.019> type<00:01:02.260> fitting<00:01:02.710> with<00:01:03.100> a<00:01:03.129> banjo<00:01:03.430> bolt

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
banjo type fitting with a banjo bolt

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.139 
banjo type fitting with a banjo bolt
that<00:01:04.539> is<00:01:04.960> supposed<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.470> hook<00:01:05.590> in<00:01:05.800> there

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
that is supposed to hook in there

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.910 
that is supposed to hook in there
probably<00:01:07.149> under<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.420> assumption<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.050> this

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
probably under the assumption that this

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.919 
probably under the assumption that this
does<00:01:09.190> not<00:01:09.310> have<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.880> rocker<00:01:10.090> feed<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.630> stock

00:01:10.919 --> 00:01:10.929 
does not have the rocker feed on a stock

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:13.529 
does not have the rocker feed on a stock
unmodified<00:01:11.470> bike<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.789> what<00:01:13.179> we're<00:01:13.330> going<00:01:13.450> to

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
unmodified bike so what we're going to

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.710 
unmodified bike so what we're going to
end<00:01:13.690> up<00:01:13.780> having<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.289> do<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.860> somehow<00:01:15.539> pair<00:01:16.539> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
end up having to do is somehow pair the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.600 
end up having to do is somehow pair the
two<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:17.050> these<00:01:17.200> together<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:18.039> order<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.429> feed

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
two of these together in order to feed

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.850 
two of these together in order to feed
the<00:01:18.729> rockers<00:01:19.149> and<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.630> oil<00:01:20.229> cooler<00:01:20.530> at<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
the rockers and the oil cooler at the

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.699 
the rockers and the oil cooler at the
same<00:01:21.100> time<00:01:21.399> now<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.899> fitting<00:01:23.229> that<00:01:23.259> we<00:01:23.410> have

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
same time now the fitting that we have

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.460 
same time now the fitting that we have
originally<00:01:24.429> which<00:01:25.240> is<00:01:25.420> was<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.110> modification

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
originally which is was a modification

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.550 
originally which is was a modification
obviously<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.849> too<00:01:28.149> short<00:01:28.420> if<00:01:28.810> we<00:01:29.020> try<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.289> use

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
obviously is too short if we try to use

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.410 
obviously is too short if we try to use
that<00:01:29.770> by<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.099> time<00:01:30.280> I<00:01:30.340> put<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.729> seal<00:01:30.970> washers

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
that by the time I put to seal washers

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.059 
that by the time I put to seal washers
on<00:01:31.599> you<00:01:31.780> can<00:01:31.929> see<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.289> there's<00:01:32.440> almost<00:01:32.619> not

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
on you can see that there's almost not

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.160 
on you can see that there's almost not
any<00:01:33.610> thread<00:01:34.060> sticking<00:01:34.300> out<00:01:34.569> as<00:01:34.720> it<00:01:34.810> is<00:01:34.959> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
any thread sticking out as it is the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.540 
any thread sticking out as it is the
time<00:01:35.380> those<00:01:35.560> steel<00:01:35.739> washers<00:01:36.130> go<00:01:36.250> on<00:01:36.369> there

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
time those steel washers go on there

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.089 
time those steel washers go on there
won't<00:01:36.700> be<00:01:36.789> enough<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.149> do<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.420> job<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.770> banjo

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
won't be enough to do the job this banjo

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.919 
won't be enough to do the job this banjo
bolt<00:01:39.459> that<00:01:39.610> they<00:01:39.729> sent<00:01:39.940> with<00:01:40.119> this<00:01:40.360> obviously

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
bolt that they sent with this obviously

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.749 
bolt that they sent with this obviously
is<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.259> correct<00:01:41.530> length<00:01:41.800> with<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.580> seal

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
is the correct length with the seal

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.940 
is the correct length with the seal
washers<00:01:43.239> on<00:01:43.420> installed<00:01:43.929> it'll<00:01:44.200> work<00:01:44.380> fine<00:01:44.649> but

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
washers on installed it'll work fine but

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.029 
washers on installed it'll work fine but
again<00:01:45.459> no<00:01:45.670> provision<00:01:46.179> for<00:01:46.209> an<00:01:46.690> oil<00:01:46.840> fitting<00:01:47.319> so

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
again no provision for an oil fitting so

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.910 
again no provision for an oil fitting so
what<00:01:48.550> my<00:01:48.729> plan<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.929> take<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.289> half<00:01:50.619> inch

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
what my plan is is to take a half inch

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.510 
what my plan is is to take a half inch
by<00:01:51.670> 20<00:01:51.940> thread<00:01:52.349> bolt<00:01:53.349> that's<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.130> little<00:01:54.340> longer

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
by 20 thread bolt that's a little longer

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.760 
by 20 thread bolt that's a little longer
than<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:54.940> one<00:01:55.209> set<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.170> up<00:01:56.289> in<00:01:56.380> my<00:01:56.530> lathe

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
than this one set it up in my lathe

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.880 
than this one set it up in my lathe
actually<00:01:57.700> bore<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.270> tap<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.989> end<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.289> this<00:01:59.470> to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
actually bore and tap the end of this to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.749 
actually bore and tap the end of this to
accept<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.310> fitting<00:02:00.610> like<00:02:00.789> this<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:02.229> actually

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
accept a fitting like this then actually

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.999 
accept a fitting like this then actually
counterbore<00:02:03.759> this<00:02:04.060> come<00:02:04.810> back<00:02:05.020> cut<00:02:05.379> this<00:02:05.560> here

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
counterbore this come back cut this here

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.190 
counterbore this come back cut this here
so<00:02:06.489> that<00:02:06.670> we<00:02:06.700> have<00:02:06.789> oil<00:02:07.149> flow<00:02:07.420> coming<00:02:07.899> through

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
so that we have oil flow coming through

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.779 
so that we have oil flow coming through
to<00:02:08.349> feed<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.709> inside<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.220> fitting<00:02:09.610> and

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
to feed the inside of this fitting and

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.940 
to feed the inside of this fitting and
then<00:02:10.479> we'll<00:02:10.629> be<00:02:10.750> able<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.020> actually<00:02:11.290> feed<00:02:11.709> both

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
then we'll be able to actually feed both

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.130 
then we'll be able to actually feed both
items<00:02:12.250> off<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.760> same<00:02:12.970> port<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.660> that's<00:02:13.870> what's

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
items off the same port so that's what's

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.750 
items off the same port so that's what's
necessary<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.770> be<00:02:14.950> done<00:02:15.190> which<00:02:15.430> will<00:02:15.610> require

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
necessary to be done which will require

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.880 
necessary to be done which will require
some<00:02:16.180> machining<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.620> will<00:02:17.739> be

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
some machining but then it will be

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.130 
some machining but then it will be
correct<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.400> will<00:02:18.520> be<00:02:18.640> right<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.450> will<00:02:19.629> not

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
correct it will be right and it will not

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.680 
correct it will be right and it will not
be<00:02:20.319> an<00:02:20.470> option<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:21.520> have<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.849> failure<00:02:22.270> there<00:02:22.510> and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
be an option to have a failure there and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.510 
be an option to have a failure there and
that's<00:02:22.840> something<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.860> would<00:02:24.129> be<00:02:24.250> worried

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
that's something that I would be worried

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.520 
that's something that I would be worried
about<00:02:24.580> with<00:02:24.879> a<00:02:24.910> short<00:02:25.180> fitting<00:02:25.510> like<00:02:25.659> this<00:02:25.900> so

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
about with a short fitting like this so

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.300 
about with a short fitting like this so
that's<00:02:26.680> what's<00:02:26.859> going<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.040> take<00:02:27.159> to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
that's what's going to take to

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.740 
that's what's going to take to
straighten<00:02:27.579> out<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.849> oil<00:02:27.879> cooler<00:02:28.239> or<00:02:28.450> set<00:02:28.629> up

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
straighten out the oil cooler or set up

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:38.790 
straighten out the oil cooler or set up
and<00:02:28.989> that'll<00:02:29.290> get<00:02:29.439> you<00:02:29.560> all<00:02:29.650> fixed<00:02:29.890> up

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.860
