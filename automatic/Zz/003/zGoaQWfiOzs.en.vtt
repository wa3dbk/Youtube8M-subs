00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 gym animals then I have a doubt 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.910
 and I need your help, feel here 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.620
 it's been five months since they stopped 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.200
 due every fortune on arm one 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.529
 tendonitis and my muscles since then 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.570
 then they practically melted 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.000
 currently I am at 70 percent from 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.990
 complete recovery from this injury e 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 I was thinking 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.699
 not from next week 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.279
 this is the next anchor of 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 get back to the gym start working 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.360
 also the upper part of the body for which 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.440
 I'm thinking of making a video logo one 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 mass live transformation where you are 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.230
 I show practically what I eat that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.660
 what I do as I train and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 all these things to start that see 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.280
 how my body turns from 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.949
 weeks week month after month and the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.809
 problem here is that finding myself at 70 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.750
 percent of my possibilities 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.600
 obviously I can't push more than 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.449
 so I will take it slowly and then i 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 results that will result 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.420
 so the final result will be 70 per 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.670
 one hundred of my potential 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.799
 just so I don't know if it's worth it 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.560
 make this transformation in this 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.580
 moment I don't know if I have to do it now 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.810
 or wait when recovered 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.130
 completely and I am one hundred for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.509
 one hundred of my possibilities 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.790
 before making this video log and then 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.500
 at this point I ask you let me know 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.909
 if you prefer that the face is so much now 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.619
 I have to do it anyway it's not a 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.470
 problem because I have to pick it up again 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.119
 mobility will resume at the high end of the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 body must start a little to push 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.030
 even if light, however, I have to do it 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 right I have to go back to the gym or 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.659
 we are and do it when I am 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.880
 completely one hundred percent of the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.869
 possibility where you can actually 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.570
 see what my efforts can 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.509
 therefore produce at maximum my own 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.900
 ability what my body like 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.210
 definitely responds to my diet 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.979
 the increase in supplements that I take the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.800
 results that I finally get 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.410
 so just let me know 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.650
 clicking I like it below if you want 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.700
 that makes this transformation 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.410
 next week so no 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.800
 next week after the other 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.590
 again or do nothing if you want that 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.590
 don't do this transformation 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.260
 now then click like if you want that 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.240
 face now or leave it alone 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.570
 do nothing thank you for your help 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.420
 this is my only doubt to know if 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.270
 I have to do it hours and ultimately if that 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.660
 video reaches at least two hundred 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.730
 onlive then i will make this video 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.270
 transform this video log where you 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.310
 I show what I eat the training I do 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.560
 I make integrators measurements 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.350
 of my body changing week 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.060
 in short, in the week it will be an irr 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.050
 a quite interesting initiative e 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.790
 funny 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.920
 I have to do it anyway I have to 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.840
 make mass so let me know e 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.310
 waiting for your feedback we feel 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.170
