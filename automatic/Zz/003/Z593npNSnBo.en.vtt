00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
tie I'm gonna take those and I hope that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.020 
tie I'm gonna take those and I hope that
you'll<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:11.130> bear<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.400> me<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.700> little<00:00:11.880> bit

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
you'll just bear with me a little bit

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.730 
you'll just bear with me a little bit
because<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.780> might<00:00:12.990> get<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.410> little<00:00:13.559> bit

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
because it might get a little bit

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.080 
because it might get a little bit
complicated<00:00:14.580> or<00:00:15.030> confusing<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.690> hope<00:00:15.990> it's<00:00:16.170> not

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
complicated or confusing I hope it's not

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.240 
complicated or confusing I hope it's not
so<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> start<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.539> strap<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.560> between<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
so you start with a strap in between the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.970 
so you start with a strap in between the
top<00:00:20.760> loop<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
top loop and I have it so that the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.420 
top loop and I have it so that the
inside<00:00:23.430> strap<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.859> just<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> little<00:00:26.160> bit<00:00:26.250> more

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
inside strap is just a little bit more

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.500 
inside strap is just a little bit more
than<00:00:26.640> half<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.449> long<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.210> outside<00:00:30.210> strap

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
than half as long as the outside strap

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.830 
than half as long as the outside strap
so<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> outside<00:00:31.050> strap<00:00:31.320> should<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.650> longer

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
so the outside strap should be longer

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.190 
so the outside strap should be longer
and<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:36.030> put<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> inside<00:00:36.780> loop

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and then you put the inside loop

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.740 
and then you put the inside loop
underneath<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.250> big<00:00:38.370> toe<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.120> then<00:00:39.629> you

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
underneath your big toe and then you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.389 
underneath your big toe and then you
cross<00:00:40.050> them<00:00:40.290> over<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.649> front<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.070> toe<00:00:41.190> so

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
cross them over in front of your toe so

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.549 
cross them over in front of your toe so
that<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.090> X<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:43.350> from<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> toe<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
that you have the X in from the toe and

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.709 
that you have the X in from the toe and
the<00:00:46.559> inside<00:00:46.920> strap<00:00:47.370> will<00:00:47.640> go<00:00:47.820> into<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> top

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the inside strap will go into the top

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.069 
the inside strap will go into the top
inside<00:00:49.260> loop

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.729 

and<00:00:56.620> then<00:00:56.800> this<00:00:56.980> one<00:00:57.280> will<00:00:58.210> go<00:00:58.420> into<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.530> back

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
and then this one will go into the back

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.890 
and then this one will go into the back
outside<00:01:00.100> loop<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.520> then<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.360> keep<00:01:04.540> this<00:01:04.690> one

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
outside loop and then to keep this one

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.820 
outside loop and then to keep this one
tight<00:01:05.229> I<00:01:05.440> just<00:01:05.500> put<00:01:05.979> it<00:01:06.100> underneath<00:01:06.610> my<00:01:07.830> shoe

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
tight I just put it underneath my shoe

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.730 
tight I just put it underneath my shoe
to<00:01:09.100> hold<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.430> in<00:01:09.520> place<00:01:09.930> while<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:10.990> work<00:01:11.530> with

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
to hold it in place while I work with

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.780 
to hold it in place while I work with
this<00:01:12.640> strap<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.710> this<00:01:14.920> one<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.369> bring<00:01:15.610> back

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.999 
this strap so this one I bring back
around<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.540> then<00:01:16.720> we<00:01:16.900> do<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.110> little<00:01:17.290> bit<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.650> a

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
around and then we do a little bit of a

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.320 
around and then we do a little bit of a
medallion<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:20.830> up<00:01:20.950> here<00:01:21.190> at<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.310> toe<00:01:21.550> so

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
medallion right up here at the toe so

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.040 
medallion right up here at the toe so
start<00:01:22.630> by<00:01:22.720> going<00:01:22.840> over<00:01:23.440> this<00:01:24.430> strap<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.960> then

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
start by going over this strap and then

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.279 
start by going over this strap and then
under<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:28.630> one<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:30.399> over<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.119> other<00:01:32.020> one

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
under that one and over this other one

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.950 
under that one and over this other one
that's<00:01:32.440> coming<00:01:32.680> in<00:01:32.860> front<00:01:33.039> of<00:01:33.100> your<00:01:33.220> toe<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
that's coming in front of your toe and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.520 
that's coming in front of your toe and
then<00:01:35.880> under<00:01:36.880> this<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.960> you<00:01:38.050> just<00:01:38.080> want<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.410> keep

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
then under this so you just want to keep

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.850 
then under this so you just want to keep
alternating<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:40.360> over<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.080> under<00:01:42.690> these

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
alternating going over and under these

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:59.320 
alternating going over and under these
five<00:01:45.509> different<00:01:48.030> strap

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.650 

and<00:01:59.840> I<00:01:59.900> think<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.200> go<00:02:00.350> around<00:02:00.650> about<00:02:01.540> three<00:02:02.540> or

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
and I think I go around about three or

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.130 
and I think I go around about three or
four<00:02:02.870> times

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.950 

and<00:02:09.619> then<00:02:09.710> when<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:09.860> get<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.130> this<00:02:10.250> point<00:02:10.960> take

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
and then when I get to this point take

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.990 
and then when I get to this point take
this<00:02:12.140> strap<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:13.400> go<00:02:13.850> directly<00:02:14.480> across<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
this strap and go directly across to the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.930 
this strap and go directly across to the
outside<00:02:17.000> upper<00:02:17.480> loop

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.000 

and<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:24.600> bring<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.020> back<00:02:25.260> around<00:02:25.440> here<00:02:25.860> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and then bring it back around here and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.650 
and then bring it back around here and
so<00:02:26.130> here<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:26.490> have<00:02:26.700> another<00:02:27.120> slight

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
so here we have another slight

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.600 
so here we have another slight
cross-section<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.710> that's<00:02:29.280> where<00:02:29.490> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
cross-section and that's where the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.720 
cross-section and that's where the
second<00:02:30.000> flower<00:02:30.270> will<00:02:30.570> be<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.430> come<00:02:32.610> back

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
second flower will be so we come back

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:41.589 
second flower will be so we come back
around<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.420> go<00:02:34.940> under<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.120> over<00:02:36.240> again

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.039 

and<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.260> one's<00:02:42.469> not<00:02:43.329> this<00:02:44.329> flower<00:02:44.599> won't<00:02:44.840> be

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
and this one's not this flower won't be

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.699 
and this one's not this flower won't be
like<00:02:45.290> really<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:46.609> circular<00:02:47.180> because<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
like really to circular because the

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.630 
like really to circular because the
straps<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.430> cross<00:02:49.879> is<00:02:50.090> at<00:02:50.209> an<00:02:50.329> odd<00:02:50.900> angle<00:02:51.640> but

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
straps the cross is at an odd angle but

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.420 
straps the cross is at an odd angle but
it'll<00:02:52.969> still<00:02:53.180> give<00:02:53.359> you<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:54.099> nice<00:02:55.099> little
