00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
like if this was a trick if we weren't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.580 
like if this was a trick if we weren't
meant<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.400> yet<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.630> i<00:01:39.960> went<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
meant to see this yet but then i went to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.469 
meant to see this yet but then i went to
