00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.100
 hi everyone knows mode in crime 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.330
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.590
 brand new glee tour video 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.300
 blackhawks 2 on the map 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.830
 pope of the dead so here are the friends 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.990
 you just have to go to the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.150
 nacelle to position yourself at this 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.680
 place there to blow you up with 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.239
 a grenade and said you will have done 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.470
 explode with a grenade will tell 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.050
 your friend they activate the gondola and 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.730
 Chivu instantly revives you 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.440
 do not respect this delay in fact you 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.920
 will not be able to achieve slips 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.050
 to actually arrive on this report itself 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.460
 his postponement that I am so once that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.260
 you got on this rebound actually 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.210
 it will be necessary to lengthen their edge like me 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.130
 in the video and once you're 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.530
 arrived at that place in fact there 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.510
 will have to make a small jump on a sky 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.340
 barrier once you're on 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.720
 this sky barrier in fact there I have you 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.770
 makes a small quick advance actually 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.119
 because in fact I put a little bit of 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.259
 time and I was afraid of falling so 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.780
 I took no risk 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.670
 so in fact you can go on to 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.860
 in fact yes to the zombies spawn in 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.690
 do you can walk all the way 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.289
 but basically it's not a barrier 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 invincibility 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.940
 it's just for fun and once 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.729
 actually done back you go 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.500
 you stick up to the wall until you 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.909
 end of the wall and once you go 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.310
 to fall in fact you will have to hurry 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.260
 to do a little job like me in the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.119
 video and once you've landed 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.009
 actually at that point actually at 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.500
 mask master level does this 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.850
 will create a barrier of invincibility 1 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.380
 frankly this glitch he's really 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.540
 epic at home strongly advises 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.590
 I advise you especially it is of the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.170
 do two steps away what I did to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.329
 three and it's still them 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.829
 sleeves are quite long 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.000
 so here's anyway I hope friends 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.040
 this video will have made you happy 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.450
 do not hesitate to drop a little like a 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.920
 little comment this is always 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.670
 pleasure and I will leave you on 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.780
 this video end 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.780
