 Scraps there for you and fast me, huh? 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
 first I 'm walking for me to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.670
 share these days because I stayed 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.160
 sick then I could not record myself 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.320
 I even managed to record but I recorded when 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.260
 I heard it was very scrotal manuscript 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.720
 So I decided not to post on youtube, right? 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.580
 the second thing came out star wars on the channel 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 I think a lot of people did not see I do not know if 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.660
 did not see why he did not want or simply 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 google youtube 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.289
 but if you like falling today did not see 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.719

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.920
 then the return of pecs modes 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.920
 so this is it stay there with the hiv 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.860

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.870

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.000
 online channel millions everyone here to 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.380
 You, but the toy moves this pack. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.350
 same person after a long time 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.690
 returning here with 11 pec victim 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.040
 here for you, right? 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.960
 first of all it leaves this range 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.730
 practice in the goal and is 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.460
 releasing this mold bank that is fine is 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.250
 little anyway is a good game like 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.800
 crazy sword or cast of crash 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.950
 that has a safe is a voice the word at last 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.750
 Do you do something cheerful? 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.960
 good here we are in version 1 7 point 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.430
 leaving the cref Mainz's life short 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.810
 an estimate that focused more on the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.720
 im more than industrial and ok 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.530
 then yes I already have a fps 7 of the line already 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.410
 have a map 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 ok if you can show it to you 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.729
 here and here is the fps and here the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.040
 map né 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.080
 what here with us takes an item 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.509
 shows under pan ps here for you 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.470
 see look only a block of grain to see 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.410
 if I can get another foot there, and it shows 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.479
 not only shows that's what I get a 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.020
 armor will also show if not me 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.190
 There is a mistake here, show below. 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.100
 durability of the amateur ok said is more 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.310
 geared more to the industrial area to it 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.010
 there's really enough then koff 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.750
 For the most fashionable day's business , huh? 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.050
 there is a very good hatred that you like 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.459
 this kind of good mode tempts me useful tij 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.220
 I do not know how to say this so 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.890
 never that it is a law that has several 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.950
 block variations right 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.780
 we also have here the fans mold're me 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.670
 Here put a slight little plane 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.950
 only receives 15 light 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.990
 need to have fuel already 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.810
 so I do not know the size of this 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.150
 disgrace my look that divulged but 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.130
 finally there are several other things that 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.709
 here's a crazy grenade 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.930
 to opec other things through the six see 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.520
 Good, I'm never going to get you some things. 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.670
 here this money explodes obviously is just 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.210
 which took seven hours but exploded 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.340
 This one 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.440
 do not just come in and the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.340
 Good my, but there are some tanks too. 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.190
 Look what cars and this gun is. 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.350
 here and several other anti-tank weapons 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.320
 also a mechanism looks only 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.130
 mechanism and the mechanism is here 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.680
 okay 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.200
 I saw the one who had started the series 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.390
 iii you wanted to have all the ways the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.430
 mechanism but had not only had one 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.550
 base then you have all the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.460
 Manners there is only here 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.220
 all that is the mechanism that you 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.750
 saw in that server the revolution of the 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.020
 trf that here is here is just for the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.220
 jetpack that thing also has only 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.920
 here o 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.220
 eita hey loco abreu that gave start 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.620
 here but finally in all other things 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.650
 that left I think the mill here 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.960
 mill here ne 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.120
 You saw it looks just really crazy. 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.160
 so have all these ways are smart 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.030
 besides all the basic modes, do not 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.510
 black pack in the sky craft good performance 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.250
 natives or new furnaces here is also 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.049
 What I would do is installed here is like 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.690
 always really good 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.180
 This show is another goat and one 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.860
 crucial issue of showing how 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.640
 stay there is nothing much 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.920
 not only has that person here biocraft and 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.190
 these things in the library are strong 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.220
 This is also true of baby's craft etc 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.400
 have a computer mode is also the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.680
 banner bell né heber that speaks do not know 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.580
 that should be putting things in it 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.770
 so do not 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.650
 and he packs everything together, you can do it 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.830
 several items is younger said it was 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.390
 a great result for the industry is how 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.940
 I already said it is a bit too a bit 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.250
 lighter than others né mode pecs 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.930
 industrial applications are lighter than 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.130
 adventure because they usually become 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.860
 furniture etc. 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.690
 but anyway if you want new modes of 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.240
 feet here on the brazilian channel for venturi 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:14.140
 a crazy mix new versions of 1,817 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.640
 burned because so I do not know that 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.640
 You want this series to be 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.530
 keep it good beauty, I had to 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.070
 Talk to you, I hope you 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.400
 like 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.890
 Then maybe I 'll stay open, it's going to be 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.660
 lynched by the fly and over there 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.270
 There you only know the second one that goes 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.670
 take you there promised fire or macaé 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.230
 I do not have it but anyway this is it if you 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.610
 liked the one that the favorite but did not 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.360
 inscribed in the channel if you have not 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.220
 registered 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.540
 Thank you to help out here one 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.860
 A big hug and see you next time. 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.860
 said and went
