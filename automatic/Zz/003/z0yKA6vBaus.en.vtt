 Hello my dear, today I'll show you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 the processing of our great walek 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 nelson your glitter uv laquered my 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.259
 model already has a modeled 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.939
 make a go with the npd ice cube pictures 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.939
 and a thin layer of make up goes 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:32.119
 the make-up helps a uniform color 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.119
 result 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:37.230
 I chose pink for the glowing 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.720
 as well as the great yellow decided 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.180
 pink is my skin color and the yellow 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.289
 the color contrast finds more colors 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.510
 let her in the online shop our UV varnishes 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.570
 in 60 seconds in an LED lamp 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.670
 or 120 seconds in a uv lamp 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.379
 herten 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.789
 depending on the desired opacity I wear 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.379
 one or two layers if you the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.210
 colors are even brighter and stronger 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.039
 Volt simply uses a white one 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 Underground instead of make up applies 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.590
 we want a subtle one today 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.590
 lukrieren 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.080
 b 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.280
 with the integrated brush can be 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.600
 The UV varnish just like 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.600
 Apply conventional paint location 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.790
 we work today with the waves as 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.340
 premium uv paints 3 in 1 that means 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.050
 this cure without a protective layer of 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.550
 It is not necessary to seal and you 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.550
 immediately gets a great shine 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.690
 The surface is hardwearing and 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.060
 Scratch insensitive simply great 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.060
 color effects and absolutely suitable for everyday use 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.990
 Here you can already the great 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.990
 see glitter effect 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.840
 Actually we are finished now 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.900
 special I still paint a pattern with 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.280
 our end the one stop colors 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.609
 I have a leo pattern for this 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.329
 I decided to drive her over 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.329
 yellow nails on 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.600
 You know for sure our once inks 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.950
 are water soluble and can be completely 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.380
 easy to process 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.940
 They are perfect for fine patterns or 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.940
 to create filigree decors 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.590
 our current leo pattern is natural 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.720
 quite simply with the help of a thin one 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.550
 Fine brush I narrow the pattern up 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.209
 the desired nails first the 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.209
 black contours 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.629
 we have air in our colors 

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:53.430
 Dry before we start the second phase 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:56.119
 The black contours should begin 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.119
 be dry 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.770
 Now I give a contrast color in 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.740
 the middle of the pattern here I am 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.999
 decided for gold 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.999
 this gives the whole more deep 

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:49.339
 our pattern is dry sealed i 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.339
 good with our job 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.620
 you see the shine is coming back 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.280
 and at the end as always 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.280
