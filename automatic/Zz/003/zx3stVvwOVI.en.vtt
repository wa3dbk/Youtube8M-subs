00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.799
 hello girls today in the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.840
 capsule tips and tricks I decided to 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.160
 to discuss a subject on which my students 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.680
 ask me some questions 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.859
 for a while and I myself 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.300
 was faced with the request of a customer 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.070
 personally I do not really have any 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.810
 nail polish so my truth that is 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.480
 very very very very very very small 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.270
 because it's not the clientele that I 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.570
 I developed my young people shouting you want 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.750
 ask for the look of the dead polish then 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.480
 I found myself in full with the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.640
 client in front of me no polish miss 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.960
 what I do I 'm bombay have to 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.460
 I manage I have no choice I have 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.310
 two menus for marc will talk again 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.110
 find a solution to be able to 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.210
 fill a customer's request and I 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.440
 decided to do my nail polish mans - nice 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.570
 so that's what I do not believe 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.060
 today a way of doing things 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.089
 polish so we always ask ourselves 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.860
 what kind to buy what prat but one 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.509
 can very well cope with this 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.040
 that we have in the vein tech even if it 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.480
 is very very excited to get to me 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.750
 I cheated a little bit August 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.120
 so I prepared two prostheses at the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.490
 sale one on which I attacked 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.350
 varnish simply and I was watching 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.210
 the same text that I had so I 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.490
 discovered two clear varnish 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.710
 so I had enough time against in 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.860
 reality I had a roland effect that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.810
 is with the Caribbean and Cayman people there 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 are simply a top coat all to 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.700
 does ordinary cheap what I'm going 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.650
 take to see my polish but I 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 will show you my secret ingredient 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.590
 who will go with my top cops and yes 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.650
 close enough but it's really 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.110
 corn starch we did not have any 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.430
 really need a lot what we 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.830
 do not really see what I'm doing 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.060
 but it's not very serious 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.369
 at least the excesses 126 I took a 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.799
 small aluminum foil 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.679
 I'm recovering for a little bit of 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.929
 h knowledge 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.269
 that I deposit and on my paper there is 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.480
 not amount to with facts they 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.469
 have exactly to the eye is young and 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.079
 look for my clear varnish 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:25.269
 I have just drop a little fact 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.430
 ops in fact together to make gaffe 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.209
 and here I am going to get my coach 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.109
 and I'm going to come and mix it up 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.639
 inside my transparent varnish 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:39.250
 this attention the facts what I have 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.500
 done here I did a little bit on purpose 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.560
 I took a varnish that is in the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.689
 shades of black so it's a mauve black 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.799
 a little bit and I took a red 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.569
 why do I tell you to pay attention 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.040
 does that when you go to do 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.409
 your mixture of top coat and count 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.819
 if you do troubles at you go 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.169
 see when you 're going to mix the gisti 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.780
 that it does not really do justice 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.799
 messi is getting too much at Easter ben there it's 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.889
 that you are going to change your 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.180
 black color in black gray do not know 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:13.930
 really what we are looking for 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.500
 so we make sure that our mixture is at 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.139
 remake 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.840
 once it's done that I like it 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:24.659
 well mix well merge I put 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:29.019
 simply applied on my nail polish 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:34.260
 my new dead top coat and in his 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.260
 cats you are going to see him change 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.409
 during a little bit i'm going i'm going 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.140
 go fishing a little bit if I'm going to blow 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:46.209
 on it I do not know if we can see it 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.590
 as once the camera is watched 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:54.610
 as one who became my I do it 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.120
 with the other hallway also I 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.120
 searched for my nail polish 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.120
 I apply 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.910
 while it dries come do my 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:19.380
 second layer of top coat on my 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:22.380
 first color of earlier this 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.350
 which is also pleasant with a varnish 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.280
 words like that does with the finding 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.810
 when we want to make this barter 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.710
 did not paint again hangs 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.710
 very well on you're looking for it 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:56.770
 heats up a little bit to speed up and 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.030
 here I take a little less 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.040
 deducing it's either I have 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.040
 directly the light on the varnish 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.520
 I think that with the law by raising a 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:17.600
 little bit better kept one finds 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:20.000
 really here with a varnish my before 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.870
 put your brush back in your 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.420
 very important bottle wipe the one 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.830
 here if you want to keep your top coat 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:33.320
 a tac before putting your brush back 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.170
 in your bottle so the girls 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.430
 now I let you try the 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.690
 little trick this polish words to reason and I 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.200
 wish you a great day 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.200
