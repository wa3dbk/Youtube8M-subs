00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.800
 Good local summoners and summoners watching the game on the internet 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.500
 We will immediately come to a post-match visit to a friendly event in front of our martial arts lord today. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.820
 Of course, our Wulin League will only be produced on April 12th. 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.120
 The martial arts lord of our LMS League of Legends project 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.940
 Today, the two teams are Shaolin’s opposite Wudang. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.100
 That is next to me is Wu Dang’s master Zhou Yuanqiao. 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 Would you like to say hello to everyone? 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.771
 Hello everyone, I am a steak. 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.360
 Ok, you are a steak, ok, I want to ask about the steak here. 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.400
 Although today is a competition for a friendly event 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.760
 But Fang Lin’s abbot’s despicable abbot, he said in the fan group that they are doing their best. 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.460
 Then I am also very curious about your Zhang San burning his side, is the instruction on the ban pick, are you going all out to deal with this game? 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.940
 Of course, I will go all out, because as long as we have a fight, we will try our best to win. 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.734
 Whether it’s an exhibition game or a competition 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.160
 All the games we have Wudang seven, really seven, right, just seven players 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.540
 Wudang Qixia will go all out. I feel that the summoner on the scene is giving us all the enthusiastic applause of Wudang Qixia. 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.020
 They are really very hard today. 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.180
 Ok, let's talk about the content of the game. 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.680
 In fact, a lot of things have happened recently. 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.460
 Then let everyone... fans who support us are very worried 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.220
 In fact, we are very sad. 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.320
 Yes, then there is 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.420
 We are very grateful to Netbank International for its support and help in the past two years. 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.820
 So, even... basically this time we still trust the company’s policy 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.080
 Although... no matter how far we can go, 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.300
 We still trust the company 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.040
 Then... I hope we can still represent the lightning wolf in the coat on April 12th.
