like that and it will ask you if you
want<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> import<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.149> block<00:01:45.540> launcher<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.930> hit

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
want to import to block launcher you hit

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.770 
want to import to block launcher you hit
import<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.590> that's<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.860> skin<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
import and that's your skin now so that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.480 
import and that's your skin now so that
is<00:01:48.990> how<00:01:49.140> skins<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.680> work<00:01:49.890> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> don't<00:01:50.310> have

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
is how skins will work if you don't have

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.870 
is how skins will work if you don't have
block<00:01:50.820> launcher<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.899> um<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:53.040> well<00:01:53.640> right

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
block launcher then um it's well right

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429 
block launcher then um it's well right
now<00:01:53.939> would<00:01:54.210> probably<00:01:54.240> just<00:01:54.630> crash<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.229> will

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
now would probably just crash but I will

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.219 
now would probably just crash but I will
come<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:55.890> when<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.790> doesn't<00:01:56.960> find<00:01:57.960> black

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
come up with when it doesn't find black

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.429 
come up with when it doesn't find black
on<00:01:58.469> sure<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.860> will<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.780> message<00:02:00.780> or<00:02:01.200> whatever

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
on sure it will do a message or whatever

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.289 
on sure it will do a message or whatever
it<00:02:01.500> will<00:02:01.590> pop<00:02:01.740> up<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.100> say<00:02:02.159> block<00:02:02.939> launcher

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
it will pop up and say block launcher

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.209 
it will pop up and say block launcher
isn't<00:02:03.570> installed<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.200> stuff<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.590> i'm

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
hoping to get away from block launch of

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.869 
hoping to get away from block launch of
here<00:02:06.990> pretty<00:02:07.140> soon<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:08.069> sure<00:02:08.280> exactly<00:02:08.729> how

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879

a village with a blacksmith and amazing
I<00:02:31.739> Stowers<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.819> it<00:02:33.090> gives<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.480> seed

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
I Stowers then it gives you the seed

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.400 
I Stowers then it gives you the seed
right<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.050> which<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.260> 106<00:02:35.100> 35<00:02:35.580> 16<00:02:35.910> 859<00:02:36.780> you

give this close out of the dialogue or

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.540 
give this close out of the dialogue or
you<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.360> hit<00:02:39.450> copy<00:02:39.750> seed<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.560> then<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.340> can

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
you can hit copy seed and then you can

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.949 
you can hit copy seed and then you can
go<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.850> paste<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.269> anywhere<00:02:42.690> i'm<00:02:42.840> just

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
go and paste that anywhere i'm just

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.970 
go and paste that anywhere i'm just
going<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.110> use<00:02:43.230> firefox<00:02:43.800> as<00:02:44.010> an<00:02:44.099> example<00:02:45.980> paste

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
going to use firefox as an example paste

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.259 
going to use firefox as an example paste
you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.340> see<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.610> will<00:02:47.819> come<00:02:47.970> up<00:02:48.000> right

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
you can see that will come up right

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.130 
you can see that will come up right
there<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.400> that's<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:51.120> how<00:02:51.269> seeds

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
there so that's that that's how seeds

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.800 
there so that's that that's how seeds
will<00:02:52.350> work<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.709> actually<00:02:52.920> where<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.810> what

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
will work and actually where is it what

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.259 
will work and actually where is it what
there<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.920> some<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.280> them<00:02:56.400> come<00:02:56.610> with<00:02:56.640> pictures

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
there is some of them come with pictures

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.330 
there is some of them come with pictures
like<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.600> they're<00:02:58.440> pretty<00:02:58.680> small<00:02:58.920> pictures

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
like that they're pretty small pictures

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.400 
like that they're pretty small pictures
I<00:02:59.580> can<00:02:59.760> attempt<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.750> make<00:03:00.959> them<00:03:01.170> bigger

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
I can attempt to make them bigger

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.650 
I can attempt to make them bigger
picture<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:01.920> not<00:03:01.950> sure<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.420> works

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
picture is not sure how that works

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.020 
picture is not sure how that works
that's<00:03:03.959> more<00:03:04.519> Google<00:03:05.519> side<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.910> things

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
that's more Google side of things

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.280 
that's more Google side of things
because<00:03:06.330> they<00:03:06.480> do<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.810> whole<00:03:06.959> alert

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
because they do the whole alert

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.280 
because they do the whole alert
dialogues<00:03:07.830> it's<00:03:08.130> part<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.150> what<00:03:09.630> they<00:03:09.870> do<00:03:09.930> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
dialogues it's part of what they do and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.770 
dialogues it's part of what they do and
not<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.620> much<00:03:10.769> what<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.010> do<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.549> can<00:03:12.239> make<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.600> look

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
not so much what I do I can make it look

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.240 
not so much what I do I can make it look
different<00:03:12.930> but<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.319> can't<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.860> know<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.100> way

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
different but I can't you know the way

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.820 
different but I can't you know the way
the<00:03:14.760> white<00:03:14.940> displays<00:03:15.360> stuff<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.870> all<00:03:16.049> Google

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
the white displays stuff is all Google

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.030 
the white displays stuff is all Google
side<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:17.459> pictures<00:03:18.560> might<00:03:19.560> be<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.709> little<00:03:19.859> bit

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
side so pictures might be a little bit

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.650 
side so pictures might be a little bit
bigger<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.640> future<00:03:20.940> not<00:03:21.299> sure<00:03:21.510> on<00:03:21.630> that

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
bigger in the future not sure on that

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.280 
bigger in the future not sure on that
