00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.009 

okay<00:01:00.440> nothing<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.560> happened<00:01:02.570> because<00:01:03.570> now

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
okay nothing what happened because now

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.280 
okay nothing what happened because now
we<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.710> paint<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> weight<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:06.290> by

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
we have to paint the weight because by

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.940 
we have to paint the weight because by
default<00:01:07.729> if<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.880> go<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.260> surfaces<00:01:10.260> body<00:01:10.560> paint

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
default if you go to surfaces body paint

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.120 
default if you go to surfaces body paint
soft<00:01:11.250> body<00:01:11.760> too<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.040> see<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:16.130> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
soft body too now you can see that the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.240 
soft body too now you can see that the
whole<00:01:17.369> plane<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:18.140> white<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.920> influence

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
whole plane is white here the influence

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.070 
whole plane is white here the influence
is<00:01:20.550> white<00:01:20.850> okay<00:01:23.060> this<00:01:24.060> free-falling<00:01:24.630> area<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
is white okay this free-falling area of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.910 
is white okay this free-falling area of
the<00:01:25.259> cloth<00:01:25.560> should<00:01:25.800> be<00:01:26.570> black<00:01:29.600> okay<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> let<00:01:31.890> me

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the cloth should be black okay so let me

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.890 
the cloth should be black okay so let me
turn<00:01:32.190> off<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.550> grid<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.050 

replace<00:01:39.770> values<00:01:40.460> with<00:01:40.730> zero<00:01:43.690> okay<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.950> paint

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
replace values with zero okay and paint

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.170 
replace values with zero okay and paint
black<00:01:47.060> on<00:01:47.420> this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
black on this

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.420 
black on this
now<00:01:49.780> goal<00:01:50.110> weight<00:01:50.410> will<00:01:50.740> have<00:01:50.920> no<00:01:51.250> influence

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
now goal weight will have no influence

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:20.290 
now goal weight will have no influence
and<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:53.170> black<00:01:53.500> area<00:01:55.230> key<00:01:56.230> painting

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.380 

okay<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.220> can<00:02:22.370> smooth<00:02:22.760> out<00:02:23.060> this

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
okay and then you can smooth out this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.980 
okay and then you can smooth out this
transition<00:02:24.790> using<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.970> smooth<00:02:26.330> option

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.850 

transition<00:02:29.990> between<00:02:30.230> black<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.620> white

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
transition between black and white

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.200 
transition between black and white
values

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.010 

ok<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:37.040> if<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.250> play<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.580> simulation<00:02:37.940> now

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.170 

still<00:02:43.860> we<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:45.200> some<00:02:46.200> white<00:02:46.470> values<00:02:46.920> your

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
still we have to some white values your

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.070 
still we have to some white values your
replace<00:02:48.180> with<00:02:48.570> black<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:50.210> shorts<00:02:51.210> perfectly

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
replace with black and shorts perfectly

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.010 
replace with black and shorts perfectly
black<00:02:52.410> there

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
black there

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:12.370 
black there
at<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.770> corners

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.720 

ok

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:28.750 

I'm<00:03:20.510> still<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.110> corner<00:03:21.590> there<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:23.000> corner

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.869 

ok

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.660 

solution

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
solution

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.290 
solution
alright<00:03:35.920> still<00:03:36.920> put<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.160> problem<00:03:37.670> here<00:03:37.880> you<00:03:38.060> can

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
alright still put a problem here you can

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:53.250 
alright still put a problem here you can
see<00:03:38.650> so<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:39.739> have<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:39.950> replace<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.250> with<00:03:40.760> white

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.760 

ok

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
ok

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.110 
ok
sir<00:03:55.580> place<00:03:55.850> this<00:03:56.090> with<00:03:56.390> white<00:03:56.630> and<00:03:57.970> play<00:03:58.970> the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
sir place this with white and play the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:08.100 
sir place this with white and play the
simulation<00:03:59.390> now

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.940 

ok

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.360 

it<00:04:12.190> has<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.760> be<00:04:12.790> black

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.469 

alright<00:04:18.709> now<00:04:19.709> we're<00:04:19.889> going<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.040> add<00:04:20.579> spring<00:04:21.329> to

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
alright now we're going to add spring to

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.060 
alright now we're going to add spring to
the<00:04:21.570> particles<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.229> give<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.560> some<00:04:22.800> realistic

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
the particles to give it some realistic

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.240 

so<00:04:57.670> now<00:04:57.850> I'll<00:04:58.150> select<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:59.170> spring<00:04:59.500> object<00:04:59.980> go

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
so now I'll select the spring object go

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.200 
so now I'll select the spring object go
to<00:05:00.310> spring<00:05:00.760> shape<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.630> set<00:05:01.900> stiffness<00:05:02.440> to

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
to spring shape and set stiffness to

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:11.100 
to spring shape and set stiffness to
like<00:05:04.210> 30

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.590 

or

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:25.299
