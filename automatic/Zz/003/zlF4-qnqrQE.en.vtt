can<00:02:07.630> do<00:02:07.750> even<00:02:07.900> if<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.229> ball<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.739> going

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
can do even if the ball is just going

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.220 
can do even if the ball is just going
into<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.090> same<00:02:10.270> place<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.810> it's<00:02:10.929> not<00:02:10.989> moving

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
into the same place and it's not moving

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.300 
into the same place and it's not moving
around<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.069> always<00:02:12.190> move<00:02:12.459> yourself

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
around you can always move yourself

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.949 
around you can always move yourself
there<00:02:15.310> now<00:02:15.400> it's<00:02:15.520> about<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.790> pay<00:02:16.000> slightly

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
there now it's about to pay slightly

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.830 
there now it's about to pay slightly
more<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.349> top<00:02:18.310> spin<00:02:18.520> shot<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.000> easier<00:02:19.480> step

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
more of a top spin shot so easier step

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.340 
more of a top spin shot so easier step
back<00:02:20.050> from<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.290> table<00:02:20.440> slightly<00:02:22.080> arm<00:02:23.080> is

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
back from the table slightly arm is

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.559 
back from the table slightly arm is
being<00:02:24.040> used<00:02:24.250> slightly<00:02:24.730> more<00:02:24.910> I'm<00:02:25.030> also<00:02:25.239> gonna

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
being used slightly more I'm also gonna

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.449 
being used slightly more I'm also gonna
be<00:02:25.750> adding<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.080> little<00:02:26.200> bit<00:02:26.350> of<00:02:26.500> risk<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.430> that

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
be adding a little bit of risk to that

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.420 
be adding a little bit of risk to that
shot<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:28.350> guess<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.500> main<00:02:29.650> difference<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.250> that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
shot I guess the main difference is that

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.430 
shot I guess the main difference is that
now<00:02:30.670> I'm<00:02:31.060> really<00:02:31.330> accelerating<00:02:32.140> into<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
now I'm really accelerating into the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.339 
now I'm really accelerating into the
ball<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:32.980> order<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.430> get<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.540> extra<00:02:34.840> spin

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
ball so in order to get that extra spin

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.490 
ball so in order to get that extra spin
and<00:02:35.590> speed<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:37.390> really<00:02:37.569> speeding<00:02:37.989> up<00:02:38.200> before

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
and speed and really speeding up before

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.220 
and speed and really speeding up before
I<00:02:38.530> make<00:02:38.739> contact<00:02:39.569> can't<00:02:40.569> see<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.810> four<00:02:41.019> hands

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
I make contact can't see the four hands

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.220 
I make contact can't see the four hands
point<00:02:41.530> so<00:02:41.680> much<00:02:41.890> for<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.190> bit<00:02:42.430> off<00:02:42.549> camera<00:02:42.790> but

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
point so much for a bit off camera but

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.050 
point so much for a bit off camera but
I'm<00:02:44.230> trying<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> really<00:02:44.860> use<00:02:45.069> my<00:02:45.310> body<00:02:45.580> lots<00:02:45.910> of

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
I'm trying to really use my body lots of

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.559 
I'm trying to really use my body lots of
rotation<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:47.610> get<00:02:48.610> power<00:02:48.819> from<00:02:49.060> transferring

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
rotation I get power from transferring

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.449 
rotation I get power from transferring
my<00:02:49.810> weight<00:02:49.989> from<00:02:50.230> our<00:02:50.440> right<00:02:50.650> foot<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.100> still

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
my weight from our right foot and still

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.890 
my weight from our right foot and still
Esther<00:02:51.850> beside<00:02:52.269> drive<00:02:52.989> through<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.410> ball<00:02:53.590> and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
Esther beside drive through the ball and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.150 
Esther beside drive through the ball and
I've<00:02:55.900> just<00:02:56.080> start<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.470> play<00:02:56.650> one<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
I've just start to play one is the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.120 
I've just start to play one is the
background<00:02:57.549> from<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.850> one<00:02:58.000> into<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.330> Fortman

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
background from the one into the Fortman

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.120 
background from the one into the Fortman
very<00:03:00.130> much<00:03:00.489> listening<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.530> quite<00:03:02.860> tricky

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
very much listening this is quite tricky

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.740 
very much listening this is quite tricky
I'll<00:03:03.340> come<00:03:03.519> back<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.819> doing<00:03:03.970> one<00:03:04.209> back<00:03:04.420> in<00:03:04.569> one

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
I'll come back to doing one back in one

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.750 
I'll come back to doing one back in one
forehand<00:03:05.290> they're<00:03:06.040> trying<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.280> do<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.549> quite

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
forehand they're trying to do it quite

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.880 
forehand they're trying to do it quite
an<00:03:06.850> aggressive<00:03:06.940> bleep<00:03:07.510> saying<00:03:07.930> I'm<00:03:08.680> really

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
an aggressive bleep saying I'm really

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.280 
an aggressive bleep saying I'm really
quite<00:03:09.220> pushed<00:03:09.670> for<00:03:09.880> time

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.589 

and<00:03:13.250> now<00:03:13.549> I've<00:03:13.700> changed<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.330> trying<00:03:14.569> to

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
and now I've changed it is trying to

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.360 
and now I've changed it is trying to
play<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> bit<00:03:15.019> more<00:03:15.140> off<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.530> balance<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.129> more

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
play a bit more off the balance so more

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.270 
play a bit more off the balance so more
of<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.519> counter<00:03:16.879> shop<00:03:17.799> that's<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:18.950> little<00:03:19.129> bit

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
of a counter shop that's a little bit

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.580 
of a counter shop that's a little bit
wild<00:03:19.489> but<00:03:19.849> here<00:03:20.510> we<00:03:20.599> go<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:20.959> kind<00:03:21.500> of

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
wild but here we go just kind of

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.380 
wild but here we go just kind of
countering<00:03:22.129> off<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.430> bounce<00:03:22.670> staying<00:03:23.180> quite

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
countering off the bounce staying quite

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.410 
countering off the bounce staying quite
closer<00:03:23.629> to<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.870> table<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:25.700> robot<00:03:26.090> gives<00:03:26.269> you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
closer to the table the robot gives you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.000 
closer to the table the robot gives you
plenty<00:03:26.629> of<00:03:26.810> topspin<00:03:27.200> on<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.349> ball<00:03:27.470> so<00:03:27.650> it's

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
plenty of topspin on the ball so it's

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.289 
plenty of topspin on the ball so it's
kind<00:03:28.189> of<00:03:28.250> like<00:03:28.430> someone's<00:03:28.819> played<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.060> loop

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
kind of like someone's played a loop

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.899 
kind of like someone's played a loop
into<00:03:29.659> you<00:03:29.870> I'm<00:03:30.769> from<00:03:30.950> if<00:03:31.069> they<00:03:31.220> relatively<00:03:31.819> up

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
into you I'm from if they relatively up

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:35.229 
into you I'm from if they relatively up
to<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> table<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:32.690> just<00:03:33.700> use<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.849> topspin

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
to the table and just use the topspin

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.880 
to the table and just use the topspin
and<00:03:35.390> out<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.599> a<00:03:35.690> textbook<00:03:35.989> now<00:03:36.530> these<00:03:36.709> are

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
and out of a textbook now these are

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.960 
and out of a textbook now these are
pretty<00:03:36.980> big<00:03:37.519> crack<00:03:37.819> hands<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:42.819> moves<00:03:43.819> the

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
pretty big crack hands and moves the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.399 
pretty big crack hands and moves the
camera<00:03:44.180> around<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.840> can<00:03:45.019> see<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.230> from<00:03:45.290> the

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
camera around so you can see it from the

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.140 
camera around so you can see it from the
different<00:03:45.530> angles<00:03:45.950> this<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.700> hall<00:03:46.879> that<00:03:47.120> I

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
different angles this is the hall that I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.059 
different angles this is the hall that I
did<00:03:47.769> most<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.920> my<00:03:48.980> coaching<00:03:49.519> in<00:03:50.769> all<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.889> boys

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
did most of my coaching in all the boys

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.160 
did most of my coaching in all the boys
have<00:03:52.220> been<00:03:52.280> hanging<00:03:52.700> now<00:03:53.290> okay<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:56.019> think<00:03:57.019> we're

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
have been hanging now okay I think we're

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.649 
have been hanging now okay I think we're
just<00:03:57.200> starting<00:03:57.349> off<00:03:57.769> with<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.040> few<00:03:58.480> back<00:03:59.480> and

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
just starting off with a few back and

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.319 
just starting off with a few back and
top<00:03:59.840> spins<00:04:00.079> again<00:04:00.909> what<00:04:01.909> you<00:04:02.000> can<00:04:02.120> see<00:04:02.299> from

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
top spins again what you can see from

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.690 
top spins again what you can see from
this<00:04:02.629> angle<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.139> now<00:04:03.980> I've<00:04:04.099> got<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> little<00:04:04.489> bit

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
this angle is now I've got a little bit

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.000 
this angle is now I've got a little bit
of<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.940> of<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.540> bounce<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:06.079> I<00:04:06.170> can<00:04:06.500> tell<00:04:06.799> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
of a of a bounce of I can tell the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.759 
of a of a bounce of I can tell the
rhythm<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.489> ball<00:04:08.139> I'm<00:04:09.139> hitting<00:04:09.590> balls

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
rhythm of the ball I'm hitting balls

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.240 
rhythm of the ball I'm hitting balls
down<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.129> line<00:04:11.470> I've<00:04:12.470> got<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> bit<00:04:12.859> of<00:04:12.980> wrist

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
down the line I've got a bit of wrist

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.430 
down the line I've got a bit of wrist
there<00:04:13.909> not<00:04:14.090> too<00:04:14.299> much<00:04:14.510> risk<00:04:14.780> just<00:04:15.079> throwing<00:04:15.319> it

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
there not too much risk just throwing it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.069 
there not too much risk just throwing it
back<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.829> forwards<00:04:16.539> here<00:04:17.539> I<00:04:17.599> think<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:17.959> can

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
back and forwards here I think you can

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.930 
back and forwards here I think you can
see<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.380> rotation<00:04:18.560> of<00:04:19.099> the<00:04:19.220> forehand<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.789> lot

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
see the rotation of the forehand a lot

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.099 
see the rotation of the forehand a lot
more<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.299> it's<00:04:20.389> very<00:04:20.570> important<00:04:20.900> when<00:04:20.989> you've

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
more so it's very important when you've

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.170 
more so it's very important when you've
found<00:04:21.260> your<00:04:21.410> forehand<00:04:21.739> shots<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.370> you're

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
found your forehand shots that you're

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.240 
found your forehand shots that you're
looking<00:04:23.449> to<00:04:23.479> turn<00:04:23.750> your<00:04:24.110> knees<00:04:24.800> your<00:04:25.099> hips

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
looking to turn your knees your hips

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.980 
looking to turn your knees your hips
your<00:04:25.520> shoulders<00:04:25.550> get<00:04:26.120> all<00:04:26.419> of<00:04:26.660> your<00:04:26.780> body

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
your shoulders get all of your body

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.270 
your shoulders get all of your body
rotating<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:30.229> now<00:04:30.470> you<00:04:30.560> can<00:04:30.740> really<00:04:30.919> see<00:04:31.010> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
rotating and now you can really see the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.909 
rotating and now you can really see the
footwork<00:04:31.669> with<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.180> one<00:04:33.020> forehand<00:04:33.530> one<00:04:33.710> back

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
footwork with the one forehand one back

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.850 
footwork with the one forehand one back
nine<00:04:34.099> and<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:34.900> staying<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:36.050> my<00:04:36.169> toes<00:04:36.199> trying<00:04:36.800> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
nine and so staying on my toes trying to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.370 
nine and so staying on my toes trying to
keep<00:04:36.979> my<00:04:37.099> weight<00:04:37.130> forwards<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:38.840> made<00:04:39.169> which

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
keep my weight forwards that made which

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.070 
keep my weight forwards that made which
quickly<00:04:39.680> kind<00:04:40.010> of<00:04:40.070> bounce<00:04:40.310> from<00:04:40.639> one<00:04:41.030> shot<00:04:41.960> to

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
quickly kind of bounce from one shot to

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.880 
quickly kind of bounce from one shot to
the<00:04:42.110> other

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.780 

gives<00:04:46.890> a<00:04:47.100> bit<00:04:47.280> more<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.520> an<00:04:47.670> aggressive

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
gives a bit more of an aggressive

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.060 
gives a bit more of an aggressive
backhand<00:04:48.660> now<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:49.080> I'm<00:04:49.200> really<00:04:49.440> accelerating

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
backhand now so I'm really accelerating

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.470 
backhand now so I'm really accelerating
into<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.400> ball<00:04:52.850> taking<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.910> ball<00:04:54.090> in<00:04:54.240> front

of<00:04:54.660> me<00:04:54.810> but<00:04:54.990> letting<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.350> come<00:04:55.560> into<00:04:55.890> my<00:04:55.980> body

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.990 
of me but letting it come into my body
not<00:04:56.460> trying<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.670> reach<00:04:56.850> too<00:04:57.150> far<00:04:57.420> for<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:59.000> give

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
not trying to reach too far for it give

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.790 
not trying to reach too far for it give
more<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.360> an<00:05:00.480> aggressive<00:05:00.720> on<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.290> forehand

more of an aggressive on a forehand
topspin
