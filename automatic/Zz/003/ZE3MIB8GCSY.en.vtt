00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
that happened on the edge and instead of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880 
that happened on the edge and instead of
doing<00:00:36.059> illustrations<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:37.559> I'm<00:00:37.649> not<00:00:37.770> an

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
doing illustrations because I'm not an

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.700 
doing illustrations because I'm not an
illustrator<00:00:38.309> I'm<00:00:39.239> he's<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.200> microscope

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
illustrator I'm he's in the microscope

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.319

to get some really good close-up images
so<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:44.000> should<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.120> something<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.420> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so that should be something that is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.010 
so that should be something that is
going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.590> cool<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:48.020> luckily

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
