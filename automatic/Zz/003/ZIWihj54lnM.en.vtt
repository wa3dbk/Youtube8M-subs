00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.390
 hello all my Diman and I hope you 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.290
 not much you teach you to the same which 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.720
 now playing in the background 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.339
 many will say cut down cut down this garbage 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.589
 she takes out the brain 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.269
 but some will ask why is she at all 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.609
 I need why I actually turned on 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.380
 included because she is very connected 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.060
 just 10 minutes to add today 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.099
 the real dance game for this song 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.589
 which plays against the background very well 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.080
 He moves well, what to 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.240
 fucking dancing today but didn't say 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.790
 so that it would be dancing it most likely 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.040
 motion tricks tell me more precisely 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 ask is it all just a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 but surely many have seen of you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.130
 videos online as half-life 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.180
 funny or gels can funny and here 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.180
 such as in a 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.960
 and after the movie ended you 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.060
 laughed and asked themselves how so 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.100
 do as they create such movement on 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.630
 actually create them with this one 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.840
 games using this mod which 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.570
 Today I added Well Well Before Know 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.100
 before you start me too 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.370
 I'll start showing you need to choose 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.290
 more precisely on the character itself Veselka I 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.020
 I will choose, I will choose, I will probably choose 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.800
 this police harvester here he will 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.460
 lie and then I'll take the tool here 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.180
 this one will find such a section right here 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.340
 that's the taste that plays the selector all 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.430
 clicked and click on three characters 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.290
 any right-left no difference here let 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.390
 after being pressed it will still 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.060
 lie and happen how would you be 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.509
 seem like nothing happened now 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.990
 choose a cushion which is this gun and 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.270
 press x and I almost forgot before 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.070
 so how do you install this mod 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.750
 you need to keep some kind of information in this console 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.610
 I still don't remember the command 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.340
 mandatory skin in in in in in description well 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.130
 so let's watch but i put 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.560
 writing is not alone inscriptions 2 is a pity and type 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.470
 chose that gun now click on x and 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.330
 here is an incomprehensible window at first sight to 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.519
 just what it really is all 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.920
 children are very easily managed for this 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.690
 to us before the start in general its 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.010
 animation to fix this 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.320
 that here now this green 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.750
 stood out and click here on this button 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.080
 you hardly see the mouse but you see on 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.239

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.799
 on the plus sign, all here I have is this 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.630
 small bug actually need to lie 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.459

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.610

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.220

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.970

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.880
 The plus sign at this time is not to press that 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.790
