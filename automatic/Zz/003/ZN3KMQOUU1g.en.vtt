00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
problem with a conventional type clutch

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.540 
problem with a conventional type clutch
is<00:00:22.919> that<00:00:23.550> as<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.910> friction<00:00:24.330> material<00:00:24.359> wears

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
is that as the friction material wears

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.460 
is that as the friction material wears
it<00:00:26.550> gets<00:00:26.820> thinner<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.749> diaphragm<00:00:28.050> spring

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
it gets thinner and the diaphragm spring

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429 
it gets thinner and the diaphragm spring
finger<00:00:29.070> angle<00:00:29.429> changes<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.720> becomes<00:00:30.869> steeper

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
finger angle changes it becomes steeper

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.360 
finger angle changes it becomes steeper
and<00:00:31.829> therefore<00:00:32.840> harder<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> overcome<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and therefore harder to overcome so the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.480 
and therefore harder to overcome so the
pedal<00:00:35.850> load<00:00:36.060> changes<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.770> clutch<00:00:38.040> wears

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.440 

self<00:00:41.490> adjusting<00:00:42.090> clutch<00:00:43.100> overcomes<00:00:44.100> that

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
self adjusting clutch overcomes that

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.300 
self adjusting clutch overcomes that
with<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> self<00:00:46.080> adjusting<00:00:46.230> mechanism<00:00:47.100> within

with a self adjusting mechanism within

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.450 
with a self adjusting mechanism within
the<00:00:47.580> cover<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> restores<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.980> diaphragm

with<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.540> self<00:02:40.840> adjusting<00:02:41.320> clutch<00:02:41.530> is

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
with the self adjusting clutch is

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.340 
with the self adjusting clutch is
firstly<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.090> light<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:44.110> have<00:02:44.230> to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
firstly it's so light that we have to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.230 
firstly it's so light that we have to
put<00:02:44.530> some<00:02:44.680> additional<00:02:44.980> springs<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:46.000> there

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
put some additional springs in there

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.240 
put some additional springs in there
just<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.960> give<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.320> bit<00:02:47.500> more<00:02:47.530> resistance

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
just to give it a bit more resistance

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.910 
just to give it a bit more resistance
toward<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> end<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.000> its<00:02:49.150> travel<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.410> because

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
toward the end of its travel and because

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.010 
toward the end of its travel and because
the<00:02:51.040> diaphragm<00:02:51.580> spring<00:02:51.760> fingers<00:02:52.510> are<00:02:52.690> moving

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
the diaphragm spring fingers are moving

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.680 
the diaphragm spring fingers are moving
down<00:02:53.350> as<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:54.340> clutch<00:02:54.550> wears<00:02:54.880> there<00:02:55.300> has<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.510> be

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
down as the clutch wears there has to be

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.410 
down as the clutch wears there has to be
a<00:02:55.810> limit<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:57.100> limit<00:02:57.430> is<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.790> stop<00:02:58.150> ring

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
a limit and the limit is that stop ring

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.020 
a limit and the limit is that stop ring
underneath<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.040> first<00:03:00.250> complaint<00:03:00.820> you

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
underneath so the first complaint you

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.210 
underneath so the first complaint you
may<00:03:01.240> get<00:03:01.510> from<00:03:01.690> your<00:03:01.810> customer<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.470> that<00:03:03.070> when

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
may get from your customer is that when

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.280 
may get from your customer is that when
they<00:03:03.340> operate<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.880> clutch<00:03:04.150> they<00:03:04.510> feel<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> hard

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290
