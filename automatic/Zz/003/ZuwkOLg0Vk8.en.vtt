in<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.530> video<00:00:01.860> tutorial<00:00:02.100> we're<00:00:02.580> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.850> be

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
in this video tutorial we're going to be

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.640 
in this video tutorial we're going to be
talking<00:00:03.149> about<00:00:03.389> oiling<00:00:04.020> which<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.380> part<00:00:04.589> of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
talking about oiling which is part of

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.410 
talking about oiling which is part of
the<00:00:04.770> clocks<00:00:05.040> maintenance<00:00:05.609> you<00:00:06.029> do<00:00:06.180> it<00:00:06.270> about

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
the clocks maintenance you do it about

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.720 
the clocks maintenance you do it about
every<00:00:06.600> two<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.020> five<00:00:07.200> years<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:08.460> can<00:00:08.610> have

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
every two to five years and you can have

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.339 
every two to five years and you can have
it<00:00:08.849> done<00:00:09.000> by<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> professional<00:00:09.300> but<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.170> very

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
it done by a professional but it's very

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.230 
it done by a professional but it's very
easy<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.309> yourself<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:11.849> long<00:00:11.969> as<00:00:12.120> you

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
easy to do it yourself so long as you

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.760 
easy to do it yourself so long as you
have<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> correct<00:00:12.719> tools<00:00:15.109> you<00:00:16.109> need<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.500> bottle

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
have the correct tools you need a bottle

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.519 
have the correct tools you need a bottle
of<00:00:16.920> pop<00:00:17.190> oil<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.480> recommend<00:00:18.810> only<00:00:19.199> o'clock

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
of pop oil and I recommend only o'clock

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.620 
of pop oil and I recommend only o'clock
oil<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:20.189> other<00:00:20.460> words<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:21.029> do<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
oil because other words they do do the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.439 
oil because other words they do do the
job<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.529> some<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.340> also<00:00:23.430> ruin<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.090> clog<00:00:24.330> up

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
job but some can also ruin and clog up

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.910 
job but some can also ruin and clog up
the<00:00:24.570> clock<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.140> don't<00:00:25.350> get<00:00:25.439> stuck<00:00:25.740> with<00:00:25.769> that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the clock so don't get stuck with that

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.400 
the clock so don't get stuck with that
another<00:00:26.849> tool<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.510> commonly<00:00:27.900> need<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
another tool that you commonly need is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.540 
another tool that you commonly need is
an<00:00:29.039> oiler

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
an oiler

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.150 
an oiler
so<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.269> long<00:00:30.480> spike<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> handle

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
so it's this long spike with the handle

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.810 
so it's this long spike with the handle
you<00:00:32.790> saw<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.090> my<00:00:33.300> tool<00:00:33.510> presentation<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:34.820> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you saw in my tool presentation as you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.670 
you saw in my tool presentation as you
did<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> clock<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:39.200> another<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
did see the clock one another one that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.729 
did see the clock one another one that
you<00:00:40.860> need<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.399> don't<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.850> is

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
you need which I don't have is

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
you need which I don't have is
mainspring<00:00:43.739> oil<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.640> use<00:00:44.670> towing<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
mainspring oil that you use towing the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.170 
mainspring oil that you use towing the
mainspring<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:47.899> did<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.140> bit<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.500> little

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
mainspring I did a little bit a little

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.709 
mainspring I did a little bit a little
experiment<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:52.309> this<00:00:53.329> novelty<00:00:54.329> clock

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
experiment with this novelty clock

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.959 
experiment with this novelty clock
what's<00:00:55.379> good<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.620> novelty<00:00:56.250> clocks<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
what's good about novelty clocks I just

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
what's good about novelty clocks I just
want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> say<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.870> they're<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.379> very

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
want to say is that they're not very

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.010 
want to say is that they're not very
high<00:00:58.890> quality<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.579> were<00:00:59.640> mass-produced

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
high quality and they were mass-produced

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.270 
high quality and they were mass-produced
so<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> mess<00:01:01.410> them<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.890> no<00:01:02.039> big<00:01:02.250> deal

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so if you mess them up it's no big deal

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.140 
so if you mess them up it's no big deal
unless<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:04.489> you've<00:01:05.489> sentimental

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
unless you know you've sentimental

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.620 
unless you know you've sentimental
attachment<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> clock<00:01:07.130> but<00:01:08.420> they're<00:01:09.420> good

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
attachment to the clock but they're good

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.560 
attachment to the clock but they're good
clocks<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.110> start<00:01:10.409> off<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
clocks to start off with so the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.710 
clocks to start off with so the
experiment<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.310> using<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.700> oil<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
experiment was using this oil on the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.890 
experiment was using this oil on the
mainspring<00:01:17.299> instead<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:19.009> proper<00:01:20.009> spring<00:01:20.340> well

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
mainspring instead of proper spring well

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
mainspring instead of proper spring well
it's<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.020> me<00:01:22.409> experiments<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.820> wouldn't

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
it's just me experiments but I wouldn't

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.270 
it's just me experiments but I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:24.360> doing<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.710> case<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.130> doesn't

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
recommend doing it in case it doesn't

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.830 
recommend doing it in case it doesn't
work<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.240> I'll<00:01:27.360> let<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.990> goes

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
work but I'll let you know how that goes

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.030 
work but I'll let you know how that goes
and<00:01:31.579> now<00:01:32.579> another<00:01:33.170> question<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and now another question that we have to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.870 
and now another question that we have to
answer<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.689> where<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.490> well<00:01:38.490> it's

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
answer is where do you all well it's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.590 
answer is where do you all well it's
very<00:01:39.060> simple

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
very simple

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
very simple
on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.110> pivots<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.310> different

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
on the pivots now there are different

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.030 
on the pivots now there are different
types<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.000> pivots<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.869> clock<00:01:45.920> there<00:01:46.920> are

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
types of pivots in this clock there are

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.520 
types of pivots in this clock there are
four<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.820> case<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:49.490> one<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.520> one

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
four in this case one here one here one

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
four in this case one here one here one
behind<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:55.310> suspension<00:01:56.310> which<00:01:56.670> belongs<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
behind the suspension which belongs to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.950 
behind the suspension which belongs to
the<00:01:57.479> suspension<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:59.509> another<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.689> behind

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the suspension and another one behind

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.380 
the suspension and another one behind
the<00:02:01.140> suspension<00:02:01.829> which<00:02:02.640> belongs<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.149> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the suspension which belongs to that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.510 
the suspension which belongs to that
little<00:02:03.659> wheeled<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.320> around<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.950> escape

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
little wheeled going around the escape

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.300 
little wheeled going around the escape
wheel<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.970> other<00:02:09.209> pivots<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:10.349> maybe<00:02:11.099> don't

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
wheel to other pivots that maybe don't

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.410 
wheel to other pivots that maybe don't
qualify<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.940> pivots<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.690> they<00:02:12.840> do<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.140> me<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
qualify as pivots but they do to me the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.059 
qualify as pivots but they do to me the
main<00:02:15.900> spring<00:02:17.330> pivot<00:02:18.470> which<00:02:19.470> belongs<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
main spring pivot which belongs to the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.130 
main spring pivot which belongs to the
mainspring<00:02:20.520> wheel<00:02:20.819> which<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.660> actually

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
mainspring wheel which is actually

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.440 
mainspring wheel which is actually
behind<00:02:22.379> mainspring<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.849> wheel<00:02:24.030> turns

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
behind mainspring and that wheel turns

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.900 
behind mainspring and that wheel turns
as<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.020> mainspring<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:25.620> lines<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.790> it's

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
as the mainspring on lines so it's

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.650 
as the mainspring on lines so it's
always<00:02:27.060> important<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.810> keep<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:29.660> regularly

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
always important to keep that regularly

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
always important to keep that regularly
your<00:02:30.870> welds<00:02:31.170> because<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.769> course<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
your welds because of course the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.369 
your welds because of course the
mainspring<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> very<00:02:33.599> important<00:02:34.110> part<00:02:34.349> of

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
mainspring is a very important part of

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.170 
mainspring is a very important part of
the<00:02:34.470> clock<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.920> gives<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.220> all<00:02:35.580> its<00:02:35.940> power

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
the clock and it gives it all its power

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.479 
the clock and it gives it all its power
to<00:02:36.390> keep<00:02:36.540> time<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.560> guess<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.160> could<00:02:38.280> say

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
to keep time so I guess you could say

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.180 
to keep time so I guess you could say
it's<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:39.180> or<00:02:39.390> maybe<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.780> main<00:02:40.050> part<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
it's one or maybe the main part of the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.500 
it's one or maybe the main part of the
plot<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> there's<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.819> there<00:02:45.360> is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
plot so there's that one and there is

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.900 
plot so there's that one and there is
another<00:02:46.140> pivot<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.800> don't<00:02:47.489> know<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.670> pivot

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
another pivot I don't know the pivot

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.490 
another pivot I don't know the pivot
there<00:02:48.319> which<00:02:49.319> belongs<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:51.140> obviously<00:02:52.140> another

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
there which belongs to obviously another

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.009 
there which belongs to obviously another
large<00:02:52.890> larger<00:02:53.849> gear<00:02:55.670> over<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.700> mainspring<00:02:57.300> so

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
large larger gear over the mainspring so

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.220 
large larger gear over the mainspring so
that's<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.800> basic<00:02:59.750> let's<00:03:00.750> call<00:03:01.050> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that's just the basic let's call the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.410 
that's just the basic let's call the
place<00:03:01.650> oiling<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.760> take<00:03:05.760> your<00:03:05.790> oil<00:03:06.120> on

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
place oiling and so you take your oil on

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.920 
place oiling and so you take your oil on
you<00:03:06.659> apply<00:03:07.050> generally<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.819> baby<00:03:08.819> through<00:03:09.209> wet

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
you apply generally to baby through wet

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.430 
you apply generally to baby through wet
one<00:03:10.260> or<00:03:10.560> two<00:03:10.800> drops<00:03:11.099> of<00:03:11.340> oil<00:03:11.489> on<00:03:11.840> them<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:13.230> each

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
one or two drops of oil on them on each

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.610 
one or two drops of oil on them on each
pivot<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.190> then<00:03:14.760> wipe<00:03:15.209> off<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:16.200> excess

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
pivot and then wipe off the the excess

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.149 
pivot and then wipe off the the excess
with<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.830> tissue<00:03:18.110> it's<00:03:19.110> great<00:03:19.379> it's<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:19.950> very

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
with the tissue it's great it's a very

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.990 
with the tissue it's great it's a very
routine<00:03:20.370> process

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
routine process

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.020 
routine process
now<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:22.930> some<00:03:23.110> cases<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.920> have<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.250> perform<00:03:24.520> a

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
now in some cases you have to perform a

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.870 
now in some cases you have to perform a
lot<00:03:25.810> more<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.410> complicated<00:03:27.190> oiling<00:03:29.880> you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
lot more of a complicated oiling you

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.620 
lot more of a complicated oiling you
have<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.270> oil<00:03:31.680> each<00:03:32.680> pivot<00:03:33.220> but<00:03:33.880> directly

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
have to oil each pivot but directly

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.770 
have to oil each pivot but directly
behind<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.380> place<00:03:35.680> on<00:03:35.980> both<00:03:36.490> sides<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.720> you

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
behind the place on both sides so you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.080 
behind the place on both sides so you
see<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.080> clock<00:03:38.320> has<00:03:38.500> two<00:03:38.740> plates<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.850> have

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
see a clock has two plates so you have

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.910 
see a clock has two plates so you have
to<00:03:40.210> perform<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:42.700> place<00:03:43.090> oiling<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.320> front

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
to perform the place oiling on the front

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.110 
to perform the place oiling on the front
plate<00:03:45.280> as<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:45.940> did<00:03:46.420> with<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.660> back<00:03:46.810> plate<00:03:47.050> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
plate as you did with the back plate and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.200 
plate as you did with the back plate and
then<00:03:49.500> what's<00:03:50.500> annoying<00:03:51.010> about<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.580> clock<00:03:51.940> is

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
then what's annoying about this clock is

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.540 
then what's annoying about this clock is
that<00:03:52.270> you<00:03:52.720> can't<00:03:52.930> take<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.320> movement<00:03:53.650> AB<00:03:53.830> but

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
that you can't take the movement AB but

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.020 
that you can't take the movement AB but
you<00:03:54.790> also<00:03:54.910> have<00:03:55.240> to<00:03:55.270> oil<00:03:55.450> each<00:03:56.230> pivot<00:03:57.030> directly

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
you also have to oil each pivot directly

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.890 
you also have to oil each pivot directly
behind<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.570> plate<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:01.000> directly<00:04:01.450> behind<00:04:01.630> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
behind the plate so directly behind the

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.400 
behind the plate so directly behind the
pivot<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:04.720> also<00:04:06.209> gets<00:04:07.209> any<00:04:07.630> old<00:04:07.930> dirt

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
pivot and that also gets any old dirt

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.070 
pivot and that also gets any old dirt
out<00:04:08.830> of<00:04:08.890> there<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:09.940> that's<00:04:10.090> very<00:04:10.270> important<00:04:10.900> to

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
out of there so that's very important to

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.930 
out of there so that's very important to
in<00:04:11.260> some<00:04:11.500> cases<00:04:11.770> you<00:04:12.070> have<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.340> do<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.610> in

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
in some cases you have to do that in

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.870 
in some cases you have to do that in
some<00:04:13.480> air<00:04:13.840> in<00:04:14.140> some<00:04:14.440> cases<00:04:14.770> it's<00:04:15.459> not<00:04:15.610> as

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
some air in some cases it's not as

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.259 
some air in some cases it's not as
important<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:17.370> have<00:04:18.370> another<00:04:18.640> clock<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.209> I

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
important I have another clock that I

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.150 
important I have another clock that I
can<00:04:19.510> show<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.810> how<00:04:20.260> for<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.859> kind<00:04:21.100> of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
can show you how for that kind of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.540 
can show you how for that kind of
routine<00:04:21.690> but<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.710> something<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.370> you

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
routine but it is something that you

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.280 
routine but it is something that you
will<00:04:25.140> run<00:04:26.140> into<00:04:26.530> quite<00:04:26.860> commonly

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
will run into quite commonly

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.140 
will run into quite commonly
so<00:04:29.290> enough<00:04:29.770> rambling<00:04:30.190> all<00:04:30.340> about<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.790> let's

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
so enough rambling all about that let's

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.080 
so enough rambling all about that let's
go<00:04:31.390> on<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.690> testing<00:04:32.260> when<00:04:33.070> testing<00:04:33.669> your<00:04:33.820> clock

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
go on to testing when testing your clock

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.300 
go on to testing when testing your clock
the<00:04:34.300> first<00:04:34.510> thing<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:34.780> want<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.020> do<00:04:35.169> after<00:04:36.100> one

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
the first thing you want to do after one

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.830 
the first thing you want to do after one
thing<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.790> I<00:04:36.880> forgot<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.240> mention<00:04:37.450> is<00:04:37.810> how

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
thing that I forgot to mention is how

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.909 
thing that I forgot to mention is how
you<00:04:38.110> own<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.710> clock<00:04:39.300> it's<00:04:40.300> important<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.530> oil

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
you own the clock it's important to oil

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.630 
you own the clock it's important to oil
it<00:04:42.190> blind<00:04:42.550> down<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.240> think<00:04:43.360> because<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:45.370> lets

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
it blind down I think because it lets

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.140 
it blind down I think because it lets
the<00:04:45.790> oil<00:04:46.210> seep<00:04:46.660> down<00:04:47.169> into<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:48.070> pivot<00:04:48.250> which

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
the oil seep down into the pivot which

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.230 
the oil seep down into the pivot which
is<00:04:49.360> important<00:04:49.960> so<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.770> gets<00:04:51.010> any<00:04:51.669> dirt

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
is important so that it it gets any dirt

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.600 
is important so that it it gets any dirt
or<00:04:52.780> grease<00:04:53.169> out<00:04:53.470> of<00:04:53.620> there<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.660> then<00:04:55.660> when

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
or grease out of there and then when

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.750 
or grease out of there and then when
when<00:04:58.050> when<00:04:59.050> you<00:04:59.200> test<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.890> or<00:05:00.130> when<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.400> let

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
when when you test it or when you let

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.700 
when when you test it or when you let
the<00:05:00.940> oil<00:05:01.120> seep<00:05:01.419> in<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:02.050> also<00:05:02.260> have<00:05:02.440> to<00:05:02.560> take

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
the oil seep in you also have to take

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.710 
the oil seep in you also have to take
the<00:05:02.770> pendulum<00:05:03.220> off<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:04.210> let<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:05.370> suspensions

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
the pendulum off to let the suspensions

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.050 
the pendulum off to let the suspensions
swing<00:05:07.720> very<00:05:08.020> freely<00:05:08.470> there<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.040> you<00:05:09.729> let<00:05:09.910> it

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
swing very freely there and you let it

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.940 
swing very freely there and you let it
on<00:05:10.180> one<00:05:10.479> you<00:05:10.720> let<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.990> clock<00:05:11.169> run<00:05:11.229> wine<00:05:11.620> for<00:05:11.860> a

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
on one you let the clock run wine for a

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.520 
on one you let the clock run wine for a
better<00:05:12.100> nicer<00:05:12.400> so<00:05:12.880> maybe<00:05:13.180> maybe<00:05:13.900> two<00:05:14.260> nights

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
better nicer so maybe maybe two nights

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.469 
better nicer so maybe maybe two nights
and<00:05:14.830> then<00:05:14.979> after<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.640> start<00:05:15.910> testing<00:05:16.419> it

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
and then after that you start testing it

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.260 
and then after that you start testing it
so<00:05:17.110> of<00:05:17.229> course<00:05:17.440> you<00:05:17.680> put<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.070> pendulum<00:05:18.790> on<00:05:18.940> and

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
so of course you put the pendulum on and

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.630 
so of course you put the pendulum on and
you<00:05:19.960> take<00:05:20.169> the<00:05:20.350> key<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:21.100> wind<00:05:21.340> up<00:05:21.460> the

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
you take the key you wind up the

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.010 
you take the key you wind up the
mainspring

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
mainspring

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.490 
mainspring
and<00:05:23.350> so<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:24.490> put<00:05:25.419> on<00:05:25.449> your<00:05:25.660> pendulum<00:05:25.990> to<00:05:26.410> the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
and so you put on your pendulum to the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.610 
and so you put on your pendulum to the
suspension<00:05:26.919> actually<00:05:27.910> I'm<00:05:28.180> going<00:05:28.389> to<00:05:28.620> show

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
suspension actually I'm going to show

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.650 
suspension actually I'm going to show
you<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:30.009> pendulum<00:05:30.430> that<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.060> made<00:05:31.300> for<00:05:31.509> this

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
you the pendulum that I made for this

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.310 
you the pendulum that I made for this
clock<00:05:31.960> because<00:05:32.830> when<00:05:33.669> it<00:05:33.910> came<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.509> me<00:05:34.660> it

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
clock because when it came to me it

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.570 
clock because when it came to me it
didn't<00:05:35.680> have<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:36.070> it<00:05:36.430> didn't<00:05:36.729> have<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:37.120> the

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
didn't have the it didn't have the the

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.150 
didn't have the it didn't have the the
pendulum<00:05:39.580> so<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.600> made<00:05:40.930> one<00:05:40.960> out<00:05:41.440> of<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:41.620> 20<00:05:41.949> cent

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
pendulum so I made one out of a 20 cent

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.810 
pendulum so I made one out of a 20 cent
coin<00:05:42.490> and<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:46.000> piece<00:05:46.900> of<00:05:47.110> wire<00:05:47.550> it's<00:05:48.550> very

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
coin and a piece of wire it's very

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.600 
coin and a piece of wire it's very
simple<00:05:49.210> and<00:05:49.479> then<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:50.050> add<00:05:50.979> a<00:05:51.009> bit<00:05:51.250> of<00:05:51.280> blue

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
simple and then you add a bit of blue

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.659 
simple and then you add a bit of blue
tactic<00:05:52.889> put<00:05:53.889> the<00:05:54.009> bulb<00:05:54.250> there<00:05:55.680> but<00:05:56.680> I<00:05:57.220> would

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
tactic put the bulb there but I would

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.950 
tactic put the bulb there but I would
also<00:05:57.820> like<00:05:58.060> to<00:05:58.120> talk<00:05:58.690> about<00:05:59.220> this<00:06:00.220> part<00:06:01.030> of<00:06:01.300> the

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
also like to talk about this part of the

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.529 
also like to talk about this part of the
of<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.190> pendulum<00:06:03.639> because<00:06:03.940> it's<00:06:04.360> very

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
of the pendulum because it's very

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.230 
of the pendulum because it's very
important<00:06:05.110> in<00:06:05.289> some<00:06:05.919> cases<00:06:06.190> if<00:06:06.580> you<00:06:06.759> make<00:06:06.970> that

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
important in some cases if you make that

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.379 
important in some cases if you make that
part<00:06:07.570> if<00:06:07.690> you're<00:06:07.810> making<00:06:07.990> this<00:06:08.380> pendulum<00:06:08.800> or

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
part if you're making this pendulum or

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.219 
part if you're making this pendulum or
or<00:06:10.389> you<00:06:10.539> can<00:06:10.690> buy<00:06:10.960> it

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
or you can buy it

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.980 
or you can buy it
another<00:06:11.590> one<00:06:11.770> from<00:06:11.979> time<00:06:12.430> savers<00:06:13.060> or<00:06:13.090> other

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
another one from time savers or other

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.620 
another one from time savers or other
clock<00:06:14.380> suppliers<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:15.370> original<00:06:15.849> one<00:06:16.030> that

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
clock suppliers the original one that

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.969 
clock suppliers the original one that
would<00:06:16.750> have<00:06:16.840> gone<00:06:16.990> with<00:06:17.050> this<00:06:17.349> clock<00:06:17.620> but<00:06:17.889> if

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
would have gone with this clock but if

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.740 
would have gone with this clock but if
you<00:06:18.099> just<00:06:18.280> want<00:06:18.490> to<00:06:18.520> make<00:06:18.699> one<00:06:18.940> and<00:06:19.360> make<00:06:19.720> sure

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
you just want to make one and make sure

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.670 
you just want to make one and make sure
that<00:06:20.320> you<00:06:20.440> don't<00:06:20.560> make<00:06:20.800> this<00:06:21.190> part<00:06:21.610> too<00:06:22.240> wide

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
that you don't make this part too wide

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.500 
that you don't make this part too wide
because<00:06:23.680> in<00:06:24.580> some<00:06:24.910> cases<00:06:25.150> you<00:06:26.610> this<00:06:27.610> this

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
because in some cases you this this

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.210 
because in some cases you this this
pendulum<00:06:29.470> would<00:06:30.280> swing<00:06:31.050> all<00:06:32.050> of<00:06:32.680> the<00:06:32.830> actual

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
pendulum would swing all of the actual

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.129 
pendulum would swing all of the actual
suspension<00:06:33.909> but<00:06:34.479> it's<00:06:34.659> actually<00:06:35.020> the

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
suspension but it's actually the

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.529 
suspension but it's actually the
pendulum<00:06:35.740> that<00:06:35.979> should<00:06:36.190> swing<00:06:36.610> to<00:06:37.150> the<00:06:37.270> rhythm

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
pendulum that should swing to the rhythm

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.409 
pendulum that should swing to the rhythm
of<00:06:37.659> the<00:06:37.810> suspension<00:06:38.639> so<00:06:39.639> don't<00:06:39.849> make<00:06:39.970> that<00:06:40.030> to

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
of the suspension so don't make that to

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.500 
of the suspension so don't make that to
large<00:06:40.630> just<00:06:40.990> make<00:06:41.199> sure<00:06:41.409> it<00:06:41.530> fits<00:06:42.510> narrowly

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
large just make sure it fits narrowly

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.860 
large just make sure it fits narrowly
onto<00:06:43.930> the<00:06:44.050> onto<00:06:44.800> the<00:06:45.159> site<00:06:45.880> onto<00:06:46.419> the

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
onto the onto the site onto the

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.159 
onto the onto the site onto the
suspension<00:06:47.970> but<00:06:48.970> do<00:06:49.360> leave<00:06:49.539> a<00:06:49.570> little<00:06:49.870> bit<00:06:50.050> of

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
suspension but do leave a little bit of

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.410 
suspension but do leave a little bit of
flexibility

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.420 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.590 

and<00:06:55.190> so<00:06:56.190> you<00:06:56.250> wind<00:06:56.550> up<00:06:56.700> the<00:06:56.880> mainspring<00:06:57.390> and

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
and so you wind up the mainspring and

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.770 
and so you wind up the mainspring and
you<00:06:57.690> test<00:06:57.990> it<00:06:58.320> and<00:06:58.560> the<00:06:59.220> times<00:06:59.490> you<00:07:00.420> need<00:07:00.600> to

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
you test it and the times you need to

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.460 
you test it and the times you need to
order<00:07:00.960> clock<00:07:01.260> to<00:07:01.620> maybe<00:07:02.010> even<00:07:02.280> three<00:07:02.610> times

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
order clock to maybe even three times

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.110 
order clock to maybe even three times
you<00:07:04.470> know<00:07:04.560> in<00:07:04.710> all<00:07:04.830> places<00:07:05.160> before<00:07:05.880> you<00:07:05.970> get

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
you know in all places before you get
