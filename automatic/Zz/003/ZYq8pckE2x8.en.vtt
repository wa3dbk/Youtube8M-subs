this recording and miraculously

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.770 
this recording and miraculously
connected<00:04:49.490> rather<00:04:49.639> quickly<00:04:50.030> though<00:04:50.449> i<00:04:50.479> found

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
connected rather quickly though i found

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.809 
connected rather quickly though i found
on<00:04:50.930> many<00:04:51.080> occasions<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.129> kinect<00:04:52.460> scream

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
on many occasions that the kinect scream

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.089 
on many occasions that the kinect scream
would<00:04:53.210> stay<00:04:53.509> up<00:04:53.690> for<00:04:53.930> upwards<00:04:54.289> of<00:04:54.379> 10<00:04:54.440> minutes

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
would stay up for upwards of 10 minutes

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.279 
would stay up for upwards of 10 minutes
before<00:04:55.250> anything<00:04:55.729> actually<00:04:55.879> happened<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.720> it

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
before anything actually happened and it

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:59.200 
before anything actually happened and it

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
took a few days of trying before i could

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.059 
took a few days of trying before i could
actually<00:04:59.479> get<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.900> purchase<00:05:00.409> screen<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.860> load

on PSN as it stands now i can
confidently<00:05:10.430> say<00:05:10.819> that<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.509> GUI<00:05:11.690> ax<00:05:11.810> is<00:05:11.990> a

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
confidently say that the GUI ax is a

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.320 
confidently say that the GUI ax is a
piece<00:05:12.289> of<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:13.039> it's<00:05:13.669> about<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.000> size<00:05:14.150> of

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
piece of and it's about the size of

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.870 
piece of and it's about the size of
12<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:15.199> system<00:05:15.560> does<00:05:15.860> have<00:05:16.190> potential<00:05:16.580> for

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
12 the system does have potential for

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.850 
12 the system does have potential for
firmware<00:05:17.150> updates<00:05:17.659> so<00:05:18.080> it's<00:05:18.229> possible<00:05:18.469> these

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
firmware updates so it's possible these

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.649
