00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
understand why she said that because she

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.229 
understand why she said that because she
knows<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:48.850> that's<00:02:49.239> little<00:02:49.570> loves<00:02:50.020> gonna<00:02:50.590> and

she doesn't want him to be pressure just

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.560 
she doesn't want him to be pressure just
because<00:02:54.480> she<00:02:55.800> confessed<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.950> him<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.570> because

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
because she confessed to him and because

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.820

people<00:04:22.270> who'll<00:04:22.479> talk<00:04:22.720> about<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.320> finally<00:04:24.160> and

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
people who'll talk about it finally and

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.310 
people who'll talk about it finally and
maybe<00:04:24.699> we'll<00:04:25.000> watch<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.509> again<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.169> can

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
maybe we'll watch it again so you can

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.790 
maybe we'll watch it again so you can
start<00:04:26.680> off<00:04:26.979> with<00:04:27.250> looking<00:04:28.240> cool<00:04:28.600> and<00:04:29.169> finally

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
start off with looking cool and finally

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.969 
start off with looking cool and finally
looking<00:04:30.039> like<00:04:30.370> he<00:04:30.669> knows<00:04:31.270> something<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:32.169> he

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
looking like he knows something and he

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.340 
looking like he knows something and he
actually<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.669> doing<00:04:34.240> something<00:04:34.539> to<00:04:35.020> become<00:04:35.320> a

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
actually is doing something to become a

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.710 
actually is doing something to become a
god<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:35.979> then<00:04:36.400> after<00:04:36.699> that<00:04:36.880> scene<00:04:37.240> we<00:04:37.539> know

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
god and then after that scene we know

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.960 
god and then after that scene we know
that<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.080> was<00:04:38.229> all<00:04:38.380> scripted<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.310> was<00:04:39.580> done<00:04:39.789> by
