00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.299 
the way there so you're trying to trick
them<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> real<00:00:35.880> maze<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.530> yep<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
them just like a real maze would yep so

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.240 
them just like a real maze would yep so
they<00:00:38.520> go<00:00:38.730> all<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> wrong<00:00:39.329> direction<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.250> just

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
they go all the wrong direction and just

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.440 
they go all the wrong direction and just
to<00:00:41.460> come<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.820> dead<00:00:42.030> end

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to come to a dead end

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.380 
to come to a dead end
okay<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.430> why<00:00:44.700> that's<00:00:45.149> why<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
okay I like that that's why that's why I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.500 
okay I like that that's why that's why I
like<00:00:45.629> mazes<00:00:46.610> why<00:00:47.610> don't<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> give<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.270> test

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
like mazes why don't you give it a test

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.450 
like mazes why don't you give it a test
play<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:48.989> quick<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:52.460> okay

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
play really quick so we can see you okay

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
play really quick so we can see you okay
so<00:00:53.730> those<00:00:54.210> two<00:00:54.510> ways<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.140> go<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:55.890> go

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so those two ways you can go you can go

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.330 
so those two ways you can go you can go
down<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.000> way<00:00:57.059> or<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.690> way<00:00:58.820> so<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.129> down

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
down this way or that way so you go down

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.890 
down this way or that way so you go down
that<00:01:02.640> way<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> watch<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.689> tricky<00:01:06.689> make

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
that way and watch this tricky make

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.390 
that way and watch this tricky make
trickster<00:01:10.040> this<00:01:11.040> part<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.400> getting<00:01:11.520> harder

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
trickster this part is getting harder

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.090 
trickster this part is getting harder
that's<00:01:14.400> why<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.760> called<00:01:14.909> hard<00:01:15.270> maze<00:01:16.100> what

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that's why it's called hard maze what

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710 
that's why it's called hard maze what
happens<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.759> hit<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> wall<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.570> you're

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
happens if you hit a wall I see you're

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510 
happens if you hit a wall I see you're
trying<00:01:18.840> not<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> hit<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> walls<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:20.369> all

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
trying not to hit the walls at all

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.920 
trying not to hit the walls at all
you'll<00:01:21.030> explode

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.480 

so<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.140> way<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.440> seems<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.830> go<00:01:28.950> nowhere<00:01:31.490> cool

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so that way it seems to go nowhere cool

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.530 
so that way it seems to go nowhere cool
and<00:01:33.450> watch<00:01:33.890> if<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.520> it'll<00:01:36.420> be

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
and watch if I go this way it'll be

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.280 
and watch if I go this way it'll be
easier<00:01:38.060> well<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:41.759> parts<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:43.369> little<00:01:44.369> bit<00:01:44.610> easy

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
easier well this parts a little bit easy

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.399 
easier well this parts a little bit easy
not<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.680> easy<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.940> kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.270> easy<00:01:48.509> so

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
not that easy but it's kind of easy so

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.450 
not that easy but it's kind of easy so
how<00:01:49.560> many<00:01:49.619> levels<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.399> gonna<00:01:50.580> have<00:01:51.440> 20<00:01:52.460> 25
