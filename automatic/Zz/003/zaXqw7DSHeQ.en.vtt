approach it's been completely redesigned

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.160 
approach it's been completely redesigned
and<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> first<00:00:32.640> time<00:00:32.850> ever<00:00:33.239> we've

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.400 
and for the first time ever we've
increased<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.829> size<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> display<00:00:36.410> by

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
increased the size of the display by

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.860 
increased the size of the display by
making<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> screen<00:00:38.309> taller<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.270> not<00:00:39.510> wider

to<00:00:54.710> achieve<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.070> design<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:55.789> then<00:00:56.120> we<00:00:56.839> had<00:00:56.960> to

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
to achieve a design this then we had to

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.810 
to achieve a design this then we had to
look<00:00:57.260> at<00:00:57.379> making<00:00:57.739> many<00:00:58.039> of<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.370> components

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
look at making many of the components

inside<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.629> design<00:00:59.929> small<00:01:00.350> it's<00:01:01.100> actually

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
inside the design small it's actually

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.639 
inside the design small it's actually
eighteen<00:01:02.120> percent<00:01:02.300> thinner<00:01:02.839> and<00:01:03.140> twenty

inside<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.940> phone<00:01:47.179> very<00:01:47.630> carefully<00:01:48.289> we've

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
inside the phone very carefully we've

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.309 
inside the phone very carefully we've
created<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.549> new<00:01:49.729> much<00:01:50.240> smaller<00:01:50.659> lightning

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
created the new much smaller lightning

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.680 
created the new much smaller lightning
connector<00:01:51.830> it's<00:01:52.310> all<00:01:52.580> digital<00:01:52.819> so<00:01:53.479> it's

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
connector it's all digital so it's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.289 
connector it's all digital so it's
designed<00:01:54.110> for<00:01:54.259> today's<00:01:54.649> juices<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.429> we<00:01:56.119> made

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
designed for today's juices and we made

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.830 
designed for today's juices and we made
it<00:01:56.330> reversible<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.440> it<00:01:57.560> fits<00:01:57.830> either<00:01:58.069> way<00:01:58.840> we

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
it reversible so it fits either way we

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.319 
it reversible so it fits either way we
also<00:02:00.020> move<00:02:00.469> to<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.710> sapphire<00:02:01.280> lens<00:02:01.759> company

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
also move to a sapphire lens company

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.779 
also move to a sapphire lens company
which<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.780> thinner<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:03.680> more<00:02:03.710> durable<00:02:04.340> than

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
which is thinner and more durable than

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.149 
which is thinner and more durable than
the<00:02:04.909> previous<00:02:05.570> cover<00:02:05.869> glass<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.799> really

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
the previous cover glass this really

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.099 
the previous cover glass this really
protects<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.880> optics<00:02:08.359> and<00:02:08.690> keeps<00:02:08.959> your

protects the optics and keeps your

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:10.919 
protects the optics and keeps your
photos<00:02:09.500> looking<00:02:09.859> great

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
photos looking great

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.929 
photos looking great
