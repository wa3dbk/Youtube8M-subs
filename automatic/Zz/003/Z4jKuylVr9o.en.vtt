round highway it's the whole thing with
n<00:02:50.260> maybe<00:02:50.590> because<00:02:50.860> we've<00:02:51.100> tried<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.550> with

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
n maybe because we've tried it with

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.090 
n maybe because we've tried it with
other<00:02:51.850> things<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:53.410> can<00:02:53.590> literally<00:02:53.830> get

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
only nav and go out of the map of you

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.930 
only nav and go out of the map of you
can<00:02:56.800> get<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.070> places<00:02:57.489> where<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.730> can't
