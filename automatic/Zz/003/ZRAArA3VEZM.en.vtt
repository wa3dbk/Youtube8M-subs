00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
line of red all across the bottom and it

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970 
line of red all across the bottom and it
actually<00:00:23.760> goes<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.630> across<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.260> edges<00:00:25.710> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
actually goes all across the edges so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.099 
actually goes all across the edges so
everywhere<00:00:26.490> around<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.660> edge<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.990> got<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
everywhere around the edge it's got a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.380 
everywhere around the edge it's got a
little<00:00:28.380> bit<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.680> red<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> very<00:00:30.150> very

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.089 
little bit of red so this is a very very
nice<00:00:30.510> monitor<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.710> 20<00:00:32.070> inches

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
nice monitor now it's 20 inches

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.510 
nice monitor now it's 20 inches
diagonally<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.770> 1600<00:00:34.770> by<00:00:34.890> 900

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
diagonally it's actually 1600 by 900

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.799 
diagonally it's actually 1600 by 900
that<00:00:35.579> means<00:00:35.730> there's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> native<00:00:36.300> 16<00:00:36.660> by<00:00:36.780> 9

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
that means there's a native 16 by 9

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.880 
that means there's a native 16 by 9
