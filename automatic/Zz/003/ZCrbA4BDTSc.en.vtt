00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.850
 without removing it 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.850
 to turn 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 let's make a button on a console 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.560
 that a few months ago it sold for 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.349
 internet a few weeks ago but already 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.270
 are the stores in the console today and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.520
 that this android operating system and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 apart from the lame is that they make a 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.660
 promotion of a channel of a friend of mine 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.230

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.629
 very good the other day did a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.359
 medium explanation explaining the nintendo 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.879
 direct from smash bros that the truth that 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.730
 it's a rarity with the edition 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 the truth that you notice a lot and nothing 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.750
 well that you go through your channel and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.620
 let's do the unboxing of this war 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.140
 and well let's go wait let's open 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.520
 close let's see the box a bit 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.420
 we will go in the 2000 the logo with the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.900
 letters make great to see here that puts 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.670
 and what 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.760
 what has hdmi and 8 gigas of memory 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.070
 bluetooth 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.650
 good brothers and sisters and as you see 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.870
 Well, this console is based on 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.180
 all games of mobile phones 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.640
 we can link the console to our 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.480
 mobile phone that is android and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.480
 so 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.410
 well that is linked to the console 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.600
 to the mobile phone and all the games that 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.960
 we have on the phone we can play them 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.630
 with this console the television the command 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.070
 and then apart we can buy 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.020
 all android games and then well 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.870
 the comfort of being able to play it as a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.760
 normal console with the remote control and not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.200
 is there as he touched on the mobile or by 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.720
 example many games are on the mobile 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.540
 I do not like them because it is that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.260
 impossible to play the games with the mobile 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.170
 So, good, let rubÃ©n speak 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.540
 apart this console as a promotion carries 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.070
 you can take and download all the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.350
 demos of the eggs that there are 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.360
 available that are hundreds and you can 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.330
 play totally free during 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.700
 for a limited time you already know that 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.760
 you already know that android and a lot 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.110
 of games that are free and then 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.730
 all those games are what we can 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.070
 download them and from those of payment 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.560
 also and what advantage does it have then that 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.980
 free games have a have the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.950
 demo that we can use it of all that we 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.830
 like well then we buy the version 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.810
 original version that we do not like so 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.310
 we do not buy it exact and the game more 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.690
 expensive on android right now 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.030
 also do not put the box here 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.430
 and then lighter it seems to me that they are 15 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.440
 vouchers and then we can play in 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:25.130
 the definition at 1080p and good taking out 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.970
 see what we get this console is worth about 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.550
 90 euros from 90 to 100 euros more here 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.370
 has come almost free because being 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.650
 partners of this well with the card 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.260
 we had points and apart carrying two 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.290
 games the truth is that it has come out 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.250
 by 2020 and a few euros well then here 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.510
 we have the console that is here for 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.190
 connect to internet cable hdmi and a usb 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.410
 I do not know what the fuck is for but good 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.760
 but it will take it the boy gave it to stop 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.060
 I do not know what it is for, but for something 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.010
 will take then is very simple the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:07.730
 most imposed console 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:13.250
 thank you how small the tour 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:16.130
 Well, it does not go there because the letters are not going 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.739
 to the screws down so it's true 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.570
 it is reason that it has and two of the legs 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.370
 those good 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:32.740
 here we have the command that is a bit 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:35.000
 orthopedic pretty between the xbox and the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.199
 but hey he wanted here makes 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.199
 acquired here to zero 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.370
 I wanted to do something and it has 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.370
 remained the thing then what you see 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:53.260
 quite seems quite uncomfortable in addition 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.260
 carries batteries 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.819
 well I did not like the controls to 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.979
 rows because I always forgot to 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.160
 buy every time with the mother wii 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.160

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.440
 here we have the cable d 

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:19.819
 and forgive for the cough but if I ask for the 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:21.439
 good throat and here we have the cable 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.469
 hdmi looks at least incorporates it to 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:26.599
 HDMI cable 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:29.479
 you do not have to buy hdmi cable and nothing 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.219
 a very simple booklet that like no 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.039
 Well, it does not come in Spanish because of the box 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:39.409
 Well, these lenses all birth plastic or 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:42.349

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.490
 variable although it is some video of the 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.500
 camera so you can see the interface or 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.110

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.509
