00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
use PRP this is platelet-rich plasma

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.980 
use PRP this is platelet-rich plasma
right<00:00:13.920> here<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.389> take<00:00:15.540> some<00:00:15.809> blood

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
right here and we just take some blood
