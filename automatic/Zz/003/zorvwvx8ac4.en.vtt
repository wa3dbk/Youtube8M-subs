you're<00:00:05.490> gonna<00:00:05.580> take<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.910> nail<00:00:06.710> through<00:00:08.840> each<00:00:09.840> of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
you're gonna take a nail through each of

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.280 
you're gonna take a nail through each of
the<00:00:10.320> sides<00:00:10.590> there<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.809> ease<00:00:12.990> with<00:00:13.019> which

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
the sides there and the ease with which

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.589 
the sides there and the ease with which
these<00:00:13.679> nails<00:00:14.009> are<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.519> in<00:00:14.670> suggested<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.480> me

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
these nails are going in suggested to me

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.300 
these nails are going in suggested to me
that<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.780> used<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.199> drill<00:00:16.410> bit<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
that I used a drill bit that was just a

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.580 
that I used a drill bit that was just a
tiny<00:00:17.550> bit<00:00:17.850> too<00:00:18.090> big<00:00:19.670> but<00:00:20.869> two<00:00:21.869> things<00:00:22.140> I'd<00:00:22.380> add

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
tiny bit too big but two things I'd add

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.859 
tiny bit too big but two things I'd add
here<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:25.369> boxes<00:00:26.660> are<00:00:27.660> not

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
here one is that the the boxes are not

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.620 
here one is that the the boxes are not
laterally<00:00:28.560> torqued<00:00:28.980> very<00:00:29.939> much<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
laterally torqued very much in the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
laterally torqued very much in the
course<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.050> most<00:00:31.289> beekeeping<00:00:33.980> so<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.130> very

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
course of most beekeeping so it's very

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
course of most beekeeping so it's very
where<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> rare<00:00:35.969> for<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.450> these<00:00:36.540> joints<00:00:36.840> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
where it rare for one of these joints to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.869 
where it rare for one of these joints to
come<00:00:37.290> undone<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.910> second<00:00:39.690> you'll<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:41.670> bulk

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
come undone and second you'll the bulk

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.049 
come undone and second you'll the bulk
of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> lifting<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.660> done<00:00:42.690> again<00:00:43.170> by<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.410> glue

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
of the lifting is done again by the glue

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
of the lifting is done again by the glue
okay<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.899> you're<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.200> wipe<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> joint

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
okay so you're going to wipe that joint

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.819 
okay so you're going to wipe that joint
off<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.059> you'll<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.260> nice<00:00:49.469> tight

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
off and you'll see you have a nice tight

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.520 
off and you'll see you have a nice tight
joint<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.780> sometimes<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.140> glue<00:00:52.379> on

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
joint there sometimes you have glue on

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.330 
joint there sometimes you have glue on
the<00:00:52.649> inside<00:00:53.000> wipe<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.239> down<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the inside wipe that down and you have a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.330 
the inside wipe that down and you have a
nice<00:00:56.520> tight<00:00:56.820> joint<00:00:57.710> let<00:00:58.710> me<00:00:58.800> shift<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
nice tight joint let me shift now to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.469 
nice tight joint let me shift now to
putting<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.149> joint<00:01:00.420> together<00:01:01.370> with<00:01:05.090> with<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
putting a joint together with with a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.700 
putting a joint together with with a
screw<00:01:06.960> you'll<00:01:07.260> need<00:01:09.080> I'm<00:01:10.080> using<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.650> drill

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
screw you'll need I'm using my drill

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.149 
screw you'll need I'm using my drill
here<00:01:14.150> some<00:01:15.150> folks<00:01:16.020> prefer<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.740> screw<00:01:17.009> them

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
here some folks prefer to screw them

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.890 
here some folks prefer to screw them
together<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.640> arguably<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.479> stronger

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
together and arguably that's a stronger

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.749 
together and arguably that's a stronger
joint<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.380> again<00:01:19.619> I'm<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.189> sure<00:01:20.580> it's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
joint but again I'm not sure it's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.240 
joint but again I'm not sure it's
terribly<00:01:21.240> critical<00:01:21.470> there's<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.680> lots<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
terribly critical there's not lots of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.749 
terribly critical there's not lots of
torque<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.790> these<00:01:24.979> boxes<00:01:25.979> laterally<00:01:26.520> unless

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
torque on these boxes laterally unless

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.899 
torque on these boxes laterally unless
you<00:01:26.909> drop<00:01:27.150> them<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:27.509> you're<00:01:27.659> full<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> honey

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
you drop them when you're full of honey

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.950 
you drop them when you're full of honey
the<00:01:29.909> screws<00:01:30.210> you're<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> use

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the screws you're going to want to use

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
the screws you're going to want to use
is<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> very<00:01:31.950> thin<00:01:32.310> drywall<00:01:32.880> screw<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
is like a very thin drywall screw and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.679 
is like a very thin drywall screw and
the<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.799> link<00:01:35.040> should<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.310> about<00:01:35.670> 1<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> 3/4

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the the link should be about 1 and 3/4

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
the the link should be about 1 and 3/4
inch<00:01:36.900> these<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.320> these<00:01:37.560> happen<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.250> in

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
inch these are these happen to be one in

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.719 
inch these are these happen to be one in
five<00:01:38.610> eighths<00:01:38.880> inch<00:01:42.049> and<00:01:43.049> again<00:01:43.640> we're<00:01:44.640> gonna

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
five eighths inch and again we're gonna

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
five eighths inch and again we're gonna
make<00:01:44.970> sure<00:01:45.000> first<00:01:45.750> step<00:01:45.990> making<00:01:46.259> sure<00:01:46.439> our

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
make sure first step making sure our

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.050 
make sure first step making sure our
handles<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.520> pointing<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> same

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
handles are pointing in the same

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.910 
handles are pointing in the same
direction<00:01:49.909> lining<00:01:50.909> them<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.460> providing<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
direction lining them up and providing a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.260 
direction lining them up and providing a
healthy<00:01:55.920> dose<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.399> tight<00:01:56.670> bond<00:01:56.909> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 

obviously<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.390> more<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.690> do<00:02:04.870> this<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.170> more

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
obviously the more you do this the more

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.890 
obviously the more you do this the more
you<00:02:06.640> get<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.030> place<00:02:07.150> where<00:02:07.480> this<00:02:07.600> flows

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
you get to the place where this flows

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.570 
you get to the place where this flows
pretty<00:02:08.170> quickly<00:02:10.710> I'm<00:02:11.710> spreading<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.280> tight

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
pretty quickly I'm spreading that tight

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.810 
pretty quickly I'm spreading that tight
bond<00:02:12.850> out<00:02:13.090> so<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:14.310> provides<00:02:15.310> an<00:02:15.520> even

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
bond out so that it's a provides an even

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.880 
bond out so that it's a provides an even
contact<00:02:16.510> or<00:02:16.750> even<00:02:17.020> seal<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:22.410> I'm<00:02:23.410> gonna<00:02:23.590> try

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
contact or even seal and I'm gonna try

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.620 
contact or even seal and I'm gonna try
to<00:02:23.950> do<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> little<00:02:24.430> bit<00:02:24.610> better<00:02:24.760> job<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.060> seating

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
to do a little bit better job of seating

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.430 
to do a little bit better job of seating
that<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:31.090> do<00:02:31.240> want<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.540> try<00:02:31.720> not<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.930> get<00:02:32.200> too

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
that you do want to try not to get too

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.560 
that you do want to try not to get too
much<00:02:32.620> glue<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.370> side<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.820> box<00:02:34.060> because

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
much glue on the side of the box because

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.990 
much glue on the side of the box because
that<00:02:34.810> will<00:02:35.709> be<00:02:35.890> make<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.250> more<00:02:36.520> difficult<00:02:36.670> for

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
that will be make it more difficult for

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.670 
that will be make it more difficult for
you<00:02:37.270> when<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.959> get<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.350> point<00:02:38.590> of

you when you get to the point of

of the boards if that occurs you want to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.730 
of the boards if that occurs you want to
throw<00:03:00.760> some<00:03:00.970> glue<00:03:01.180> down<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.690> crack<00:03:02.020> and

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
I don't think that causes much harm you

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.660 
I don't think that causes much harm you
really<00:03:54.280> don't<00:03:54.490> need<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.700> put<00:03:55.000> more<00:03:55.210> than<00:03:56.670> two

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
really don't need to put more than two

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.320 
really don't need to put more than two
to<00:03:57.940> three<00:04:00.180> screws<00:04:01.180> from<00:04:01.480> any<00:04:01.630> one<00:04:01.840> side<00:04:03.330> this

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
to three screws from any one side this

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:11.940 
to three screws from any one side this
creating<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:05.110> very<00:04:05.920> sturdy<00:04:06.630> bond<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:10.950> leaving

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
creating a very sturdy bond and leaving

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.229 
creating a very sturdy bond and leaving
you<00:04:12.070> with<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.720> very<00:04:13.720> strong<00:04:14.110> box<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:15.820> have

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
you with a very strong box so you have

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.270 
you with a very strong box so you have
two<00:04:16.450> choices<00:04:16.690> here<00:04:16.989> you've<00:04:17.350> got<00:04:17.560> nailing<00:04:18.040> and

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
two choices here you've got nailing and

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.370 
two choices here you've got nailing and
screwing<00:04:18.700> either<00:04:19.300> will<00:04:19.630> work<00:04:19.840> just<00:04:19.870> fine<00:04:20.200> and

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
screwing either will work just fine and

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.930 
screwing either will work just fine and
I'm<00:04:20.650> sure<00:04:20.860> you<00:04:21.010> leave<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.489> with<00:04:21.670> a<00:04:21.700> very

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.060 

so<00:04:29.240> you've<00:04:29.420> assembled<00:04:29.780> your<00:04:30.080> box<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.650> you've

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
so you've assembled your box and you've

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.930 
so you've assembled your box and you've
got<00:04:31.250> all<00:04:31.400> four<00:04:31.670> of<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.970> angles<00:04:32.380> both<00:04:33.940> glued

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
got all four of the angles both glued

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.550 
got all four of the angles both glued
and<00:04:35.300> either<00:04:35.540> nailed<00:04:35.870> or<00:04:36.110> screwed<00:04:36.140> together

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
and either nailed or screwed together

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.590 
and either nailed or screwed together
you<00:04:37.310> have<00:04:37.430> one<00:04:37.640> more<00:04:37.820> step<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.650> is<00:04:40.600> to

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
you have one more step and that is to

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.360 
you have one more step and that is to
reach<00:04:41.750> in<00:04:41.960> your<00:04:42.140> toolbox<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:44.180> get<00:04:44.480> a<00:04:44.510> square

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
reach in your toolbox and get a square

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.900 
reach in your toolbox and get a square
this<00:04:46.370> is<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.610> simple<00:04:47.060> plastic<00:04:47.600> square<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:49.370> you

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
this is a simple plastic square and you

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.670 
this is a simple plastic square and you
want<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.210> make<00:04:50.360> sure<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.110> edge<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.560> the

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
want to make sure that the edge of the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.440 
want to make sure that the edge of the
box<00:04:52.120> is<00:04:53.590> square<00:04:54.590> now<00:04:55.520> if<00:04:55.790> you've<00:04:55.940> got<00:04:56.180> two<00:04:56.420> of

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
box is square now if you've got two of

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.350 
box is square now if you've got two of
the<00:04:56.690> angles<00:04:57.020> two<00:04:57.290> or<00:04:57.410> three<00:04:57.620> of<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:57.860> angles

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
the angles two or three of the angles

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.290 
the angles two or three of the angles
square<00:04:59.360> you're<00:05:00.140> doing<00:05:00.440> well<00:05:00.910> if<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.180> a

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
square you're doing well if it's a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.810 
square you're doing well if it's a
little<00:05:02.510> bit<00:05:02.660> off<00:05:02.840> square<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:04.370> way<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.550> fix

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
little bit off square the way to fix

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.610 
little bit off square the way to fix
that<00:05:05.090> is<00:05:05.990> just<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.440> take<00:05:06.620> it<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.690> wrap<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.960> and

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
that is just to take it and wrap it and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.870 
that is just to take it and wrap it and
often<00:05:10.250> that's<00:05:10.430> enough<00:05:10.760> to<00:05:11.290> bring<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.440> back

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
often that's enough to bring it back

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.140 
often that's enough to bring it back
true<00:05:14.560> this<00:05:15.560> box<00:05:15.860> is<00:05:16.130> square<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.670> other<00:05:16.940> way<00:05:17.090> to

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
true this box is square the other way to

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.020 
true this box is square the other way to
do<00:05:17.390> that<00:05:17.570> by<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.810> way<00:05:17.990> is<00:05:18.200> to<00:05:18.350> take<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.590> ruler

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
do that by the way is to take a ruler

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.490 
do that by the way is to take a ruler
and<00:05:20.030> run<00:05:20.240> it<00:05:20.390> corner<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:20.900> corner<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.290> you'll

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
and run it corner to corner and you'll

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.800 
and run it corner to corner and you'll
need<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:21.680> be<00:05:21.860> fairly<00:05:22.130> exact<00:05:22.580> with<00:05:22.820> that<00:05:23.000> and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
need to be fairly exact with that and

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.330 
need to be fairly exact with that and
then<00:05:24.080> make<00:05:24.440> sure<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:24.800> have<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:25.100> same

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
then make sure you have the same

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.150 
then make sure you have the same
measurement<00:05:25.760> corner<00:05:26.210> to<00:05:26.360> corner<00:05:26.600> here<00:05:27.160> you

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
measurement corner to corner here you

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.880 
measurement corner to corner here you
have<00:05:28.310> a<00:05:28.340> box<00:05:28.610> that's<00:05:28.910> ready<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.270> ready<00:05:30.170> to<00:05:30.260> go

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
have a box that's ready to ready to go

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.820 
have a box that's ready to ready to go
whether<00:05:31.340> you're<00:05:31.550> going<00:05:31.640> to<00:05:31.730> stain<00:05:32.030> or<00:05:32.270> paint

and put bees in it and they'll be very
happy<00:05:36.260> with<00:05:36.470> that<00:05:39.010> so<00:05:40.010> now<00:05:40.310> assuming<00:05:40.850> that
