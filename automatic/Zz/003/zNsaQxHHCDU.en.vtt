00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
about 100 patients we have done the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.100 
about 100 patients we have done the
innocent<00:01:43.080> operation<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.860> about<00:01:44.190> 13<00:01:44.729> patients

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
innocent operation in about 13 patients

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.410 
innocent operation in about 13 patients
we<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.320> been<00:01:46.640> extremely<00:01:47.640> impressed<00:01:48.030> with

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
we have been extremely impressed with

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
we have been extremely impressed with
both<00:01:48.690> treatments<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.619> abramson

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
both treatments and so the abramson

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.410 
both treatments and so the abramson
operation<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.300> is<00:01:54.690> moving<00:01:55.289> into<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
operation I think is is moving into a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.620 
operation I think is is moving into a
position<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:58.320> being<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:59.160> standard<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.180> widely

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
position of being a standard and widely

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:10.050 
position of being a standard and widely
accepted<00:02:01.050> therapy
