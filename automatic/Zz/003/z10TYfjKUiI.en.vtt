00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
handlebar like I do right here it's

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.600 
handlebar like I do right here it's
really<00:00:20.410> easy<00:00:20.529> to<00:00:20.710> put<00:00:20.860> it<00:00:20.980> on<00:00:21.040> if<00:00:21.310> you<00:00:21.430> have<00:00:21.580> the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
really easy to put it on if you have the

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.609 
really easy to put it on if you have the
handlebar<00:00:22.210> it's<00:00:22.450> much<00:00:22.630> easy<00:00:22.990> just<00:00:23.349> you<00:00:23.500> know

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
handlebar it's much easy just you know

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.220 
handlebar it's much easy just you know
places<00:00:24.369> we're<00:00:24.669> supposed<00:00:25.000> to<00:00:25.029> go<00:00:25.240> you<00:00:25.990> should

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
places we're supposed to go you should

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.600 
places we're supposed to go you should
the<00:00:26.349> line<00:00:26.560> itself<00:00:26.950> you<00:00:27.220> know<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.460> little

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
the line itself you know the little

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.910 
the line itself you know the little
clips<00:00:27.880> right<00:00:28.029> here<00:00:28.289> show<00:00:29.289> line<00:00:29.529> itself<00:00:29.800> right

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
clips right here show line itself right

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.369 
clips right here show line itself right
into<00:00:30.070> the<00:00:30.160> holes<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:31.720> you<00:00:31.810> express<00:00:32.140> it<00:00:32.290> in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
into the holes then you express it in

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.520 
into the holes then you express it in
with<00:00:33.010> the<00:00:33.100> handle<00:00:33.519> it's<00:00:34.330> a<00:00:34.510> the<00:00:35.170> trick<00:00:35.379> is<00:00:35.500> to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
with the handle it's a the trick is to

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
with the handle it's a the trick is to
lift<00:00:35.860> analog<00:00:36.580> you<00:00:36.940> know<00:00:37.720> push<00:00:38.440> this<00:00:38.920> part<00:00:39.250> of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
lift analog you know push this part of

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.630 
lift analog you know push this part of
the<00:00:39.730> faceplate<00:00:40.629> down<00:00:41.019> and<00:00:41.769> go<00:00:41.860> underneath<00:00:42.309> the

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
the faceplate down and go underneath the

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
the faceplate down and go underneath the
handlebar<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:46.510> slide<00:00:46.719> it<00:00:46.870> into<00:00:46.989> place

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
handlebar and just slide it into place

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.740 
handlebar and just slide it into place
so<00:00:49.660> first<00:00:49.899> you<00:00:50.079> want<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.320> get<00:00:50.469> two<00:00:50.590> clips<00:00:50.860> in

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so first you want to get two clips in

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.060 
so first you want to get two clips in
and<00:00:52.750> you<00:00:52.840> can<00:00:52.930> get<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.140> bottom<00:00:53.320> side<00:00:53.649> you<00:00:54.010> know

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
and you can get the bottom side you know

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.119 
and you can get the bottom side you know
I'm<00:00:54.280> backside<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:54.969> try<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.210> pushed<00:00:55.539> in<00:00:56.129> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
know that the all these modules there's

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.400 
know that the all these modules there's
connector<00:02:22.569> which<00:02:22.720> connects<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> yeah

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
connector which connects to the yeah

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.750

motherboard<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:26.140> it's<00:02:26.290> very<00:02:26.410> critical

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
motherboard so it's very critical

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.360 
motherboard so it's very critical
connections<00:02:27.760> there<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:29.010> will<00:02:30.010> place<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
connections there I will place the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.510 
connections there I will place the
battery<00:02:31.890> sometimes<00:02:32.890> people<00:02:33.130> would<00:02:33.220> give<00:02:33.370> you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
battery sometimes people would give you

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.580 
battery sometimes people would give you
air<00:02:33.760> five<00:02:34.120> messages<00:02:34.450> up<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.110> try<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.350> put

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
air five messages up to to try to put

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.860 
air five messages up to to try to put
take<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.830> apart<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.280> put<00:02:36.370> together<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:37.660> real

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
take it apart and put together it's real

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.750 
take it apart and put together it's real
simple<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.350> solve<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.340> know<00:02:39.520> if<00:02:39.640> you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
simple to solve that and you know if you

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.300 
simple to solve that and you know if you
had<00:02:39.940> everything<00:02:40.300> working<00:02:40.600> fine<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:42.130> make

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
had everything working fine just make

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.259 
had everything working fine just make

know<00:02:46.330> pulled<00:02:46.630> up<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> little<00:02:47.080> bit<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:48.340> the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
know pulled up a little bit to the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.740 
know pulled up a little bit to the
bottom<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.910> back<00:02:49.090> ones<00:02:49.300> right<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
bottom the back ones right here the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.380 
bottom the back ones right here the
smaller<00:02:50.019> ones<00:02:50.290> are<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.970> four<00:02:51.970> temperature

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
smaller ones are the four temperature

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.680 
smaller ones are the four temperature
and<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.950> big<00:02:54.130> ones<00:02:54.280> are<00:02:54.370> for<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.640> battery<00:02:54.970> so

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
and the big ones are for the battery so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.690 
and the big ones are for the battery so
sometimes<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.290> temperature<00:02:56.650> wants<00:02:57.100> bent<00:02:57.580> a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
sometimes the temperature wants bent a

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.479 
sometimes the temperature wants bent a
