00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 We have just got three o'clock in the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.639
 Of course, the whole night has one too 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.769
 colt and that was before sascha and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.940
 we have video was originally shot 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.160
 planned that we turn 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.529
 sascha arises ask the talks 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.690
 sascha asked choice questions are there 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.430
 reply 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.670
 so it was then in the end only 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.949
 then during the cutting we know 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.449
 just noticed that the video and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.969
 i know sounds weird to mine 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.850
 conditions are not so cool 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.070
 But I have to honestly say that intro 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.340
 has become good for my circumstances 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.289
 and it then informs you about that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.010
 from you know these topics moment if 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.629
 her the tip used just 15 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 I do not want to hit my face because I do not 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.770
 stepped on facebook on the sack goes like this 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.170
 do and then came already more or 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.289
 less the first one I ask for 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.239
 my ratios say 40 well 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.060
 answers consumer for my 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.540
 conditions no longer answer 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 given 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.670
 get the first episode and I want now 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.400
 not even say that somehow then 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.720
 even the second question a bit 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.140
 personal but was not injured 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.049
 Sting is just that youtuber like me 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.740
 on such questions 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.270
 maximum 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.340
 I would answer professionally now 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.799
 Almost say and that's about it 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.580
 now puts cloud is very important that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.350
 you ill imagine that 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.350
 Imagine you drive the most expensive 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.630
 porsche on the world ins gives and you 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.420
 Put him against the wall now 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.420
 with 100 last 200 be 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.000
 I do not know if the problem with 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.520
 such videos question and videos is 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.440
 that will be her soon 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.789
 questions came or came from sascha questions 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.759
 so it can be said that they are not 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.229
 but people are interested in the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.810
 somehow nobody cares about being interested 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.700
 can imagine a song on 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.069
 his youtube channel have not the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.000
 fall in spite of such fucking questions at all 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.920
 no way 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.410
 can irritate the question is just whether 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.480
 I would be ideal then yes that is true 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.480
 is he can not safely 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.680
 logical it would be nice and instant too 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.470
 measure and the question is just when he 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.239
 That's what made everything or nothing 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.590
 In the end , their porcelain are the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.530
 next election for example like it then 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.599
 really interesting and there have 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.910
 I also try so serious 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.620
 they really ask too 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.390
 answer which movie could you get 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:01.739
 sport sponsoring in the future 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:04.450
 we imagine for one of our other 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.190
 vodka gorbachev so I try too 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.120
 To be a role model is already next year 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.890
 Sascha has been friends for some time already 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:18.190
 actually knows me already 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:20.530
 several years relatively good and sascha 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.390
 then stop and ask questions now 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:29.459
 for me a light are what on average 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.459
 with a high school diploma if the ad tour have 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.340
 in other words what you never doing right now 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.740
 live to see the youtube from 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.070
 education study you have your own car 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.330
 or firmly in Rome but also the questions 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.480
 I then have as a first class youtuber 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.220
 relatively well answered there 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.570
 Of course, then also moments in such 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.460
 row videos or in such recordings 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.250
 neither sascha asks nor me 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:20.799
 answer that gives you then approximately like that 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:25.390
 from and of course such a question 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.970
 answer video not the future planning 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.730
 missing say the question where it somehow 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.770
 something that goes in the future he 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.950
 then sascha also relatively precise 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.720
 where do you see yourself in five years 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.390
 and now I'm just one I go 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:48.010
 here and I give to such precise 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:49.360
 ask relatively I want to such 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.460
 I'll give you well and ask later 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.660
 I would like to have a precise answer 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.120
 In five years, not in front of the camera 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.250
 with a date that we imagined 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.840
 that I now have the sister and so on 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.080
 approximately then sees a highest 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.490
 professional question answer video 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.230
 I do not want to say that now 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.760
 video that somehow had the feeling 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:13.660
 I uploaded the Sun is shit 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:17.850
 but sascha if you shit that 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.850
 become good 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.360
 I do not own it now either 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:32.230
 I actually say goodbye 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:37.650
 we never have 313 there now either 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.650
 then lunch would be
