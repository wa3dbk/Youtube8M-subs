00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
other base over here which I are the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.170 
other base over here which I are the
people<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.500> have<00:00:23.039> their<00:00:23.340> teammate<00:00:23.699> captured

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
people that have their teammate captured

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.779 
people that have their teammate captured
this<00:00:24.960> team<00:00:25.260> has<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.130> run<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> other

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this team has to go and run to the other

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.730 
this team has to go and run to the other
base<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.359> take<00:00:27.660> their<00:00:27.840> teammate<00:00:28.199> back<00:00:28.410> who<00:00:28.619> is

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
base to take their teammate back who is

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980 
base to take their teammate back who is
trapped<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.189> opposite<00:00:29.699> base<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.300> it's

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
trapped in the opposite base and it's

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.569 
trapped in the opposite base and it's
kind<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.349> complicated<00:00:31.500> process<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.309> i'll

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
kind of a complicated process but i'll

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.729 
kind of a complicated process but i'll
show<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.759> some<00:00:32.910> gameplay<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.270> my<00:00:33.480> own<00:00:33.739> because

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
show you some gameplay of my own because

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.170 
show you some gameplay of my own because
I<00:00:34.890> think<00:00:35.040> it'll<00:00:35.309> make<00:00:35.460> more<00:00:35.640> sense<00:00:35.700> once<00:00:36.030> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
I think it'll make more sense once you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.660 
I think it'll make more sense once you
watch<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> gameplay<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:36.960> yeah<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.160> whole

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
watch the gameplay so yeah this whole

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.069 
watch the gameplay so yeah this whole
game<00:00:38.879> type<00:00:39.149> counter<00:00:39.390> revolves<00:00:39.690> around<00:00:39.780> one

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
game type counter revolves around one

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
game type counter revolves around one
team<00:00:40.320> trying<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.100> their<00:00:41.520> teammate

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
team trying to go and get their teammate

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
from the other base and the other base

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.170 
from the other base and the other base
has<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> team<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:44.399> trying<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.670> guard<00:00:44.879> their

has a team that's trying to guard their
base<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> make<00:00:46.350> sure<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> other<00:00:46.860> team

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
base and make sure that the other team

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.560 
base and make sure that the other team
doesn't<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> hostage<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.360> the

different<00:00:54.989> rounds<00:00:55.410> i<00:00:55.559> don't<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.800> i<00:00:55.829> really

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
different rounds i don't know i really

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.380 
different rounds i don't know i really
enjoyed<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.399> quite<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:56.760> i<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:56.969> it'd<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
enjoyed it quite a bit i think it'd be a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
enjoyed it quite a bit i think it'd be a
lot<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.570> fun<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.079> multiple<00:00:58.500> people<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.980> my

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
lot more fun with multiple people and my

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.040 
lot more fun with multiple people and my
multiple<00:00:59.399> i<00:00:59.460> mean<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.789> over<00:01:00.180> eight<00:01:00.420> or<00:01:00.719> ten<00:01:01.020> i

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
multiple i mean like over eight or ten i

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.139 
multiple i mean like over eight or ten i
would<00:01:01.289> say<00:01:01.440> eight<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.100> 16<00:01:02.579> people<00:01:03.030> would

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
would say eight to like 16 people would

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
would say eight to like 16 people would
be<00:01:03.270> probably<00:01:04.110> optimal<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.010> game<00:01:05.189> type<00:01:05.460> i

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
be probably optimal for this game type i

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.670 
be probably optimal for this game type i
I<00:01:05.790> enjoyed<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.570> lot<00:01:06.600> i<00:01:06.750> only<00:01:07.229> played<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.560> like

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
I enjoyed a lot i only played with like

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
I enjoyed a lot i only played with like
four<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> six<00:01:08.280> people<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:09.270> now<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.600> game

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
four to six people right now in the game

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.149 
four to six people right now in the game
plan<00:01:09.930> i'm<00:01:10.049> only<00:01:10.170> playing<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.560> four<00:01:10.830> people

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
plan i'm only playing with four people

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.859 
plan i'm only playing with four people
but<00:01:11.369> i<00:01:11.610> still<00:01:12.060> enjoyed<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.570> i<00:01:12.600> still<00:01:12.750> think

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
but i still enjoyed and i still think

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.149 
but i still enjoyed and i still think
it's<00:01:13.020> kind<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> interesting<00:01:13.439> i<00:01:13.710> think<00:01:13.979> it's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it's kind of interesting i think it's

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's kind of interesting i think it's
just<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.720> think<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.080> more<00:01:16.229> fun<00:01:16.259> with

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
just I think it's just more fun with

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
just I think it's just more fun with
more<00:01:16.680> people<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.310> makes<00:01:17.520> sense<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.000> yeah

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
more people if that makes sense so yeah

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.330 
more people if that makes sense so yeah
my<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:18.990> complaint<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.070> whole

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
my only complaint about this whole

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
my only complaint about this whole
custom<00:01:20.909> game<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.240> general<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> fact<00:01:22.020> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
custom game in general is the fact that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.560 
custom game in general is the fact that
the<00:01:22.439> spawns<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:23.490> quick<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:24.000> Slayer

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the spawns are really quick there Slayer

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.929 
the spawns are really quick there Slayer
spawns<00:01:24.990> instead<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.439> objective<00:01:25.920> spawns<00:01:26.189> which

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
spawns instead of objective spawns which

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.580 
spawns instead of objective spawns which
basically<00:01:27.299> means<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.140> people<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.560> are

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
basically means that the people that are

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
basically means that the people that are
defending<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.340> spawn<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:29.880> away<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
defending can spawn right away and that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.109 
defending can spawn right away and that
can<00:01:30.900> kill<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.200> basically<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.090> is

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
can kill you basically so I think it is

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.819 
can kill you basically so I think it is
a<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.420> bit<00:01:33.600> easier<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> capture<00:01:34.290> their<00:01:34.619> not

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
a little bit easier to capture their not

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.440 
a little bit easier to capture their not
to<00:01:35.009> capture<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> fender<00:01:35.909> guy<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.360> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
to capture to the fender guy that it is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.630 
to capture to the fender guy that it is
to<00:01:36.540> capture<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.079> think<00:01:37.650> an<00:01:37.770> easy<00:01:37.950> fix<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
to capture I think an easy fix for that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.060 
to capture I think an easy fix for that
would<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.780> make<00:01:40.200> an<00:01:40.350> objective<00:01:40.799> spawn

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
would be to just make an objective spawn

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
would be to just make an objective spawn
so<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> team<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.210> defending<00:01:42.509> would<00:01:42.930> you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
so the team that was defending would you

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.080 
so the team that was defending would you
know<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.530> spawn<00:01:43.920> right<00:01:44.189> away<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.880> team

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
know not spawn right away so the team

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.060 
know not spawn right away so the team
that<00:01:45.240> was<00:01:45.390> trying<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> rescue<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.680> hostage

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
that was trying to rescue the hostage

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.340 
that was trying to rescue the hostage
will<00:01:47.250> be<00:01:47.340> able<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.350> besides

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
will be able to get in there but besides

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
will be able to get in there but besides
that<00:01:49.470> slight<00:01:49.799> spawning<00:01:50.130> complaint<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.700> really

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that slight spawning complaint I really

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.249 
that slight spawning complaint I really
think<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.270> actually<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> really<00:01:51.810> fun<00:01:52.079> game

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
think this is actually a really fun game

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.990 
think this is actually a really fun game
type<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.619> would<00:01:52.710> love<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.430> big

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
type I would love to see it in like big

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.520 
type I would love to see it in like big
team<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.570> action<00:01:54.899> Zach<00:01:55.079> or<00:01:55.229> something<00:01:55.439> like

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
team or action Zach or something like

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.109 
team or action Zach or something like
that<00:01:55.590> even<00:01:55.890> online<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.939> could

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that even online like I think this could

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.730 
that even online like I think this could
actually<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.600> an<00:01:57.810> online<00:01:57.930> game<00:01:58.290> type<00:01:58.530> that's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
actually be an online game type that's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.350 
actually be an online game type that's
how<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:59.040> fun<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.430> but<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.180> definitely

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
how much fun it is but it's definitely

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.179 
how much fun it is but it's definitely
you<00:02:00.780> know<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.079> great<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.619> custom<00:02:01.979> games

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you know it's great here in custom games

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.620 
you know it's great here in custom games
i'm<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.460> saying<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> has<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.450> online

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
i'm not saying that it has to be online

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.149 
i'm not saying that it has to be online
but<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.229> still<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.409> great<00:02:04.530> game<00:02:04.740> type<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
but it's still a great game type and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.160 
but it's still a great game type and
it's<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.460> think<00:02:06.030> 343<00:02:06.570> could<00:02:06.750> should<00:02:06.840> check<00:02:07.049> it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
it's I think 343 could should check it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.300 
it's I think 343 could should check it
out<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.680> better<00:02:07.829> than<00:02:08.009> some<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
out I think it's better than some of the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
out I think it's better than some of the
other<00:02:08.429> game<00:02:08.580> types<00:02:08.789> I'm<00:02:08.970> play<00:02:09.149> online<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.750> yeah
