00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to all dear subscribers and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.480
 my channel viewers my name is sergey and 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.540
 if you znach inspection time has come 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.150
 for the next review of the mod for Skyrim 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.429
 today's mod adds a whole 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.740
 flying city where we are 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.810
 go up on this hardly short 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.449
 Shor ladder let's consider where he is 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.340
 is here here here it is called 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 homework let's do that in any 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.410
 the case is essentially where we carry it 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.010
 accommodate leading pride 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.010
 stairs so ladder 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.270
 sort of came 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.420
 actually perfume 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.580
 in fact, we can not scheme here 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.950
 chat because the mod is on 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.910
 alpha stage 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.740
 version 0.2 is so but nonetheless 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.690
 worth the frustration I think when not 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.250
 It will be the year the author hope is not made due to 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.050
 the fact that too much want 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.630
 attach from work think for flying 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.700
 the city and it is here that seems to be changing 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.540
 the city is actually warm here by 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.130
 add your cross something your year and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.430
 this city also has one very 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.530
 big winter feature 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.720
 the visibility of the word I do not know whether these 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.590
 stones wrong pro textured 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.560
 either something else that's the best thing or 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.790
 can auto write off added anyway 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.310
 and the authorities ask and drakosha drakosha somewhere 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.830
 which does not touch us exactly peaceful 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.259
 dragon I do not know why we do not 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.229
 touches but meanwhile the creak gave him 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.790
 good and i'm grateful that us pipe from 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.979
 we are here an empty place to put and for 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.140
 what people who can not be delivered there 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.509
 talk there still from home drakosh flies 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.830
 the world did not think that he should throw 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.960
 on such and such and even more so with them 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.319
 It can be a lot a lot of things to do and different 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.990
 I do not know I hope that 2 will not abandon though 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.819
 in fact since time on version 02 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.950
 it's been a very long time and 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.300
 looking for this mod appeared when there were first 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.220

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.500
 cast unfortunately well anyway 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.930

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.030

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.530
 mod with volume here already that its author is not 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.090
 abandoned no just colossal work 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.470
 which they do not in one month and 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:02.110
 not for two I think in general if yes damn 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.120
 there is an author from tapes each for a long time 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.070
 somehow looks like a bank wrapped 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.560
