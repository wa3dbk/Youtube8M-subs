00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.889 
you reload so if your gun has 30 bullets
you<00:00:56.370> shoot<00:00:56.610> ten<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.120> kill<00:00:57.270> someone<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:57.840> you

you shoot ten and kill someone then you

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
have 20 left in that clip and you reload

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.880 
have 20 left in that clip and you reload
and<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.239> lose<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.660> 20<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.379> ammo<00:01:01.680> count

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and you lose that 20 so your ammo count

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.979 
and you lose that 20 so your ammo count
drops<00:01:02.160> pretty<00:01:02.399> fast<00:01:02.730> which<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.480> why<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> pretty

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
drops pretty fast which is why I pretty

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
drops pretty fast which is why I pretty
much<00:01:04.080> always<00:01:04.439> run<00:01:04.710> scavenger<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.339> every<00:01:05.670> class

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
much always run scavenger on every class

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.140 
much always run scavenger on every class
now<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.960> let's<00:01:07.500> talk<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:07.830> how<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> KF<00:01:08.909> 5

plays<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.900> close<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.380> mid-range<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
plays from close to mid-range it is a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.760 
plays from close to mid-range it is a
beast<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.570> gun<00:01:12.780> sounds<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.380> good<00:01:13.560> when

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
beast and this gun sounds so good when

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
if someone is long-range but they aren't

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
if someone is long-range but they aren't
focused<00:01:18.570> at<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.590> take<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:19.979> out

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.590 
don't use it on that and sync map map
which<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.040> forest<00:01:32.340> map<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.939> some

which is the the forest map and some
people<00:01:33.900> might<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.650> iron<00:01:34.829> sights<00:01:35.250> on

people might not like the iron sights on

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.130 
people might not like the iron sights on
it<00:01:35.490> although<00:01:36.000> personally<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.570> don't<00:01:36.780> like

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it although personally I don't like

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
it although personally I don't like
using<00:01:37.380> red<00:01:37.710> dot<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> deal<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
using red dot on it so I deal with it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.270 
using red dot on it so I deal with it
sometimes<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.900> slice<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.530> annoying<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
sometimes it slice you get annoying and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.590 
sometimes it slice you get annoying and
it<00:01:41.579> all<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.939> comes<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.420> personal

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it all just comes down to personal

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.870 
it all just comes down to personal
preference<00:01:43.049> anyway<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> class

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
preference anyway so on to the class

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880 
preference anyway so on to the class
setups<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.869> tried<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.530> Griffin

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
setups for it I tried it with a Griffin

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.280 
setups for it I tried it with a Griffin
silencer<00:01:47.520> group<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.060> rapid<00:01:48.450> fire<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:49.229> just

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
silencer group with rapid fire or just

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.469 
silencer group with rapid fire or just
the<00:01:49.920> silencer<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.490> parabolic<00:01:51.000> microphone

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the silencer and parabolic microphone

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.480 
the silencer and parabolic microphone
because<00:01:51.869> everybody<00:01:52.380> uses<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.829> silencer<00:01:53.369> in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
because everybody uses the silencer in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.950 
because everybody uses the silencer in
this<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.880> pretty<00:01:54.060> useful<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.630> worth<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
this so it's pretty useful and worth a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.020 
this so it's pretty useful and worth a
point<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.470> opinion<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.610> group<00:01:56.820> makes

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
point in my opinion and the group makes

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
point in my opinion and the group makes
this<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.329> laser<00:01:57.509> gun<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.200> better<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.560> mid

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
this a laser gun and is better at mid

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
this a laser gun and is better at mid
range<00:01:59.040> gunfights<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.299> don't<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.570> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
range gunfights and you don't have to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.389 
range gunfights and you don't have to
use<00:02:00.840> although<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.380> recommend<00:02:01.860> using<00:02:02.159> it

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
use although I do recommend using it

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.459 
use although I do recommend using it
with<00:02:02.579> rapid<00:02:02.909> fire<00:02:02.939> some<00:02:03.810> people<00:02:03.869> might<00:02:04.290> feel

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
with rapid fire some people might feel

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.350 
with rapid fire some people might feel
like<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.799> too<00:02:05.040> weak<00:02:05.340> silence<00:02:05.880> sometimes<00:02:06.090> I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
like it's too weak silence sometimes I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
like it's too weak silence sometimes I
do<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.170> take<00:02:07.380> off<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.680> silencer

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
do and I just like take off the silencer

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.770 
do and I just like take off the silencer
and<00:02:08.340> slap<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> microphone<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.599> laser

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
and slap on the microphone or a laser

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.420 
and slap on the microphone or a laser
sight<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.410> always<00:02:10.649> changed<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
sight I just always changed it up and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.280 
sight I just always changed it up and
mags<00:02:12.790> really<00:02:13.120> isn't<00:02:13.239> needed<00:02:13.689> on<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.019> because

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
mags really isn't needed on this because

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.959 
mags really isn't needed on this because
it<00:02:14.379> already<00:02:14.500> has<00:02:14.739> 40<00:02:15.129> bullets<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.489> begin<00:02:15.760> with

it already has 40 bullets to begin with

it already has 40 bullets to begin with
extended<00:02:16.750> mags<00:02:16.780> would<00:02:17.170> give<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.379> 60<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.219> it's

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
extended mags would give it 60 and it's

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.209 
extended mags would give it 60 and it's
already<00:02:18.989> has<00:02:19.989> fast<00:02:20.349> reload<00:02:20.709> like<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.010> don't

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219 
already has fast reload like you don't

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.559 
already has fast reload like you don't
need<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.430> dual<00:02:21.760> mag<00:02:21.939> for<00:02:22.239> it

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
need a dual mag for it

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.660 
need a dual mag for it

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
rushing class would be the KF 5 with

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.830 
rushing class would be the KF 5 with
silencer<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.579> whatever<00:02:36.819> other<00:02:37.150> attachments

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.470 
silencer and whatever other attachments
you<00:02:37.930> prefer<00:02:38.290> with<00:02:38.799> lightweight<00:02:39.480> low-profile

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
you prefer with lightweight low-profile

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.899 
you prefer with lightweight low-profile
blast<00:02:41.170> suppressor<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.189> can<00:02:42.430> rush<00:02:42.639> fast

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
blast suppressor so you can rush fast

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.429 
blast suppressor so you can rush fast
while<00:02:43.090> completely<00:02:43.510> staying<00:02:43.840> off<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.139> radar

while completely staying off the radar

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.559

since<00:02:45.189> you're<00:02:45.400> using<00:02:45.549> blast<00:02:45.970> suppressor<00:02:46.120> you

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
since you're using blast suppressor you

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.000 
since you're using blast suppressor you
can<00:02:46.750> only<00:02:46.900> take<00:02:47.169> either<00:02:47.319> scavenger<00:02:47.980> or

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
can only take either scavenger or

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.679 
can only take either scavenger or
toughness<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:48.669> that<00:02:48.819> depends<00:02:49.209> if<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.389> go<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.569> a

toughness so that depends if you go on a

toughness so that depends if you go on a
5<00:02:49.900> plus<00:02:50.109> streak<00:02:50.500> or<00:02:50.680> not<00:02:50.859> so<00:02:51.459> onto<00:02:51.730> the
