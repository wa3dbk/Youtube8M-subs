LM pollute O's figure it and the L and
pluto's<00:02:04.920> um<00:02:05.219> wheel<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.780> yeah<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.439> mean<00:02:07.680> they

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
pluto's um wheel so yeah I mean they

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.490 
pluto's um wheel so yeah I mean they
might<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.729> even<00:02:08.789> give<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.929> governor's

outfit

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.600 
outfit
but<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:12.049> would<00:02:12.230> assume<00:02:12.290> they<00:02:12.590> would<00:02:12.620> because

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
but I would assume they would because

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.490 
but I would assume they would because
what<00:02:13.849> she<00:02:14.000> will<00:02:14.150> still<00:02:14.420> haven't<00:02:14.840> caught<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:15.379> to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
what she will still haven't caught on to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.860 
what she will still haven't caught on to
this<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.549> next<00:02:16.730> thing<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.299> actually

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
this and the next thing is actually

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.740 
this and the next thing is actually
going<00:02:18.409> to<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:19.180> governor's<00:02:20.180> outfit<00:02:20.569> so<00:02:20.690> I

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.100 
do it and all the videos I've seen are
just<00:02:28.579> showing<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.000> off<00:02:29.150> which<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.599> retarded

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
just showing it off which is retarded

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.080 
just showing it off which is retarded
why<00:02:30.290> would<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.560> post<00:02:30.739> up<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:31.010> video<00:02:31.129> sharing<00:02:32.000> it

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
why would you post up a video sharing it

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.300 
why would you post up a video sharing it
off<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.360> not<00:02:32.510> tell<00:02:32.840> people<00:02:33.200> how<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.290> get<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.709> so

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
off and not tell people how to get it so

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.729 
off and not tell people how to get it so
um<00:02:34.670> how<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.540> get<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:35.959> like<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.319> yet<00:02:36.620> to

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
um how to get it is like this yet to

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.990 
um how to get it is like this yet to
find<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.980> social<00:02:37.190> treasure<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.790> what<00:02:37.909> these

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
find a social treasure and what these

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.119 
find a social treasure and what these
are<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:39.110> was<00:02:39.500> thinking<00:02:39.530> they<00:02:39.860> were<00:02:39.920> going<00:02:40.069> to

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
are is I was thinking they were going to

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.710 
are is I was thinking they were going to
be<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.280> super<00:02:40.459> complicated<00:02:40.849> and<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.540> didn't

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
be like super complicated and I didn't

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.740 
be like super complicated and I didn't
understand<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.879> so<00:02:43.879> I'm<00:02:44.000> assuming<00:02:44.540> that

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
understand it and so I'm assuming that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.000 
understand it and so I'm assuming that
other<00:02:45.049> people<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.530> had<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.769> same<00:02:45.950> problem

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
other people have had the same problem

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.589 
other people have had the same problem
because<00:02:46.730> some<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:46.940> these<00:02:47.060> games<00:02:47.299> are<00:02:47.450> pretty

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
because some of these games are pretty

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.460 
because some of these games are pretty
encrypted<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:50.120> mine<00:02:50.599> spawned<00:02:50.989> right<00:02:51.230> here

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
encrypted and so mine spawned right here

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.930 
encrypted and so mine spawned right here
in<00:02:53.920> Castillo<00:02:54.920> de<00:02:55.280> I'm<00:02:55.519> not<00:02:55.670> going<00:02:55.879> to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
in Castillo de I'm not going to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.589 
in Castillo de I'm not going to
pronounce<00:02:56.060> that

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
pronounce that

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.619 
pronounce that
um<00:02:57.549> it's<00:02:58.549> writing<00:02:58.790> on<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.030> map<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.329> I<00:02:59.359> should

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
um it's writing on the map so I should

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.970 
um it's writing on the map so I should
assume<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.840> more<00:03:00.170> um<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:02.780> don't<00:03:03.709> know<00:03:03.769> I

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
assume that more um but I don't know I

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.080 
assume that more um but I don't know I
don't<00:03:04.129> know<00:03:04.310> if<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.519> going<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.730> spawn<00:03:04.940> there

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
don't know if it's going to spawn there
