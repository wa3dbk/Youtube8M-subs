 We samsung galaxy gear in hands 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.000
 had 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.639
 That is a watch that communicates with 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.070
 your smartphone via bluetooth and you see 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.260
 more and more smartwatches of this kind 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.490
 also at this fair and the sony was one of them 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.890
 the first airbag

 at 320 pixels 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.400
 the screen is 1.63 inches so that is 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.470
 fairly small 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.059
 this compares with other ordinary ones 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.400
 more logical than it is quite large and 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.160
 thick watch so with thinner wrists yes 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.199

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.010

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.050

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.760
 signe on you on your watch 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.519

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.290
 missed calls or text messages to 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.390

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.150
 smartwatch 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.940
 so you from that contact list 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.620
 Equal your money if you go with a telephone 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.450

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.820
 against your ear and then the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.680
 environment not with whom you talk to the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.690
 smartwatch is slightly different 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 there you had come from the speakers 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.580
 the sound and the can in principle 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.580
 everyone just that 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.990

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.729
 calling against the wind with that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.150
 telephone or with that 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:59.560
 samsung gear that is nice to have such 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.270
 is a bit disappointing to be honest 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.720
 because there is that strong wind and there is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.390
 but very small speaker and that pier 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.240
 and 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.569
 why you are not so good but became is 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.569
 ok to see you later 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.300
 it currently only works with note 3 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.610
 and with galaxy tab 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.990
 chin point so a bit of a shame 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.880

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.640

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.650
 cooperate but only the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.100

 He worked sold at 299 euros 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.569

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.220
 amount for this gadget and I am whole 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.930
