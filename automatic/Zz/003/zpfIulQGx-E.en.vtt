00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.370 
going to see and then market is as crazy
on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> Olympics<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.600> would<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.840> pretty<00:01:49.049> fun

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
on the Olympics that would be pretty fun

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.429 
on the Olympics that would be pretty fun
to<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.680> them<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to see them do and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.539 

yeah<00:01:53.439> it's<00:01:53.619> it's<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.979> little<00:01:54.189> boring<00:01:54.310> if

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
yeah it's it's a little boring if

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.980 
yeah it's it's a little boring if
they're<00:01:54.700> going<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.880> wait<00:01:55.030> this<00:01:55.329> long<00:01:55.390> but<00:01:55.930> I

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
they're going to wait this long but I

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.569 
they're going to wait this long but I
also<00:01:56.320> think<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.710> could<00:01:56.920> be<00:01:57.070> very<00:01:57.100> clever

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
also think it could be very clever

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.149 
also think it could be very clever
because<00:01:57.909> if<00:01:58.540> they<00:01:58.930> can<00:01:59.200> market<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.560> or<00:01:59.740> not<00:01:59.920> on

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
because if they can market it or not on

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.160 
because if they can market it or not on
the<00:02:00.310> Summer<00:02:00.520> Olympics<00:02:00.640> then<00:02:01.630> they<00:02:01.780> can<00:02:01.960> sell<00:02:02.140> a

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
the Summer Olympics then they can sell a

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.350 
the Summer Olympics then they can sell a
ton<00:02:02.530> of<00:02:02.590> those<00:02:02.950> smartphones<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.820> that<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
ton of those smartphones and that the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.289 
ton of those smartphones and that the

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
of weird with the color balance but that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.379 
of weird with the color balance but that
could<00:03:35.980> be<00:03:36.010> yes<00:03:36.579> because<00:03:36.670> they've<00:03:37.030> added<00:03:37.329> a

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
could be yes because they've added a

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.819 
could be yes because they've added a
filter<00:03:37.720> stuff<00:03:37.870> like<00:03:38.079> that<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.410> pictures

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
filter stuff like that to the pictures

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.789 
filter stuff like that to the pictures
but<00:03:39.760> some<00:03:39.970> pictures<00:03:40.269> look<00:03:40.480> where<00:03:40.840> we<00:03:40.989> r<00:03:41.290> much

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
but some pictures look where we r much

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.250 
but some pictures look where we r much
in<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.130> yellowish<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:43.389> think<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.840> was<00:03:44.200> just

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
in a yellowish and I think it was just

core<00:05:41.380> smart<00:05:42.190> phones<00:05:42.370> until<00:05:43.169> 2013<00:05:44.310> but<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.430> don't

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
core smart phones until 2013 but I don't

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.980 
core smart phones until 2013 but I don't
really<00:05:45.760> think<00:05:45.880> that<00:05:46.090> that's<00:05:46.210> a<00:05:46.480> major<00:05:46.690> issue

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
really think that that's a major issue

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.600 
really think that that's a major issue
because<00:05:47.800> of<00:05:48.250> course<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:50.590> Duke<00:05:50.800> or<00:05:51.130> experience

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
because of course the Duke or experience

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.770 
because of course the Duke or experience
is<00:05:51.790> insanely<00:05:52.750> good<00:05:53.680> right<00:05:54.520> now<00:05:54.669> but<00:05:55.419> of<00:05:55.540> course

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
is insanely good right now but of course

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.260 
is insanely good right now but of course
for<00:05:56.380> course<00:05:56.650> sounds<00:05:56.950> good<00:05:57.280> quad<00:05:57.910> core<00:05:58.150> is<00:05:58.240> a

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
for course sounds good quad core is a

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.690

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
later than last year with s2 that would

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.030 
later than last year with s2 that would
be<00:06:25.760> pretty<00:06:25.970> disappointing<00:06:26.720> and<00:06:27.010> also<00:06:28.010> I

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
be pretty disappointing and also I

be pretty disappointing and also I
really<00:06:28.460> do<00:06:28.550> hope<00:06:28.790> that<00:06:28.850> sounds<00:06:29.480> not<00:06:29.780> waiting

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
really do hope that sounds not waiting

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.040 
really do hope that sounds not waiting
until<00:06:30.560> they<00:06:31.430> get<00:06:31.820> carrier<00:06:32.330> support<00:06:32.780> from<00:06:32.960> the
