00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
hey there's just a very quick video here

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.470 
hey there's just a very quick video here
to<00:00:01.979> show<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.220> some<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.000> changes<00:00:03.149> that<00:00:03.389> are

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
to show you some of the changes that are

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.120 
to show you some of the changes that are
going<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.840> here<00:00:04.020> with<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.200> GFS<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.799> trends

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
going on here with the GFS the trends

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.059 
going on here with the GFS the trends
we're<00:00:05.250> seeing<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:06.029> why<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:06.870> am<00:00:07.379> still<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.710> board

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
we're seeing and why I am still on board

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.610 
we're seeing and why I am still on board
for<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.460> moderate<00:00:09.090> snowfall<00:00:09.719> at<00:00:10.080> least<00:00:10.260> across

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
for a moderate snowfall at least across

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.930 
for a moderate snowfall at least across
the<00:00:10.889> mid-atlantic<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.490> parts<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the mid-atlantic and parts of the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.110 
the mid-atlantic and parts of the
Northeast<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.469> was<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.679> GFS<00:00:14.160> at<00:00:14.400> 0z

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
Northeast and this was the GFS at 0z

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
Northeast and this was the GFS at 0z
last<00:00:15.420> night<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.960> here<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.800> see<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.100> west

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
last night and here you can see out west

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.670 
last night and here you can see out west
we<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:17.910> trough<00:00:18.510> coming<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.109> energy<00:00:19.590> is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we have this trough coming in energy is

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.859 
we have this trough coming in energy is
kind<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.039> sheer<00:00:20.400> doubt<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.180> look<00:00:21.779> at

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
kind of sheer doubt out here look at

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
kind of sheer doubt out here look at
this<00:00:21.990> try<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> orig<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.730> flattens

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
this try the orig here see it flattens

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.820 
this try the orig here see it flattens
out<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:24.990> bit<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.289> bridging<00:00:25.650> there

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
out here a little bit of bridging there

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.529 
out here a little bit of bridging there
but<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.310> flattens<00:00:26.730> out<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
but this all flattens out in here and

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839 
but this all flattens out in here and
over<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.890> energy<00:00:29.310> sheared<00:00:29.640> out

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
over here we have the energy sheared out

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.049 
over here we have the energy sheared out
and<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.929> basically<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.830> west<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.219> east<00:00:32.279> flow<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and a basically in west to east flow and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.229 
and a basically in west to east flow and
no<00:00:33.899> real<00:00:34.170> ridging<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.040> off<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.219> coast<00:00:35.610> now<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
no real ridging here off the coast now I

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
no real ridging here off the coast now I
want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> go<00:00:36.600> ahead<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:40.309> 1804<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.399> stuff

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
want to go ahead to the 1804 in stuff

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.700 
want to go ahead to the 1804 in stuff
all<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> energy<00:00:42.239> out<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> not<00:00:43.110> as<00:00:43.379> sheer

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
all the energy out here is not as sheer

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.569 
all the energy out here is not as sheer
doubt<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:45.059> that's<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.600> much<00:00:45.870> more

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
doubt you can see that's it's much more

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.729 
doubt you can see that's it's much more
consolidated<00:00:47.579> obviously<00:00:48.410> when<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.500> look<00:00:49.620> at

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
consolidated obviously when you look at

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.420 
consolidated obviously when you look at
that<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> ridging<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:52.110> west<00:00:52.559> also<00:00:53.160> like

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that now the ridging out west also like

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.729 
that now the ridging out west also like
I<00:00:53.579> said<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.030> was<00:00:54.920> very<00:00:55.920> flat<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.590> with<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
I said it was very flat in here with the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
I said it was very flat in here with the
old<00:00:58.920> run<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.489> look<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.570> happens<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.140> it's

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
old run and look what happens here it's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
old run and look what happens here it's
not<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.800> flat<00:01:02.100> anymore<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.969> some

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
not as flat anymore you can see some

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.420 
not as flat anymore you can see some
definitive<00:01:03.809> ridging<00:01:04.409> there<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> flow<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> not

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
definitive ridging there the flow is not

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.810 
definitive ridging there the flow is not
what's<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> east<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.659> has<00:01:07.320> become<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
what's the east it has become more of a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.899 
what's the east it has become more of a
bridge<00:01:09.540> pattern<00:01:10.020> there<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.439> turn<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.790> are

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
bridge pattern there in turn we are

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.750 
bridge pattern there in turn we are
seeing<00:01:12.240> less<00:01:12.979> shearing<00:01:13.979> off<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> trough

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
seeing less shearing off of the trough

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.660 
seeing less shearing off of the trough
in<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> east<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.869> isn't<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.799> flat<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.490> as

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
in the east it isn't as flat it's not as

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
in the east it isn't as flat it's not as
sheared<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> spread<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:18.900> there's<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
sheared out and spread out there's a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.170 
sheared out and spread out there's a
more<00:01:19.560> defined<00:01:19.920> trough<00:01:20.340> forming<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
more defined trough forming here and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
more defined trough forming here and
look<00:01:21.630> what's<00:01:21.810> happening<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.799> flow

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
look what's happening here the flow

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
look what's happening here the flow
before<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:24.090> West<00:01:24.390> East<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:24.990> look<00:01:25.110> what's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
before was West East but look what's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.929 
before was West East but look what's
happening<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:25.979> becoming<00:01:26.610> more

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
happening it's now becoming more

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
happening it's now becoming more
southwest<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> we're<00:01:28.200> starting<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
southwest and we're starting to see a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.069 
southwest and we're starting to see a
little<00:01:28.890> bit<00:01:29.040> backing<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.939> ridge<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
little bit backing of a ridge the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
little bit backing of a ridge the
mid-atlantic<00:01:31.320> ridge<00:01:31.710> off<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> coast<00:01:32.430> they're

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
mid-atlantic ridge off the coast they're

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.780 
mid-atlantic ridge off the coast they're
coming<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:33.390> towards<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> east<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.790> those

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
coming back towards the east and those

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.910 
coming back towards the east and those
are<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> trends<00:01:36.210> were<00:01:36.360> looking<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.020> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
are the trends were looking at and I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.800 
are the trends were looking at and I
think<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.909> very<00:01:39.240> clearly<00:01:39.329> that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
think you can see that very clearly that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 
think you can see that very clearly that
things<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.290> becoming<00:01:40.560> more<00:01:40.770> amplified<00:01:41.130> less

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
things are becoming more amplified less

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.670 
things are becoming more amplified less
year<00:01:42.150> now<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.540> therefore<00:01:43.290> that's<00:01:43.409> why<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
year now and therefore that's why the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
year now and therefore that's why the
storm<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.280> tracking<00:01:45.060> more<00:01:45.210> northward<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
storm is tracking more northward and is

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.230 
storm is tracking more northward and is
becoming<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.590> bit<00:01:46.890> stronger<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.640> also
