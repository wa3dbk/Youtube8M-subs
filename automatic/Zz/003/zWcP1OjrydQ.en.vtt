Charlie kind of psychology of the game
is<00:00:40.970> to<00:00:41.120> try<00:00:41.150> and<00:00:41.360> get<00:00:41.510> on<00:00:41.600> top<00:00:41.809> of<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.020> spinner

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
is to try and get on top of the spinner

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
get on the pitch well I'd be in my setup

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.610 
get on the pitch well I'd be in my setup
and<00:01:00.260> my<00:01:01.190> frame<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.610> mind<00:01:01.790> is<00:01:02.030> positive<00:01:02.600> as<00:01:03.379> soon

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
and my frame of mind is positive as soon

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.140 
and my frame of mind is positive as soon
as<00:01:03.739> he<00:01:03.800> let<00:01:03.979> go<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.280> board<00:01:04.460> I<00:01:04.610> see<00:01:04.820> it's<00:01:04.940> above

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
as he let go the board I see it's above

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.300 
as he let go the board I see it's above
my<00:01:05.180> eyeline<00:01:05.659> I'm<00:01:06.409> looking<00:01:06.800> to<00:01:06.890> get<00:01:07.010> down<00:01:07.190> the

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
my eyeline I'm looking to get down the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.410 
my eyeline I'm looking to get down the
wicket<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:09.350> key<00:01:09.530> thing<00:01:09.740> for<00:01:09.799> me<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.420> my

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
wicket and the key thing for me is my

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.719 
wicket and the key thing for me is my
head<00:01:11.690> goes<00:01:12.080> towards<00:01:12.440> whether<00:01:12.620> Buddhism<00:01:12.799> so

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
head goes towards whether Buddhism so

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.030 
head goes towards whether Buddhism so
you<00:01:13.790> see<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.360> line<00:01:15.320> of<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.560> ball<00:01:15.799> that<00:01:15.979> the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
you see the line of the ball that the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.800 
you see the line of the ball that the
spin<00:01:16.340> is<00:01:16.460> bold<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.060> you'd<00:01:17.240> say<00:01:17.450> your<00:01:17.630> head

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
spin is bold and you'd say your head

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.969 
spin is bold and you'd say your head
towards<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.229> line<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:18.530> when<00:01:18.650> off-spinner

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
towards the line so when off-spinner

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.100 
towards the line so when off-spinner
balls<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.520> foot<00:01:19.820> outside<00:01:19.970> Austin<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.840> take

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
balls it a foot outside Austin you take

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.140 
balls it a foot outside Austin you take
your<00:01:21.260> head<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:21.680> your<00:01:22.159> feet<00:01:22.369> will<00:01:22.580> follow<00:01:22.850> suit

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
your head and your feet will follow suit

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.359 
your head and your feet will follow suit
and<00:01:23.299> if<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.600> left<00:01:24.260> down<00:01:24.470> spin<00:01:24.500> abalzer<00:01:25.100> ball

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
and if the left down spin abalzer ball

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.740 
and if the left down spin abalzer ball
it's<00:01:25.549> on<00:01:25.640> legs<00:01:25.880> don't<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.240> take<00:01:26.450> your<00:01:26.540> head

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
it's on legs don't you take your head

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.720 
it's on legs don't you take your head
down<00:01:26.930> towards<00:01:27.320> legs<00:01:27.500> numb<00:01:27.740> that's<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.520> key

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
down towards legs numb that's the key

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.850 
down towards legs numb that's the key
point<00:01:28.970> and<00:01:29.120> what<00:01:29.210> kind<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.480> movement<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:29.960> do

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
point and what kind of movement you do

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.920 
point and what kind of movement you do
you<00:01:30.950> hand<00:01:31.160> down<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.550> pitch<00:01:31.760> to<00:01:32.360> spin<00:01:32.660> out<00:01:32.780> I'd

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
you hand down the pitch to spin out I'd

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.610 
you hand down the pitch to spin out I'd
probably<00:01:33.110> go<00:01:33.380> behind<00:01:34.510> so<00:01:35.510> if<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.660> ball<00:01:35.870> is<00:01:36.050> out

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
probably go behind so if the ball is out

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.690 
probably go behind so if the ball is out
there<00:01:38.740> that's<00:01:39.740> pretty<00:01:40.010> solid<00:01:40.160> as<00:01:40.400> you<00:01:40.430> see

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
there that's pretty solid as you see

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.270 
there that's pretty solid as you see
your<00:01:40.850> movement<00:01:41.180> there<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:41.480> go<00:01:41.660> behind<00:01:42.380> your

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
your movement there you go behind your

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.220 
your movement there you go behind your
back<00:01:43.340> leg<00:01:43.700> there's<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:44.540> many<00:01:44.630> different<00:01:45.110> ways

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
back leg there's so many different ways

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.600 
back leg there's so many different ways
to<00:01:45.410> do<00:01:45.500> your<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:45.770> some<00:01:45.920> light<00:01:46.010> Jack<00:01:46.250> Kelly's

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
to do your see some light Jack Kelly's

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.210 
to do your see some light Jack Kelly's
goes<00:01:46.850> with<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.510> shimmy<00:01:47.900> you<00:01:48.620> see<00:01:48.860> someone

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
goes with the shimmy you see someone

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.040 
goes with the shimmy you see someone
like<00:01:49.370> Brian<00:01:49.670> Lara<00:01:49.970> knows<00:01:50.180> left<00:01:50.450> anybody<00:01:50.720> kind

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
like Brian Lara knows left anybody kind

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.440 
like Brian Lara knows left anybody kind
of<00:01:51.170> jumps<00:01:51.980> at<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.250> ball<00:01:52.430> there's<00:01:53.060> many<00:01:53.300> many

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
of jumps at the ball there's many many

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.330 
of jumps at the ball there's many many
different<00:01:53.930> ways<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.290> do<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:54.710> that<00:01:55.220> is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
different ways to do it but that is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.040 
different ways to do it but that is
probably<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.850> most<00:01:56.000> consistent<00:01:56.660> way<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.810> do

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
probably the most consistent way to do

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.690 
probably the most consistent way to do
it<00:01:57.140> in<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.320> most<00:01:57.530> used<00:01:58.070> ways<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.550> it's<00:01:58.670> a

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
it in the most used ways that it's a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.100 
it in the most used ways that it's a
little<00:01:58.940> shimmy<00:01:59.180> down<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.420> pitch<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.960> gives

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
little shimmy down the pitch it gives

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.750 
little shimmy down the pitch it gives
you<00:02:00.200> options<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.620> hit<00:02:01.250> both<00:02:01.430> over

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
you options to hit both over

yards outside crease and you know even

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.310 
yards outside crease and you know even
further<00:02:19.390> than<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.780> testing<00:02:20.170> yourself

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
further than that testing yourself

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.990 
further than that testing yourself
trying<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.830> get<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.160> far<00:02:21.340> as<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.520> can<00:02:21.730> I

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
trying to get out as far as you can I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.740 
trying to get out as far as you can I
said<00:02:22.330> go

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.040 

I<00:02:30.980> think<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.310> other<00:02:32.760> big<00:02:33.660> things<00:02:33.930> have

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
I think one of the other big things have

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.320 
I think one of the other big things have
practiced<00:02:34.410> any<00:02:34.590> shot<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.910> actually

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
practiced any shot is that you actually

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.060 
practiced any shot is that you actually
get<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> bottle<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.990> bowl<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.680> every

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
get a bottle to bowl and you do every

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.410 
get a bottle to bowl and you do every
ball<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.400> go<00:02:38.520> down<00:02:38.670> every<00:02:38.820> single<00:02:39.180> ball<00:02:39.330> so

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
ball you go down every single ball so

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.700 
ball you go down every single ball so
you<00:02:39.510> actually<00:02:39.630> find<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.170> balls<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.650> you

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
you actually find out the balls that you

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.910 
you actually find out the balls that you
can't<00:02:41.040> hit<00:02:41.250> as<00:02:41.370> well<00:02:44.090> our<00:02:45.090> bolt<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:46.620> good<00:02:46.770> but
