00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
wine is going to oxidize overnight what

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.260 
wine is going to oxidize overnight what
does<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.149> mean<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:52.350> remember<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.270> last

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270

does this mean you remember that last
time<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.260> talked<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.129> about<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.670> benefits

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
time I talked to you about the benefits

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.950 
time I talked to you about the benefits
of<00:00:57.680> oxygenating<00:00:58.680> your<00:00:58.710> wine<00:00:59.219> while<00:00:59.960> swirling

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
of oxygenating your wine while swirling

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.509 
of oxygenating your wine while swirling
it<00:01:01.699> remember<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> aromas<00:01:05.159> come

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it remember so that the aromas come

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.380 
it remember so that the aromas come
forward<00:01:06.049> but<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.979> wine<00:01:08.280> gets<00:01:08.729> too<00:01:09.119> much

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
forward but if your wine gets too much

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
forward but if your wine gets too much
air<00:01:09.799> you're<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> find<00:01:11.400> yourself<00:01:11.490> with

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
air you're going to find yourself with

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.810 
air you're going to find yourself with
an<00:01:12.030> oxidized<00:01:12.570> wine<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.520> oxidized<00:01:14.520> wine

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
an oxidized wine and oxidized wine

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.350 
an oxidized wine and oxidized wine
tastes<00:01:15.420> sour<00:01:15.869> bitter<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:18.000> probably

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
tastes sour bitter and will probably

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.100

have lost all of its fruit aromas how to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.870

listen okay it's getting harder and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.880 
listen okay it's getting harder and
harder<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.329> when<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.570> know<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:14.650> I

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
harder so this is when I know that I

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.009 
harder so this is when I know that I
have<00:03:15.100> taken<00:03:15.370> all<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.030> air<00:03:16.180> away<00:03:16.480> from<00:03:16.870> my

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:24.240 
have taken all the air away from my
bottle<00:03:20.100> good<00:03:21.480> if<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.690> leave<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.470> bottle<00:03:23.859> like

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
bottle good if I leave the bottle like

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.210 
bottle good if I leave the bottle like
this<00:03:24.660> nothing<00:03:25.660> is<00:03:25.900> going<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.200> happen<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:27.100> my

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
this nothing is going to happen to my

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.670 
this nothing is going to happen to my
wine<00:03:27.430> I'm<00:03:27.670> not<00:03:28.060> going<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.420> have<00:03:28.600> vinegar<00:03:29.049> next

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
wine I'm not going to have vinegar next

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.270 
wine I'm not going to have vinegar next
time<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:29.829> want<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.190> drink<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.519> wine<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:32.280> you

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
time I want to drink the wine and you

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.789 
time I want to drink the wine and you
can<00:03:33.459> basically<00:03:33.670> keep<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.269> up<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.989> one<00:03:35.290> week<00:03:35.319> or

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
can basically keep it up to one week or

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:43.170 
can basically keep it up to one week or
ten<00:03:36.160> days<00:03:37.799> there<00:03:38.799> is<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:40.170> important<00:03:41.170> thing<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
ten days there is a important thing you

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.629 
ten days there is a important thing you
should<00:03:43.209> know<00:03:43.510> about<00:03:43.540> wine<00:03:44.139> pumps<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:45.459> use

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
should know about wine pumps and the use

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.640 
should know about wine pumps and the use
of<00:03:45.670> wine<00:03:46.090> pumps<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.569> why<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:47.230> wine<00:03:47.650> pump<00:03:47.980> anyway

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
of wine pumps and why a wine pump anyway

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.309 
of wine pumps and why a wine pump anyway
if<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:51.579> take<00:03:51.790> this<00:03:51.910> one<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.660> can<00:03:52.870> see<00:03:52.900> it's

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
if I take this one you can see it's

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.680 
if I take this one you can see it's
pretty<00:03:53.560> light<00:03:54.010> colored<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:56.639> why's<00:03:57.639> that<00:03:58.000> have

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
pretty light colored so why's that have

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.370 
pretty light colored so why's that have
this<00:03:58.989> light<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.859> color<00:04:00.100> our<00:04:00.519> wines<00:04:01.450> that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
this light of a color our wines that

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.009 
this light of a color our wines that
will<00:04:02.829> not<00:04:03.040> survive<00:04:03.549> overnight<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.810> will

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
will not survive overnight and that will

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.129 
will not survive overnight and that will
probably<00:04:05.350> turn<00:04:05.500> into<00:04:05.829> vinegar<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:07.079> why<00:04:08.079> is

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
probably turn into vinegar so why is

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.640 
probably turn into vinegar so why is
that<00:04:08.940> there<00:04:09.940> are<00:04:10.060> several<00:04:10.450> grape<00:04:11.109> varieties

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
that there are several grape varieties

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.850 
that there are several grape varieties
that

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
that

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.520 
that
do<00:04:14.580> not<00:04:15.380> support<00:04:16.380> air<00:04:17.840> like<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.019> contract

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
do not support air like the contract

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.430 
do not support air like the contract
with<00:04:19.709> air<00:04:19.980> like<00:04:20.549> lighter<00:04:21.510> grape<00:04:21.900> varieties

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
with air like lighter grape varieties

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.400 
with air like lighter grape varieties
like<00:04:22.470> Manu<00:04:23.400> ganache<00:04:24.270> Pinot<00:04:24.870> Noir

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
like Manu ganache Pinot Noir

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.690 
like Manu ganache Pinot Noir
I<00:04:25.890> think<00:04:26.760> our<00:04:26.910> grape<00:04:27.120> varieties<00:04:27.600> that<00:04:28.700> don't

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
I think our grape varieties that don't

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.810 
I think our grape varieties that don't
support<00:04:29.970> air<00:04:30.600> so<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:31.320> should<00:04:31.590> probably

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
support air so you should probably

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.850 
support air so you should probably
invest<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:33.030> wine<00:04:33.210> pump<00:04:33.480> this<00:04:33.990> cost<00:04:34.260> 10<00:04:34.830> euros

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
invest in a wine pump this cost 10 euros

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.220 
invest in a wine pump this cost 10 euros
or<00:04:35.520> $15<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:38.060> whereas<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.570> had<00:04:39.750> an<00:04:39.900> oak

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
or $15 and whereas if you had an oak

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.950 
or $15 and whereas if you had an oak
Cabernet<00:04:40.830> Sauvignon<00:04:41.370> nothing<00:04:42.210> will<00:04:42.510> probably

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
Cabernet Sauvignon nothing will probably

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.870 
Cabernet Sauvignon nothing will probably
happen<00:04:43.140> to<00:04:43.410> your<00:04:43.560> wine<00:04:43.860> or<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.370> will<00:04:44.550> even

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
happen to your wine or it will even

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.090 
happen to your wine or it will even
probably<00:04:45.390> taste<00:04:45.660> better<00:04:46.050> on<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.650> next<00:04:46.680> day

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
probably taste better on the next day

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.460 
probably taste better on the next day
but<00:04:47.790> still<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.390> one<00:04:48.660> pump<00:04:48.900> is<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.140> good

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
but still a one pump is a good

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.570 
but still a one pump is a good
investment<00:04:49.890> okay<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.200> actually<00:04:52.680> say<00:04:52.980> I'm

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
investment okay so I actually say I'm

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.210 
investment okay so I actually say I'm
