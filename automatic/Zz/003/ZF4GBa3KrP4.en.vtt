it powered on what you'll need to do is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.490 
it powered on what you'll need to do is
I'm<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.750> find<00:00:36.960> settings<00:00:37.350> right

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
I'm just going to find settings right

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
I'm just going to find settings right
here<00:00:37.560> because<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.100> easy<00:00:38.310> to<00:00:38.489> find<00:00:38.700> instead

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
here because it's easy to find instead

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.970 
here because it's easy to find instead
of<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.930> into<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> apps<00:00:40.380> and<00:00:40.560> finding<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
of going into the apps and finding it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.740 
of going into the apps and finding it
either<00:00:41.160> way<00:00:41.340> find<00:00:41.640> settings<00:00:41.910> go<00:00:42.720> into

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
either way find settings go into

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.920 
either way find settings go into
settings<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:45.000> already<00:00:45.450> had<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> open

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
settings and then I already had it open

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
settings and then I already had it open
so<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.290> you<00:00:46.440> scroll<00:00:46.830> down<00:00:47.070> here<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so if you scroll down here to where it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.630 
so if you scroll down here to where it
says<00:00:48.450> more<00:00:48.720> networks<00:00:49.250> that's<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.460> you're
