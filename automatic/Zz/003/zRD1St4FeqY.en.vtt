00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:12.322
There are things in this world 
worth fighting and dying for.

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:15.323
We are warriors.

00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:17.964
It's who we are.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.178
It's what we do.

00:00:25.582 --> 00:00:26.953
The Three Musketeers.

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:29.337
I came to Paris to be one of you.

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.591
D'Artagnan, you wanna be a musketeer?

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:36.416
This is your chance.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.669
We live in a kingdom controlled by fear.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.296
The Cardinal rules the land.

00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:48.199
Buckingham rules the skies.

00:00:48.396 --> 00:00:51.586
My new war machines 
will readdress the balance.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.186
And she is the deadliest assassin
 the world has ever seen.

00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:05.164
Together they will unleash war
 on the entire continent.

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:10.560
We're the musketeers.
It's up to us to put the end to the Cardinals plot.

00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:12.842
I could do with some exercise.

00:01:13.976 --> 00:01:15.813
- All for one.
- And one for all!

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:37.547
Look out of the window.

00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:40.590
Round two.

00:01:51.643 --> 00:01:53.460
There were four of us against forty of them.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.707
Was it forty,
or four hundred?

00:01:57.877 --> 00:01:58.845
Just forty.

00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:01.114
It was an off-day.
