I've had a lot of requests to do another

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.379 
I've had a lot of requests to do another
bench<00:00:13.980> video<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.700> think<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.000> best<00:00:15.179> way<00:00:15.360> to

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
bench video so I think the best way to

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.730 
bench video so I think the best way to
go<00:00:15.570> about<00:00:15.660> doing<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.200> is<00:00:16.260> we've<00:00:16.590> already

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
go about doing this is we've already

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.070 
go about doing this is we've already
done<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.250> bunch<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.000> instructional<00:00:18.689> videos

bench press before so I have no idea
what<00:00:31.560> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.800> disaster<00:00:32.129> I'm<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.699> walk

that I use before I put somebody on the
bench<00:00:51.299> just<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.619> understand<00:00:53.159> the<00:00:53.280> verbal

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
bench just so they understand the verbal

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
particular is I've been trying to figure

particular is I've been trying to figure
out<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.770> they're<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.450> visual<00:01:21.450> learner<00:01:21.659> or<00:01:22.530> if

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
out if they're a visual learner or if

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
out if they're a visual learner or if
they're<00:01:23.399> an<00:01:23.609> audible<00:01:24.119> learner<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.689> other

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
they're an audible learner in other

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
they're an audible learner in other
words<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.859> done<00:01:26.039> or<00:01:26.250> do

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
words do they have to see it done or do

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.840 
words do they have to see it done or do
they<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.999> it<00:01:27.179> because<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.020> does

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
they have to do it because that does

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.830 
they have to do it because that does
influence<00:01:29.850> how<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:30.240> going<00:01:30.359> to<00:01:30.450> cue<00:01:30.719> the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.340 
take the bar out of the raft and from
here<00:03:46.090> I'm<00:03:47.090> using<00:03:47.270> what's<00:03:47.630> called<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.930> rotator

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
here I'm using what's called a rotator

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.010 
here I'm using what's called a rotator
bar<00:03:48.650> here<00:03:49.120> more<00:03:50.120> than<00:03:50.210> likely<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.690> won't<00:03:50.870> have

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
bar here more than likely you won't have

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.110 
bar here more than likely you won't have
one<00:03:51.320> we<00:03:52.310> like<00:03:52.460> you<00:03:52.580> can<00:03:52.730> tell<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:52.970> where<00:03:53.090> to

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
one we like you can tell you where to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.800 
one we like you can tell you where to
get<00:03:53.270> one<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:54.790> like<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:56.000> because<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.300> angles<00:03:56.510> up

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
get one I like that because it angles up

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.600 
get one I like that because it angles up
on<00:03:56.960> each<00:03:57.110> end<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:57.440> it's<00:03:57.650> easier<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.220> be<00:03:58.370> able<00:03:58.430> to

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
on each end so it's easier to be able to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.050 
on each end so it's easier to be able to
feel<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.970> last<00:03:59.180> pull<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:01.190> all<00:04:01.520> I'm<00:04:01.610> gonna<00:04:01.730> do

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
feel the last pull so all I'm gonna do

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.940 
feel the last pull so all I'm gonna do
is<00:04:02.330> just<00:04:02.360> basically<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.350> straight<00:04:03.620> out<00:04:03.710> pull

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
is just basically it straight out pull

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.230 
is just basically it straight out pull
it<00:04:03.980> out<00:04:04.160> from<00:04:04.430> here<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:05.390> here<00:04:05.720> but<00:04:06.290> with<00:04:06.530> that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
it out from here to here but with that

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.600 
it out from here to here but with that
focus<00:04:08.240> on<00:04:08.420> me<00:04:08.600> making<00:04:09.080> sure<00:04:09.440> he's<00:04:10.190> pulling

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
focus on me making sure he's pulling

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.530 
focus on me making sure he's pulling
with<00:04:10.760> his<00:04:10.910> last<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:14.060> you're<00:04:14.180> gonna<00:04:14.300> actually

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
with his last so you're gonna actually

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.000 
with his last so you're gonna actually
bend<00:04:14.930> your<00:04:15.110> knees<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.290> little<00:04:15.470> bit<00:04:15.650> go<00:04:15.800> a<00:04:15.830> little

bend your knees a little bit go a little

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.130 
bend your knees a little bit go a little
bit<00:04:16.220> wider<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:16.670> you're<00:04:17.000> up<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.300> the<00:04:17.390> hop<00:04:17.630> you

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
bit wider so you're up on the hop you

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.810 
bit wider so you're up on the hop you
