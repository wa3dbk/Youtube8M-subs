00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
you're going to need a bigger stitch and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.770 
you're going to need a bigger stitch and
you'll<00:00:24.860> need<00:00:25.040> a<00:00:25.250> triple<00:00:25.700> pull<00:00:26.060> double<00:00:26.510> throw

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
for the led to be added so you're going

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.140 
for the led to be added so you're going
to<00:00:32.930> need<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.260> get<00:00:33.410> yourself<00:00:33.500> an<00:00:33.860> LED<00:00:34.340> it

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
to need to get yourself an LED it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.910 
to need to get yourself an LED it
doesn't<00:00:35.480> really<00:00:35.600> matter<00:00:35.840> what<00:00:36.140> size<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:36.710> get

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
going to need an LED holder to house the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.670 
going to need an LED holder to house the
LED<00:00:51.890> inside<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.670> chassis<00:00:53.149> of<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.450> pedal<00:00:54.020> so

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
LED inside the chassis of the pedal so

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.250 
LED inside the chassis of the pedal so
for<00:00:54.950> my<00:00:55.160> free<00:00:55.430> millimeter<00:00:56.090> LED<00:00:56.600> I've<00:00:56.870> got<00:00:57.230> a

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
for my free millimeter LED I've got a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.790 
for my free millimeter LED I've got a
three<00:00:57.829> millimeter<00:00:58.120> LED<00:00:59.120> holder<00:00:59.570> for<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.020> I've

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
three millimeter LED holder for it I've

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.389 
three millimeter LED holder for it I've
also<00:01:01.520> got<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.969> 2k<00:01:02.690> resistor<00:01:03.189> which<00:01:04.189> you're

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
also got a 2k resistor which you're

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.399 
also got a 2k resistor which you're
going<00:01:04.549> to<00:01:04.670> need<00:01:04.879> to<00:01:05.059> solder<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.870> cathode

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
going to need to solder to the cathode

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.450 
going to need to solder to the cathode
or<00:01:06.710> short<00:01:07.280> leg<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.240> LED<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.460> finally

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
or short leg of the LED and finally

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.649 
or short leg of the LED and finally
you're<00:01:10.670> going<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.909> need<00:01:11.090> some<00:01:11.299> more<00:01:11.450> wire

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
you're going to need some more wire

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.360 
you're going to need some more wire
because<00:01:12.140> we're<00:01:12.320> adding<00:01:12.560> some<00:01:12.770> more<00:01:12.890> wires<00:01:13.130> to

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
because we're adding some more wires to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.640 
because we're adding some more wires to
the<00:01:13.490> circuit<00:01:13.909> board<00:01:14.049> so<00:01:15.049> now<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:15.320> have<00:01:15.530> two

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
the circuit board so now you have two

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.620 
the circuit board so now you have two
unsold<00:01:16.100> ER<00:01:16.220> all<00:01:16.370> of<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.670> wires<00:01:16.880> off<00:01:17.180> of<00:01:17.450> the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
unsold ER all of the wires off of the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.060 
unsold ER all of the wires off of the
switch<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:19.900> remove<00:01:20.900> the<00:01:21.170> switch<00:01:21.470> completely

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
switch and remove the switch completely

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.789 
switch and remove the switch completely
from<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.369> pedal<00:01:23.140> now<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.200> have<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.530> remove

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
from the pedal now you have to remove

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.680 
from the pedal now you have to remove
both<00:01:25.130> input<00:01:25.549> jack<00:01:25.790> bolts<00:01:26.210> from<00:01:26.360> either<00:01:26.570> side

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
both input jack bolts from either side

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.930 
both input jack bolts from either side
of<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.140> pedal<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.640> remove<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.820> screw

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
of the pedal and remove the screw

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.109 
of the pedal and remove the screw
holding<00:01:29.000> in<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.600> PCB<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:31.430> remove<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.880> wiring

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
holding in the PCB and remove the wiring

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.719 
holding in the PCB and remove the wiring
connector<00:01:32.420> plug<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:33.380> then<00:01:33.530> take<00:01:33.799> out<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.130> PCB

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.420 
of the pedal just here on the left and
our<00:03:56.420> LED<00:03:56.930> fits<00:03:57.200> perfectly<00:03:57.769> into<00:03:58.040> this<00:03:58.190> hole

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
our LED fits perfectly into this hole

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.970 
our LED fits perfectly into this hole
like<00:03:59.209> so<00:03:59.450> now<00:04:00.079> what<00:04:00.260> we're<00:04:00.440> going<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.650> be<00:04:00.769> doing

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
like so now what we're going to be doing

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.349 
like so now what we're going to be doing
is<00:04:01.370> soldering<00:04:02.239> on<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.510> small<00:04:03.200> piece<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.590> wire<00:04:03.829> to

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
is soldering on a small piece of wire to

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:10.660 
is soldering on a small piece of wire to
the<00:04:05.359> short<00:04:05.810> leg<00:04:06.019> or<00:04:06.320> cathode<00:04:06.980> of<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.459> led

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.670 

you<00:04:11.599> should<00:04:11.780> then<00:04:11.959> have<00:04:12.170> something<00:04:12.440> that

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
you should then have something that

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.979 
you should then have something that
looks<00:04:12.800> like<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.640> will<00:04:14.300> now<00:04:14.450> have<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.810> cut

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
looks like this you will now have to cut

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.800 
looks like this you will now have to cut
off<00:04:15.170> two<00:04:15.380> bits<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.860> heat<00:04:16.669> shrink<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:17.269> go<00:04:17.419> over

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
off two bits of heat shrink to go over

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.409 
off two bits of heat shrink to go over
the<00:04:17.930> wire<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.530> then<00:04:19.160> slide<00:04:19.489> both<00:04:19.730> bits<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.269> the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
the wire and then slide both bits of the

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.540 
the wire and then slide both bits of the
heat<00:04:20.600> shrink<00:04:20.930> over<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.380> wire<00:04:21.560> before<00:04:22.250> you

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
heat shrink over the wire before you

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.250 
heat shrink over the wire before you
solder<00:04:22.970> on<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.090> other<00:04:23.389> end<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.990> switch

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
solder on the other end to the switch

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.610 
solder on the other end to the switch
and<00:04:25.090> then<00:04:26.090> use<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.330> lighter<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.960> heat<00:04:26.990> up<00:04:27.169> the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
and then use a lighter to heat up the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.800 
and then use a lighter to heat up the
heat<00:04:27.830> shrink<00:04:28.040> around<00:04:28.970> where<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.360> exposed

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
heat shrink around where the exposed

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.500 
heat shrink around where the exposed
metal<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.700> okay<00:04:31.700> so<00:04:31.760> now<00:04:32.000> we're<00:04:32.150> going<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.360> take

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
metal is okay so now we're going to take

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.030 
metal is okay so now we're going to take
the<00:04:32.720> other<00:04:32.750> wire<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.380> we<00:04:33.530> soldered<00:04:33.889> on<00:04:34.010> to

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040
