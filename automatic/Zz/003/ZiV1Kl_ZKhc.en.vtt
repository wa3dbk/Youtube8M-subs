00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello and welcome to the video channel 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.330
 of the blog my child draws today 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.059
 I would like to show you our last 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.160
 DIY around the theme of Easter we have 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.510
 made a basket of easter for 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.250
 pick up the chocolates on easter day 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 the necessary material we have 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.730
 used a fruit juice brick a 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.590
 large greek of 2 liters 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.679
 of painting created branch of the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.070
 gouache paint felt pens 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.440
 a string a paintbrush and then a 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 fancy brush that can be 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.969
 replaced by a fork 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.390
 so the bulk of the decoration is going to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.489
 do with finger paint 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.559
 we start by cutting the game bridle 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.230
 fruit in half to get a cube 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.570
 who will we serve as baskets the child 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 will paint the four faces that were 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.800
 courses and juice brick 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.030
 fruits in white with paint 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.010
 white acrylic 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.020
 so be careful you have to use 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.619
 acrylic painting and not couach 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.420
 since it applies better on all 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.780
 the supports and in particular the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.780
 cartons that are pretty brilliant games 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.909
 range that sometimes do not go through a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.280
 derrick of the gouache paint 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.880
 So here we have to do two or three 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 layers to cover the brick and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.520
 then when the paint is dry the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.829
 cub junta we will continue with the help 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.970
 the child 's holes on both sides 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.939
 opposite like those on which we 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.250
 will tie a braided string or so 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.780
 a ribbon so we did not have any 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.729
 ribbon is they were using a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.979
 braided string but I think it 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.460
 would be much nicer with a beautiful you 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.829
 of which a fabric then in the decoration 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.659
 the business child and Toussaint a 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.960
 hen a rooster with paint to 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.719
 fingers 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.090
 so first the child will do the body 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.700
 by making a print of paint 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.390
 yellow 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.950
 with his thumb next to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.080
 the child will make a smaller 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.129
 yellow imprint using his 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.569
 auricular or another finger when the 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.519
 essert painting and I in the fund goes 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.209
 to draw the paws of our little 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.150
 chick hanoi and beak with a red 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.910
 so here is our little chick who are 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.420
 very kids will do the same again 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.910
 operation on two phases of study on the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.560
 third phase my daughter asked to 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.480
 to make a hen then to make a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.599
 hen we used paint 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.790
 gouache of brown color since the 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.829
 chicks are young but then the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.049
 chickens decor we are younger 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.120
 so we used brown and then we got 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.760
 expanded a little bit the fingerprints in 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.849
 making a wider circle with the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.989
 inch to the body then the fact of 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.880
 the decoration so with the felt and 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.099
 then on the fourth place and he did 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.860
 a rooster so we used exactly the 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.200
 same technique right there then took the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.880
 others to make a multi tail 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.760
 colors so the child goes next 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.510
 used a little fancy brush for 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.190
 realize the grass as you see here 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.720
 if you do not have fancy brush 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.160
 to do that you can help yourself 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.109
 a fork 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.459
 it works very very well too 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.530
 when the paint is dry on the 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.430
 four faces long the child is going 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.200
 use his index finger to make the sky 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.359
 blue so he's going to make small 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.319
 footprint side by side with 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.160
 painting gouache little and to finish the 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.739
 decoration 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.920
 the child can represent flowers 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.150
 with color dots of all 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.639
 felt colors 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.060
 so here we have a nice picture of 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.060
 spring 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.550
 to finish we will try to improve 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.590
 the edge of the orange juice brick that 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.900
 was cut out so for that we have 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.000
 cut out a strip of crepe paper that 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.910
 we folded in half in the direction of 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.579
 the length like this then the child 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.519
 to cut out this strip of paper in 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.790
 shape of france and we cut it a 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.470
 piece also by measuring 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.690
 directly on the box to have 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.540
 depend on the bomb length after 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.419
 my month to join them by applying a 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.940
 small a small trickle of glue to 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.000
 inside and then a press of course 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.650
 the edge of the car so you this way 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.020
 we have to hide the face of the cuts and 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.540
 from our orange juice brick and that's it 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.300
 our easter basket is ready so 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.919
 it's a pretty easy DIY to do 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.530
 with a job from the age of 5 6 years so 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.210
 we made a basket of easter that 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.070
 the child will be able to use the day of 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.500
 easter to pick up the eggs of time 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.720
 here I hope another diy 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.000

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.289
