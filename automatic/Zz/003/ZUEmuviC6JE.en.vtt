00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
can be relatively tight from the factory

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.030 
can be relatively tight from the factory
so<00:00:44.450> an<00:00:44.570> easy<00:00:44.690> way<00:00:44.900> to<00:00:44.960> remove<00:00:45.290> this<00:00:45.500> bolt<00:00:45.770> to

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
so an easy way to remove this bolt to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.670 
so an easy way to remove this bolt to
yourself<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.550> ratchet<00:00:46.970> or<00:00:47.120> wrench<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:48.470> what

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
yourself a ratchet or wrench and what

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.280

the<00:01:08.600> fluid<00:01:08.930> can<00:01:09.080> be<00:01:09.170> quite<00:01:09.500> warm

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.010 

now<00:01:25.430> once<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.790> fluid<00:01:26.000> finishes<00:01:26.600> draining

new washer

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:40.090 
new washer
it<00:01:31.580> reads<00:01:31.910> stall<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.810> drain<00:01:33.050> bolt<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.950> then

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
it reads stall the drain bolt and then

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.000 
it reads stall the drain bolt and then
of<00:01:40.280> course<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:42.760> tighten<00:01:43.760> up<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:43.940> bolt<00:01:45.010> now

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
of course just tighten up the bolt now

of course just tighten up the bolt now
what<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:46.370> want<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.640> do<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:46.910> measure<00:01:47.210> how<00:01:47.690> much

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
what you want to do is measure how much

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.110 
what you want to do is measure how much
came<00:01:48.320> out<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:48.890> drain<00:01:49.250> pan<00:01:49.550> so<00:01:49.790> let's<00:01:49.970> go

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
came out of that drain pan so let's go

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.969 
came out of that drain pan so let's go
ahead<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.480> do<00:01:50.600> that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.679 

so<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> wrap<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.299> here's<00:01:57.570> your

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
so what you wrap that up here's your

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.440 
so what you wrap that up here's your
boater<00:01:57.869> toward<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> driver's<00:01:59.490> side<00:01:59.700> right

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
boater toward the driver's side right

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.289 
boater toward the driver's side right
here<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.020> upper<00:02:01.350> radiator<00:02:01.530> hose

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
here you have the upper radiator hose

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.760 
here you have the upper radiator hose
then<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> transmission<00:02:04.320> dipstick

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
then you have the transmission dipstick

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.190 
then you have the transmission dipstick
this<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.149> charging<00:02:06.630> pipe<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.170> what

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
this is the charging pipe this is what

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660 
this is the charging pipe this is what
they<00:02:07.409> call<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> charging<00:02:08.129> pipe<00:02:08.340> it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
they call a charging pipe it's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.820 
they call a charging pipe it's
essentially<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.269> dipstick<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.679> is

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
essentially the dipstick and this is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.240 
essentially the dipstick and this is
where<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.370> need<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.640> install<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.810> do<00:02:12.959> fluid<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
where we need to install to do fluid so

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.530 
where we need to install to do fluid so
what<00:02:14.400> we're<00:02:14.519> going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.030> remove<00:02:15.300> this

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
what we're going to do is remove this

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.190 
what we're going to do is remove this
dipstick<00:02:16.370> install<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.550> funnel<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.840> happen

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
dipstick install a funnel and I happen

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.890 
dipstick install a funnel and I happen
to<00:02:19.230> measure<00:02:19.590> four<00:02:20.340> quarts<00:02:20.790> or<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.330> gallon

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
to measure four quarts or one gallon

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.979 
to measure four quarts or one gallon
that's<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:22.440> came<00:02:22.620> out<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.160> drain<00:02:24.090> pen<00:02:24.330> so

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
that's what came out of the drain pen so

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.050 
that's what came out of the drain pen so
I'm<00:02:25.110> going<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.590> reinstall<00:02:26.069> four<00:02:26.430> quarts<00:02:26.819> and

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
I'm going to reinstall four quarts and

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.750 
I'm going to reinstall four quarts and
then<00:02:27.690> we'll<00:02:27.840> start<00:02:28.080> up<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> car<00:02:28.610> drive<00:02:29.610> it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
then we'll start up the car drive it

then we'll go ahead and check the fluid
level<00:02:33.769> now<00:02:34.769> this<00:02:34.799> dipstick<00:02:35.459> does<00:02:35.849> not<00:02:36.150> just

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
level now this dipstick does not just
