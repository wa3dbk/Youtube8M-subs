some things that we that we can and you

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.009 
some things that we that we can and you
know<00:04:07.379> work<00:04:07.650> work<00:04:07.980> hard<00:04:08.280> fight<00:04:09.060> for<00:04:09.870> things

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
know work work hard fight for things

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.819 
know work work hard fight for things
that<00:04:10.319> we<00:04:11.219> can<00:04:11.489> control<00:04:13.669> and<00:04:15.440> leave<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.620> rest

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
that we can control and leave the rest

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.499 
that we can control and leave the rest
alone<00:04:16.949> what<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.699> like<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.030> see<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.239> when<00:04:18.419> we

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
alone what I like to see is when we

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.449 
alone what I like to see is when we
really<00:04:18.840> succeed<00:04:19.259> and<00:04:19.859> law<00:04:20.039> school<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.340> that

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
really succeed and law school and that

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.460 
really succeed and law school and that
really<00:04:20.699> starts<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.180> change<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:22.199> stitching

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
really starts to change the stitching

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.200 
really starts to change the stitching
that<00:04:22.530> we<00:04:22.650> have<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:22.889> many<00:04:23.039> students<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:24.090> know

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
that we have so many students you know

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.760 
that we have so many students you know
getting<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.539> aid<00:04:24.659> classes<00:04:24.930> doing<00:04:25.349> honours

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
getting the aid classes doing honours

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.159 
getting the aid classes doing honours
going<00:04:26.159> so<00:04:26.370> well<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.509> remember<00:04:27.750> like

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
going so well and I remember like

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.719 
going so well and I remember like
hearing<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.590> quote<00:04:28.830> sort<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.430> thing<00:04:29.580> like

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
hearing a quote sort of the thing like

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.390 
hearing a quote sort of the thing like
the<00:04:29.909> of<00:04:30.509> the<00:04:30.810> brown<00:04:31.020> man's<00:04:31.259> got<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.500> like<00:04:32.039> flight

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
the of the brown man's got a like flight

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.249 
the of the brown man's got a like flight
where<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.759> white<00:04:32.909> man<00:04:33.120> can<00:04:33.270> walk<00:04:33.389> too<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.870> I

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
where the white man can walk too and I

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.390 
where the white man can walk too and I
know<00:04:34.320> it's<00:04:34.530> probably<00:04:34.740> going<00:04:35.009> to<00:04:35.070> take<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.250> lot

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
know it's probably going to take a lot

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.830 
know it's probably going to take a lot
of<00:04:35.430> effort<00:04:35.580> on<00:04:35.820> our<00:04:35.970> part<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.389> we've<00:04:36.599> got<00:04:36.750> to

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
of effort on our part so we've got to

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.320 
of effort on our part so we've got to
work<00:04:36.960> twice<00:04:37.650> as<00:04:37.710> hard<00:04:37.889> but<00:04:38.639> when<00:04:38.789> we<00:04:38.909> do<00:04:39.090> people

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
work twice as hard but when we do people

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.570 
work twice as hard but when we do people
start<00:04:39.659> to<00:04:39.810> see<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.259> we're<00:04:40.440> actually<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:41.490> we

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
start to see that we're actually and we

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.219 
start to see that we're actually and we
know<00:04:41.699> we're<00:04:41.820> not<00:04:41.909> lazy<00:04:42.150> we're<00:04:42.720> not<00:04:42.870> here<00:04:43.199> just

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
know we're not lazy we're not here just

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.990 
know we're not lazy we're not here just
because<00:04:43.530> we<00:04:43.770> get<00:04:43.919> in<00:04:44.039> through<00:04:44.370> something<00:04:44.789> some

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
because we get in through something some

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.180 
because we get in through something some
easy<00:04:45.240> scheme<00:04:45.690> or<00:04:46.229> actually<00:04:46.650> some<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:46.889> the<00:04:47.009> top

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
easy scheme or actually some of the top

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.589 
easy scheme or actually some of the top
like<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.550> top<00:04:47.729> students<00:04:48.090> there<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:48.300> we<00:04:48.389> add<00:04:48.570> a

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
like the top students there and we add a

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.240 
like the top students there and we add a
lot<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:48.930> like<00:04:49.080> life<00:04:49.349> and<00:04:49.530> diversity<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:50.159> the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
lot of like life and diversity to the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.089 
lot of like life and diversity to the
law<00:04:50.370> school<00:04:51.020> we<00:04:52.020> get<00:04:52.220> discriminated<00:04:53.220> upon<00:04:53.340> but

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
law school we get discriminated upon but

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.149 
law school we get discriminated upon but
we<00:04:56.099> can<00:04:56.340> build<00:04:56.520> other<00:04:56.699> people<00:04:57.120> up<00:04:57.650> we<00:04:58.650> can<00:04:58.889> be

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
we can build other people up we can be

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.760 
we can build other people up we can be
we<00:04:59.940> are<00:05:00.150> we<00:05:00.389> are<00:05:00.509> loved<00:05:00.750> we<00:05:01.080> are<00:05:01.169> out<00:05:01.349> of<00:05:01.380> her<00:05:01.590> we

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
we are we are loved we are out of her we

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.390 
we are we are loved we are out of her we
are<00:05:01.919> so<00:05:02.310> curing<00:05:02.909> we<00:05:03.090> are<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.449> strong<00:05:03.840> if<00:05:04.400> people

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
are so curing we are so strong if people

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.129 
are so curing we are so strong if people
were<00:05:05.520> nicer<00:05:05.789> to<00:05:06.060> us<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.419> feel<00:05:06.659> like<00:05:06.780> this<00:05:06.960> would

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
were nicer to us I feel like this would

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.260 
were nicer to us I feel like this would
become<00:05:07.889> more<00:05:08.250> obvious<00:05:08.400> because<00:05:08.940> that<00:05:09.150> means

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
become more obvious because that means

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.170 
become more obvious because that means
we<00:05:09.599> would<00:05:10.320> reflect<00:05:11.219> more<00:05:11.580> love<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:11.849> more

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
we would reflect more love and more

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.260 
we would reflect more love and more
happiness<00:05:12.719> and<00:05:13.050> more<00:05:13.259> joy<00:05:13.560> well<00:05:14.550> I'd<00:05:14.849> like<00:05:15.210> to

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
happiness and more joy well I'd like to

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.670 
happiness and more joy well I'd like to
see<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.710> university<00:05:17.610> take<00:05:18.539> a<00:05:18.870> much<00:05:19.229> stronger

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
see the university take a much stronger

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.320 
see the university take a much stronger
stance<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.610> would<00:05:21.180> hope<00:05:21.960> that<00:05:22.320> people<00:05:22.919> who<00:05:23.789> are

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
stance I would hope that people who are
