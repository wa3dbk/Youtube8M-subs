00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.549
 and now that they have known registering pelÃ© 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.160
 stay on the street and I'm Anthony 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.769
 My name is Pascal My name is Giovana Alone 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.610
 elite are also broke a tinga and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.610
 dance company 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:33.480
 one of the pieces that I like to do is 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 our dream is going you dance and have fun 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.290
 in the beginning it was boy dance types 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.510
 I like to dance with my partner because 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.880
 You have to trust your non-partner. 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.880
 can trust only in himself on Saturday 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:06.810
 when there is a change and it gets very crazy 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.120
 when the pascal dances he is very 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.390
 skillful and everyone talks uaw that 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:17.310
 This guy when I'm dancing is like 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.580
 if I could float in the water I could 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580
 fly 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.780
 the meringue is a fun dance 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:40.460
 I am American so merengue is the 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.460
 that defines a Dominican 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.350
 I feel like a star when I 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.050
 I defend myself by presenting myself on stage 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.670
 choreography comes out naturally I train 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.649
 a couple of times and then go dancing 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.420
 it 's not like a brain memory is kind 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.100
 a much larger memory because you do not 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.369
 have to think the space you did not stay 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.369
 nervous 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.680
 God knows the best thing in the world.
