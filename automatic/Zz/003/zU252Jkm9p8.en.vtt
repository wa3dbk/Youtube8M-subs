00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.379
 Welcome to the forecast of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:09.090
 bayer 04 leverkusen against borussia 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.599
 dortmund today's question is therefore 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.920
 can stop at the bvb express 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.920
 We'll just go for it 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.570
 statistics on and see that bayer against 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.760
 borussia dortmund in the last eleven 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 could not even win the game 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.240
 The last victory they had in the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.590
 first day of the season 2010/2011 in the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.400
 direct comparison, however, it is very 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.859
 balanced 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.870
 out of the 67 the bavaria and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.860
 they had dortmund against each other 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.200
 each won 24 and 19 are 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.350
 drew a draw on the home 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.450
 and the balance is very interesting 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.090
 bayer was able to announce 17 home wins 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.770
 however dortmund only seven home victories 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.710
 but could 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.469
 dortmund 17 out of six victories 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 and at only 7 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.320
 so it seems a lot today 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.180
 to become balanced game and us 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.980
 can be curious how it goes out 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.989
 Both teams are natural 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.850
 highly motivated, it's about here 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.530
 some dortmund in third place 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.600
 bayer 04 leverkusen on the second 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.369
 space both they are the prosecutor of 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
 Bayern Munich at the moment has both 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.659
 a projection of 14 points 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.150
 leverkusen and 15 points on borussia 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.680
 dortmund also from the view of the bavaria 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.530
 Of course there would be a draw here 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.030
 optimal for the table result 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 So let's have a look at this fifa 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.420
 Forecast with all goals and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 highlights and finally I will 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.170
 then just do it again even a 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.240
 Predict how the game might play 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.650
 well then should go now 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.070
 first start with the offense 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.540
 dortmund starts and yes they are 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.549
 Of course, not quite clear at the beginning 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.950
 how can we counter leverage here? 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.040
 Advance answers to 4 on the outside there 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.350
 it can go there comes the pass 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.140
 not to be clarified but unfortunately one 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.560
 a transfiguration so to speak 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.350
 God knows lewandowski had that 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 one has to chop the space and shoots 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.340
 misses the gate 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.500
 at just under two meters 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.470
 After that, the Dortmunder are one again 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.400
 continuous attack on reus has now burst 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.010
 Royce shoot and I miss the goal 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.110
 twice they have carved 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:24.120
 lewandowski and reus meet nevertheless 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.970
 otherwise always here idol added 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.860
 on Blaszczykowski slight costly so on 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.860
 lewandowski has space again and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.959
 magda goebbels shot yes we see here 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.180
 clearly only chances of borussia 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.650
 dortmund von leverkusen was still there 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.480
 nothing to hear here now lewandowski 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.079
 has space and there lace the thing 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.629
 purely no thing yes there has the defense 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.989
 not quite paid attention there was the gap 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.750
 and lewandowski meets his thirteenth 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.200
 if I have the right thing he has 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.970
 met twelve times before and that 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.319
 was now a number 13 so that he would be 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.739
 in second place with kießling 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.310
 together that was just here thus 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.769
 the only chance for leverkusen in the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.859
 first half and then we see now 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.889
 once again a chance for borussia 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.420
 dortmund in the first half 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.620
 laskowski with such a feeble one 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.760
 shot that was it already 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.700
 the second half then goes too 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.000
 continue with a chance for 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.010
 leverkusen castro on I'm still out 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.819
 I'm with odd suitcase from 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.950
 Kiessling 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.630
 Kiessling 1 on beautiful school I know 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.340
 what he is supposed to do is confuse the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.329
 defense jumps in and yes can there 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.260
 do not do anything here first 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:49.230
 changed and we look at the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.819
 next chance at borussia dortmund in 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.819
 attack blaszczykowski 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:05.010
 pisczek gündogan purely flanked and the 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:06.870
 has leno blindfold yes 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.520
 only one chance for dortmund one wanted 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:14.400
 then the counter-castro think there in 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.930
 the 83 minute now seen the game 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.269
 but at times real chance now 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.010
 here shortly before closing only ten 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.530
 minutes to play castro makes the gate 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.560
 to the 1 2 1 of course they are 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:34.410
 leverkusener ready now 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.030
 to shoot the second or not there you go 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.490
 first a foul free kick for 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.180
 leverkusen from a new good 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.330
 position 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.830
 You can play well in the scalp 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.470
 Do not really care where to go with that 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.000
 game in principle even to the end of 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.010
 tried shot rhine again all 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.900
 both sellers no problem 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.570
 and then it can be easy too 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.950
 be resigned since then stands again 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:05.340
 shoots also says the same conclusion 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.110
 game will go out one on one time 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.789
 again as in the last forecast 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.470
 I'm not so sure about that 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.020
 11 will really go out 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.130
 the end try again from dortmund 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.850
 I think the game will be two too 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.240
 zero go out 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.500
 and I really think that leverkusen 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.360
 can do it today 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.830
 what do you mean, just write in 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.190
 the comments we'll see you at 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.190
 next time
