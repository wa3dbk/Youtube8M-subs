we<00:03:50.360> can<00:03:50.840> just<00:03:51.200> throw<00:03:51.440> this<00:03:51.830> in<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.430> dehydrator

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
we can just throw this in the dehydrator

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.110 
we can just throw this in the dehydrator
and<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.930> do<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.520> just<00:03:55.520> to<00:03:55.700> warm<00:03:55.910> them

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
and I like to do this just to warm them

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.740 
and I like to do this just to warm them
up<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.450> gives<00:03:56.540> them<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.810> nice<00:03:56.959> soft<00:03:57.580> texture<00:03:58.750> put

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
up it gives them a nice soft texture put

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.270 
up it gives them a nice soft texture put
it<00:03:59.840> in<00:03:59.930> there<00:04:00.110> for<00:04:00.140> an<00:04:00.380> hour<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.740> could<00:04:01.040> put<00:04:01.190> it

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
it in there for an hour you could put it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.210 
it in there for an hour you could put it
in<00:04:01.310> there<00:04:01.490> for<00:04:01.520> longer<00:04:02.050> and<00:04:03.050> I<00:04:03.620> like<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:03.980> cover

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
in there for longer and I like to cover

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.610 
in there for longer and I like to cover
it<00:04:04.430> because<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.910> keeps<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.450> from<00:04:05.930> drying<00:04:06.260> the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
it because it keeps it from drying the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.100 
it because it keeps it from drying the
apples<00:04:06.980> out<00:04:07.160> so<00:04:07.820> just<00:04:08.150> get<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.450> glass<00:04:08.810> container

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
apples out so just get a glass container

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.110 
apples out so just get a glass container
i<00:04:09.500> definitely<00:04:10.130> recommend<00:04:10.220> glass<00:04:10.700> versus

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
i definitely recommend glass versus

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
i definitely recommend glass versus
plastic<00:04:11.600> stick<00:04:12.470> this<00:04:12.620> in<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.980> dehydrator<00:04:13.130> on

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
plastic stick this in the dehydrator on

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.870 
plastic stick this in the dehydrator on
115<00:04:15.140> for<00:04:15.770> about<00:04:15.980> an<00:04:16.070> hour<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.370> they<00:04:16.730> will

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
115 for about an hour and they will

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.979 
115 for about an hour and they will
soften<00:04:17.090> up<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.390> little<00:04:17.419> bit<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.750> get<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.930> little

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
i'll put a link down below for that and

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.740 
i'll put a link down below for that and
then<00:04:34.100> just<00:04:34.280> freeze<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.760> in<00:04:35.060> ice<00:04:35.210> cube<00:04:35.480> trays

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
then just freeze it in ice cube trays

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.290 
then just freeze it in ice cube trays
now<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.530> takes<00:04:36.740> about<00:04:36.950> 2<00:04:37.370> cups<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.820> almond<00:04:38.120> milk

a Vitamix for it to be able to actually

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.880 
a Vitamix for it to be able to actually
reach<00:04:46.040> with<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.370> tamper<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.240> get<00:04:47.450> totally
