like a Dollar Tree product sometimes

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.260 
like a Dollar Tree product sometimes
it's<00:05:41.890> tricky<00:05:42.100> at<00:05:42.340> Dollar<00:05:42.490> Tree<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:43.000> don't<00:05:43.180> get

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
things and they first come out and so I

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.830 
things and they first come out and so I
finally

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
finally

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.320 
finally
waited<00:05:47.830> long<00:05:48.130> enough<00:05:48.160> I<00:05:48.580> was<00:05:48.700> patient<00:05:48.910> and<00:05:49.210> I

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
waited long enough I was patient and I

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.090 
waited long enough I was patient and I
finally<00:05:49.570> was<00:05:49.870> able<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:50.170> find<00:05:50.500> three<00:05:50.860> decent

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
finally was able to find three decent

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.930 
finally was able to find three decent
looking

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
looking

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.900 
looking
and<00:05:52.300> so<00:05:52.810> now<00:05:52.960> I<00:05:52.990> have<00:05:53.110> all<00:05:53.320> three<00:05:53.770> and<00:05:54.100> I'm

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.360 
and so now I have all three and I'm
happy<00:05:55.360> love<00:05:55.780> these<00:05:56.050> because<00:05:56.800> they're<00:05:57.100> white

happy love these because they're white

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
so that means like when the seasons

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.320 
so that means like when the seasons
change<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.190> can<00:06:00.430> put<00:06:00.580> different<00:06:00.670> color<00:06:01.060> tea

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
change you can put different color tea

change you can put different color tea
Lots<00:06:01.540> in<00:06:01.750> them<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:02.230> they<00:06:02.440> can<00:06:02.470> just<00:06:02.770> be<00:06:02.920> for
