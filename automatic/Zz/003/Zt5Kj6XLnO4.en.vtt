 your donations page also for the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.879
 people who are interested and like it and 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.530

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.980
 thanks 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.829
 see you here information from 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.679
 442 Android device 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.740
 with a cyanogen-based kernel because 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:05.260
 the round is cyanogenmod 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.340
 but well I 'm using it right now 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.100
 the flash boe and it goes great as far as 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.760
 sound quality the performance of 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.800
 drums 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.690
 it improves in a couple of hours surely 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.470
 what else can we bring you to be good 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.470
 the dealer 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.979
 if we give it here we see that it is blank 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.840
 also in the blue is one of the changes 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.799
 more significant with other versions 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.799
 from this same rom 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.369
 the contact table 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.899
 well we have speed and the test for 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.969
 write much faster add pause 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.450
 two seconds or add wait during 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.450
 a call 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.130
 if we go to the contacts 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.360
 shows us in black also with the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.680
 consequent energy savings as well 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.409
 that as we have seen in the menu 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.460
 adjustments if we go to adjustments too 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.799
 it's all black 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.850
 novelties of this version because the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.850
 options that we have 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.960
 in handling the cells have also 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.670
 been redesigned black and white itself 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.230
 all the clothes are black and white with 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.540
 which one 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.989
 Optimally indicated for a better 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 Battery management incorporates 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.610
 notifications something and multi windows and 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.320
 we must activate and not often used 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.200
 but it's good for people who do 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.700
 He liked me 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.190
 and options that you will have to go 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.490
 doing research 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.760
 my advice is it's a pretty good rom 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.050
 of using it 7 days or so and I think 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.380
 that I'm going to stay with her 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.870
 it perfectly manages the 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.780
 ram and you forget any kind of the 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.050
 app 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.870
 and the truth is that it is very very good 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.319
 Ron 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.690
 the google gaps that incorporates bring to 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.069
 pole for example from the player 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.069
 cyanogen music 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.069
 what else does he bring 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.540
 google the gaps will have to see 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.540
 here 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.990
 but I look for them bring us the notes of 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.330
 keep 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.560
 in news and time the playbook is play 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.960
 of kiosk and studio play music spain 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.510
 movies in order the complete data of 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.120
 google that do not give any kind of error 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.000
 at the time of some core process of 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:46.640
 america forgiveness and nothing I recommend is 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.319
 try it, I'm delighted with an idea 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.260
 the truth and visit the web a greeting and 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.099
