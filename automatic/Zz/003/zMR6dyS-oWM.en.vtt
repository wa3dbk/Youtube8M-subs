starting to get an army of My Little
Ponies<00:00:18.590> we've<00:00:18.920> got<00:00:19.130> two<00:00:19.400> more<00:00:19.609> to<00:00:19.670> do<00:00:20.019> we<00:00:21.019> have

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
Ponies we've got two more to do we have

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.759 
Ponies we've got two more to do we have
Twilight<00:00:22.869> Sparkle<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:25.900> Rainbow<00:00:26.900> Dash<00:00:27.289> so

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
Twilight Sparkle and Rainbow Dash so

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.939 
Twilight Sparkle and Rainbow Dash so
we're<00:00:27.980> going<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:28.310> do<00:00:28.490> Twilight<00:00:29.919> Sparkle<00:00:30.919> and

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
we're going to do Twilight Sparkle and

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.490 
we're going to do Twilight Sparkle and
then<00:00:31.249> we'll<00:00:31.400> finish<00:00:31.640> off<00:00:31.970> with<00:00:31.999> Rainbow<00:00:32.900> Dash

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
then we'll finish off with Rainbow Dash

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.610 
then we'll finish off with Rainbow Dash
so<00:00:34.340> what<00:00:34.520> we'll<00:00:34.700> do<00:00:34.880> is<00:00:35.120> we'll<00:00:35.630> quickly<00:00:35.930> jump

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
so what we'll do is we'll quickly jump

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.260 
so what we'll do is we'll quickly jump
across<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.130> you<00:00:37.250> can<00:00:37.399> see<00:00:37.610> what<00:00:37.820> you<00:00:37.940> will<00:00:38.120> be

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
across so you can see what you will be

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.270 
across so you can see what you will be
building<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:38.900> then<00:00:39.350> we'll<00:00:39.530> jump<00:00:39.800> into<00:00:40.130> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
building and then we'll jump into the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:01:06.860 
building and then we'll jump into the
tutorial

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.260 

right<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.140> we're<00:01:08.290> back<00:01:08.440> so<00:01:08.940> similar<00:01:09.940> again

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
right and we're back so similar again

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.420 
right and we're back so similar again
the<00:01:10.630> bodies<00:01:10.990> are<00:01:11.200> all<00:01:11.380> pretty<00:01:11.680> much<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.190> same

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
the bodies are all pretty much the same

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.040 
the bodies are all pretty much the same
for<00:01:12.760> this<00:01:12.880> model<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.560> we'll<00:01:14.740> do<00:01:14.950> this

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
for this model so we'll do this

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.690 
for this model so we'll do this
hopefully<00:01:17.050> if<00:01:17.140> you've<00:01:17.320> been<00:01:18.100> building<00:01:18.550> the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
hopefully if you've been building the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.750 
hopefully if you've been building the
other<00:01:18.820> ones<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.479> should<00:01:20.220> should<00:01:21.220> be<00:01:21.430> able<00:01:21.550> to

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
other ones you should should be able to

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.359 
other ones you should should be able to
build<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.330> bodies<00:01:22.720> by<00:01:23.110> now<00:01:23.350> pretty<00:01:23.830> easy<00:01:24.130> I

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
build the bodies by now pretty easy I

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.830 
build the bodies by now pretty easy I
would<00:01:24.640> have<00:01:24.760> thought<00:01:24.940> so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
would have thought so

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.010 
would have thought so
same<00:01:26.170> again<00:01:26.470> 2x2<00:01:27.340> square<00:01:27.850> bring<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.540> up<00:01:28.630> twice

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
same again 2x2 square bring it up twice

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.070 
same again 2x2 square bring it up twice
here<00:01:29.610> come<00:01:30.610> around<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.910> back<00:01:31.090> make<00:01:31.720> sure<00:01:31.750> that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
here come around the back make sure that

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.320 
here come around the back make sure that
comes<00:01:32.380> up<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.830> same<00:01:33.040> level<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.790> then<00:01:34.090> add

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
comes up to the same level and then add

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.499 
comes up to the same level and then add
2<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.010> so<00:01:36.010> once<00:01:36.700> again<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.150> want<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.360> then

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
2 to it so once again you want to then

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.630 
2 to it so once again you want to then
bring<00:01:37.690> leaves<00:01:37.960> in<00:01:38.200> and<00:01:38.440> then<00:01:38.979> bring<00:01:39.250> them<00:01:39.430> up

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
bring leaves in and then bring them up

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.510 
bring leaves in and then bring them up
another<00:01:40.149> one<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.780> then<00:01:41.680> on<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.979> second<00:01:42.369> one

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
another one and then on the second one

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.070 
another one and then on the second one
you<00:01:42.759> want<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.030> bring<00:01:43.210> it<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.869> should

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
you want to bring it in so you should

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.540 
you want to bring it in so you should
end<00:01:44.259> up<00:01:44.380> with<00:01:44.440> something<00:01:44.590> like<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.009> for<00:01:45.490> the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
end up with something like that for the

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.510 
end up with something like that for the
actual<00:01:45.850> front<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.360> your<00:01:46.479> model<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:48.250> from

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
actual front of your model and then from

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.700 
actual front of your model and then from
here<00:01:48.790> once<00:01:49.390> again<00:01:49.660> we'll<00:01:49.930> start<00:01:50.050> doing<00:01:50.590> the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
here once again we'll start doing the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.350 
here once again we'll start doing the
face<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.430> could<00:01:51.580> take<00:01:51.729> out<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.090> block

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
face so we could take out that block

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.830 
face so we could take out that block
they<00:01:52.539> don't<00:01:52.840> need<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.289> so<00:01:54.570> as<00:01:55.570> you're<00:01:55.720> looking

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
they don't need it so as you're looking

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.170 
they don't need it so as you're looking
from<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.259> top<00:01:56.289> from<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.280> front<00:01:57.670> you'll<00:01:58.000> end

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
from the top from the front you'll end

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.930 
from the top from the front you'll end
up<00:01:58.330> with<00:01:58.509> like<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.720> giant<00:01:59.229> V<00:01:59.580> then<00:02:00.580> what<00:02:00.820> we

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
up with like a giant V then what we

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.730 
up with like a giant V then what we
could<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.210> find<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.630> cinder<00:02:01.899> block<00:02:02.110> add<00:02:02.350> one

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
could do find the cinder block add one

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.980 
could do find the cinder block add one
there<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.789> blocks<00:02:04.060> next<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.600> add<00:02:04.720> another

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
there the blocks next to it add another

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.740 
there the blocks next to it add another
two<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:06.280> fact<00:02:06.610> we<00:02:06.759> can<00:02:06.910> add<00:02:07.030> free<00:02:07.390> because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
two in fact we can add free because

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.160 
two in fact we can add free because
that's<00:02:07.960> going<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.140> go<00:02:08.259> up<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.679> there<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.869> what

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
that's going to go up to there then what

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.289 
that's going to go up to there then what
we<00:02:11.290> can<00:02:11.380> do<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.650> add<00:02:11.860> our<00:02:11.890> eyes<00:02:12.250> totally<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.269> to

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
we can do is add our eyes totally up to

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.600 
we can do is add our eyes totally up to
you<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.989> can<00:02:14.140> maybe<00:02:14.320> use<00:02:14.620> dark<00:02:14.980> blue<00:02:15.250> for<00:02:15.489> this

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
you you can maybe use dark blue for this

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.240 
you you can maybe use dark blue for this
if<00:02:15.820> you<00:02:15.850> want<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.510> eyes<00:02:16.769> it's<00:02:17.769> totally<00:02:18.130> up

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
if you want for the eyes it's totally up

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.320 
if you want for the eyes it's totally up
to<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.519> I<00:02:18.549> think<00:02:18.760> I'm<00:02:18.850> just<00:02:18.970> going<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.180> use

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
to you I think I'm just going to use

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.670 
to you I think I'm just going to use
black<00:02:19.570> for<00:02:19.600> now<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:22.420> these<00:02:23.170> my<00:02:23.440> little

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
black for now because these my little

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.860 
black for now because these my little
poems<00:02:23.860> they've<00:02:24.100> all<00:02:24.220> got<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.870> different

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
poems they've all got like different

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.020 
poems they've all got like different
types<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.350> eyes<00:02:26.530> but<00:02:26.950> for<00:02:27.459> now<00:02:27.610> I'm<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:27.880> going

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
types of eyes but for now I'm just going

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.500 
types of eyes but for now I'm just going
to<00:02:28.090> show<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.820> simple<00:02:30.820> way<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.030> build

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
to show you like a simple way to build

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.120 
to show you like a simple way to build
it<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.900> then<00:02:32.080> it's<00:02:32.320> up<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:32.769> whether<00:02:32.980> you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
it and then it's up to you whether you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.360 
it and then it's up to you whether you
want<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.459> add<00:02:33.610> your<00:02:34.450> own<00:02:34.510> sort<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.350> twists<00:02:35.920> to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
want to add your own sort of twists to

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.539 
want to add your own sort of twists to
it<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:38.110> what<00:02:38.260> we<00:02:38.440> can<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.709> here<00:02:39.100> add<00:02:39.340> another

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
it so what we can do here add another

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.930 
it so what we can do here add another
one<00:02:39.760> down<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.299> that<00:02:40.480> sticks<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:41.049> there<00:02:41.940> and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
one down so that sticks to there and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.690 
one down so that sticks to there and
that<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.870> pretty<00:02:44.200> much<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.739> front<00:02:45.010> yeah<00:02:45.459> my

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
that is pretty much the front yeah my

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.960 
that is pretty much the front yeah my
little<00:02:45.910> pony<00:02:46.269> done<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> hair<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.640> bit

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
little pony done but the hair is a bit

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.449 
little pony done but the hair is a bit
more<00:02:49.239> different<00:02:49.510> we're<00:02:50.200> gonna<00:02:50.320> use<00:02:50.680> blue

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.800 

because<00:02:54.459> it's<00:02:54.640> supposed<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.000> be<00:02:55.120> purple<00:02:55.600> but

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
because it's supposed to be purple but

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.780 
because it's supposed to be purple but
that's<00:02:56.019> there's<00:02:56.500> not<00:02:56.709> much<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.280> difference

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
that's there's not much of a difference

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.750 
that's there's not much of a difference
there<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.060> I'm<00:02:58.329> going<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.510> use<00:02:58.720> blue<00:02:59.110> for<00:02:59.140> this

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
there so I'm going to use blue for this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.410 
there so I'm going to use blue for this
be<00:03:00.760> red<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.920> some<00:03:03.220> more<00:03:03.250> blue<00:03:03.700> here<00:03:04.120> so

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
be red and then some more blue here so

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.020 
be red and then some more blue here so
that<00:03:04.570> runs<00:03:04.810> across<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.560> that's<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.370> start<00:03:06.790> of

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
that runs across and that's the start of

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.960 
that runs across and that's the start of
the<00:03:07.239> actual<00:03:07.600> hair<00:03:07.840> for<00:03:08.079> this<00:03:08.230> one<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:09.820> then

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
the actual hair for this one so then

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.150 
the actual hair for this one so then
what<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.269> can<00:03:10.420> do<00:03:10.600> is<00:03:10.660> get<00:03:11.560> your<00:03:11.680> skin<00:03:11.920> color

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
what you can do is get your skin color

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.890 
what you can do is get your skin color
out<00:03:12.370> again<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:12.940> want<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.450> diagonal

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
out again and you want one diagonal

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.510 
out again and you want one diagonal
there<00:03:14.319> then<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.770> want<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> bring<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.340> out<00:03:15.459> and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
there then you want to bring it out and

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.020 
there then you want to bring it out and
up<00:03:15.849> diagonally<00:03:16.840> like<00:03:16.959> that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
up diagonally like that

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.880 
up diagonally like that
so<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.209> from<00:03:19.390> this<00:03:19.629> bit<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:20.469> then<00:03:20.650> fill

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
so then from this bit you can then fill

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.349 
so then from this bit you can then fill
in<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.359> so<00:03:22.359> be<00:03:22.780> free<00:03:23.560> by<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.340> square<00:03:25.120> across

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
in this so be free by to square across

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.750 
in this so be free by to square across
here<00:03:25.719> and<00:03:25.930> then<00:03:26.230> just<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.799> 2<00:03:27.040> in<00:03:27.249> there<00:03:27.489> like

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
here and then just a 2 in there like

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.179 
here and then just a 2 in there like
that<00:03:27.870> as<00:03:28.870> you're<00:03:29.139> looking<00:03:29.170> at<00:03:29.560> then<00:03:29.920> what<00:03:30.099> you

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
that as you're looking at then what you

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:36.229 
that as you're looking at then what you
can<00:03:30.370> do<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.760> then<00:03:31.030> place<00:03:31.389> a<00:03:32.040> novel<00:03:33.040> read<00:03:33.219> there

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.000 

and<00:03:37.239> it's<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.719> it's<00:03:38.379> coming<00:03:38.500> together<00:03:38.769> pretty

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
and it's a it's coming together pretty

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.670 
and it's a it's coming together pretty
nicely<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.969> now<00:03:40.120> what<00:03:40.299> we<00:03:40.480> want<00:03:40.629> to<00:03:40.719> do<00:03:40.870> start

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
nicely so now what we want to do start

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.309 
nicely so now what we want to do start
adding<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.159> ears<00:03:42.370> in<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:42.969> from<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:44.019> blacks

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
adding the ears in so from the blacks

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.409 
adding the ears in so from the blacks
you<00:03:44.620> want<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.919> do<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.069> row<00:03:45.310> free<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.209> it's

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
you want to do a row free so it's it's

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.530 
you want to do a row free so it's it's
roughly<00:03:46.959> about<00:03:47.169> where<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.769> hair<00:03:48.540> finishes

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
roughly about where the hair finishes

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.679 
roughly about where the hair finishes
like<00:03:50.169> so<00:03:53.639> so<00:03:54.639> as<00:03:54.700> we're<00:03:54.909> looking<00:03:54.939> for<00:03:55.389> MIT<00:03:55.540> that

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
like so so as we're looking for MIT that

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.020 
like so so as we're looking for MIT that
should<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.079> covered<00:03:56.469> in<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:57.430> one<00:03:57.730> there

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
should be covered in that one there

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.550 
should be covered in that one there
should<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.359> covered<00:03:58.659> in<00:03:58.780> that's<00:03:59.019> that's<00:03:59.379> all

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
should be covered in that's that's all

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.589 
should be covered in that's that's all
good<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.250> then<00:04:00.459> what<00:04:00.819> we<00:04:00.909> can<00:04:01.000> do<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.359> then

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
good so then what we can do is then

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.259 
good so then what we can do is then
bring<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:02.109> out<00:04:02.349> one<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.609> then<00:04:03.790> on<00:04:03.969> this<00:04:04.209> one

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
bring this out one and then on this one

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.420 
bring this out one and then on this one
here<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:05.049> want<00:04:05.230> to<00:04:05.319> then<00:04:05.439> bring<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.829> down<00:04:05.859> free

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
here you want to then bring it down free

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.009 
here you want to then bring it down free
so<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:07.150> one<00:04:07.359> lower<00:04:07.629> than<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.019> ear<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:10.019> like

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
so it's one lower than the ear and like

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.869 
so it's one lower than the ear and like
normal<00:04:11.560> what<00:04:11.919> we<00:04:12.010> can<00:04:12.159> do<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.400> probably<00:04:12.699> fill

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
normal what we can do is probably fill

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.309 
normal what we can do is probably fill
all<00:04:13.000> this<00:04:13.209> thing<00:04:13.449> because<00:04:13.689> you<00:04:13.780> won't<00:04:14.049> really

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
all this thing because you won't really

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.319 
all this thing because you won't really
see<00:04:14.500> most<00:04:15.099> of<00:04:15.370> this<00:04:17.639> you<00:04:18.639> want<00:04:18.849> to<00:04:18.910> blue<00:04:19.120> in

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
see most of this you want to blue in

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.420 
see most of this you want to blue in
here<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.049> then<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.500> can<00:04:20.620> fill<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:20.829> bit<00:04:21.280> in

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
here and then you can fill that bit in

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.649 
here and then you can fill that bit in
there<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:22.120> there<00:04:23.639> right<00:04:24.639> so<00:04:24.909> now<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.150> put<00:04:25.539> the

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:25.659 
there and there right so now you put the

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:28.110 
there and there right so now you put the
blue<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:26.860> there<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.370> gives<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.759> a<00:04:27.820> bit

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
blue that in there it gives you a bit

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.390 
blue that in there it gives you a bit
more<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.419> a<00:04:28.509> marker<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.289> this<00:04:29.500> behave<00:04:29.949> you<00:04:30.220> can

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
more of a marker so this behave you can

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.140 
more of a marker so this behave you can
then<00:04:30.520> add<00:04:30.729> your<00:04:30.909> T<00:04:31.150> pattern<00:04:32.639> so<00:04:33.639> it<00:04:33.759> sits<00:04:34.030> like

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
then add your T pattern so it sits like

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.600 
then add your T pattern so it sits like
that<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.900> that<00:04:35.289> is<00:04:35.440> pretty<00:04:35.860> much<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.370> hair

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
that and that is pretty much the hair

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.240 
that and that is pretty much the hair
complete<00:04:37.090> for<00:04:37.389> this<00:04:37.570> model<00:04:37.930> one<00:04:38.229> this<00:04:38.409> one<00:04:38.650> so

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
complete for this model one this one so

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.589 
complete for this model one this one so
what<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.490> can<00:04:39.639> then<00:04:39.759> do<00:04:39.970> is<00:04:40.090> get<00:04:40.240> your<00:04:40.330> pink

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
what you can then do is get your pink

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.399 
what you can then do is get your pink
running<00:04:41.080> up<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.979> sits<00:04:42.250> in<00:04:42.490> there<00:04:42.699> nicely

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
running up so it sits in there nicely

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.490 
running up so it sits in there nicely
and<00:04:45.120> then<00:04:46.120> what<00:04:46.270> we<00:04:46.389> can<00:04:46.509> do<00:04:46.659> is<00:04:46.780> go<00:04:46.990> around<00:04:47.080> to

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
and then what we can do is go around to

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.960 
and then what we can do is go around to
the<00:04:47.650> other<00:04:47.860> sides

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.620 

and<00:04:52.380> then<00:04:53.380> same<00:04:53.950> thing<00:04:53.980> run<00:04:54.640> this<00:04:54.850> up<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.150> there

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
and then same thing run this up to there

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.100 
and then same thing run this up to there
and<00:04:55.840> basically<00:04:56.710> want<00:04:57.100> this<00:04:57.280> into<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:57.670> 2<00:04:57.970> 2<00:04:58.570> by<00:04:58.780> 3

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
and basically want this into a 2 2 by 3

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.810 
and basically want this into a 2 2 by 3
square<00:04:59.170> and<00:04:59.800> then<00:05:01.950> prior<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:03.220> there<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:03.520> as

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
square and then prior to there so as

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.520 
square and then prior to there so as
you're<00:05:03.970> looking<00:05:04.300> from<00:05:04.420> the<00:05:04.570> top<00:05:04.600> of<00:05:04.930> it<00:05:05.080> it

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
you're looking from the top of it it

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.170 
you're looking from the top of it it
actually<00:05:05.950> looks<00:05:06.250> like<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:08.050> tea<00:05:09.010> you<00:05:09.670> see<00:05:09.850> I<00:05:09.880> mean

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
actually looks like a tea you see I mean

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.240 
actually looks like a tea you see I mean
by<00:05:10.420> that<00:05:10.660> there's<00:05:11.230> a<00:05:11.380> little<00:05:11.590> tea<00:05:11.830> pattern

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
by that there's a little tea pattern

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.310 
by that there's a little tea pattern
there<00:05:12.400> but<00:05:12.610> you<00:05:12.700> want<00:05:12.850> it<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.000> fix<00:05:13.570> those<00:05:13.960> two

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
there but you want it to fix those two

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.120 
there but you want it to fix those two
like<00:05:14.980> that<00:05:15.010> so<00:05:15.940> then<00:05:16.120> what<00:05:16.360> we<00:05:16.480> can<00:05:16.600> do<00:05:16.810> up<00:05:17.590> from

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
like that so then what we can do up from

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.120 
like that so then what we can do up from
here<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.640> want<00:05:18.820> your<00:05:18.910> 2x2<00:05:19.420> square<00:05:19.930> with<00:05:20.920> one

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
here you want your 2x2 square with one

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.240 
here you want your 2x2 square with one
sticking<00:05:21.460> out<00:05:21.670> either<00:05:21.880> side<00:05:22.770> then<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.980> cross

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
sticking out either side then you cross

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.120 
sticking out either side then you cross
patterns<00:05:24.700> like<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:25.390> here<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.140> here<00:05:26.380> on<00:05:26.740> this

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
patterns like so here and here on this

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.880 
patterns like so here and here on this
side<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.730> then<00:05:28.240> the<00:05:28.450> exact<00:05:28.900> same<00:05:29.140> here<00:05:29.560> so

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
side and then the exact same here so

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.070 
side and then the exact same here so
that'd<00:05:30.100> be<00:05:30.130> you<00:05:30.370> send<00:05:30.640> up<00:05:30.850> down<00:05:31.240> one<00:05:31.540> and<00:05:31.810> then

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
that'd be you send up down one and then

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.190 
that'd be you send up down one and then
out<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.620> side<00:05:33.570> you<00:05:34.570> see<00:05:34.780> it's<00:05:34.990> coming

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
out to the side you see it's coming

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.900 
out to the side you see it's coming
along<00:05:35.440> really<00:05:35.500> nicely<00:05:36.220> we're<00:05:36.610> gonna<00:05:36.700> add<00:05:36.880> some

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
along really nicely we're gonna add some

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.960 
along really nicely we're gonna add some
red<00:05:37.270> here<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:37.720> here<00:05:38.170> for<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.620> actual<00:05:38.980> bits<00:05:39.730> on

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
red here and here for the actual bits on

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.840 
red here and here for the actual bits on
the<00:05:40.150> side<00:05:40.390> of<00:05:40.630> the<00:05:40.780> horse<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.550> then<00:05:42.550> what<00:05:42.730> we

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
the side of the horse and then what we

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.680 
the side of the horse and then what we
can<00:05:43.060> do<00:05:43.390> come<00:05:44.290> round<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:45.040> inside<00:05:45.490> row<00:05:46.300> free

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
can do come round to the inside row free

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.500 
can do come round to the inside row free
on<00:05:46.960> here<00:05:47.380> so<00:05:48.010> it<00:05:48.100> runs<00:05:48.340> down<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:48.880> there<00:05:49.210> like

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
on here so it runs down to there like

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.380 
on here so it runs down to there like
that<00:05:49.810> nice<00:05:50.560> little<00:05:51.070> zigzag<00:05:51.550> pattern<00:05:51.970> same

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
that nice little zigzag pattern same

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.000 
that nice little zigzag pattern same
with<00:05:52.570> this<00:05:52.690> side<00:05:52.750> so<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.290> want<00:05:53.530> to<00:05:53.620> come<00:05:53.800> all

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
with this side so you want to come all

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.360 
with this side so you want to come all
the<00:05:54.280> way<00:05:54.310> around<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:55.240> inside<00:05:55.450> here

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
the way around the inside here

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.550 
the way around the inside here
one<00:05:57.370> two<00:05:57.700> free<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:58.600> then<00:05:58.870> drop<00:05:59.170> it<00:05:59.320> down<00:05:59.350> to

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
one two free and then drop it down to

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.860 
one two free and then drop it down to
there<00:06:00.070> and<00:06:00.310> this<00:06:00.700> is<00:06:00.910> gonna<00:06:01.270> be<00:06:01.510> like<00:06:01.690> the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
there and this is gonna be like the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.750 
there and this is gonna be like the
start<00:06:02.200> of<00:06:02.290> your<00:06:02.500> legs<00:06:02.680> for<00:06:02.950> this<00:06:03.070> bit<00:06:03.400> built

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
start of your legs for this bit built

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.150 
start of your legs for this bit built
here<00:06:04.090> so<00:06:04.900> what<00:06:05.110> we<00:06:05.230> could<00:06:05.380> do<00:06:05.560> from<00:06:05.860> these

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
here so what we could do from these

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.370 
here so what we could do from these
blocks<00:06:06.400> here<00:06:06.790> drop<00:06:07.090> it<00:06:07.240> down<00:06:07.419> all<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.230> way<00:06:08.320> to

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
blocks here drop it down all the way to

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
blocks here drop it down all the way to
the<00:06:08.620> floor<00:06:09.360> like<00:06:10.360> so<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:11.140> then<00:06:11.440> free<00:06:11.890> up<00:06:12.040> here

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
the floor like so and then free up here

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.490 
the floor like so and then free up here
so<00:06:12.880> that<00:06:12.910> joins<00:06:13.270> up<00:06:13.540> nicely<00:06:13.840> with<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.230> two

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
so that joins up nicely with the two

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.220 
so that joins up nicely with the two
sticking<00:06:15.010> down<00:06:15.220> and<00:06:15.520> then<00:06:16.120> two<00:06:16.390> in<00:06:16.600> here<00:06:16.930> like

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
sticking down and then two in here like

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.990 
sticking down and then two in here like
that

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
that

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.909 
that
