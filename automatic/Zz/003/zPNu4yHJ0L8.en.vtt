it's just coming from two locations and
then<00:01:18.860> with<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.070> virtual<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:19.610> will<00:01:19.700> actually

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
then with the virtual it will actually

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.820 
then with the virtual it will actually
input<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.540> show<00:01:20.660> you<00:01:20.720> where<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.080> extra<00:01:21.590> speed

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
input and show you where the extra speed

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.980 
input and show you where the extra speed
is<00:01:22.010> being<00:01:22.250> added<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.060> for<00:01:23.090> instance<00:01:23.360> on<00:01:23.750> your

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.520 
is being added so for instance on your
5.1<00:01:24.890> solutions<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.970> will<00:01:26.150> actually<00:01:26.270> add<00:01:26.630> 25

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530
