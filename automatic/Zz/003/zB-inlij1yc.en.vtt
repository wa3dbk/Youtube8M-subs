00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.859
 simple 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.859
 from beginning to end 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.920
 hello welcome to the new video of 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.480
 mechanical my name is Jesus and today we go 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.400
 to see the status of our filter 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.600
 air and if necessary to change it if 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.420
 want to expand the information of 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.830
 air filter enters the website of rodez 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.350
 also on the web you can find 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.210
 information about spare parts pass the 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:36.070
 vehicle and give the thing to get off comfortably 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:37.540
 from your house the air filter serves 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.900
 to prevent impurities from entering into 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.490
 of motor 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.230
 we have to have to have in 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.420
 account that your state is the ideal 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.130
 prevent it from being obstructed and increasing 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.110
 our fuel consumption the 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.670
 location of the air filter always 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.640
 we near the top 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.100
 of the engine and close to the mission is the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.830
 air intake to the engine in this model 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.530
 in particular to it is necessary to release this 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.080
 clamp that catches the intake tube 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.430
 where we have the temperature sensor 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.810
 we will proceed to release the clamp and 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.790
 pull tube width is the following 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.090
 drop this pipeline we will proceed to 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.359
 release the screws 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.740
 that closes the filter cover of the year 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.509
 once removed the four screws in 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.610
 this case we will proceed to open the box 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.440
 of the air filter 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.230
 but you can see the filter leire which 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.610
 let's take out we can check a 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.130
 filter that we have removed from our 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.130
 vehicle and a new filter the state of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.440
 Our filter is right yet 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.420
 let's proceed to clean it so that it 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.280
 stay in the best conditions with a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.220
 simple manometer that we can have in 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.020
 house or a gas station will always throw 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.140
 the air in contradirection as it enters 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.970
 which means that the air does enter 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.590
 on this side we are going to talk backwards 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.850
 so that the little dirt that 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.850
 we can have our air filter 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.600
 once we have our filter clean 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.600
 let's clean the housing of it 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.450
 let's proceed to assemble our filter 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.090
 of clean air 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.390
 we have to take into account in the cover 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.280
 that we have two accommodations 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.280
 that go in those accommodations 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.900
 Once the lid is assembled, we return to 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.360
 tighten our four screws and 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.890
 we assemble the intake tube 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.320
 we will keep in mind that it does not loose 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.880
 no cable or connector and 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.880
 we will tighten the clamp 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.730
 and with this we conclude this
