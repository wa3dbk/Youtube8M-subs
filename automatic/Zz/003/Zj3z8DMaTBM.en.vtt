00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.710
 ah 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.110
 you have to walk people to youtube 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.520
 welcome to this new video a boxing 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.920
 this time I bring you the unboxing 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.779
 of the clock but this time it is 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.790
 a smart watch because my name is 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.830
 concept of smart watches is 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.380
 good because now we are going to be a 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.080
 little more comfortable let's say is an example 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.060
 This clock is connected via Bluetooth to 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.370
 our smartphone ok 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.140
 this watch receives calls messages 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.090
 all the notifications that are going to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.430
 get to our smartphone ok by 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.579
 example if you are driving you do not have to 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.070
 take out your smartphone and just see the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.850
 notification from the clock ok it's more a 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.460
 little safer than walking out 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.989
 smartphone from your bag that just flip 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.090
 to watch the clock a few seconds so 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.980
 good apart from that it will be safer 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.480
 is going to be more comfortable etcetera so why 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.390
 that interested me what has been the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.280
 concept of smart watches and 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.780
 Well, it's practically that, so 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.690
 let's see a bit of what's coming 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.700
 being the sides of the box so 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.770
 Well, here we are seeing what 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.560
 the sides are the part of 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.970
 back for example here let's see what 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.080
 what is being said the bowl 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.140
 here it is 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.490
 it's the same on one side as on the other 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 it's good not to mention here for example 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.140
 says it's via bluetooth and it's 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.660
 available with android and what comes next 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.910
 being the iphone ok so we're going to 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.440
 arrange we are going to open what comes 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.640
 being the package we are going to open the clock 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.530
 so good this time not 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.290
 I found my magic knife with an edge like that 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.480
 I had to grab this this knife 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.670
 so let's take what's coming 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.830
 being the plastic and let's see what 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.830
 wave that brings us inside the box 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.940
 here battle a little with what's coming 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.610
 being the open the box brings a little or 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.040
 It is difficult at the beginning but it is not 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.270
 impossible so first price not 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.730
 obviously we have what is being 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.930
 the clock we are going to put the box this 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.370
 side 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.120
 here we have what is the clock 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.280
 let's take it out and when taken out of the clock 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.790
 it is not difficult this yes it was more difficult 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.410
 open the box and at the end of the box in 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.050
 the bottom of the box we have what comes 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.209
 being two papers let's see what they are 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.209
 let's put the box well 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.859
 first we have what is being 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.829
 important information about 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:50.209
 product ok and on the other paper it comes 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:53.129
 being an installation guide for 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.519
 installation or a guide to start 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.530
 fast that so good let's leave 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.659
 these papers on the one hand we are going to 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.239
 leave them here aside and let's see 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.810
 what's up with this watch, let's start 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.859
 to remove what is still a as the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.859
 chain the strap 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.450
 ok and here inside brings us what comes 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.190
 being the watch charger for example 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.430
 here you can see what the clock is 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.880
 with 33 buttons on one side and the other 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.750
 side you will find the back button 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.750
 ok here we can see 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.130
 here for example let's show them 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.930
 what is being the charger as 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.690
 can see has two small magnets and 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.790
 what is already being those two little ones 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.320
 piquitos that I forgot the name but 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.660
 is where the current passes so that 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.980
 load the clock ok as you can see then 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.630
 it is very easy the charger via usb and 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.040
 well there's practically nothing much to see 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.680
 there ok 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.699
 in what is coming the charger would go 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.699
 from this position 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.990
 on the other side ok I would go more or less 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.120
 this position as you can see this 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.820
 it simply sticks obviously because 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.220
 bring a magnet 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.680
 but well here, more or less, it would go like this and 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.650
 the battery of this watch would already be charged 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.300
 it lasts about a week which 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.150
 I also liked it compared to the 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.070
 other smart watches since there are others that 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.630
 they load this good they have to 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.820
 load every day as if it were a 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.820
 smartphone ok here we already learned what 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.060
 it's been our watch and well here 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.880
 for example this one we have to connect 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.520
 via bluetooth to our smartphone like this 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.400
 how good are we going to see here the clock says 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.640
 install and run the application of peru 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.410
 ok I already installed it and I ran it so 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.270
 now the application told me that what 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.060
 will connect via bluetooth so right now 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:16.000
 my smartphone is looking for the watch like this 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.000
 that already found it let's connect it 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.780
 and for example here it tells us that if 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.640
 we want to link the let's give that and 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.350
 in our Peru we will also give 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.360
 that if there is one that is already 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.800
 connected we have to obviously good 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.200
 we have to see I wanted it to be 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.430
 connected there already says and we're going to give it 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.230
 here allow ok once already the already 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.450
 we have given all the permits to our 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.300
 smartphone to our smartphone and 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.590
 also our smart watch is going to 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.380
 start downloading an update 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:52.050
 as you can see here it says 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:54.600
 update link and is at 17% 18% 19% and so 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.910
 will continue up to 100% ok 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.470
 once it is already updated what 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.420
 that being the system software and and 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:07.350
 Well, it's going to let us do some tests 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.150
 of sms and also called ok for example 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.460
 if I give you here on calls we 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.910
 would appear that way as if 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.620
 I give the messages in the sms 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.620
 would appear in this way 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.210
 ok and good practically that would be all 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.530
 that would be all more than anything because of this one 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.840
 boxing I hope you liked it 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.090
 sorry if I got a little bit but good and 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.210
 the truth I have a long time without 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.840
 make a boxing and good the truth now 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.310
 yes I'm losing the practice and 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.290
 I hope to continue releasing videos more often 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.900
 but not practically that is all 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.580
 I repeat for this a boxing wait for the 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.680
 review I'm going to review you about 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.690
 of this smart watch since it is very pro 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.120
 the truth the information of this video 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.240
