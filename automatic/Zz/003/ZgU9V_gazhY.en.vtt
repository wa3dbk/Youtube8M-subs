00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.700
 parties has always been exciting and 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.390
 I must say that it is perfectly maintained 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.830
 in the latter version then 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.410
 in the interior we will see that it has succeeded in 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.310
 distance everyone with innovations 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.779
 valid consistent for nothing sterile e 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.000
 instead elegant thing really not easy 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.940
 but now let's start with the strength of his 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.450
 numbers 310 horsepower of the engine 156 and two 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.149
 the specific power in liter horses 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.899
 4 93 the relationship this power 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:53.100
 bow to the horse with me at the wheel 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 let's put it to the test immediately 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.570
 the select drive and in dynamic start 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.329
 almost with light control e 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.640
 acceleration is assisted by fields 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.979
 will march beautiful but very comfortable 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.899
 and hear the popping sound at the drain 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.789
 very nice during gear shifting 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.009
 in the resumption of 70 kilometers an hour yes 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:38.479
 feels the benefit of the engine 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:41.090
 turbo combined with a sixth with an engine 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.289
 certainly one of the strengths of the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.509
 tt s 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:47.140
 and in fact its specific power makes it 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.020
 puts among the best 4 petrol turbos 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.869
 current and stands out in particular 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.880
 let's watch it fund for its system of 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.649
 power a double system of 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.270
 feeds in fact here you see the 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.450
 high pressure injection pump 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.700
 direct and here instead the fuel rail 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.939
 of the multipoint injection that comes 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.860
 used in all partitions 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.560
 also the turbocharged turbine unit 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.810
 plus turbine and compressors of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.030
 Japanese production hee hee e 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.190
 the intercooler unlike all the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.880
 other engines fitted on this one 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.470
 platform is an air to air intercooler 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.079
 the electromechanical steering to a 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.329
 the progressive gear rack the 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.890
 which means having a steering wheel away 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.859
 more direct depending on the angle 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.989
 let's try it immediately in a test 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.780
 special for steering the science 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.630
 whitman eu which consists in carrying out 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.510
 of constant amplitude rotations but 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.459
 frequency gradually increasing and this for 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.560
 understand if the car's answers in 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.200
 terms of yaw and acceleration 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.569
 side hold and here you see that 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.209
 even if the frequency increases 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.970
 rotations the car always responds not 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.120
 it never becomes dumb and this means yes 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.440
 gives very sporting steering response 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.959
 immediate great precision 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.700
 in making the curve and therefore never 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.980
 there will be a need to correct 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:17.720
 during the brooding really a great one 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:20.989
 4x4 system screen in the audi tts a 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.750
 performance system that helps to have 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.640
 greater lateral hold since 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.080
 traction ordinary broken hands 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.420
 on the four wheels 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.060
 and in fact here the findings showed 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.230
 superior lateral acceleration well 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.420
 greater than one turn 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.209
 moreover here is of motion from the tor crec 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.579
 toning that the couple is not exposed 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.500
 on the external wheel to the fault but 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.299
 even brakes the inner wheel e 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.439
 therefore it helps to keep the trajectories 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.439
 very narrow 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.650
 and here is the 4x4 system of the atiesse that 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.240
 audi calls as permanent as ever 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.120
 as you see a fourth haldex 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.040
 generation with control of 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.230
 electronic control unit on the pump 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.060
 electric that creates the pressure that 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.650
 closes the disks and therefore allows the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.480
 transfer of torque to the wheels 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.200
 back and this transfer 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.270
 it happens even in the absence of any 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.070
 slip of the front wheels only 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.140
 because the control unit is capable of 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.850
 interpret the methods of use 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.220
 of the car 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.910
 entry into the curve fast change corner 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.220
 fast lane on track you can 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.590
 get even to disarm 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.810
 completely the spies and here the tts vi 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.670
 will entertain with his big one 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.460
 stability and the engine is always 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.780
 completely available because not 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.880
 cut by electronic check and if 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.580
 exploited thoroughly but really thoroughly 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.370
 then he will allow me to do also some 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.970
 very well controllable drift e 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.970
 secure 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.690
 the rear suspension of the tt it 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.420
 represents the best interpretation 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.940
 of the type three and a half levers 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.980
 multi link capable of ensuring great 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.650
 longitudinal flexibility for 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.900
 improve comfort through the lever 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.810
 longitudinal above all its bushing 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.770
 very flexible and placed higher 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.770
 of the wheel center able to ensure 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.780
 a convergence recovery in the in 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.110
 outside the curve by the lever 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.420
 fake steering and increase the angle of 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.940
 kamber through the upper lever of 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.640
 kamber recovery to get more grip in 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.560
 curve and then look at the end 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.570
 the steering axle is tilted 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.760
 backwards with negative custer e 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.880
 this explains why all this 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.550
 great stability and now wide to the picture 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.340
 tools just a touch on the button 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.740
 of the steering wheel and here is the panorama la 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.070
 navigator map whose accuracy 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.470
 whose technicality has no competitors and if 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.550
 you want a racing vision 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:08.430
 here is the big tachometer in the center 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.980
 of the instrument panel and then drive select 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.650
 to accept the car or inefficiencies 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.680
 molin comfort or automatically in dynamic 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.450
 individual oony to choose the 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.630
 engine response as a function of 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.880
 accelerator pedal the flying pair la 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.930
 calibration of audi shock absorbers 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.240
 magnetic ride 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.450
 all as you can see with one 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.990
 innovative realization very easy to 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:38.070
 see consult instinctive and at 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:41.110
 very very elegant finish 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.590
 in conclusion after the tests we have 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:50.400
 made the perceptions previously manifested by 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:55.169
 this new gts the very personal style 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:58.150
 sporty because low compact and streamlined 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.040
 and decidedly more racy he said 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.160
 the angle of the night is further 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.720
 reduced only 17 degrees 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.490
 a real fastback and then interiors 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.780
 futuristic in total respect 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.130
 of rationality and elegance 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.460
 plus with simple controls 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.530
 intuitive never distress the 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.160
 mechanical behavior obviously is 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:27.340
 excellent and not an exaggeration of mine 

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:31.360
 because the tts developed to the minimum 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:34.300
 details so as to be perfect though 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.280
 being a 4x4 urging it with the 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.710
 more difficult maneuvers, ie shooting 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.690
 release at low speed is not felt 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:45.370
 the slightest vibration and then above all e 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:49.000
 funny if we want to find a mole 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.169
 then we can tell the kits in place 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.360
 of the spare wheel 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:56.169
 in the sports file it is dedicated to everyone 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:58.990
 coupe and cabrio at newsstands with the number 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:02.289
 of June of four wheels you will find the 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:06.479
 complete test of the ttf with the results 

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:06.479
 objective measured by the test center
