00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.379
 I want to welcome you to the monitor 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:15.360
 Comparison of company c is available for selection 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:18.270
 the model 23 67 fh and ce 23 69 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.680
 vm these two monitors stand for 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.160
 Choice so that we better first 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.960
 see 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.490
 I'll turn it off like that and so on 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.769
 see the two monitors are looking 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.390
 relatively similar to the one is probably in 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.550
 be successor or parallel 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.829
 Project both look very similar from the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 difference is in principle once the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.980
 foot and once the monitor so we 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.860
 see below there is one 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.800
 much wider frame than here and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.699
 from the back dimension you have to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.379
 also say that both monitors so different 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.050
 one has an integrated one 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.850
 power supply and the other not 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.359
 that is now from the 69 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.760
 He has an integrated power supply and the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.920
 others are really completely narrow 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 which has an external power supply what here 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.210
 below is from the connections if 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.729
 we are already on the back 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.390
 take almost nothing of the 6 9 has 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.700
 a display port connection more and me 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.830
 I think he also has 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.030
 integrated speakers and I see 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 Here, too, such a possibility of 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.710
 kensington locks and the 760 year of 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.990
 it does not have that has an external 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.640
 power supply has VGA input twice hdmi 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.470
 and yes I think he also has 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.009
 Speakers below how that looks 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.210
 but are definitely chmelar and 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.750
 here in kensington, too 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.880
 from the back looks the 67 years 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.899
 plastic but noble narrow also the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.490
 Suspension is nice and the 69 years 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.729
 he is a bit wider and looks like that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.729
 out 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.110
 both consume about the same amount of electricity 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.739
 water of a 29 kilowatt hours per 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.569
 year and the other 47 as a minimum 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.250
 difference that maybe five 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.830
 euro or so when it comes up well 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.290
 is sitting roughly so I now 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.850
 not so much anymore, if anything 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.790
 a lot of difference is three euros believe 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.830
 I see from the outside that the monitor 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.630
 Both have similar optics up 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.489
 the stand so you can see the upper one 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.680
 area is held relatively helpless 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:43.190
 a lower edge of silver 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:48.690
 Plastic and one has a round 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.060
 down round round holder and the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.830
 others not 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.150
 what is the reason the reason put 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.040
 suspension because both again 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.470
 the different one is bit 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.720
 nobler hung by his 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.030
 curved, curved bracket 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.739
 has no wall bracket and the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.799
 Another is he put reminds me 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.290
 something to the bracket of samsung and 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.950
 also has the wall mount is there 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.950
 prepared 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.090
 furthermore both can only be inclined 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.700
 So that will be the only one 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.310
 Adjustment height or turn 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.590
 goes to the two not online panels 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.209
 I have to say both have ips panels 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.209
 grown with led backlight 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.980
 and are the same size the same 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.140
 dissolution of servants something 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.320
 different one here the one 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.359
 has buttons that are here at the 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.670
 back and the other 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.260
 he has the buttons down I switch 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.810
 right now a white because that is also 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:52.109
 again which number which is that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.980
 the 69 that the 67 we see of the 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.930
 picture that one very nice 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.370
 is or jumps back and forth in the video 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.900
 it is in the 1 I could only 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.370
 unfortunately drive via vga 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.470
 That's why I would not now the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.140
 I compare pictures with each other 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.540
 both panels are almost identical to what you are 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.620
 I do not see a big difference 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.970
 have not tested it any longer 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.549
 I also say I have no dvds now 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.650
 or similar looks but in principle 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.370
 are both really the same of 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.530
 to those 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.329
 On the values â€‹â€‹I hold it some 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.020
 behind then both have in the same 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.810
 big frame of one stands here 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.210
 the higher the with the 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.470
 the 69 wider it also slightly higher 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.850
 because he heart recently with in it that is 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.650
 this one exactly 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.410
 Overall, I would say both monitors 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.990
 are ideal combinations for 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.330
 a mac so both monitors see from 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.910
 front really noble and make it 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.970
 very nice impression of the manufacturer 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.590
 Lake is new in Europe in the market 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.080
 Asia has been on the market for a while now 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.000
 It would also have experience built it 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.600
 is not a complete newcomer but where to go 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.460
 have to say 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.810
 The monitors both have such a 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.949
 I do not like that property that way 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.250
 just because I'm a bit samsung 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.490
 I'm spoiling her plastic 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.050
 has been installed is not quite 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.660
 high quality so there is more beautiful 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.699
 touch for the eye is always this 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.930
 monitor optimal but you firmly there 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.580
 one that both monitors came soja 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.650
 plastic what is coated like 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.979
 aluminum is unfortunately only plastic 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.599
 it is a pity both from the foot and 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.400
 is it so that both wobble a bit so 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.349
 now here more about the boxes 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.660
 but somehow they do not work that way 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.300
 solid impression and wobble and that is 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.710
 pity I think that's not a problem 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.419
 if you where I have a desk 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.000
 but if you work on the railway line 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.919
 or if you often take the monitor with you 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.410
 or shocking space is then noticeable 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.880
 one that it is not so nice 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.550
 Overall, I would say both have 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.400
 a price difference of around the 10 15 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.430
 up to 20 euros is a matter of taste in the end 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.650
 which one one takes one could now 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.760
 of course the comparison of the values 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.919
 I do not want to do that 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.990
 can you do better I think both 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.590
 have a great accessory and I think 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.150
 the one tells me something more about that 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.280
 fashion as the corners worked 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.190
 are that fits a bit more to the mac's 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.229
 also rounded corners has how one 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.740
 The other one can see this here 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:21.590
 Tailor is held alike 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.030
 a lot of representation is one has to say that 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.150
 the one becomes much narrower and 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.410
 the other offender acts i will that 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.330
 again, if they really compare 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.070
 panels can be the same but me 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.370
 I think a bit optically 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:39.840
 moved so the 69 he has acts 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.669
 just fat the 69 yes again has 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.970
 down here the service below 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:47.520
 you can see the buttons and the 67 years 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:52.229
 who has the service here at the side 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.810
 and here you can see that's okay 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:59.000
 I tried now to each other 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:04.530
 I can say that very well 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.199
 So exactly how the monitors are from the 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.030
 size of the width of the tali than table 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.080
 and I think that's really just 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.330
 the operation and a power supply 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.699
 otherwise they would want to work 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.789
 determines the same similar panel 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:20.130
 you can see, I'm the one 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:23.070
 opinion both look very noble and 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:27.229
 make a good field of view and fit 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.229
 actually really good for the mac
