00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.940
 There is a message from God in the 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.160
 planet Mars NASA announced that the 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.410
 robot curiosity rover has found a 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.140
 unequivocal message of God written in 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.690
 boards in a Martian cave of agreement 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.880
 with an official press release two 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.650
 giant stone slabs are found 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.530
 inside a cavern in a 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.480
 great mountain on Mars behind one of 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.730
 the tables you read a copy of the ten 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.570
 commandments and the text of John chapter 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.329
 3 verse 16 written in 12 languages 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.519
 including english spanish chinese euskera 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.609
 and Hebrew in the other there is a message 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.819
 simple in English in which you read 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:51.039
 I am real according to the scientists who have 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.929
 studied the discovery widely 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.699
 these results may have 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.350
 definitely established the 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.859
 Christianity as the only religion 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.679
 true this is incredible says without is 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.809
 covington an Australian researcher from 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.299
 work of the exploration program 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.250
 marte in the nasa we went to the cave in 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.810
 look for water and instead we 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.440
 we found with the proof of the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.870
 existence of god 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.780
 the rover curiosity of the nasa came to 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.460
 marte in August of the year 2012 with the 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.650
 mission to explore the climate and 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.590
 geology of Mars looking for signs of 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.930
 habitability so far the mission has 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.150
 been a success with the discovery of 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.950
 an old seabed and the substances 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.440
 Chemicals necessary for life 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.130
 suggest that mars once was suitable for 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.170
 live however the tablets that are 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.660
 signed with the words peace and love 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.360
 key represent the most 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.520
 significant to date and is perhaps 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.370
 the most important scientific event of 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.590
 the history cinemas covington said no 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.590
 can you tell how those tables came 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.630
 but if I can tell you one thing, there is no 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.240
 a single atheist in the control room of the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.240
 nasa what we saw was amazing
