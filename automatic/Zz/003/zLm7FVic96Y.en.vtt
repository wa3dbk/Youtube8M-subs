00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
win first position you need to have to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.040 
win first position you need to have to
move<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:24.180> how<00:02:25.180> do<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.390> know<00:02:25.420> if<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:25.900> to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
move so how do you know if you have to

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.770 
move so how do you know if you have to
move<00:02:26.230> well<00:02:26.800> let's<00:02:27.280> show<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.520> one<00:02:27.790> way<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.630> can

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
move well let's show you one way you can

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.920 
move well let's show you one way you can
go<00:02:28.990> by<00:02:29.230> columns<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:30.760> your<00:02:30.970> system<00:02:31.450> you're

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
go by columns in your system you're

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.320 
go by columns in your system you're
playing<00:02:32.200> white<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:33.100> your<00:02:33.280> columns<00:02:33.790> would<00:02:34.150> be

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
playing white so your columns would be

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.030 
playing white so your columns would be
your<00:02:34.540> king<00:02:34.840> row<00:02:34.990> 30<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:36.000> 32<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.650> 831<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:39.480> 732<00:02:41.040> 629

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
your king row 30 to 32 to 831 to 732 629

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.120 
your king row 30 to 32 to 831 to 732 629
to<00:02:42.310> 5<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:42.940> what<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.510> would<00:02:43.690> do<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.380> you

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
to 5 and what you would do is you you

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.100 
to 5 and what you would do is you you
count<00:02:45.370> all<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.940> checkers<00:02:46.330> where<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.750> red<00:02:46.930> or

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
count all the checkers where the red or

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.600 
count all the checkers where the red or
white<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.530> those<00:02:48.310> rows<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:49.239> find<00:02:49.510> out<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:51.130> if<00:02:51.459> we

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
white in those rows to find out so if we

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.699 
white in those rows to find out so if we
go<00:02:51.790> here<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.900> we're<00:02:53.050> going<00:02:53.170> down<00:02:53.380> in<00:02:53.530> there's

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
go here and we're going down in there's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.479 
go here and we're going down in there's
no<00:02:53.830> checker<00:02:54.100> so<00:02:54.340> that's<00:02:54.520> 0<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:55.630> go<00:02:55.780> 31<00:02:56.489> just

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
no checker so that's 0 you go 31 just

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.360 
no checker so that's 0 you go 31 just
check<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:57.970> here<00:02:58.150> that's<00:02:58.360> 1<00:02:58.650> go<00:02:59.650> here<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.100> none

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
check to here that's 1 go here this none

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.710 
check to here that's 1 go here this none
zero<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.380> it's<00:03:02.500> one<00:03:02.709> checker

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
zero so it's one checker

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.190 
zero so it's one checker
one<00:03:04.720> piece<00:03:05.400> one<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.520> an<00:03:06.640> odd<00:03:06.850> number<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.870> odds

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
one piece one is an odd number so odds

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.930 
one piece one is an odd number so odds
if<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.680> it's<00:03:09.340> an<00:03:09.459> odd<00:03:09.610> number<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:11.140> say<00:03:11.940> you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
if you it's an odd number and say you

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.060 
if you it's an odd number and say you
have<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.269> move<00:03:13.450> it's<00:03:14.140> an<00:03:14.230> even<00:03:14.530> number<00:03:14.560> you

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
have to move it's an even number you

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.759 
have to move it's an even number you
don't<00:03:15.250> have<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.519> move<00:03:15.670> on<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.239> us<00:03:16.420> ok<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.650> other

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
don't have to move on to us ok the other

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.520 
don't have to move on to us ok the other
way<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.040> check<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.640> out<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.940> jumbled<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:19.989> in<00:03:20.320> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
way to check it out is jumbled so in the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.090 
way to check it out is jumbled so in the
time<00:03:20.739> so<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.640> 15<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.269> 19<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.019> 10<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:23.980> go

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
time so you go 15 to 19 so 10 and you go

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.170 
time so you go 15 to 19 so 10 and you go
15<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.640> 19

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
15 to 19

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.960 
15 to 19
now<00:03:25.480> sapir-whorf<00:03:26.080> system<00:03:26.680> 11<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.580> paid<00:03:27.820> off

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
now sapir-whorf system 11 is paid off

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.640 
now sapir-whorf system 11 is paid off
before<00:03:29.220> 19<00:03:30.220> is<00:03:30.400> paid<00:03:30.610> off<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:30.970> 27<00:03:31.600> red<00:03:32.470> in

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
before 19 is paid off with 27 red in

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.160 
before 19 is paid off with 27 red in
order<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:32.980> move<00:03:33.489> he<00:03:33.670> has<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.970> retreat<00:03:34.480> so

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
order to move he has to retreat so

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.539 
order to move he has to retreat so
that's<00:03:35.470> another<00:03:35.739> way<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:35.980> tell<00:03:36.310> if<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.519> have

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
that's another way to tell if you have

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.940 
that's another way to tell if you have
to<00:03:36.790> move<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.850> now<00:03:40.030> that's<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.870> first<00:03:41.049> step<00:03:41.320> so

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
to move so now that's the first step so

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.410 
to move so now that's the first step so
red<00:03:42.400> goes<00:03:43.829> 27<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:45.190> 32<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.910> now<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:48.850> need<00:03:49.269> to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
red goes 27 to 32 and now you need to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.680 
red goes 27 to 32 and now you need to
get<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.600> king<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:50.799> you<00:03:50.860> go<00:03:51.070> 11<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.519> 7<00:03:51.850> you<00:03:52.510> don't

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
get a king so you go 11 to 7 you don't

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.990 
get a king so you go 11 to 7 you don't
mind<00:03:53.049> if<00:03:53.140> he<00:03:53.260> moves<00:03:53.470> for<00:03:53.709> what<00:03:53.799> 8<00:03:53.980> you<00:03:54.700> know<00:03:54.820> you

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
mind if he moves for what 8 you know you

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.509 
mind if he moves for what 8 you know you
in<00:03:55.329> fact<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.750> makes<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.049> easier<00:03:56.380> figure<00:03:56.650> the

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
in fact it makes it easier figure the

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.120 
in fact it makes it easier figure the
red<00:03:57.700> comes<00:03:57.940> back<00:03:58.150> here<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.989> go<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.980> you

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
red comes back here you go in and you

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.759 
red comes back here you go in and you
get<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.430> okay<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.690> now<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:02.350> have<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.590> do<00:04:02.650> your

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
get you okay so now you have to do your

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.020 
get you okay so now you have to do your
second<00:04:03.130> step<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.310> got<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.989> got<00:04:05.170> your<00:04:05.350> king

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
second step you got you got your king

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.750 
second step you got you got your king
red<00:04:07.030> goes<00:04:07.239> here<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.950> come<00:04:08.950> out<00:04:09.100> you're<00:04:09.670> gonna

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
red goes here you come out you're gonna

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.539 
red goes here you come out you're gonna
use<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:09.970> little<00:04:10.269> psychology<00:04:10.930> on<00:04:11.019> this<00:04:11.549> right

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
use a little psychology on this right

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.600 
use a little psychology on this right
here<00:04:12.820> you<00:04:13.239> come<00:04:13.360> out<00:04:13.630> that<00:04:14.530> goes<00:04:14.739> here<00:04:14.950> doesn't

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
here you come out that goes here doesn't

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.400 
here you come out that goes here doesn't
matter<00:04:15.670> if<00:04:15.849> he's<00:04:15.970> going<00:04:16.180> back<00:04:16.390> at<00:04:16.599> 14<00:04:16.989> you're

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
matter if he's going back at 14 you're

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.759 
matter if he's going back at 14 you're
gonna<00:04:17.500> make

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
gonna make

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.479 
gonna make
the<00:04:17.829> same<00:04:18.039> rules<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.489> go<00:04:18.639> here<00:04:18.879> he<00:04:19.690> goes<00:04:19.870> huh

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
the same rules you go here he goes huh

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.969 
the same rules you go here he goes huh
you<00:04:21.489> go<00:04:21.669> here<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.120> now<00:04:22.599> it's<00:04:23.379> a<00:04:23.470> good<00:04:23.710> chance

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
you go here and now it's a good chance

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.249 
you go here and now it's a good chance
instead<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.030> going<00:04:25.240> back<00:04:25.449> into<00:04:25.720> the<00:04:25.840> corner

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
instead of going back into the corner

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.640 
instead of going back into the corner
he's<00:04:26.500> gonna<00:04:26.740> move<00:04:26.919> four<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.370> eight<00:04:27.550> now<00:04:28.590> how<00:04:29.590> do

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
he's gonna move four to eight now how do

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.680 
he's gonna move four to eight now how do
you<00:04:29.770> force<00:04:30.069> to<00:04:30.250> win<00:04:30.400> from<00:04:30.550> here<00:04:31.470> they're<00:04:32.470> going

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
you force to win from here they're going

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.540 
you force to win from here they're going
nineteen<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.930> sixteen<00:04:35.319> if<00:04:35.620> he<00:04:35.889> would<00:04:36.039> go<00:04:36.190> here

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
nineteen to sixteen if he would go here

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.610 
nineteen to sixteen if he would go here
to<00:04:36.789> twelve<00:04:37.090> you<00:04:37.720> would<00:04:37.900> just<00:04:38.050> go<00:04:38.199> eighteen<00:04:38.530> to

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
to twelve you would just go eighteen to

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.189 
to twelve you would just go eighteen to
fifteen<00:04:39.039> when<00:04:39.699> he<00:04:39.789> jumps<00:04:40.150> 18<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.599> 19

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
fifteen when he jumps 18 to 19

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.670 
fifteen when he jumps 18 to 19
you<00:04:41.560> jumped<00:04:41.949> fifteen<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.490> thirty<00:04:42.520> one<00:04:43.650> for<00:04:44.650> a

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
you jumped fifteen to thirty one for a

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.980 
you jumped fifteen to thirty one for a
double<00:04:45.039> what<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:48.759> he<00:04:49.180> can't<00:04:49.419> go<00:04:49.569> in

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
double what so he can't go in

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.460 
double what so he can't go in
so<00:04:50.500> he<00:04:50.800> goes<00:04:50.979> here<00:04:51.220> now<00:04:51.819> if<00:04:52.150> he<00:04:52.270> goes<00:04:52.300> here<00:04:53.139> the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
so he goes here now if he goes here the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.080 
so he goes here now if he goes here the
same<00:04:53.740> thing<00:04:53.770> you're<00:04:54.400> gonna<00:04:54.490> make<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:54.880> same

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
same thing you're gonna make the same

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.610 
same thing you're gonna make the same
force<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:55.569> moves<00:04:55.780> you're<00:04:55.960> gonna<00:04:56.110> force<00:04:56.380> him

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
force and moves you're gonna force him

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.450 
force and moves you're gonna force him
to<00:04:56.860> square<00:04:57.900> 2016<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:59.020> 12

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
to square 2016 to 12

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.629 
to square 2016 to 12
that's<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.610> move<00:05:00.819> you<00:05:01.630> go<00:05:01.810> here<00:05:02.250> ask<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.460> move

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
that's the move you go here ask the move

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.390 
that's the move you go here ask the move
attack<00:05:04.630> them<00:05:04.840> again<00:05:05.020> they<00:05:05.680> can't<00:05:05.949> go<00:05:06.130> here

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
attack them again they can't go here

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.010 
attack them again they can't go here
because<00:05:06.430> then<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.389> would<00:05:07.509> go<00:05:07.659> what<00:05:07.780> he'd<00:05:07.930> have

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
because then you would go what he'd have

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.469 
because then you would go what he'd have
any<00:05:08.169> strapped<00:05:08.819> you<00:05:09.819> can't<00:05:10.060> go<00:05:10.240> here<00:05:10.449> because

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
any strapped you can't go here because

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.620 
any strapped you can't go here because
then<00:05:11.229> you<00:05:11.380> go<00:05:11.560> 11<00:05:12.250> to<00:05:12.340> 16<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:13.060> you<00:05:13.389> win<00:05:13.539> the

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
then you go 11 to 16 and you win the

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.399 
then you go 11 to 16 and you win the
checker<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.860> you<00:05:15.550> forced<00:05:15.909> him<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.060> 20<00:05:16.479> 16<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.020> 20

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
checker so you forced him to 20 16 to 20

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:21.990 
checker so you forced him to 20 16 to 20
then<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.340> follow<00:05:19.199> 11<00:05:20.199> to<00:05:20.259> 16<00:05:20.699> he<00:05:21.699> could<00:05:21.849> go

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
then you follow 11 to 16 he could go

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.059 
then you follow 11 to 16 he could go
here<00:05:22.270> or<00:05:22.659> here<00:05:22.690> but<00:05:23.259> it<00:05:23.319> doesn't<00:05:23.530> matter<00:05:23.800> we're

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
here or here but it doesn't matter we're

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.409 
here or here but it doesn't matter we're
going<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.250> show<00:05:24.400> you<00:05:24.460> you're<00:05:24.969> gonna<00:05:25.120> play<00:05:25.270> the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
going to show you you're gonna play the

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.140 
going to show you you're gonna play the
same<00:05:25.449> move<00:05:25.810> because<00:05:26.560> say<00:05:26.860> he<00:05:26.979> goes<00:05:27.190> 24<00:05:27.699> to<00:05:27.819> 28

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
same move because say he goes 24 to 28

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.959 
same move because say he goes 24 to 28
you<00:05:29.050> go<00:05:29.199> here<00:05:29.469> he<00:05:30.340> can't<00:05:30.610> go<00:05:30.729> here<00:05:30.909> because

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
you go here he can't go here because

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.809 
you go here he can't go here because
you'll<00:05:31.509> go<00:05:31.659> here<00:05:31.870> and<00:05:32.050> travel<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:33.340> he<00:05:33.430> comes<00:05:33.669> in

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
you'll go here and travel so he comes in

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.399 
you'll go here and travel so he comes in
here<00:05:34.029> now<00:05:34.539> you're<00:05:34.690> going<00:05:34.779> to<00:05:34.870> drive<00:05:35.080> them<00:05:35.289> out

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
here now you're going to drive them out

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.350 
here now you're going to drive them out
that's<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:35.860> third<00:05:36.069> step<00:05:36.400> you're<00:05:36.909> gonna<00:05:37.090> drive

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
that's the third step you're gonna drive

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.469 
that's the third step you're gonna drive
them<00:05:37.509> out<00:05:37.659> of<00:05:37.719> deal<00:05:38.849> it's<00:05:39.849> a<00:05:39.909> double<00:05:40.180> corner

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
them out of deal it's a double corner

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.100 
them out of deal it's a double corner
you<00:05:40.750> go<00:05:40.900> here<00:05:41.169> his<00:05:42.099> only<00:05:42.430> move<00:05:42.580> is<00:05:42.880> 32<00:05:43.569> to<00:05:43.690> 28

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
you go here his only move is 32 to 28

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.600 
you go here his only move is 32 to 28
and<00:05:44.349> now<00:05:44.860> you<00:05:45.029> max<00:05:46.029> you<00:05:46.210> off<00:05:46.330> again<00:05:46.659> you<00:05:46.810> go<00:05:46.930> 23

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
and now you max you off again you go 23

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.899 
and now you max you off again you go 23
