00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the well there's all three because the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.029 
the well there's all three because the
strikers<00:01:01.050> need<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> stop<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> long<00:01:01.829> ball

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
strikers need to stop the long ball

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.619 
strikers need to stop the long ball
defenders<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.030> got<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> win<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
defenders have got a win it and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.729 
defenders have got a win it and
midfielders<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> make<00:01:04.439> sure<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
midfielders are going to make sure the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.730 
midfielders are going to make sure the
second<00:01:05.100> ball<00:01:05.250> regains<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.150> didn't<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
second ball regains and we didn't do it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.260 
second ball regains and we didn't do it
after<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> 15<00:01:08.070> minutes<00:01:08.520> ago<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> thought<00:01:09.150> we

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
after the 15 minutes ago I thought we

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.580 
after the 15 minutes ago I thought we
were<00:01:09.360> excellent<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.869> particularly<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.560> in

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
were excellent and particularly so in

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
were excellent and particularly so in
the<00:01:10.799> second<00:01:11.159> half<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.610> once<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.479> happened

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the second half and once that happened

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.719 
the second half and once that happened
then<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.290> control<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> ball<00:01:13.979> again<00:01:14.310> dominate

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
then we control the ball again dominate

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.030 
then we control the ball again dominate
the<00:01:14.880> possession<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.530> look<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.890> we

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the possession and we just look like we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.160 
the possession and we just look like we
can<00:01:17.159> score<00:01:17.369> from<00:01:17.430> from<00:01:18.090> every<00:01:18.330> attack<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:19.140> a
