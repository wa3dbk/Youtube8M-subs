00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.340
 This is our second visit to Barnett. 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.920
 marim faro stays here while me muricy 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.460
 I think we've come again 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.109
 it was cold we did not take advantage much more 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.990
 they are super cute part 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:28.740
 it has even a few ruins of a 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:31.140
 ancient aztec civilization being a union 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:37.530
 stay thousand 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:40.620
 with that it was bad the last tiger 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.460
 so it's very interesting and now people 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.460
 will see heat 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 the agreement with the research 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.879
 My dear, one thing that always amazes me is 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.670
 so it is independent of the place you 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.320
 okay for example it is a mistake park and well 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.090
 isolated right 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.750
 but regardless of where you are 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.150
 You will always see what is always the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.400
 bathroom including large bath 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.020
 cross and and well maintained okay 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.049
 It is not always that you are well taken care of but 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 in this case bathroom care is well taken care of 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.680
 drinking fountain 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.549
 so to know here with the environment of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.869
 The beach also has a shower here, right? 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:28.290
 people came to salty and this is a 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.950
 thing that still impresses me is a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 thing like that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.630
 regardless of the place he has a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.780
 excellent infrastructure for the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.689
 futuristic visitor thing that does not exist 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.110
 in brazil or in places great places 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.700
 big you get lucky if you see some 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.820
 bathroom even in that state in that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.810
 poop overflowing in the toilet and here 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:02.280
 very well maintained clean ne er ala eric was 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:06.670
 there you liked the bathroom you did the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.980
 which is a well that she is a woman 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:21.849
 to 1 with advance that is understood very 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:26.050
 cool what you did is not very good 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:40.569
 now where do we go then let's go 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:52.500
 there what do you want to do on oil and 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:52.500
 wants to climb in the ruin has already risen so alone 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.019
 A girl from the ruin shop here is very well. 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.709
 we think it's a 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.870
 old is illegal so here is five 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.940
 ten minutes from home and it 's very fast. 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.690
 and if you get here and burn it even in the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.040
 But it's a panoramic here for you. 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.040
 watch the beach 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:27.570
 the beach is nice sand coarse sand more 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.540
 is a line compared with the others and the 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.719
 people was even that it was stone 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.180
 thick marine but it does not stop 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:44.049
 be in the vein and we're here on the pier 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.780
 small sink and something that calls me to 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.230
 attention has a lot of people fishing 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.540
 practicing mainly would be a 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.060
 very common thing I just saw one 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.310
 person taking even taking out this 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.889
 Dude, there's plenty more to it. 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.769
 fish that are said to have a license 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:07.239
 if someone catches you fishing in the place 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:11.469
 without a license will pay a fine in the 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.519
 The only minimum is that it's too new for me. 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:21.030
 payment 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:24.520
 Let's get something. 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.430
 the filming technique mouth filming 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.960
 clips correctly by that person 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.960
 how is it constrained not to be discreetly 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.960
 best 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.680
 Look, this is not giving to see. 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.699
 right 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:47.590
 Look here, you just passed here. 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:47.590
 underneath you are an invasion of the Nazis 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.569
 to the bombing, right? 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.009
 and what a crazy look this looks like 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:02.009
 are five down and have more behind than 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:06.949
 downloaded 5 on the front information and more 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.949

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.220

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:29.279
 Pretty, this beach, right? 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.960
 We 're really late now, now, what? 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.099
 they are light and six and a half with the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.169
 seven o'clock at night 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:37.520
 so there 's no sun then when hit 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.520
 solo looks much more beautiful, huh? 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.639
 in general here there are more ruins 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.639

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.150
