00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.800
 sum up and so that I do for 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.800
 this week you and generally what I did and 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 The first question we have is Masha 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 answer whether there will be any more games on 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 Myas Crimea our power new blood closer 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.300
 to the topic of course there will be some more 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.460
 games on the channel but I do not think that I will 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.700
 I will return to the parade ground 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.710
 small montages and because i played a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.870
 because I very often start 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.570
 addict and no longer write 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.050
 normal stable video here such 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.050
 here are the pies 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.890
 this question did not want him 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.930
 to bring here zones of similarity 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 very much in general yes I look 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.070
 marit they like me these pink 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.920
 little creatures that are cool 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.920
 they tell her at all it's a sound generator 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 Well , somehow, and I have them looking 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 little sister therefore 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.439
 probably and such love for them in the morning 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.439
 hear May little pony 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.979
 somehow relates to rock music and yes 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.469
 generally to people who hear or 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 playing rock music I started listening after 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.390
 watching your first dumb well at all 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.590
 like more people from my circle 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.799
 most communication 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.140
 yes I am very narrow know how I feel about 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.450
 people who listen and for play 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.640
 probably neutral because it depends 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.649
 who is this person i have yes and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.929
 I can leave my favorite tracks 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.929
 yourself on the wall if you are certainly interested 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.899
 on pike on machine cookies 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.489
 you now have a screen 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.090
 people that I watch 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:08.780
 there are so many of them but they are interesting 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:17.010
 may even replacing and especially and so that 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:19.500
 here are such pies grandfather I wave with someone 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 do you most of all shoot video in general i 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.090
 most often rented with my team 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.670
 rotten can someone she is not familiar 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.690
 very often said podcasts as well as 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:36.690
 by individuals such as Denmark Vanya 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:39.580
 from the top of the miller I still have many many 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.270
 a man who is also stubborn 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.400
 lovely how i made a compliment to myself 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.110
 don't praise yourself nobody praises 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.540
 and the next question is it sounds so what 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.310
 your height and how you picked up so quickly 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.840
 so many subscribers I probably 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.060
 warped this question because 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.570
 I say it from memory well, in general nakakat 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.850
 until the second part of the question I will ignore a 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:10.980
 my height 156 I Malyavka and even with it 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:14.140
 some even become ashamed 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.780
 do you want to play games with 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.980
 subscribers would be time since 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.760
 now may 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.940
 final control it all boils 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.850
 puffs need to pass as best as possible and 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.920
 in the summer I promise you almost every arrow 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.110
 week almost every day will be 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.610
 probably stream on twitch but that's all 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:39.420
 closer to the summer we will not guess 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:44.099
 get like a run 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.770
 some stuffing at your computer while this 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.810
 It will help you as the operating system 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.660
 windows 7 is maximal 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.400
 intel core i5 processor 2 to 7 gigahertz 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.260
 dreams are all new memory 4 gigabytes 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.400
 one which is well all over again new background 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 small and of course our video card 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.920
 geforce 9600 gt 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.959
 all in i finish with this course when i 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.709
 We speak not through every word mate 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:17.250

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.060
 a little bit like you really me 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.239
 swearing 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:26.040
 serodka so to speak, and when a lot of storms 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:29.070
 Emotion or on fan at all omate from me 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.360

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.000
 many then ends a quarter of 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.100
 someone starts the first exam and 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.039
 although I don't know about that at all 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.080
 I will not but still wish everyone good luck 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.620
 who is taking the exam this year is not 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.590
 bring neither down nor pen to you on May 30 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.539
 car wheeled goes to St. Petersburg and that 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.550
 we will do these videos and so 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.220
 almost not going to drag you all week 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.890
 will never be online anywhere because 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:12.210
 that I have a bucket droid it is discharged 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.729
 like a sword and do in general i will make a couple 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.880
 montages and also have to write 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.669
 letspley well as those that we Benny 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.200
 pass this to the eagles with the blue sheep 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:27.390
 and a couple of quests quests Fu achivki my 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.850
 I beat grumbling but not the point in 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.220
 In general, the channel will probably follow 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.650
 Yes, not Vanya Dima, as always 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.020
 happened and will follow roughly 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.150
 the administration will also sit for a while on 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.030
 cyber page and answers questions 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:45.780
 which you are most often interested in can 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.070
 even answers some questions 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.560
 about the video 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.740
 and at the expense of passing because she 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.370
 very often, well, not often communicates with me 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.410
 but still knows when that go in 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.260
 all the same, check my 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.630
 instagram because there will be

 photos small videos 2 tekke can 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.230
 I will write down the block but it will be 50/50 to me 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.450
 laziness or not or not whether Anna will 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.070
 I generally shoot there, but I would like to 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.380
 share your opinion 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.200
 unfortunately to meet there will not work 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.630
 I know that many people live in St. Petersburg 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.840
 because I'm going with a class on a tour 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:27.090
 this year participated heard from friends 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.240
 that St. Petersburg also drove on 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.340
 excursions and things like that in general 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.030
