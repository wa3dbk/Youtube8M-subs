 December that is this excess in Milan 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.450
 here in Verona there is a shitty time 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.710
 it really continues to rain raining enough 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:45.729

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.790
 sports joke I won't talk about kylie anymore 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.990
 forth one of my channels brings the 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.049
 affair 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.670
 I saw the dragon videos thank you 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.890
 he was very clear and also defending 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.799
 I thank him in short, he is a person who 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:11.290
 It respects very much so that's okay by 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:12.550
 I hope the story is over, but 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:21.489
 someone read it from the back lists 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:25.900
 should be liked anyway let me 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.430

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.819

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.819

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:44.500
 to make me forgive you decide that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:47.769
 saw you want bartolomew to make me a bunch 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.540
 that I don't have because I still tell me if 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:58.260
 you want some particular ignition 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:58.260
 maxi or cards that try to do it 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.860
 therefore victims of you will be in Milan 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.760
 so we do find ourselves but anyway 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.290
 I think that before Milan like 45 days 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.680
 first a week before make a crossroads 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.659
 what bouquets can be found of 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.079
 side firecrackers must be played 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.099
 which will never be stronger less strong 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.790
 how to play against certain brands 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.480
 etc 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.209
 so here from 97 we arrive 200 light 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.849

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.849
