lots<00:00:30.560> of<00:00:30.740> information<00:00:30.980> I<00:00:32.050> think<00:00:33.050> it<00:00:33.170> has<00:00:33.380> more

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
emergency fill and that would be seven

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.330 
emergency fill and that would be seven
days<00:01:21.970> but<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.330> here<00:01:23.660> it<00:01:23.780> had<00:01:24.110> in<00:01:24.470> one<00:01:24.979> portion

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
days but in here it had in one portion

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.090 
days but in here it had in one portion
of<00:01:25.429> the<00:01:25.520> book<00:01:25.670> has<00:01:25.819> said<00:01:26.090> 72<00:01:26.780> hours<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.830> we<00:01:27.979> know

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
of the book has said 72 hours so we know

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.999 
of the book has said 72 hours so we know
that<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:28.520> wrong<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.119> when<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:29.539> notice<00:01:30.009> errors

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
that is wrong so when you notice errors

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.770 
that is wrong so when you notice errors
like<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.940> might<00:01:32.119> want<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.330> go<00:01:32.479> ahead<00:01:32.509> and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
like that you might want to go ahead and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.480 
like that you might want to go ahead and
correct<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.500> for<00:01:33.770> yourself

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
correct it for yourself

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.180 
correct it for yourself
scratch<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.450> out<00:01:35.569> in<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.780> book<00:01:35.929> as<00:01:36.050> ideas<00:01:36.530> you

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
scratch it out in the book as ideas you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.740 
scratch it out in the book as ideas you
know<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.580> eat<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.390> has<00:01:38.600> ten<00:01:39.170> practice<00:01:40.130> exams

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
know and eat it has ten practice exams

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.230 
know and eat it has ten practice exams
but<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:41.869> also<00:01:41.990> has<00:01:42.380> end<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.979> chapter<00:01:43.250> exams<00:01:43.850> so

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
but it also has end of chapter exams so

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.320 
but it also has end of chapter exams so
you<00:01:44.330> could<00:01:44.660> just<00:01:44.869> make<00:01:45.050> that<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.470> be<00:01:45.619> about<00:01:45.800> 15

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
you could just make that to be about 15

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.850 
you could just make that to be about 15
to<00:01:47.330> about<00:01:47.959> 20<00:01:48.649> test<00:01:49.310> subjects<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.450> would<00:01:50.600> say

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
to about 20 test subjects I would say

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.130 
to about 20 test subjects I would say
and<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:52.130> those<00:01:52.369> some<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.300> answer<00:01:53.810> sheets

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
and in those some of the answer sheets

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.630 
and in those some of the answer sheets
are<00:01:54.640> incorrect<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:57.259> like<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.069> said<00:01:58.130> you're

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
are incorrect so like I said you're

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.690 
are incorrect so like I said you're
gonna<00:01:58.789> have<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.090> pay<00:01:59.240> attention<00:01:59.569> to<00:02:00.700> simple

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
gonna have to pay attention to simple

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.309 
gonna have to pay attention to simple
errors<00:02:02.000> like<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:02.509> correct<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:03.050> that

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
errors like that and correct it so that

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.820 
errors like that and correct it so that
you're<00:02:03.560> not<00:02:03.800> studying<00:02:04.429> the<00:02:05.149> wrong<00:02:05.420> thing<00:02:05.830> and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
you're not studying the wrong thing and

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.070 
you're not studying the wrong thing and
so<00:02:07.550> I<00:02:07.580> noticed<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.300> lot<00:02:08.450> of<00:02:08.630> things<00:02:08.840> like<00:02:09.020> that

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
so I noticed a lot of things like that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.020 
so I noticed a lot of things like that
but<00:02:09.800> I<00:02:09.830> will<00:02:09.979> say<00:02:10.190> overall<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.849> book<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.569> very

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
but I will say overall the book is very

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.800
