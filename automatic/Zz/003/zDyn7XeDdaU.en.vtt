00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
now the one thing I read in a lot of

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.519 
now the one thing I read in a lot of
reviews<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.120> snare<00:00:03.449> people<00:00:04.200> say<00:00:04.380> that

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
reviews is for the snare people say that

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.800 
reviews is for the snare people say that
they<00:00:04.650> weren't<00:00:04.830> given<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.370> cable<00:00:05.819> for<00:00:06.060> it<00:00:06.180> the

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
they weren't given the cable for it the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.370 
they weren't given the cable for it the
cable<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:08.250> single<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> stereo<00:00:09.360> cable<00:00:09.630> from

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
cable is a single is a stereo cable from

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.379 
cable is a single is a stereo cable from
the<00:00:10.440> drum<00:00:10.740> pad<00:00:10.950> because<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.460> drum<00:00:11.670> pads<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the drum pad because the drum pads the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.110 
the drum pad because the drum pads the
drum<00:00:12.630> pads<00:00:12.809> output<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> stereo<00:00:13.889> output<00:00:14.460> but

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
drum pads output is a stereo output but

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.120 
drum pads output is a stereo output but
the<00:00:15.870> thing<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.650> drum<00:00:16.920> water

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the thing is is that this drum water

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.519 
the thing is is that this drum water
this<00:00:17.460> drum<00:00:17.730> module<00:00:17.880> does<00:00:18.300> not<00:00:18.510> support<00:00:18.990> dual

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
this drum module does not support dual

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.830 
this drum module does not support dual
zone<00:00:19.770> pads<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.150> means<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.660> if

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
zone pads so what that means is that if

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.019 
zone pads so what that means is that if
you<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> dual<00:00:22.380> zone<00:00:22.590> say<00:00:22.980> snare<00:00:23.340> or<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> dual

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
you have a dual zone say snare or a dual

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.660 
you have a dual zone say snare or a dual
zone<00:00:24.210> symbol<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:24.930> ride<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.550> get

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
zone symbol or ride that you have to get

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.410 
zone symbol or ride that you have to get
a<00:00:26.699> splitter<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.470> pad<00:00:28.800> takes<00:00:29.760> up<00:00:29.939> two

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
a splitter and so one pad takes up two

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170 
a splitter and so one pad takes up two
inputs<00:00:30.869> which<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.800> kind<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.160> downer<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.669> as

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
inputs which is kind of a downer but as

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.790 
inputs which is kind of a downer but as
people<00:00:33.329> say<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> snare<00:00:34.320> doesn't<00:00:34.680> come

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
people say that the snare doesn't come

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.620 
people say that the snare doesn't come
with<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> cable<00:00:35.370> but<00:00:35.550> that's<00:00:35.850> actually<00:00:36.059> here

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
with the cable but that's actually here

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.750 
with the cable but that's actually here
it's<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> red<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.160> white<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.579> there

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it's the red one and the white one there

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
it's the red one and the white one there
the<00:00:39.270> red<00:00:39.570> when<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> plug<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> main

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
the red when you plug it in is the main

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.760 
the red when you plug it in is the main
snare<00:00:41.460> voice<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.930> white<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
snare voice and the white one is for the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
snare voice and the white one is for the
rim<00:00:44.010> shot<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.750> know<00:00:45.840> people<00:00:46.200> IM

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
rim shot and so you know people IM

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.930 
rim shot and so you know people IM
guessing<00:00:46.860> i<00:00:46.980> think<00:00:47.250> some<00:00:47.430> people<00:00:47.640> said<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
guessing i think some people said that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.209 
guessing i think some people said that
they<00:00:48.000> thought<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.450> was<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.899> splitter<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
they thought this was a splitter for the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.340 
they thought this was a splitter for the
auxiliary<00:00:51.030> outputs<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.660> something<00:00:52.050> whereas

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
auxiliary outputs or something whereas

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.380 
auxiliary outputs or something whereas
but<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.280> you're<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> hear<00:00:53.850> more<00:00:54.059> but

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
but but you're going to hear more but

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.819 
but but you're going to hear more but
the<00:00:54.539> auxiliary<00:00:55.020> outputs<00:00:55.410> are<00:00:55.559> already

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the auxiliary outputs are already

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.410 
the auxiliary outputs are already
labeled<00:00:56.039> i<00:00:56.280> left<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> mono

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
labeled i left and right there a mono

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.830 
labeled i left and right there a mono
output<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.969> single<00:00:59.969> cable<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.480> split

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
output so that single cable that split

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.360 
output so that single cable that split
off<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> splitter<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.280> your

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
off like a splitter that is for your

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.939 
off like a splitter that is for your
snare<00:01:02.670> pad<00:01:03.229> just<00:01:04.229> would<00:01:04.530> make<00:01:04.680> sure<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
snare pad just would make sure that

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.620 
snare pad just would make sure that
we're<00:01:05.070> clear<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.580> now<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.360> thing<00:01:06.510> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
we're clear on it now the one thing I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.719 
we're clear on it now the one thing I
did<00:01:06.840> notice<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.890> drum<00:01:08.159> kit<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
did notice what this drum kit is that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.080 
did notice what this drum kit is that
the<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> drum<00:01:09.930> pads<00:01:10.229> mount<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> see

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the way the drum pads mount you can see

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
the way the drum pads mount you can see
like<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.840> arm<00:01:13.170> clamp<00:01:13.650> right<00:01:13.950> here

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
like you got this arm clamp right here

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429 
like you got this arm clamp right here
this<00:01:14.490> arm<00:01:14.729> clamp<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.540> L<00:01:15.780> this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this arm clamp and then this L this

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.190 
this arm clamp and then this L this
metal<00:01:16.860> L<00:01:17.009> arm<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:18.119> attached<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.960> frame

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
metal L arm that attached to the frame

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.749 
metal L arm that attached to the frame
and<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:19.619> comes<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> drum<00:01:20.400> pad<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and then comes up to the drum pad to

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
and then comes up to the drum pad to
attach<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> drum<00:01:21.509> pad<00:01:21.720> by<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.140> set<00:01:22.770> screw

attach to the drum pad by this set screw

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.990 
attach to the drum pad by this set screw
well<00:01:24.560> like<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> ion<00:01:26.100> drum<00:01:26.130> marker<00:01:26.610> if

well like on the ion drum marker if

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
well like on the ion drum marker if
anyone<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.200> pads<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.710> be

this drum set is set up so that these
arms<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> flat<00:01:39.689> side<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.140> each<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
arms have a flat side on each on on the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
arms have a flat side on each on on the
opposite<00:01:41.909> sides<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.560> bigger

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
opposite sides of it and one is bigger

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.050 
opposite sides of it and one is bigger
than<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> other<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.520> makes<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
than the other and that makes it so that

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.600 
than the other and that makes it so that
this<00:01:45.299> drum<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.170> pad<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.950> only<00:01:47.250> be

this drum that the pad can only be
mounted<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.840> L<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:50.299> which<00:01:51.299> is

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
mounted on this L on one way which is

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.240 
mounted on this L on one way which is
totally<00:01:52.140> stupid<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.680> ask<00:01:52.710> me<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.220> should
