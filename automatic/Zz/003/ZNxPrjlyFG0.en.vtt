00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
maps are big and if I to describe this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.430 
maps are big and if I to describe this
game<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.640> would<00:00:56.640> really<00:00:57.180> call<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.780> third

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
game I would really call it a a third

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.540 
game I would really call it a a third
person<00:00:58.739> shooter<00:00:59.309> RTS<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.620> build<00:01:02.340> in

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
person shooter RTS so you build in

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.399 
person shooter RTS so you build in
battle<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.090> build<00:01:03.359> different<00:01:03.539> bases<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> can

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
battle you build different bases you can

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.620 
battle you build different bases you can
build<00:01:04.830> what<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.670> built<00:01:05.880> first<00:01:06.210> there<00:01:06.540> in

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
build what I just built first there in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.210 
build what I just built first there in
the<00:01:06.689> middle<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> math<00:01:07.140> was<00:01:07.320> pod<00:01:07.619> beacon<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the middle of math was pod beacon and

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.010 
the middle of math was pod beacon and
what<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> will<00:01:08.610> allow<00:01:08.729> me<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
what that will allow me to do is it's a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.530 
what that will allow me to do is it's a
spawn<00:01:10.409> point<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.150> got<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
spawn point so you see here I got in a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
spawn point so you see here I got in a
gunfight<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.530> both<00:01:13.680> kill<00:01:14.040> each<00:01:14.189> other<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
gunfight we both kill each other but I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.460 
gunfight we both kill each other but I
can<00:01:15.450> spawn<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> middle<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.259> map

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
can spawn here in the middle of map

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.929 
can spawn here in the middle of map
because<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> maps<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.159> pretty<00:01:17.369> big<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:17.759> this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
because the maps are pretty big but this

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.359 
because the maps are pretty big but this
is<00:01:18.119> considered<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> small<00:01:19.110> map<00:01:19.409> by<00:01:19.710> starhawk

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
is considered a small map by starhawk

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.880 
is considered a small map by starhawk
standards<00:01:21.030> now<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> an<00:01:22.140> eight<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.560> eight

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
standards now this is an eight on eight

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.700 
standards now this is an eight on eight

maps soon and that one's going to be a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.390 
maps soon and that one's going to be a
large<00:01:27.810> map<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.229> never<00:01:28.439> played<00:01:28.680> Warhawks<00:01:29.159> why

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
large map I never played Warhawks why

large map I never played Warhawks why
don't<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.000> expect<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
don't you know what to expect for a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
don't you know what to expect for a
large<00:01:30.900> graph<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.439> maps<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.890> me

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
large graph because these maps to me

large graph because these maps to me
we're<00:01:32.460> huge<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.210> I've<00:01:33.420> never<00:01:33.659> played<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
we're huge because I've never played a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
energy that you use to build at these

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.370

gameplays so I built the hawk thing the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.080 
gameplays so I built the hawk thing the
launch<00:02:41.380> pad<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.100> here<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.730> go<00:02:42.819> i'm<00:02:42.910> gonna<00:02:42.970> go

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
launch pad and here you go i'm gonna go

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.080 
launch pad and here you go i'm gonna go
fly<00:02:43.450> all<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.080> can<00:02:44.410> do<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.620> fly<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.430> can't<00:02:45.790> shoot

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
fly all I can do is fly I can't shoot

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.050 
fly all I can do is fly I can't shoot
and<00:02:46.299> fly<00:02:46.450> at<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.600> same<00:02:46.810> time<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.319> actually<00:02:47.680> be

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
and fly at the same time and actually be

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.130 
and fly at the same time and actually be
consistent<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.120> get<00:02:49.299> kills<00:02:49.600> with<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:49.959> so<00:02:50.110> I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
consistent and get kills with it so I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.390 
consistent and get kills with it so I
pretty<00:02:50.350> much<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.650> serve<00:02:51.069> as<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.250> distraction

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
pretty much just serve as a distraction

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.630 
pretty much just serve as a distraction
and<00:02:52.060> then<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.480> usually<00:02:53.019> just<00:02:53.200> get<00:02:53.470> close<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:54.130> go

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
and then I usually just get close I go

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.280 
and then I usually just get close I go
on<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.819> ground<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.299> do<00:02:55.480> right<00:02:55.510> here<00:02:55.750> and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
on the ground like I do right here and

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.140 
on the ground like I do right here and
I'm<00:02:57.100> just<00:02:57.250> gonna<00:02:57.400> try<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.700> start<00:02:58.000> shooting

to build some walls you can upgrade the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.789 
to build some walls you can upgrade the
walls<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.640> larger<00:03:46.090> gates<00:03:46.450> but<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:47.140> don't<00:03:47.680> want

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
weapon bunker and then I wanted a spot

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.140 
weapon bunker and then I wanted a spot
so<00:03:56.799> I<00:03:56.859> could<00:03:57.069> come<00:03:57.220> up<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.489> snipe<00:03:57.850> from<00:03:58.060> a

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
so I could come up and snipe from a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150 
so I could come up and snipe from a
little<00:03:58.420> bit<00:03:58.630> as<00:03:58.870> they<00:03:59.109> were<00:03:59.170> trying<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.920> take

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
little bit as they were trying to take

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.620 
little bit as they were trying to take
over<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.430> middle<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.730> map<00:04:00.880> as<00:04:01.060> well<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.299> end<00:04:01.569> up

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
over the middle of map as well I end up

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.240 
over the middle of map as well I end up
sniping<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.230> guy<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.650> they<00:04:02.709> built<00:04:02.889> a<00:04:02.950> sniper

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
sniping that guy and they built a sniper

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.250 
sniping that guy and they built a sniper
tower<00:04:03.519> over<00:04:03.760> here<00:04:03.880> have<00:04:03.970> no<00:04:04.209> idea<00:04:04.569> why<00:04:04.840> because

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
tower over here have no idea why because

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.660 
tower over here have no idea why because
it's<00:04:05.410> at<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.560> horrible<00:04:05.980> spot<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.459> they<00:04:06.549> had<00:04:06.639> no

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
it's at a horrible spot and they had no

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.240 
it's at a horrible spot and they had no
defense<00:04:07.209> around<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.840> but<00:04:08.590> as<00:04:08.799> you<00:04:08.950> can<00:04:09.040> see

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
defense around it but as you can see

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.620 
defense around it but as you can see
we're<00:04:09.400> losing<00:04:09.730> two<00:04:09.940> to<00:04:09.970> nothing<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.540> I

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
we're losing two to nothing and I

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.849 
we're losing two to nothing and I
haven't<00:04:10.780> really<00:04:10.959> seen<00:04:11.170> anybody<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.769> know

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
haven't really seen anybody so I know

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.289 
haven't really seen anybody so I know
they<00:04:12.100> must<00:04:12.310> have<00:04:12.400> been<00:04:12.519> going<00:04:12.760> on<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:12.940> edges

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
they must have been going on the edges

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.089 
they must have been going on the edges
of<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.420> map<00:04:13.690> there<00:04:14.200> was<00:04:14.319> more<00:04:14.500> routes<00:04:14.799> here

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
of the map there was more routes here

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.920 
of the map there was more routes here
but<00:04:15.280> i<00:04:15.310> mainly<00:04:15.580> stuck<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.209> middle<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.840> i

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
but i mainly stuck to the middle and i

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.229 
but i mainly stuck to the middle and i
wasn't<00:04:17.169> dying<00:04:17.620> very<00:04:17.950> often<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.640> i<00:04:18.700> was<00:04:18.849> able<00:04:19.000> to

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
wasn't dying very often so i was able to

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:19.620 
wasn't dying very often so i was able to
stay

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
stay

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.990 
stay
here<00:04:19.930> but<00:04:20.739> we<00:04:20.860> ended<00:04:20.980> up<00:04:21.190> losing<00:04:21.790> this<00:04:21.940> game

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
here but we ended up losing this game

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.230 
here but we ended up losing this game
and<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:23.440> can<00:04:23.590> see<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.740> XP<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.400> I<00:04:24.430> get<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:25.000> a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
and you can see the XP that I get and a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.060 
and you can see the XP that I get and a
couple<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.930> bonuses<00:04:26.170> I<00:04:26.560> gotta<00:04:26.770> level<00:04:27.010> at

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
couple of the bonuses I gotta level at

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.590 
couple of the bonuses I gotta level at
the<00:04:27.100> level<00:04:27.160> 4<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.820> takes<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.090> while<00:04:28.240> level

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
the level 4 and it takes a while level

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.810 
the level 4 and it takes a while level
of<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:29.020> probably<00:04:29.170> played<00:04:29.470> 10<00:04:29.830> 15<00:04:30.280> maybe<00:04:30.550> 20

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
of like I probably played 10 15 maybe 20

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.970 
of like I probably played 10 15 maybe 20
games<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.510> i'm<00:04:31.660> only<00:04:31.780> level<00:04:32.020> 4<00:04:32.440> at<00:04:32.530> this<00:04:32.710> point

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
games and i'm only level 4 at this point

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.030 
games and i'm only level 4 at this point
I<00:04:33.250> go<00:04:33.640> eight<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.060> two<00:04:34.240> 4300<00:04:35.110> XP<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.800> match

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
I go eight and two 4300 XP in that match

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.910 
I go eight and two 4300 XP in that match
and<00:04:36.400> then<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.150> next<00:04:37.180> game<00:04:37.630> we<00:04:37.870> say<00:04:38.320> map<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.740> just

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
and then the next game we say map I just

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.460 
and then the next game we say map I just
want<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.310> do<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.490> same<00:04:39.730> thing<00:04:40.090> but<00:04:40.660> first<00:04:41.260> I

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
taking over this area and trying to

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.260 
taking over this area and trying to
build<00:04:48.160> bases<00:04:48.520> or<00:04:48.640> anything<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:48.970> can<00:04:49.120> see

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
build bases or anything and you can see

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.700 
build bases or anything and you can see
two<00:04:49.480> guys<00:04:49.630> coming<00:04:50.020> up<00:04:50.140> they<00:04:50.290> must<00:04:50.530> have<00:04:50.650> known

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
i wanted to take over the middle or they

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.640 
i wanted to take over the middle or they
want<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.420> build<00:04:52.510> their<00:04:52.690> own<00:04:52.720> spawn<00:04:53.140> beacons

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
want to build their own spawn beacons

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.920 
want to build their own spawn beacons
and<00:04:54.000> that<00:04:55.000> guy<00:04:55.150> ends<00:04:55.300> up<00:04:55.390> getting<00:04:55.510> killed<00:04:55.780> by

and that guy ends up getting killed by

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.290 
and that guy ends up getting killed by
proximity<00:04:56.350> mine<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.070> then<00:04:57.910> i'm<00:04:58.000> ready<00:04:58.210> to

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
proximity mine and then i'm ready to

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.670 
proximity mine and then i'm ready to
engage<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.750> other<00:04:58.870> guy<00:04:59.080> but<00:04:59.290> he<00:04:59.350> gets<00:04:59.530> killed

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
engage the other guy but he gets killed

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.350 
engage the other guy but he gets killed
by<00:04:59.740> other<00:05:00.010> proximity<00:05:00.550> mines<00:05:00.790> so<00:05:00.970> i<00:05:01.000> get<00:05:01.210> two

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
by other proximity mines so i get two

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.150 
by other proximity mines so i get two
kills<00:05:01.660> here<00:05:01.960> i<00:05:02.140> already<00:05:02.500> have<00:05:02.710> my<00:05:02.740> spawn

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
kills here i already have my spawn

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.880 
kills here i already have my spawn
beacon<00:05:03.370> up<00:05:03.730> and<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.720> i<00:05:04.990> have<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.140> live<00:05:05.620> like<00:05:05.770> a

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
beacon up and the i have a live like a

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.160 
beacon up and the i have a live like a
perk<00:05:06.310> you<00:05:06.460> can<00:05:06.640> choose<00:05:06.910> for<00:05:07.360> your<00:05:07.540> combat<00:05:07.990> it's

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
perk you can choose for your combat it's

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.510 
perk you can choose for your combat it's
like<00:05:08.320> one<00:05:08.560> perk<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.040> the<00:05:09.130> one<00:05:09.250> i<00:05:09.280> have<00:05:09.490> is

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
like one perk and the one i have is

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.430 
like one perk and the one i have is
called<00:05:09.820> rift<00:05:10.060> affinity<00:05:10.600> and<00:05:10.780> what<00:05:11.170> that<00:05:11.290> does

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
called rift affinity and what that does

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.350 
called rift affinity and what that does
is<00:05:11.500> allows<00:05:11.920> me<00:05:12.130> to<00:05:12.220> gain<00:05:12.460> rift<00:05:12.820> even<00:05:13.180> when<00:05:13.270> i'm

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
is allows me to gain rift even when i'm

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.290 
is allows me to gain rift even when i'm
not<00:05:13.540> near<00:05:13.600> my<00:05:13.930> home<00:05:14.140> base<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:14.770> so<00:05:15.610> because<00:05:16.180> in

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
not near my home base and so because in

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.150 
not near my home base and so because in
your<00:05:16.330> face<00:05:16.600> yet<00:05:16.810> i<00:05:16.930> guess<00:05:17.080> energy<00:05:17.620> thing<00:05:17.920> and

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
your face yet i guess energy thing and

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.120 
your face yet i guess energy thing and
it<00:05:18.250> gives<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.700> rift<00:05:19.270> as<00:05:19.570> you<00:05:19.930> just<00:05:20.320> are<00:05:20.650> near

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
it gives you rift as you just are near

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.980 
it gives you rift as you just are near
it<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.520> i<00:05:21.910> don't<00:05:21.940> want<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.300> be<00:05:22.420> at<00:05:22.540> my<00:05:22.630> bases

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
it and i don't want to be at my bases

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.750 
it and i don't want to be at my bases
i'm<00:05:23.110> not<00:05:23.260> defending<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:23.920> I<00:05:23.980> ripped<00:05:24.250> affinities

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
i'm not defending so I ripped affinities

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.700 
i'm not defending so I ripped affinities
so<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:24.970> can<00:05:25.180> start<00:05:25.420> building<00:05:25.570> basis<00:05:26.260> and<00:05:26.500> really

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
so I can start building basis and really

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.080 
so I can start building basis and really
just<00:05:26.890> have<00:05:26.980> a<00:05:27.010> second<00:05:27.430> base<00:05:27.610> for<00:05:27.790> us<00:05:27.910> in<00:05:28.030> the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
just have a second base for us in the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.910 
just have a second base for us in the
middle<00:05:28.270> of<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.390> map<00:05:28.600> and<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:29.500> we<00:05:29.590> can<00:05:29.770> have

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
middle of the map and that we can have

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.850 
middle of the map and that we can have
map<00:05:30.160> control<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.790> hopefully<00:05:31.530> take<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:32.650> flag

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
map control and hopefully take the flag

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.470 
map control and hopefully take the flag
and<00:05:33.070> we<00:05:33.130> have<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.280> one<00:05:33.520> nothing<00:05:33.670> lead<00:05:33.850> here<00:05:34.300> and

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
and we have a one nothing lead here and

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.630 
and we have a one nothing lead here and
i<00:05:34.900> ended<00:05:35.110> up<00:05:35.200> getting<00:05:35.410> inside<00:05:36.280> one<00:05:36.490> of<00:05:36.520> the

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
i ended up getting inside one of the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.190 
i ended up getting inside one of the
Razorbacks<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.330> i<00:05:37.420> got<00:05:37.570> back<00:05:37.750> in<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:37.990> turret

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
Razorbacks and i got back in the turret

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.540 
Razorbacks and i got back in the turret
because<00:05:38.530> they<00:05:38.650> have<00:05:38.770> a<00:05:38.800> weapon<00:05:38.950> bunker<00:05:39.400> up

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
because they have a weapon bunker up

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.490 
because they have a weapon bunker up
here<00:05:39.760> and<00:05:39.880> i<00:05:39.970> wanted<00:05:40.600> to<00:05:40.630> do<00:05:40.780> some<00:05:41.050> damage<00:05:41.260> i

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500
