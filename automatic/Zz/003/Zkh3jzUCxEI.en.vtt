00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.550 

this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.439> demonstration<00:00:02.190> 5<00:00:02.429> from<00:00:02.730> Riedl<00:00:03.000> ferry

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
this is demonstration 5 from Riedl ferry

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.050 
this is demonstration 5 from Riedl ferry
my<00:00:04.560> understanding<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.160> how<00:00:05.190> this<00:00:05.490> works<00:00:05.759> is

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
my understanding of how this works is

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.639 
my understanding of how this works is
that<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.330> mass<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.870> human<00:00:07.170> body<00:00:07.379> is

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
that the mass of the human body is

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.410 
that the mass of the human body is
organized<00:00:08.160> along<00:00:08.460> meridian<00:00:08.970> lines<00:00:09.179> of

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
organized along meridian lines of

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.680 
organized along meridian lines of
flowing<00:00:09.690> energy<00:00:10.340> Blood<00:00:11.340> Bones<00:00:11.670> organs<00:00:12.509> and

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
flowing energy Blood Bones organs and

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.020 
flowing energy Blood Bones organs and
the<00:00:12.780> well-being<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> human<00:00:13.740> organism<00:00:14.030> are

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the well-being of the human organism are

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.930 
the well-being of the human organism are
influenced<00:00:15.660> by<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.809> flow<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> energy

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
influenced by this flow of energy

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.050 
influenced by this flow of energy

should<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.720> called<00:00:30.929> super<00:00:31.320> body<00:00:31.500> yoga<00:00:31.980> because

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
should be called super body yoga because

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.750 
should be called super body yoga because
it<00:00:32.880> affects<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.390> whole<00:00:33.570> body<00:00:34.610> benefits<00:00:35.610> may

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it affects the whole body benefits may

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.580 
it affects the whole body benefits may
be<00:00:35.820> more<00:00:36.090> noticeable<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.809> brain<00:00:37.140> because

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
be more noticeable in the brain because

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
be more noticeable in the brain because
memory<00:00:37.890> improves<00:00:38.629> immediately<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
memory improves immediately and the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.229 
memory improves immediately and the
knowledge<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.379> becomes<00:00:40.890> useful<00:00:41.239> you

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
knowledge you have becomes useful you

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.569 
knowledge you have becomes useful you
see<00:00:42.450> opportunities<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.350> solutions<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.460> your

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
see opportunities and solutions and your

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.660 
see opportunities and solutions and your
physical<00:00:45.059> body<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.620> rejuvenated<00:00:46.670> these

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
physical body is rejuvenated these

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
physical body is rejuvenated these
videos<00:00:48.030> will<00:00:48.239> demonstrate<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.379> please

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
videos will demonstrate this so please

00:00:49.649 --> 00:04:21.720 
videos will demonstrate this so please
