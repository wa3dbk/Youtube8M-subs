00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.180 
there's a lot more comedy and humor
that's<00:04:12.169> underlying<00:04:12.590> which<00:04:12.829> I<00:04:12.919> don't

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
that's underlying which I don't

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.159 
that's underlying which I don't
necessarily<00:04:13.430> think<00:04:13.849> that<00:04:14.150> they're<00:04:15.019> gonna

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
necessarily think that they're gonna

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.500 
necessarily think that they're gonna
play<00:04:15.470> with<00:04:15.680> in<00:04:15.859> this<00:04:16.010> movie<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:17.000> think<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.419> would

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
play with in this movie I think it would

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.300 
play with in this movie I think it would
be<00:04:17.599> interesting<00:04:17.780> if<00:04:18.289> we<00:04:18.349> got<00:04:18.620> some<00:04:18.889> of<00:04:19.160> that

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
be interesting if we got some of that

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.520 
be interesting if we got some of that
vibe<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:19.699> the<00:04:19.849> movie<00:04:20.180> but<00:04:20.389> I<00:04:20.539> mean<00:04:20.690> I<00:04:20.870> again<00:04:21.500> I

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
vibe in the movie but I mean I again I

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.900 
vibe in the movie but I mean I again I
think<00:04:21.709> it's<00:04:21.949> we're<00:04:22.220> gonna<00:04:22.310> see<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.639> lot<00:04:22.820> of

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
think it's we're gonna see a lot of

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.060 
think it's we're gonna see a lot of
people<00:04:23.120> but<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.270> don't<00:04:23.360> think<00:04:23.510> we're<00:04:23.660> gonna<00:04:23.750> get

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
and Marvel Comics anyway is that DC

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.340 
and Marvel Comics anyway is that DC
tends<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.210> be<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.360> lot<00:04:58.540> darker<00:04:58.690> than<00:04:58.900> Marvel

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
tends to be a lot darker than Marvel

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.740
