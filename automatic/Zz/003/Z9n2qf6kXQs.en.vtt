00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 welcome to the masters of the lane has 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.810
 come the 4.5 patch with buttons and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.970
 adjustments for some champions with this 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.900
 new challengers arrived who will be a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.900
 new rail master 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.350
 these were the masters of the cheek in the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.810
 last chapter but let's see who 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.670
 survives blowout has sat on his 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.160
 throne on the top of a pretty way 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.439
 comfortable but you have to remember that this does not 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.169
 It is definitive and to remind you it arrives 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.940
 to your challenger and now a battle that 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.760
 we all want to see especially because 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.340
 there will be things doing point as in point 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.690
 and straight was an ally in this patch and 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.300
 figure is at its best 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.460
 the winner of this meeting is that 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.230
 now if you are an alternative to the goal 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.600
 and his specialty is the champions who 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.700
 they do not have enough cc to stop it 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.680
 before it activates its definitive 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.710
 the next meeting is through the jungle 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.739
 the current master of the lane is almost his 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.930
 challenger the teacher and a fight fails 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.850
 worth seeing especially because more than 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.149
 you have to be wondering what 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.660
 damn does the master already here or master 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.910
 and the winner of this meeting is 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.860
 teacher and almost that healthy should be maintained 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.840
 century off longer between 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.820
 vacuum attack launches like 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.560
 flash was evolved no longer reduces 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.030
 the damage of the turrets when almost that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.040
 it becomes invisible 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.070
 this adjustment was not what made him lose 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.770
 the master and the new flare object 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.930
 wild simply gives you a quantity 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.509
 Insane in scale and in cleaning the jungle 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.270
 jude and you already have these moments and you must 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.630
 be a totally mandatory van go 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.479
 I never thought I would see this day but the 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.810
 next encounter is for 1000 six is 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.729
 the current master of the lane his challengers 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.580
 oriana in the last chapter we had 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.590
 a challenging something peculiar lulu without 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.210
 However, as expected, they came 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.520
 the new ones for her in this patch 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.800
 Now he arrives in Oriana to declare the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.060
 war six the winner of this meeting 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.159
 is six oriana is a great champion and his 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.769
 definitive is very useful in the fights of 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.050
 team however six comes out victorious 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.650
 the next meeting is in support the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.530
 current master is lion to his challengers zone 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.560
 do not wait I got the wrong image 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.630
 now yes this patch also work 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.160
 some have for lioness reducing their 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.160
 resistance armor bonus 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.220
 magical in the w eclipse the winner of his 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.800
 meeting is leonard sincerely me 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.690
 like much more zone or three but this 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.550
 list is not about my favorites but 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.890
 of those that offer more utility in 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.010
 each of the different encounters and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.720
 that's where lioness wins last meeting where 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.940
 the master of the lane will be decided 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.690
 analyze the current master of the lane is 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.030
 jinks your challengers I make a big effort 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.430
 bus for my effort in this patch those 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.560
 code cupcakes people and those 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.450
 pistols although they are not the most 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.550
 interesting to play have a 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.410
 excellent performance in your lane and now 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.350
 scale quite well in a game 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.590
 late or let gain the winner 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.340
 of this meeting is links 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.280
 unfortunately for me it is ford tom 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.830
 james in my opinion is still the best 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
 adc as far as the year is concerned and sulette 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.040
 game is also good 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.800
 these are centuries we are from the lane to 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.520
 the patch 4.5 you have to remember that this 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.910
 stop of champions is only 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.940
 to play on alone that this is not a 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.820
 viable composition to play as 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.530
 team only in just I want is 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.960
 I'm probably touching a bit by 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.640
 the patches that rays could do without 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.130
 But in the next chapter we will be 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.030
 up to date luck and until next time 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.030
 chao chao
