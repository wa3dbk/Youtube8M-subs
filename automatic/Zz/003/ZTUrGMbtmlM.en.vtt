00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
swivels and it opens out that way it's a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.240 
swivels and it opens out that way it's a
swiveling<00:00:59.100> sheet<00:01:00.379> see<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.710> focus<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:12.859 
swiveling sheet see if I can focus this
in<00:01:04.729> okay<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:07.040> guess<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.189> came<00:01:11.270> anyways<00:01:12.270> there's<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
in okay I guess I came anyways there's a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
in okay I guess I came anyways there's a
swiveling<00:01:13.260> sheet<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.369> would<00:01:14.490> be

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
swiveling sheet which I think would be

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.390 
swiveling sheet which I think would be
easier<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> use<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.960> those<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.740> fixed<00:01:17.100> sheath

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
easier to use and those are fixed sheath

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.030 
easier to use and those are fixed sheath
and<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.400> good<00:01:20.790> sheath<00:01:21.740> that's<00:01:22.740> not

and this is a good sheath that's not
coming<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.970> other<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> knife's<00:01:25.590> not

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
coming out of the other the knife's not

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.390 
coming out of the other the knife's not

it's<00:04:07.540> just<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:08.020> think<00:04:08.410> it's<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.620> Hanson<00:04:09.010> knife

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.100 
it's just I think it's a Hanson knife
and<00:04:09.550> it's<00:04:09.700> really<00:04:10.150> short<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.750> he<00:04:13.960> will

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
and it's really short and so he will

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.490 
and it's really short and so he will
know<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:17.790> personally<00:04:18.790> think<00:04:19.140> you're<00:04:20.140> on<00:04:20.350> this

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
know I personally think you're on this

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.150 
know I personally think you're on this
on<00:04:20.680> your<00:04:20.830> hip<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.690> if<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:23.290> have<00:04:23.410> long<00:04:23.680> lanky

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
on your hip and if you have long lanky

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.280 
on your hip and if you have long lanky
arms<00:04:24.190> like<00:04:24.640> me<00:04:24.850> it's<00:04:25.090> kind<00:04:25.300> of<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.600> hassle<00:04:25.990> to

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
arms like me it's kind of a hassle to

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.040 
arms like me it's kind of a hassle to
kind<00:04:26.560> of<00:04:26.620> pull<00:04:26.830> out<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:28.270> easier<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.690> pull<00:04:28.930> out

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
kind of pull out is easier to pull out

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.130 
kind of pull out is easier to pull out
in<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:29.230> reverse<00:04:29.500> grip<00:04:30.090> but<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.570> think<00:04:31.960> for

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
in the reverse grip but I think for

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.960 
in the reverse grip but I think for
people<00:04:32.470> who<00:04:32.680> have<00:04:32.830> longer<00:04:33.160> arms<00:04:33.190> or<00:04:33.670> Tyler

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
people who have longer arms or Tyler

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.830 
people who have longer arms or Tyler
lanky<00:04:34.780> or<00:04:34.900> town<00:04:35.800> like<00:04:36.010> me<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:37.120> think<00:04:37.660> it's

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
lanky or town like me I think it's

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.450 
lanky or town like me I think it's
