00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
outside and then it has the color of the

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.470 
outside and then it has the color of the
lipstick<00:00:15.019> here<00:00:15.380> and<00:00:15.589> i<00:00:15.799> also<00:00:15.950> like<00:00:16.250> this<00:00:16.520> style

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
lipstick here and i also like this style

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.569 
lipstick here and i also like this style
of<00:00:17.689> lipstick<00:00:18.170> when<00:00:18.590> it's<00:00:18.710> smaller<00:00:19.099> because<00:00:19.369> it

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:19.579 
of lipstick when it's smaller because it

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.580 
of lipstick when it's smaller because it
takes<00:00:19.730> me<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:19.939> while<00:00:20.149> to<00:00:20.210> use<00:00:20.599> a<00:00:20.779> full<00:00:21.140> lipstick

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
takes me a while to use a full lipstick

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.519 
takes me a while to use a full lipstick
so<00:00:21.829> i<00:00:22.040> actually<00:00:22.759> prefer<00:00:22.880> it<00:00:23.270> to<00:00:23.390> be<00:00:23.599> smaller

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
so i actually prefer it to be smaller

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.179 
so i actually prefer it to be smaller
