00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
for mine and next I'll just do the small

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.350 
for mine and next I'll just do the small
vehicles<00:04:36.160> okay<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.610> for<00:04:37.880> these<00:04:38.030> small

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
vehicles okay and for these small

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.260 
vehicles okay and for these small
vehicles<00:04:38.960> we<00:04:39.919> have<00:04:39.949> the<00:04:40.220> Cobra<00:04:40.610> ASP<00:04:41.240> or

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
assault system pod see if it goes

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.480 
assault system pod see if it goes
through<00:04:48.169> this<00:04:48.260> way

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.430 

though<00:04:53.490> they<00:04:53.670> in<00:04:53.700> Kansas<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.780> Luke<00:04:54.990> in<00:04:55.140> camp

actually<00:05:15.590> this<00:05:16.590> trip<00:05:16.830> up<00:05:16.980> works<00:05:18.170> reveals<00:05:21.080> well

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
actually this trip up works reveals well

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.760 
actually this trip up works reveals well
the<00:05:22.200> weasels<00:05:22.530> patent<00:05:22.830> was<00:05:22.980> a<00:05:24.350> total<00:05:25.350> vehicle

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
the weasels patent was a total vehicle

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.560 
the weasels patent was a total vehicle
at<00:05:25.860> this<00:05:26.040> point<00:05:32.240> according<00:05:33.240> to<00:05:33.450> the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
at this point according to the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.940 
at this point according to the
instructions<00:05:36.020> in<00:05:37.020> order<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.380> get<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.650> figure

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
instructions in order to get the figure

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.870 
instructions in order to get the figure
in<00:05:38.220> for<00:05:39.150> easy<00:05:39.360> access<00:05:40.250> the<00:05:41.250> thing<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.580> go<00:05:41.700> like

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
in for easy access the thing to go like

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.770 
in for easy access the thing to go like
this<00:05:42.150> I<00:05:42.830> guess<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.950> figure<00:05:44.190> could<00:05:44.370> just<00:05:44.780> walk

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
this I guess the figure could just walk

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.690 
this I guess the figure could just walk
in

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.200 

next<00:05:51.690> we<00:05:51.810> have<00:05:51.930> the<00:05:52.020> Cobra<00:05:52.380> cloth<00:05:52.770> or<00:05:53.580> covert

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
next we have the Cobra cloth or covert

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.730 
next we have the Cobra cloth or covert
light<00:05:54.480> aerial<00:05:54.960> weapon<00:05:55.880> say<00:05:56.990> flying<00:05:57.990> wings<00:05:58.440> I

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
light aerial weapon say flying wings I

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.920 
light aerial weapon say flying wings I
guess<00:05:59.580> a<00:05:59.610> powered<00:06:00.270> glider<00:06:00.450> maybe<00:06:03.530> had<00:06:05.930> these

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
guess a powered glider maybe had these

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:16.430 
guess a powered glider maybe had these
extra<00:06:08.990> we<00:06:09.990> need<00:06:10.340> extensions<00:06:12.170> or<00:06:13.170> flops<00:06:15.440> came

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
extra we need extensions or flops came

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.950 
extra we need extensions or flops came
with<00:06:16.590> two<00:06:16.770> tiny<00:06:17.040> little<00:06:17.390> micelles

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.420 

one<00:06:21.960> big<00:06:22.170> bomb<00:06:22.440> that<00:06:22.650> you<00:06:22.770> can<00:06:22.920> actually<00:06:23.220> put

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
one big bomb that you can actually put

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.280 
one big bomb that you can actually put
in<00:06:23.580> the<00:06:23.700> figure<00:06:24.600> pulsed<00:06:25.590> or<00:06:26.840> unmanned<00:06:27.840> aerial

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
in the figure pulsed or unmanned aerial

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:37.960 
in the figure pulsed or unmanned aerial
vehicle<00:06:29.160> mode<00:06:33.260> as<00:06:34.260> well<00:06:34.500> as<00:06:34.880> landing<00:06:35.930> wheels

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
vehicle mode as well as landing wheels

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.880 
vehicle mode as well as landing wheels
yeah<00:06:38.970> you<00:06:39.330> don't<00:06:39.420> really<00:06:39.510> roll<00:06:40.410> up<00:06:40.440> well

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:40.890 
yeah you don't really roll up well

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:53.730 
yeah you don't really roll up well
anymore<00:06:41.870> also<00:06:42.870> had<00:06:43.020> a<00:06:45.290> machine<00:06:46.290> gun<00:06:46.350> cover

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.670 

next<00:06:54.740> we<00:06:54.830> have<00:06:55.009> GI<00:06:55.400> Joes<00:06:56.680> Skyhawk<00:06:58.030> this<00:06:59.030> was<00:06:59.210> a

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
next we have GI Joes Skyhawk this was a

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:08.740 
next we have GI Joes Skyhawk this was a
VTOL<00:07:04.000> position<00:07:05.000> the<00:07:05.120> engine<00:07:07.449> works<00:07:08.449> for

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
VTOL position the engine works for

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:14.249 
VTOL position the engine works for
simulated<00:07:09.319> vertical<00:07:09.770> takeoff<00:07:12.789> to<00:07:13.789> arch

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 
and one that Tim just for better close

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.589 
and one that Tim just for better close
up<00:07:41.630> than<00:07:41.930> I<00:07:42.020> might<00:07:42.199> have<00:07:42.229> had<00:07:42.470> before<00:07:43.599> he's

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 
up than I might have had before he's

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:46.480 
up than I might have had before he's
actually<00:07:44.780> well<00:07:45.110> didn't<00:07:45.889> run<00:07:45.979> out<00:07:46.130> at<00:07:46.190> the<00:07:46.280> same

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490 
actually well didn't run out at the same

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.450 
actually well didn't run out at the same
time<00:07:47.229> the<00:07:48.229> original<00:07:48.590> to<00:07:48.740> this<00:07:48.889> actually

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:49.460 
time the original to this actually

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.600 
time the original to this actually
wasn't<00:07:50.030> a<00:07:50.180> number<00:07:50.710> that's<00:07:51.710> the<00:07:52.039> that's<00:07:52.550> the

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:52.610 
wasn't a number that's the that's the

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.820 
wasn't a number that's the that's the
only<00:07:52.819> difference<00:07:52.969> between<00:07:53.240> that<00:07:53.659> in<00:07:54.169> the<00:07:54.259> 1983

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:54.830 
only difference between that in the 1983

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:00.070 
only difference between that in the 1983
version<00:07:55.370> of<00:07:55.460> this<00:07:57.130> this<00:07:58.130> one<00:07:58.280> having<00:07:59.080> more

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 
version of this this one having more

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:07.570 
version of this this one having more
1983<00:08:01.690> molds<00:08:02.690> for<00:08:03.500> the<00:08:04.960> rishis<00:08:05.960> weapons<00:08:06.580> and

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:07.580 
1983 molds for the rishis weapons and

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.689 
1983 molds for the rishis weapons and
that's<00:08:07.759> it<00:08:07.969> for<00:08:08.180> these<00:08:08.270> small<00:08:08.630> vehicles<00:08:09.229> and

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:09.699 
that's it for these small vehicles and

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:13.300 
that's it for these small vehicles and
accessories<00:08:10.699> and<00:08:10.909> places
