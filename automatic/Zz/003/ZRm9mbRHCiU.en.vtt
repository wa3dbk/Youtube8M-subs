00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.700
 I greet all this is Vladimir Chashchin 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.570
 and the distribution of the day especially for 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 pokerstarter . orc today in hand of the day 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:19.039
 we have a tournament for $ 30 at least for 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:22.310
 hyper turbo cis we have a king hand 10 and 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 we will play it on a rifling system 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:32.850
 this is the standard opponent strategy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.980
 flop comes out 57 roll 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.960
 flush draw opponent checks 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.829
 I do not see any reason not to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:47.850
 put a continuation bet of 40 chips i 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:50.489
 I bet it and the opponent just calls to 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 the turn is second jack 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.129
 flop opponent we can do 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.539
 the conclusion that the opponent has no flush draw 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.629
 which he would undoubtedly launch on 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.879
 such a board he has no jack 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.670
 played through check-raise or check-raise 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.610
 push would put either 120 chips either 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.299
 pushed out because with a jack on the wood 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.820
 blackboard 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.740
 rival hardly won just flat 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.340
 the drummer gives us a stake 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.619
 the right to put the second barrel of it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.250
 sizes need to be chosen so that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.240
 the turn we did not overbet 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:35.070
 so i put 90 chips range 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.590
 flop seven, five, and ace 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.409
 the highest card maybe who I am the eldest 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.799
 card maybe 910 or 89 which 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:52.229
 an opponent could have been 865 also shoved 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.960
 on the flop we bet 90 chips and a contender 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.210
 calls 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.100
 by this we understand that the opponent 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.189
 there is no ace-high 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.310
 because two barrels stus x and rival 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.619
 obviously does not hold an opponent in the range 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.130
 only five left only sevens 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.099
 because opponent's gutshots are undoubtedly 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.040
 pulled out the second barrel and the house came out 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 river gives us a great chance 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
 steal the bank we shove and rival 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.110
 will be forced to just send a pass 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.099
 five or seven because our 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.010
 the line killed is very strong and we go 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.319
 All-iny rival throws out 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.549
 great game we take away big under 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.989
 we didn't have showdown value on the river 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.190
 because we certainly lost by 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.970
 top five and seven 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.780
 but we had good fold equity to him 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.590
 took advantage 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.599
 knocking out an opponent from the bank it was 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.459
