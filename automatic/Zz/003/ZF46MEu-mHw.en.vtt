00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
or alternatively you can just use a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.720 
or alternatively you can just use a
resistance<00:03:21.959> band<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.530> find<00:03:23.280> an<00:03:23.430> attachment

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
resistance band and find an attachment

to safely get it on a doorframe and
that's<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:28.140> way<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.350> can<00:03:28.590> do<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.739> pull-up

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
that's that way you can do a pull-up

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.310 
that's that way you can do a pull-up
like<00:03:29.519> motion<00:03:30.080> without<00:03:31.080> having<00:03:31.560> TVs<00:03:33.320> you're
