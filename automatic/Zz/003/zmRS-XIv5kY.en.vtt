 I am in France I enjoy a successful experience 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.890
 share the first place the children of the committee 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 so that's like a hip-hop cultural exchange 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.460
 the kids no longer the brightest support lower 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.540
 jonathan customer support this is where he only cultivates 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.970
 the sprites they damn board referee m 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.360
 waiting for the researchers to move forward 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.410

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.070
 want and you can not please you anymore 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.700
 then we will go into the static depth that the collective work 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.650
 of work such methods the hardest for me for a little while 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.070
 Do work 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.450
 an overall work 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.670
 the competition I am curious to be able to ask 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.050
 the communique calls for things to happen well the black zone 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.350
 is ol hip hop dance is like the road sport 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 but it's human 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 and it's true more 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.810
 regards psig density and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.240
 that's all like say it's sport because lucia if you want 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.510
 I think more with a little more flexibility m more the same 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.220
 thank you at the same level as their finances 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.710
 why did you decide to support the committee of 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.650
 families because globally by giving his runners home from 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.250
 women 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.610
 but here is the support puymiclan budget families I think no 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.680
 and this force the shipping agent not necessarily mans 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.059
 I am the victim 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:13.509
 ever earlier even women's fuel because the force that are 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:18.169
 inclined than to do things here to get things done i think that 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:20.049
 that's all that motivates me 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.439
 even if I have this motivation so far 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.769
 after when you meet people like us 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.040
 how many jeans paul gaultier and 5 I want you to shoot that's all 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.760
 everything made you want to work while the train was able to do things that 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.699
 can 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:39.269
 since September 7th it does not necessarily embarrass me I'm convinced 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.030
 that he is unique 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.970
 and on the ground what is the love of hip-hop 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.169
 why him 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.540
 and love of the point 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.120
 he is always the one who has the love of his neighbor because he wears his 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.919
 congo politician ideas that the revolution 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:55.719
 but not the revolution against people but the vibration in itself 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.060
 and she does not know what to think 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.489
 the exits we can not continue 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.999
 when we doubt that it is 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.649
 and help to realize that actually when it's beautiful it's really 

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:08.969
 a culture of doubt 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:14.369
 of two license studies per se we can not give up just 6 by 6 to 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.129
 6 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.559
 smaller tool daily fluctuation margin 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:25.429
 and at the same time at the same time then that allow me to be in harmony m 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:27.259
 every Saturday 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:28.559
 every Saturday 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.109
 from his paintings 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.429
 pursuer so we just measured 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:37.019
 and afterwards we will die as I pull my friend from the smoke together and the 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.150
 graffiti then came 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.389
 at emporiki by world 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.679
 and maybe with my buddy my wafer site with tourcoing fc 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.329
 m 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.059

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.199

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.899
 I am a supporter of the association emphasizes AIDS 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.899
 so all together I hope we will move forward 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.209
 the three men are dead 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.359
 ultimately in the world more people 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:12.899
 this committee must have 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:15.899
 I hope it will continue 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.789
 I feel that we will have consequences for the future 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.069
 she left 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.240
