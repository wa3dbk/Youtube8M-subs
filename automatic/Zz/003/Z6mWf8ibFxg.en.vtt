subject called earthing so what you need
to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> need<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:11.790> yourself<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
to do is you need to get yourself a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.249 
to do is you need to get yourself a
piece<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.380> cable<00:01:14.030> put<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> crocodile<00:01:15.540> clip<00:01:16.080> on

piece of cable put a crocodile clip on
one<00:01:16.380> end<00:01:16.590> which<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.250> what<00:01:17.850> you're<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
one end which is what you're going to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.990 
one end which is what you're going to
connect<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:18.960> cable<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.799> attaches

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
connect on to your cable that attaches

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.910 
connect on to your cable that attaches
to<00:01:21.000> your<00:01:21.030> earthing<00:01:21.810> system<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.770> you're

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
to your earthing system that you're

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.060 
to your earthing system that you're
planning<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.400> using<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> other<00:01:25.500> end<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
planning on using and the other end you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.700 
planning on using and the other end you
want<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> strip<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.470> feel<00:01:28.680> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
want to strip it so you can feel a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.300 
want to strip it so you can feel a
highly<00:01:29.670> stranded<00:01:30.119> cable<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.100> want<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
highly stranded cable and you want to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
highly stranded cable and you want to
strip<00:01:32.840> enough<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> cable<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.680> can

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
strip enough of the cable so it can

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
strip enough of the cable so it can
completely<00:01:35.310> fill<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> pot<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.640> let's<00:01:38.640> take

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
completely fill the pot so let's take

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.740 
completely fill the pot so let's take
the<00:01:38.970> plant<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.780> its<00:01:40.020> pot

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.060 

and<00:01:44.750> what<00:01:44.870> we're<00:01:44.990> going<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.200> do<00:01:45.350> is<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.650> simply

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
and what we're going to do is to simply

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:56.740 
and what we're going to do is to simply
going<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:47.470> spread<00:01:48.470> out<00:01:48.770> strands<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:55.750> we're

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
going to spread out strands and we're

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.330 
going to spread out strands and we're
going<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.670> put<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.790> in<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:58.940> pot<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:01.280> then

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
going to put it in the pot and then

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.270 
going to put it in the pot and then
we've<00:02:01.520> got<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.640> plant<00:02:02.060> on<00:02:02.450> top<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:05.740> now<00:02:06.740> we

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
we've got a plant on top of it so now we

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.890 
we've got a plant on top of it so now we
have<00:02:07.520> our<00:02:08.180> plant<00:02:08.600> as<00:02:09.729> its<00:02:10.729> earthing<00:02:11.510> cable

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
have our plant as its earthing cable

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.660 
have our plant as its earthing cable
onto<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.060> we<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.330> an<00:02:14.840> alligator<00:02:15.230> clip

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
onto it and we have an alligator clip

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.330 
onto it and we have an alligator clip
that<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:16.880> use<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.540> connect<00:02:17.840> onto<00:02:18.340> your

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
that you can use to connect onto your

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.890 
that you can use to connect onto your
earthing<00:02:20.120> system<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:23.120> takes<00:02:23.330> about<00:02:23.480> six

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
earthing system and it takes about six

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.320 
earthing system and it takes about six
months<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.290> assess<00:02:24.980> your<00:02:25.550> earthing<00:02:25.940> system

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
months to assess your earthing system

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.840 
months to assess your earthing system
using<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.900> plant<00:02:27.170> but<00:02:28.070> it's<00:02:28.400> something<00:02:28.640> they

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
using this plant but it's something they

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.380 
using this plant but it's something they
should<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.300> prior<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.500> connecting<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:32.270> your

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
should do prior to connecting in to your

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.760 
earthing system and there's quite a few
of<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.190> tests<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.209> should<00:02:35.390> do<00:02:35.540> you

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
of the tests that you should do you

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.560 
of the tests that you should do you
typically<00:02:36.770> make<00:02:37.520> sure<00:02:37.700> there's<00:02:37.910> no<00:02:38.090> radio

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
typically make sure there's no radio

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.360 
typically make sure there's no radio
frequencies<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.590> your<00:02:39.770> earthing<00:02:40.220> door

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
frequencies on your earthing door

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.610 
frequencies on your earthing door
grounding<00:02:40.880> system<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:42.080> should<00:02:42.260> also<00:02:42.440> make

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
grounding system you should also make

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.610 
grounding system you should also make
sure<00:02:42.770> there's<00:02:43.100> no<00:02:43.220> voltage<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:44.690> your<00:02:44.990> Fingal

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
sure there's no voltage on your Fingal

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.160 
sure there's no voltage on your Fingal
grounding<00:02:46.040> system<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:47.270> separate<00:02:47.720> videos

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
grounding system I have separate videos

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.970 
grounding system I have separate videos
that<00:02:48.500> show<00:02:48.769> how<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.940> test<00:02:50.330> for<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:51.019> I<00:02:51.320> hope

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that show how to test for that I hope

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.770 
that show how to test for that I hope
