00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
then he stopped growing the same thing

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.539 
then he stopped growing the same thing
down<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.750> pan<00:01:42.960> beach<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.560> same<00:01:43.799> process<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
down in pan beach the same process the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
down in pan beach the same process the
same<00:01:44.759> way<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.930> basically<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.530> almost

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
