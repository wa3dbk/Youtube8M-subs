00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
I put the trigger in the stock on but in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.910 
I put the trigger in the stock on but in
this<00:00:42.989> video<00:00:43.170> I'm<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.530> gonna<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.770> over<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
this video I'm just gonna go over the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.639 
this video I'm just gonna go over the
stuff<00:00:44.570> extract<00:00:45.570> through<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> trigger<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
stuff extract through the trigger and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.110 
stuff extract through the trigger and
sight<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.079> some<00:00:49.079> other<00:00:49.289> stuff<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.000> let's<00:00:51.000> get

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
sight and some other stuff but let's get

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.250 
sight and some other stuff but let's get
into<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.480> real<00:00:51.719> quick<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.890> stock<00:00:54.260> it's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
into that real quick the stock it's

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
into that real quick the stock it's
pulling<00:00:55.710> stock<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:58.039> it<00:00:59.039> pulls<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
pulling stock so it pulls just like that

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.709 
pulling stock so it pulls just like that
and<00:01:01.340> basically<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> latch<00:01:03.449> up

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and basically I don't have a latch up

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.530 
and basically I don't have a latch up
here<00:01:04.019> anything<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.030> basically<00:01:06.450> just

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
here anything but you basically just

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
here anything but you basically just
hold<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:08.630> fire<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.950> I'll<00:01:11.130> show

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
hold on to fire like that and I'll show

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.780 
hold on to fire like that and I'll show
you<00:01:11.340> guys<00:01:11.460> how<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.820> put<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.180> together<00:01:13.790> so

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you guys how I put that together so

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.080 
you guys how I put that together so
basically<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.330> has<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:16.280> pan<00:01:17.280> right<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
basically it has a pan right here that I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.320 
basically it has a pan right here that I
welded<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.990> fabricated<00:01:19.799> myself<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.820> it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
welded on and fabricated myself and it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
welded on and fabricated myself and it's
got<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.780> door<00:01:22.560> latch<00:01:22.860> right<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:25.310> that's

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
got a door latch right here and that's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880 
got a door latch right here and that's
the<00:01:26.670> only<00:01:27.000> two<00:01:27.270> parts<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.780> makes<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> work<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the only two parts that makes it work I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.850 
the only two parts that makes it work I
thought<00:01:29.490> they'd<00:01:29.670> probably<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> easiest

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
thought they'd probably be the easiest

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.160 
thought they'd probably be the easiest
way<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.890> put<00:01:32.189> together<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.299> had<00:01:33.479> some

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
way to put together and I had some

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260 
way to put together and I had some
people<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.619> YouTube<00:01:35.009> suggested<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.790> cryptic

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
people on YouTube suggested like cryptic

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.539 
people on YouTube suggested like cryptic
cricket<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.860> thought<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.189> was<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:38.460> good

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
cricket and I thought it was pretty good

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.590 
cricket and I thought it was pretty good

anything<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.800> because<00:02:07.800> I<00:02:08.040> thought

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
anything like that because I thought

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.270 
anything like that because I thought
it'd<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.400> too<00:02:08.490> complicated<00:02:09.020> but<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.350> was<00:02:11.100> kind

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
it'd be too complicated but I was kind

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
it'd be too complicated but I was kind
of<00:02:11.310> tired<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.060> good<00:02:12.300> after<00:02:12.990> a

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
of tired with all this good after a

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.450 
of tired with all this good after a
while<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:15.000> didn't<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:16.190> yeah<00:02:17.190> that's<00:02:17.340> the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
while that didn't but yeah that's the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.550 
while that didn't but yeah that's the
breech<00:02:17.700> block<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.210> fixed<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> problem<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.500> I

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
breech block I fixed the problem that I

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.620 
breech block I fixed the problem that I
had<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> previous<00:02:20.430> test<00:02:20.610> firing<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
had in the previous test firing was the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.630 
had in the previous test firing was the
primer<00:02:22.020> was<00:02:22.290> blowing<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.800> every<00:02:23.370> time<00:02:23.490> I

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
primer was blowing out every time I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.540 
primer was blowing out every time I
fired<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:25.110> think<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.740> fixed<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.130> problem<00:02:26.310> I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
fired so I think I fixed that problem I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.000 
fired so I think I fixed that problem I
drilled<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.820> smaller<00:02:27.150> hole<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:27.960> kind<00:02:28.950> of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
drilled a smaller hole in it and kind of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.880 
drilled a smaller hole in it and kind of
redesigned<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.560> course<00:02:31.740> has<00:02:31.860> the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
redesigned it it of course has the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.720 
redesigned it it of course has the
adjustable<00:02:34.890> toke

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
adjustable toke

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.020 
adjustable toke
I've<00:02:36.240> put<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.570> on<00:02:36.630> most<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> my<00:02:37.020> guns<00:02:37.320> and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
I've put it on most of my guns and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.090 
I've put it on most of my guns and
that's<00:02:39.030> pretty<00:02:39.330> self-explanatory<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:40.830> you're

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
that's pretty self-explanatory if you're

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.610 
that's pretty self-explanatory if you're
watching<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.610> other<00:02:41.820> videos<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.620> find

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
watching in other videos you can find

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.200 
watching in other videos you can find
out<00:02:43.770> about<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:46.370> ground<00:02:47.370> some<00:02:47.610> grooves<00:02:47.880> in

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
out about that I ground some grooves in

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.480 
out about that I ground some grooves in
the<00:02:48.390> top<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:50.780> receiver<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.770> mounted<00:02:53.220> a

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
the top of the receiver and I mounted a

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.540 
the top of the receiver and I mounted a
sight<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.570> this<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.860> works<00:02:56.070> really<00:02:56.310> good

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
sight on this so that works really good

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.670 
sight on this so that works really good
it's<00:02:57.150> really<00:02:57.540> solid<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.690> frying-pan

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
it's really solid and the frying-pan

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.070 
it's really solid and the frying-pan
I'll<00:03:02.370> go<00:03:02.520> ahead<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.730> show<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:02.940> guys<00:03:03.060> how<00:03:03.600> that

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
I'll go ahead and show you guys how that

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.130 
I'll go ahead and show you guys how that
functions<00:03:05.390> basically<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.570> already<00:03:06.810> cost<00:03:06.989> me

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
functions basically it's already cost me

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.160 
functions basically it's already cost me
I<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.380> cockpit<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.480> what<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.600> do<00:03:09.750> there's<00:03:10.110> a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
I this cockpit and what you do there's a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.699 
I this cockpit and what you do there's a
little<00:03:10.410> like<00:03:10.940> catch<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.600> fine<00:03:12.840> pin<00:03:13.110> inside

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
little like catch on the fine pin inside

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.650 
little like catch on the fine pin inside
of<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.130> there's<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.670> spring<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.390> catch

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
of this there's a spring and the catch

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.560 
of this there's a spring and the catch
and<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.110> frying<00:03:16.380> pan<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:18.150> push<00:03:18.390> this

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
and the frying pan and you push this

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.970 
and the frying pan and you push this
little<00:03:18.690> thing<00:03:19.050> up<00:03:19.260> into<00:03:19.620> it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
little thing up into it

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.850 
little thing up into it
and<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:20.970> catches<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.480> there<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.050> now<00:03:22.739> it's

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
and it catches on there and now it's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.020 
and it catches on there and now it's
caught<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:25.640> mean<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:27.300> really<00:03:27.690> simple<00:03:29.030> it's

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
caught so I mean it's really simple it's

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.670 
caught so I mean it's really simple it's
the<00:03:30.209> easiest<00:03:30.660> way<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.840> could<00:03:31.110> think<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.470> do

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
the easiest way I could think of to do

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.300 
the easiest way I could think of to do
it<00:03:31.800> but<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.700> can<00:03:32.850> see<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:34.500> just<00:03:34.709> goes<00:03:34.920> up<00:03:35.130> and

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
it but you can see it just goes up and

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.860 
it but you can see it just goes up and
down

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
down

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.250 
down
when<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> pull<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> trigger<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.810> that's<00:03:40.110> how

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
when I pull the trigger and that's how

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.500 
when I pull the trigger and that's how
it<00:03:40.380> works<00:03:40.590> I'll<00:03:40.680> go<00:03:40.800> ahead<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.180> load<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.330> up

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
it works I'll go ahead and load it up

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.880 
it works I'll go ahead and load it up
and<00:03:42.750> show<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.200> how<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.349> unload<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.739> and

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
and show you how to unload it and

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.130 
and show you how to unload it and
everything<00:03:44.220> like<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.400> basically<00:03:45.390> just<00:03:45.660> put

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
everything like that basically just put

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.820 
everything like that basically just put
it<00:03:46.260> around<00:03:47.540> make<00:03:48.540> sure<00:03:48.569> it<00:03:48.840> sits<00:03:49.110> nice<00:03:49.800> and

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
it around make sure it sits nice and

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.860 
it around make sure it sits nice and
tight<00:03:50.450> then<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.890> rotate<00:03:52.890> it<00:03:53.130> into<00:03:53.819> place<00:03:54.300> and

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.449 

put<00:03:57.870> your<00:03:58.019> little<00:03:58.200> breech<00:03:58.500> block<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:59.160> there

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
put your little breech block in there

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.320 
put your little breech block in there
and<00:03:59.970> now<00:04:00.959> it's<00:04:01.200> loaded<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:03.030> then<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.750> can

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
and now it's loaded and then you can

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.020 
and now it's loaded and then you can
pull<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:06.450> back<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:09.950> cocky

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
pull this back and cocky

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.390 
pull this back and cocky
so<00:04:12.570> now<00:04:12.720> it's<00:04:12.840> cocked<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.320> loaded<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:16.400> now

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
so now it's cocked and loaded and now

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.289 
so now it's cocked and loaded and now
it's<00:04:17.700> fired

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
it's fired

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.099 
it's fired
so<00:04:19.230> it's<00:04:19.950> really<00:04:20.130> simple<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.850> tried<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:21.959> make<00:04:22.049> it

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
so it's really simple I tried to make it

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.890 
so it's really simple I tried to make it
simple<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:22.620> it'd<00:04:22.860> be<00:04:22.890> easy<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.250> make<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:24.540> so

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
simple so it'd be easy to make and so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.380 
simple so it'd be easy to make and so
now<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.170> can<00:04:25.290> unload<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.980> you<00:04:26.460> just<00:04:26.640> rotate<00:04:27.330> it

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
now you can unload it you just rotate it

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.280 
now you can unload it you just rotate it
back<00:04:28.250> comes<00:04:29.250> through<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:29.880> extractors<00:04:33.290> pop

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
back comes through the extractors pop
