00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.649 
one of the things I love about a Motor
Show<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.639> fact<00:00:03.000> that<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.149> can<00:00:03.300> get<00:00:03.449> up

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
close and personal have a little pot

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.980 
close and personal have a little pot
around<00:00:05.069> with<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> new<00:00:06.150> car<00:00:06.390> before<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.779> hits<00:00:06.930> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
around with a new car before it hits the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.839 
around with a new car before it hits the
road<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.529> I've<00:00:08.309> really<00:00:08.639> been<00:00:08.670> looking

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
road and I've really been looking

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.910 
road and I've really been looking
forward<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.330> seeing<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.050> new<00:00:10.230> a1<00:00:10.679> and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
forward to seeing the new a1 and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.459 
forward to seeing the new a1 and
actually<00:00:11.400> here<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> metal<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.599> have<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.349> say

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
actually here in the metal I have to say

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.330 
actually here in the metal I have to say
that's<00:00:13.650> pretty<00:00:13.830> stunning

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
that's pretty stunning

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.660 
that's pretty stunning
it<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.690> bigger<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.990> think<00:00:16.049> than<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.890> mini<00:00:17.220> it's

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it is bigger I think than a mini it's

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.630 
it is bigger I think than a mini it's
not<00:00:17.880> quite<00:00:18.150> as<00:00:18.949> distinctive<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:20.520> have

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
not quite as distinctive but just have

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.250 
not quite as distinctive but just have
some<00:00:20.789> very<00:00:21.000> cool<00:00:21.480> styling<00:00:21.960> features

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
some very cool styling features

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.240 
some very cool styling features
obviously<00:00:22.350> dizzy

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
obviously dizzy

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.460 
obviously dizzy
you<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> tell-tale<00:00:24.029> howdy<00:00:24.869> cool

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
you know the tell-tale howdy cool

you know the tell-tale howdy cool
headlights<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> way<00:00:27.060> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
headlights and I do like the way that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.540 
headlights and I do like the way that
they've<00:00:27.359> gone<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> contrasting<00:00:28.529> roof<00:00:29.250> arch

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
they've gone for a contrasting roof arch

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.769 
they've gone for a contrasting roof arch
to<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> rest<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> body<00:00:30.420> color<00:00:30.660> now

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
to the rest of the body color now

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.089 
to the rest of the body color now
apparently<00:00:31.109> you'd<00:00:31.260> probably<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.560> able<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> get

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
apparently you'd probably be able to get

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.430 
apparently you'd probably be able to get
the<00:00:32.279> wing<00:00:32.850> mirrors<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.719> match<00:00:33.930> these<00:00:34.200> roof

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the wing mirrors to match these roof

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.319 
the wing mirrors to match these roof
arches<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.040> want<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.430> now<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.120> come

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
arches if you want it now if you come

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.430 
arches if you want it now if you come
around<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> back<00:00:36.690> obviously<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.170> talking

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
around the back obviously we're talking

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.330 
around the back obviously we're talking
about<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.649> mini<00:00:37.940> one<00:00:38.940> thing<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.590> can

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
about the mini one thing that this can

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.090 
about the mini one thing that this can
beat<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> mini<00:00:41.850> form<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.360> space<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.950> it's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
beat the mini form is space because it's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.010 
beat the mini form is space because it's
a<00:00:44.280> mess<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.579> slightly<00:00:44.850> larger<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.480> does<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.989> a

boot that you can use I mean it's not

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
boot that you can use I mean it's not
exactly<00:00:49.260> massive<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> could<00:00:51.030> fit<00:00:51.210> quite

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
exactly massive but you could fit quite

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.180

is the ultimate test now that is
actually<00:01:38.670> impressive<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:39.990> in

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
actually impressive is that if I was in

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.690 
actually impressive is that if I was in
a<00:01:40.140> mini<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.400> knees<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
a mini you know my knees would be

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.800 
a mini you know my knees would be
touching<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.119> back<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.479> seat<00:01:42.660> they're

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
touching the back of the seat they're

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.260 
touching the back of the seat they're
just<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.320> all<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.190> only<00:01:44.220> problem<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> have

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
just not at all the only problem I have

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.620 
just not at all the only problem I have
is<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:46.050> my<00:01:46.290> head<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.220> actually<00:01:47.340> hitting<00:01:48.150> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is that my head is actually hitting the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
is that my head is actually hitting the
roof<00:01:49.500> lining<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:50.160> means<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:50.880> got

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
roof lining here means because it's got

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
roof lining here means because it's got
a<00:01:51.030> swooping<00:01:51.840> roof<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.229> back<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> mean<00:01:52.650> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
a swooping roof at the back I mean it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.320 
a swooping roof at the back I mean it
doesn't<00:01:52.860> look<00:01:52.950> good<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> payoff<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
doesn't look good but the payoff is the

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.730 
doesn't look good but the payoff is the
fact<00:01:54.540> really<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.930> couldn't<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.350> anyone

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
fact really you couldn't have anyone

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.440 
fact really you couldn't have anyone
much<00:01:56.250> taller<00:01:56.520> than<00:01:56.580> me<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.970> here<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.300> no

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
much taller than me in here and I'm no

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.380 
much taller than me in here and I'm no
giant<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.890> overall<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.700> does<00:02:00.000> feel<00:02:00.180> quite

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
giant but overall it does feel quite

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.440 
giant but overall it does feel quite
roomy<00:02:00.720> I'm<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.140> quite<00:02:01.320> impressed
