00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the sink but a lot of times we just do

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.820 
the sink but a lot of times we just do
it<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.580> bathtub<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:55.260> what<00:01:55.440> we<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.650> is

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
it in the bathtub and then what we do is

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.469 
it in the bathtub and then what we do is
let<00:01:56.310> me<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.430> show<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.670> yeah<00:01:57.180> we'll<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.420> to

the Batman in the tub okay and the other
way<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.670> we're<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.970> bathtub

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
way to do it is if we're the bathtub

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
way to do it is if we're the bathtub
when<00:02:03.540> we're<00:02:03.660> doing<00:02:03.870> a<00:02:03.930> bath<00:02:04.110> we'll<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.220> them

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.160 
when we're doing a bath we'll get them
to<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:06.270> typically<00:02:06.600> don't<00:02:06.690> have<00:02:06.900> all<00:02:07.050> their

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
for simulation purposes I've got the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
for simulation purposes I've got the
rest<00:02:11.580> our<00:02:11.700> head<00:02:11.820> back<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.720> then
