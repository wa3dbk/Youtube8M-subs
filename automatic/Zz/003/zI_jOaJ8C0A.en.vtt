realized it was in the top of the plug
and<00:01:10.909> sometimes<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.149> just<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.569> a<00:01:12.600> hint<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.959> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and sometimes is just as a hint of the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.599

beginner<00:01:13.319> sometimes<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> dig<00:01:14.399> deep<00:01:14.429> for

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
beginner sometimes if you dig deep for

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.279
