00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.069
 hello and welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 one of the most asked questions of 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.269
 blender begin with the blender 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.150
 Game engine work is like getting one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.119
 real-time shadow created in blender 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 So that in the 3d viewer or in the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.000
 Game engine real time is available yes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.090
 The whole thing is actually very simple 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.160
 but we have to work on that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.579
 Two things ensure that the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.530
 First that we use the duke wood textures 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.620
 gewittern one with buy 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 at shading gsl here we have ours 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.960
 normal point lemm no shadow 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.860
 but if we live the point in the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.600
 Change menu to a collection 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.050
 we see, there is no such thing 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.570
 shadow 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.840
 yet how to just activate ray shadow 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.920
 look at the menu item in the shadow 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.229
 you can throw over the shadow 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.490
 of course, still the energy adjust 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.420
 So the higher you put the older 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.430
 and the color of our shadow 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.479
 standard black completely but no 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.220
 hardly a shadow looks like that 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.110
 usually a bit transparent that you can 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.090
 Just make the color 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.200
 bit brighter a picture and sound looks 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.409
 you would shade something more transparent 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.720
 and becomes more realistic that's only possible 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.770
 since version 2.6 4 with the sun 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.189
 It used to be done with scotland 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.790
 Barrichello only that was a method that 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.020
 So not so many user made this 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.740
 Noise is treatment method against is 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.049
 far better suitable for beginners and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.439
 It also works in the blender 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.439
 game with
