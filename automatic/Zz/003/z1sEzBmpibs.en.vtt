joists the interior joists are just
regular<00:01:34.340> joists<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.210> we're<00:01:35.689> going<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.840> drive

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
regular joists and we're going to drive

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.599 
regular joists and we're going to drive
a<00:01:36.079> few<00:01:36.320> screws<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.829> here<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.250> lock<00:01:37.430> them

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
a few screws in here and lock them

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.789 
a few screws in here and lock them
solidly<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.329> foundation<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.409> we<00:01:39.530> can<00:01:39.680> then

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
solidly to the foundation so we can then

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.870 
solidly to the foundation so we can then
bring<00:01:39.979> our<00:01:40.189> posts<00:01:40.579> in<00:01:40.700> next<00:01:45.579> let's<00:01:46.579> rock<00:01:46.850> it

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
bring our posts in next let's rock it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.840 
bring our posts in next let's rock it
yeah<00:01:47.890> there<00:01:48.890> are<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.009> couple<00:01:49.219> of<00:01:49.429> different

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
yeah there are a couple of different

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.969 
yeah there are a couple of different
ways<00:01:49.969> that<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.390> can<00:01:50.659> build<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.170> corner<00:01:51.469> post<00:01:51.679> if

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
ways that you can build a corner post if

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.469 
ways that you can build a corner post if
you're<00:01:52.159> building<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.609> playset<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.179> your<00:01:53.329> own

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
you're building a playset of your own

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.310 
you're building a playset of your own
but<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.460> many<00:01:55.520> other<00:01:55.899> oddball<00:01:56.899> jobs

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
but like so many other oddball jobs

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.010 
but like so many other oddball jobs
turns<00:01:58.130> out<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.579> jaw<00:01:58.909> horse<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.479> an<00:01:59.600> ideal

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
turns out that jaw horse is an ideal

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.099 
turns out that jaw horse is an ideal
tool<00:02:00.439> for<00:02:00.469> this<00:02:00.920> I've<00:02:01.490> got<00:02:01.789> to<00:02:02.060> set<00:02:02.390> up<00:02:02.539> one<00:02:02.990> at

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
tool for this I've got to set up one at

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.289 
tool for this I've got to set up one at
each<00:02:03.289> end<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.829> I've<00:02:04.369> got<00:02:04.579> a<00:02:04.609> couple<00:02:04.909> of<00:02:05.030> bar

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
each end and I've got a couple of bar

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.719 
each end and I've got a couple of bar
clamps<00:02:05.869> here<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.679> squeeze<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.340> pieces

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
clamps here to squeeze the pieces

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.320 
clamps here to squeeze the pieces
together<00:02:07.909> so<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.420> can<00:02:08.810> get<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> nice<00:02:09.500> tight

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
together so I can get a nice tight

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.170 
together so I can get a nice tight
square<00:02:11.330> corner<00:02:12.370> now<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.610> I've<00:02:13.700> got<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.060> all

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
square corner now that I've got it all

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.840 
square corner now that I've got it all
set<00:02:14.480> up<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.410> last<00:02:15.650> step<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.160> set<00:02:16.460> screws

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
set up the last step is to set screws

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:40.330 
set up the last step is to set screws
along<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.270> edge

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340

before we did a couple of tricks to make

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.640 
before we did a couple of tricks to make
