much<00:01:48.509> easier<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.320> had<00:01:49.469> used<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.920> paint<00:01:50.340> marker

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

and thought ahead of course but i didn't

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.580 
and thought ahead of course but i didn't
so<00:01:53.250> i<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.520> use<00:01:53.729> black<00:01:54.149> acrylic<00:01:54.509> paint<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:55.079> a

so i just use black acrylic paint in a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.279 
so i just use black acrylic paint in a
thin<00:01:56.399> paint<00:01:56.850> brush<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.750> use<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.020> paint

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
thin paint brush but you can use a paint

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.919 
thin paint brush but you can use a paint
marker<00:01:58.469> even<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.369> sharpie<00:01:59.880> might<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.299> okay<00:02:00.630> but

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
marker even a sharpie might be okay but

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.760 
marker even a sharpie might be okay but
just<00:02:01.320> take<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.920> time<00:02:01.979> with<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
just take your time with the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.470 
coffee filter because i'm awesome like
that<00:03:23.799> but<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.340> can<00:03:24.489> probably<00:03:24.700> use<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.060> plate

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480

stencils and be a little careful with

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.390 
stencils and be a little careful with
this<00:03:33.330> because<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:34.260> don't<00:03:34.410> want<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.830> get<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
paint way outside the lines but it's

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.170 
paint way outside the lines but it's
okay<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.680> does<00:03:37.800> not<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.370> be<00:03:38.400> perfect<00:03:38.550> I

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
