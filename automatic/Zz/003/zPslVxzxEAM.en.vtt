00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
this but uh I have other 189 13 which

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.880 
this but uh I have other 189 13 which
has<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.390> correct<00:01:50.600> charger<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.259> that's<00:01:51.500> okay

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
has the correct charger so that's okay

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:04.680 
has the correct charger so that's okay
I'm<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.340> our<00:01:52.520> video<00:02:00.069> there's<00:02:01.069> a<00:02:01.130> civil<00:02:01.700> one

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.630 

the<00:02:05.690> blades<00:02:06.649> look<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.979> little<00:02:07.099> different<00:02:07.459> color

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
the blades look a little different color

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.449 
the blades look a little different color
too<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.300> that's<00:02:08.479> kind<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.750> cool<00:02:09.009> not<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.250> check

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
too so that's kind of cool not to check

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.509 
too so that's kind of cool not to check
this<00:02:10.640> out<00:02:10.910> probably<00:02:12.040> charge<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.220> up<00:02:13.280> here

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
this out probably charge it up here

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.100 
this out probably charge it up here
shortly

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:43.470 

antenna<00:02:37.800> same<00:02:38.800> frequency<00:02:39.990> 49.8<00:02:40.990> 60<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.480> think

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
antenna same frequency 49.8 60 I think

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.720 
antenna same frequency 49.8 60 I think
that's<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.750> same<00:02:43.960> as<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.290> other<00:02:44.440> one<00:02:44.680> but<00:02:45.610> off

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
that's the same as the other one but off

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.020 
that's the same as the other one but off
double<00:02:46.150> check<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.280> lightest<00:02:51.700> tapes

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
double check that and the lightest tapes

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.830 
double check that and the lightest tapes
just<00:02:52.990> hold<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.650> there<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:58.660> that's

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
just hold it in there so that's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.270 
just hold it in there so that's
everything<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.380> get<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.739> box<00:03:02.280> under

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
everything you get in the box under

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:13.650 
everything you get in the box under

the parts parts list in the back of it

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.920 
the parts parts list in the back of it
typical<00:03:21.000> looks<00:03:22.000> very<00:03:22.239> similar<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:23.080> other

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
typical looks very similar to the other

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.740 
typical looks very similar to the other
models<00:03:25.930> by<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.410> company<00:03:27.510> except<00:03:28.510> for<00:03:28.660> the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
models by this company except for the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.550 
models by this company except for the
front<00:03:28.989> page<00:03:31.200> where<00:03:32.200> they<00:03:32.290> talk<00:03:32.350> about

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
front page where they talk about

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.590 
front page where they talk about
batteries<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.670> trends<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.150> stuff<00:03:34.450> but

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
batteries and the trends of stuff but

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.120 
batteries and the trends of stuff but
that's<00:03:34.750> good<00:03:35.049> i<00:03:35.080> was<00:03:35.290> glad<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.590> i<00:03:35.799> got<00:03:35.830> the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
that's good i was glad that i got the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.729 
that's good i was glad that i got the
one<00:03:36.280> with<00:03:36.459> three<00:03:36.760> trim<00:03:37.209> off<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.720> happy<00:03:38.650> about

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
one with three trim off so happy about

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:46.350 
one with three trim off so happy about
that<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.209> this<00:03:40.360> is<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.660> 8911<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.670> Falcon<00:03:45.030> 17<00:03:46.030> I

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
that so this is the 8911 the Falcon 17 I

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.740 
that so this is the 8911 the Falcon 17 I
think<00:03:46.570> that<00:03:46.630> is<00:03:46.930> but<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.739> 8911<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:48.880> that's<00:03:49.630> the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
think that is but it 8911 so that's the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.729 
think that is but it 8911 so that's the
difference<00:03:49.959> between<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:51.360> 8911<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:56.560> is

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
difference between the 8911 and this is

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.850 
difference between the 8911 and this is
the<00:03:56.860> evening<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.310> 13<00:03:57.989> which<00:03:58.989> i<00:03:59.110> think<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.500> the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
the evening I 13 which i think is the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.539 
the evening I 13 which i think is the
only<00:03:59.980> difference<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.730> color<00:04:01.000> but<00:04:01.720> I

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
only difference is the color but I

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.729 
only difference is the color but I
haven't<00:04:03.549> yet<00:04:04.049> confirmed<00:04:05.049> this<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.500> don't<00:04:05.650> know

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
haven't yet confirmed this I don't know

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.740 
haven't yet confirmed this I don't know
if<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:05.920> can<00:04:06.040> get<00:04:06.220> an<00:04:06.310> 80<00:04:06.489> 911<00:04:07.150> in<00:04:07.959> an<00:04:08.440> orange<00:04:09.750> or

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
if you can get an 80 911 in an orange or

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.259 
if you can get an 80 911 in an orange or
is<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.440> just<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:12.160> number<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.790> numbering<00:04:13.090> the

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
is it just the number the numbering the

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.990 
is it just the number the numbering the
same<00:04:13.890> different<00:04:14.890> for<00:04:15.040> each<00:04:15.070> color<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:15.820> it's

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
same different for each color so it's

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.520 
same different for each color so it's
kind<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.620> kind<00:04:17.620> of<00:04:17.680> a<00:04:17.799> cool<00:04:17.979> thing<00:04:18.040> so<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:20.380> i

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
kind of a kind of a cool thing so but i

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.170 
kind of a kind of a cool thing so but i
like<00:04:20.739> that<00:04:20.890> i<00:04:21.040> like<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.370> get<00:04:21.489> one<00:04:21.640> of<00:04:21.760> each<00:04:21.910> so

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
like that i like to get one of each so

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.690 
like that i like to get one of each so
that's<00:04:22.419> good<00:04:22.630> but<00:04:23.620> that's<00:04:23.770> leading<00:04:24.040> on<00:04:24.310> 11

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
that's good but that's leading on 11

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.630 
that's good but that's leading on 11
wanted<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.090> show<00:04:25.270> you<00:04:25.300> guys<00:04:25.479> that
