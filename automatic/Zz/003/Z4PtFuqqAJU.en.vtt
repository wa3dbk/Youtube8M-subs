00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.800
 good another of the programs that we are taking to tavo in the center is the 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.160
 classroom management program if they were two points 0 is a program of the mind 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.889
 free 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.170
 of which the soto in Rome castro a confessor of the lecce prd tomelloso the 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.170
 real city policy and from which 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.640
 per hundred wolf speaks maec is a demented project coordinator someone else 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.569
 center of juan francisco psoe floors 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.019
 now well 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.909
 the project if it consists the general ine is a computer solution 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.320
 that allows to keep in contact to teachers father 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.710
 and to 1 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.090
 he senses the program mainly 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.489
 it helps teachers to manage 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.220
 in a fast way 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.700
 integral 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.210
 intuitive easy all the percent and documented processes that are recorded 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.450
 daily in a wave or in the center taking as always the 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.890
 teacher programming 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.790
 the program is very important because the management is very simple and only 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.760
 We need to have 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.700
 a web hosting where to hang the program 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.850
 per cent a laptop in the classroom 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.820
 and internet connection 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.469
 mainly I will comment on enlarge raco like 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.410
 the crazy teacher use 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.750
 how students use it and how parents use it 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.940
 efe to the master min allows us to record all kinds of data as in the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.869
 assistance 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.620
 the weighted ratings 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.750
 because in this way it does not save 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.800
 the first coffee of the final quarter average 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.130
 percent record the daily tasks that children send to stay in 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.780
 home 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.860
 as well as all kinds of observations annotations 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.230
 this matter 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.080
 - also allows to assign to the individual record of the student's record 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.570
 where then we have quickly and easily all our parents duck 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.890
 phone 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.530
 that many times we have to look at the file o'neal the pen 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.090
 Certainly it allows me to create reports of all kinds 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.089
 devaluation of assistance generate letter 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.889
 another very interesting thing that allows us to record the interviews with 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.319
 parents 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.090
 another very interesting thing is that it allows us to maintain a communication 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.529
 internally through the program 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.960
 to email mode 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.960
 between teachers and parents 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.979
 this affected mainly would be the emt the possibilities that it does not offer to the 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:39.039
 teachers 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:43.789
 wolf also percent everything that was registered very important that you can 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.899
 generate in the form of ts 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.529
 so that 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:52.109
 you do not have to have any documents but if you need it you can always 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.279
 access it 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.569
 percent and as for father sticks level 1 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.380
 allows them to enter from home through the internet with a password 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.319
 that are given at the beginning of the course 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.729
 i percent 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:07.150
 to parents allows them to see the daily monitoring of children 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.710
 the note of loeza mÃ©nez spa the assistance 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.559
 the observations that it produces in a specific moment can do with it 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.030
 and children allow them to see daily 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.459
 the tasks of exercises that are demanded of all the subjects 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:22.829
 for the House 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.199
 also lets him know the exam dates 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.889
 and of course power the qualifications 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.609
 it is very important also for parents percent the system 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.299
 communication that you have with us because through the program 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.729
 Let us communicate and the son will not come to class for example 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.310
 or make an appointment with us 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.219
 for tutoring time 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.609
 the project good this city the general line of how the project works 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.939
 in the center it started as a pilot experience in the third cycle 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.639
 desired 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.389
 extended the second cycle 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.219
 to the first cycle 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.449
 it has not been possible to fully implement as I say of an experience 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:12.570
 Vido pilot can see about this resource string that sometimes 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.959
 we need pop 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.339
 especially laptops to or fight in this case for the 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.189
 specialist professor 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:24.300
 hello my name is age and if the college joan navarro de la hoya 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.570

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.990
 whereabouts 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.029
 is not true 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:35.080
 the note that we have been given 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.900
 and to communicate the advisory committee and who interests or communicates with me 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.840
 my father also the holy days stop in the note of the debt to them and 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.889
 we are sure of what I do or not 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.110
 often these days to that state because 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.289
 I would not owe it if I'm not wrong 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:58.739
