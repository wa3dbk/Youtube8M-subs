you saw we were going 3540 miles an hour

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.460 
you saw we were going 3540 miles an hour
I<00:03:08.610> believe<00:03:09.209> right<00:03:09.420> before<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.750> turned<00:03:10.049> on<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
I believe right before I turned on the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.930 
I believe right before I turned on the
camera<00:03:11.599> so<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:13.140> backs<00:03:13.440> up<00:03:13.739> all<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.280> way<00:03:14.430> from

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
camera so it backs up all the way from

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.050 
camera so it backs up all the way from
the<00:03:15.480> web<00:03:15.599> Chapel<00:03:16.019> extension<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.370> loop<00:03:17.730> 12
