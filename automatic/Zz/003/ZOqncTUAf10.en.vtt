00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
ready and you know away from home that's

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.850 
ready and you know away from home that's
a<00:00:49.090> key<00:00:49.239> is<00:00:49.390> making<00:00:50.140> sure<00:00:50.440> that<00:00:50.590> when<00:00:50.710> that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
a key is making sure that when that

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.590 
a key is making sure that when that
whistle<00:00:51.129> blows<00:00:51.340> that<00:00:51.579> you're<00:00:52.300> ready<00:00:52.480> because

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
whistle blows that you're ready because

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.060 
whistle blows that you're ready because
sometimes<00:00:53.020> it's<00:00:53.170> easy<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.410> be<00:00:53.559> complacent<00:00:53.829> on

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
sometimes it's easy to be complacent on

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.709 
sometimes it's easy to be complacent on
the<00:00:54.129> road<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:54.520> I<00:00:54.730> think<00:00:55.030> that's<00:00:55.570> most

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
the road so I think that's most

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.900 
the road so I think that's most
important<00:00:56.170> for<00:00:56.260> us<00:00:56.350> tomorrow<00:00:56.530> and<00:00:56.920> if<00:00:57.520> we<00:00:57.730> do

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
important for us tomorrow and if we do

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.549 
important for us tomorrow and if we do
that<00:00:57.940> then<00:00:58.239> well<00:00:58.420> then<00:00:58.600> hopefully<00:00:59.050> we<00:00:59.350> can<00:00:59.469> get

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
that then well then hopefully we can get

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.110 
that then well then hopefully we can get
the<00:00:59.649> right<00:00:59.769> result<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.219> think<00:01:00.850> we<00:01:00.940> have<00:01:00.969> you

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
the right result I think we have you

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.090 
the right result I think we have you
know<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.930> desire<00:01:02.199> more<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.649> wind<00:01:02.800> on<00:01:02.920> them

know one teams even more motivated
because<00:01:28.060> of<00:01:28.390> their<00:01:28.510> previous<00:01:28.810> results<00:01:29.350> it<00:01:29.410> was

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
because of their previous results it was

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.080 
because of their previous results it was
a<00:01:29.530> little<00:01:29.740> bit<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.280> that<00:01:30.670> last<00:01:30.940> week

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090

a little bit like that that last week
with<00:01:31.240> DC<00:01:31.570> United<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:32.050> think<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.440> it's<00:01:32.590> probably

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
with DC United I think and it's probably

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.110 
with DC United I think and it's probably
a<00:01:33.010> little<00:01:33.100> bit<00:01:33.280> like<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:33.610> this<00:01:33.760> week<00:01:33.940> and
