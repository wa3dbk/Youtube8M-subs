 we did a lot of things we collected 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 video from external surveillance cameras 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.239

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.000
 communicated with girls exposed 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.829

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.370
 which passed to us indifferent 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.399
 citizens in the light of all these actions 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.110
 we got real suspects we 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.439
 systematized all the data that have 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.860
 we were and passed them in charge 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.140
 Committee 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.710

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.530
 now we can not but we were told that this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.140
 the information is very price that it is real 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.280
 may affect the course of the investigation 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.920
 For over a month now we have been fed 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.650
 promises that everything will have 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 verified soon we are not 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.159

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.470
 investigators to their own duties 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.150
 and intend to continue to monitor the progress 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.100
 affairs 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.440

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.200
 comments 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.180
 Media and separately I would like to turn to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.790
 girls of our city and to all 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.759
 other residents 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.700
 don't be afraid to talk about any 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.910
 events do not be afraid to talk about 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.250
 harassment about attacks and attempts 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.070
 rape is not something that should 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.670
 feel shy that's exactly what we all need 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.670
 fight and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.890
 It is on us those who got in 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.239
 similar situation 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.930
 responsible for the future sacrifice 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:36.030
 because exactly we can prevent 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.030
 their appearance thanks
