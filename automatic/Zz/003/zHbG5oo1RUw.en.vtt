00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 there were androids as you are welcome to 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.299
 a new video today I will show you something that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.069
 You will definitely like them all, since it is from 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.870
 personalization but it's not about a 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.509
 theme or anything but configurations 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.670
 internal of the system and if it is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.350
 second module of the xbox framework that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.119
 taught about two months ago and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.410
 that I will leave you here and the truth is 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.970
 that since then I've been testing 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.100
 many modules but they are finished 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 uninstalling all since not really 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
 but they did not provide something really useful and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.519
 until today I did not find the second one that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 is the wiimote whose book I'll leave you in the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.300
 description times the monkey has 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.030
 basically three interesting sections 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 this application in terms of effects the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.540
 first of all it is the effect of 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.700
 bounce when you reach the end of the lists 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.140
 this good now I have it put 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.820
 pretty small I do not know if you can 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730
 observe but usually on android 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.410
 action when you get from a list then to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.910
 sometimes quite suddenly and this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.379
 effect as you see there is this effect of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.789
 bounce that has the iphone that by 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.770
 misfortune has patented and android not 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.020
 you can use but with this mode 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 so we can apply it then as 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.039
 you see makes the effect much more 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.510
 clean and to separate the best that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.060
 we have reached the end of the lists 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.060
 then all this can be configured 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860
 the section is bugle mod we activate it and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.470
 here we can select by pixels 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 this distance the next point are 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.490
 the animations as you will see now what 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.079
 I have totally put in random all 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.990
 and as you see it acts in a way 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.280
 rather curious the less but what 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.000
 good is that you can configure everything 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.229
 we go to the section system animation 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.270
 animation control we also activate it 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.220
 we mark this tick and here we can 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.799
 select the duration below 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.899
 we have the whole list of animations and 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.850
 possible situations with which 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.539
 do these animations and for each 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.459
 one 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.560
 in particular we can select between 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.780
 all these options also in windows 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.729
 transition you can select the one from tele 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.409
 transition that is the one that gets this 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.780
 Effect of windows and keyboards 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 for example if I'm going to write a tweet 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.750
 you have seen how the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.970
 keyboard the truth is that it's pretty 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.380
 curious and the truth is that you can not see 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.929
 not much and it's quite a button 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.959
 the third point of this application is what 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.039
 which is called list view animation this is 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.989
 the animation that you will see now 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.569
 continuation which is that when we go down to 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.219
 the list and new items appear 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.049
 with the effect that we want 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.129
 so for example I'm going to administrator 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.159
 of applications that you will see more 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.389
 you clearly see how you are going as 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.040
 I go down, the 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:26.819
 elements in all applications already 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.499
 be with tweets with youtube videos with 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.329
 absolutely all the lists as you see 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:33.359
 makes this effect clear, as it is very 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:36.150
 interesting then we go to the tri mod to the 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.889
 section list view animation and then 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.480
 here we can select the one that I 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.579
 I have placed now is the wave left 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.319
 although there are many more but the others I 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.669
 I see them too bulky and that 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.879
 it really is already even loss of 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:49.829
 time then here we can select 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.510
 the kind of no animation but if there 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.909
 some effect for example more rotary 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.379
 acceleration acceleration to which I 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.900
 I liked the most is this one 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.159
 deceleration and finally the duration and 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.139
 now I have cut a little bit because if not 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.819
 well, if it did not go down if the guy went down 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.519
 they were slow to appear in 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.019
 approximately 180 milliseconds is for 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.299
 me the most optimal but you will see that there 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.310
 other options that comes is also 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.049
 application this module but these are 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.819
 the three most prominent then as 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.620
 we may have seen thanks to this 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.900
 module that we will have customized all 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.840
 the effects from our device 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.579
 and good until today I want to add 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.140
 that these last two months are a 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.950
 little absent from the channel and all who 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.629
 surrounds 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.970
 for personal things but I'll be back 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.040
 channel and they will watch videos much more 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.540
 them so I hope they support me and they 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.459
 they liked the video disappeared 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.079
 interesting is the application of a good 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.909
 like to help the community but 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.019
 android to continue making trips has already 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.019
 been the next androids
