00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
in the kill feed which means he

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.569 
in the kill feed which means he
literally<00:02:00.380> got<00:02:00.469> it<00:02:00.710> like<00:02:00.829> three<00:02:01.340> or<00:02:01.549> four

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
literally got it like three or four

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.419 
literally got it like three or four
seconds<00:02:02.149> before<00:02:02.329> um<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.679> then<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.920> last<00:02:04.069> kill

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
seconds before um and then the last kill

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.999 
seconds before um and then the last kill
he<00:02:04.759> managed<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.299> get<00:02:05.569> literally<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:06.709> 10

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
he managed to get literally like 10

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.389 
he managed to get literally like 10
seconds<00:02:07.520> before<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:08.149> um<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.470> even<00:02:10.130> with<00:02:10.250> all

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
seconds before that um so even with all

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.790 
seconds before that um so even with all
that<00:02:10.429> time<00:02:10.700> added<00:02:11.120> up<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:11.360> comes<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.690> like<00:02:11.840> 420

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
that time added up it comes to like 420

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.230 
that time added up it comes to like 420
I<00:02:13.040> believe<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.520> might<00:02:13.640> be<00:02:13.730> even<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.910> little<00:02:14.000> less

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
I believe it might be even a little less

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.970 
I believe it might be even a little less
than<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.480> yeah<00:02:14.660> right<00:02:14.870> here<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.770> still

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
than that yeah right here you can still

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.530 
than that yeah right here you can still
see<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.250> Willie<00:02:16.459> yeah<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.120> can<00:02:17.240> still<00:02:17.420> see

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
see that Willie yeah you can still see

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.760 
see that Willie yeah you can still see
that<00:02:17.690> kill<00:02:17.900> right<00:02:18.050> there<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.320> kill<00:02:18.560> feed

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
that kill right there on the kill feed

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.440 
that kill right there on the kill feed
um<00:02:19.450> but

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
um but

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.080 
um but
he<00:02:21.629> managed<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.230> get<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.560> like<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:23.090> 420

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
he managed to get it like in 420

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.780 
he managed to get it like in 420
probably<00:02:24.599> around<00:02:25.410> there<00:02:25.769> but<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.310> previous

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
probably around there but the previous

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.160 
probably around there but the previous
record<00:02:26.910> was<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.450> believe<00:02:28.129> 337<00:02:29.129> or<00:02:29.930> 437<00:02:30.930> my<00:02:31.019> vet

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
record was I believe 337 or 437 my vet

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.140 
record was I believe 337 or 437 my vet
for<00:02:31.319> 37<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.910> one<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.629> like<00:02:34.670> 420<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
for 37 and this one is in like 420 and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.430 
for 37 and this one is in like 420 and
somewhere<00:02:36.510> around<00:02:36.599> there<00:02:37.010> for<00:02:38.010> 24<00:02:38.790> 15<00:02:39.300> um<00:02:39.569> so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
somewhere around there for 24 15 um so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.820 
somewhere around there for 24 15 um so
it's<00:02:40.709> still<00:02:41.720> definitely<00:02:42.720> less<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.590> last

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
it's still definitely less that last

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.040 
it's still definitely less that last
kill<00:02:44.160> before<00:02:44.459> he<00:02:44.760> started<00:02:45.480> or<00:02:45.630> before<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.930> got

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
kill before he started or before you got

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.150 
kill before he started or before you got
that<00:02:46.200> kill<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.560> didn't<00:02:46.769> see<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.010> in<00:02:47.069> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
that kill you didn't see it's in the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.530 
that kill you didn't see it's in the
killfeed<00:02:47.580> literally<00:02:47.910> three<00:02:48.120> seconds<00:02:48.420> before

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
killfeed literally three seconds before

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.190 
killfeed literally three seconds before
um<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.580> can<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.209> or<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.870> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
um you you can see it or it's it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.930 
um you you can see it or it's it
wouldn't<00:02:52.470> have<00:02:52.560> been<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.709> much<00:02:53.099> before<00:02:53.549> this

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
wouldn't have been that much before this

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.990 
wouldn't have been that much before this
um<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.980> second<00:02:56.370> part<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
um and in the second part of this the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.059 
um and in the second part of this the
second<00:02:57.330> kem<00:02:57.480> strike<00:02:57.780> he<00:02:57.959> actually<00:02:58.170> one<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
second kem strike he actually one of the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.520 
second kem strike he actually one of the
guys<00:02:59.220> started<00:02:59.519> backing<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.970> unfortunately

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
guys started backing out unfortunately

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.410 
guys started backing out unfortunately
but<00:03:01.530> he<00:03:01.620> was<00:03:01.769> still<00:03:02.010> able<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.519> get<00:03:02.819> those<00:03:03.030> kills

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
but he was still able to get those kills

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.640 
but he was still able to get those kills
right<00:03:04.230> around<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.980> 24<00:03:05.819> 25<00:03:06.569> around<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.349> area

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
right around for 24 25 around that area

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.640 
right around for 24 25 around that area
so<00:03:08.489> still<00:03:08.760> about<00:03:08.940> 15<00:03:09.120> 10<00:03:09.720> seconds<00:03:10.200> faster<00:03:10.620> than

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
so still about 15 10 seconds faster than

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.520 
so still about 15 10 seconds faster than
the<00:03:10.920> previous<00:03:11.540> world<00:03:12.540> record<00:03:12.720> for<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.200> double
