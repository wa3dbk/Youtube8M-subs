00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.510 
767 we have almost 800 orders so far and
we<00:01:44.180> expect<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.750> retrofit<00:01:45.259> over<00:01:45.520> 5,000

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
we expect a retrofit over 5,000

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.850 
we expect a retrofit over 5,000
airplanes<00:01:47.000> in<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.420> next<00:01:47.660> five<00:01:47.840> years

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
airplanes in the next five years

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.670 
airplanes in the next five years
so<00:01:49.430> what<00:01:49.640> we're<00:01:49.820> going<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.030> do<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.360> adapt<00:01:50.900> this

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
so what we're going to do is adapt this

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.580 
so what we're going to do is adapt this
technology<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.730> other<00:01:53.240> airplanes<00:01:53.780> as<00:01:54.020> well<00:01:54.260> we

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
technology to other airplanes as well we

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.110 
technology to other airplanes as well we
haven't<00:01:54.740> approved<00:01:55.070> any<00:01:55.280> new<00:01:55.490> programs<00:01:55.940> but

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
haven't approved any new programs but

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.760 
haven't approved any new programs but
that's<00:01:56.330> kind<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:56.630> next<00:01:56.990> in<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.200> future<00:01:57.560> in

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
that's kind of next in the future in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.100 
that's kind of next in the future in
addition<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.730> that<00:01:58.970> we're<00:01:59.450> working<00:01:59.810> on<00:01:59.930> new

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
addition to that we're working on new

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.260 
addition to that we're working on new
laminar<00:02:00.590> flow<00:02:00.800> studies<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.790> we<00:02:01.970> think<00:02:02.180> we

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
laminar flow studies that we think we

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.330 
laminar flow studies that we think we
can<00:02:02.300> take<00:02:02.660> this<00:02:03.170> winglet<00:02:03.590> without<00:02:03.860> modifying

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
can take this winglet without modifying

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.540 
can take this winglet without modifying
it<00:02:04.580> even<00:02:04.850> make<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.150> save<00:02:05.330> even<00:02:05.479> more<00:02:05.630> fuel<00:02:06.550> so

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
it even make it save even more fuel so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.710 
it even make it save even more fuel so
what's<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.880> future<00:02:08.060> for<00:02:08.270> we<00:02:08.570> let

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
what's in the future for we let

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.500 
what's in the future for we let
technology<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.470> aviation<00:02:09.710> partners<00:02:10.160> well<00:02:11.150> we

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
technology and aviation partners well we

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.640 
technology and aviation partners well we
like<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.810> say<00:02:11.960> we're<00:02:12.140> just<00:02:12.350> getting<00:02:12.620> started

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
like to say we're just getting started

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.830 
like to say we're just getting started
we<00:02:13.280> have<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.490> new<00:02:13.670> technology<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.690> can

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
we have a new technology that you can

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.449 
we have a new technology that you can
see<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.200> screen<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.590> spy<00:02:15.860> road<00:02:16.070> which<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.310> a

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
see on the screen is spy road which is a

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.580 
see on the screen is spy road which is a
circular<00:02:17.300> tip<00:02:17.570> we<00:02:18.110> think<00:02:18.320> that's<00:02:18.440> very

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
circular tip we think that's very

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.680 
circular tip we think that's very
promising<00:02:19.550> we<00:02:19.670> think<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.240> add<00:02:20.390> as<00:02:20.540> much

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
promising we think that can add as much

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.140 
promising we think that can add as much
as<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> 12-percent<00:02:21.590> fuel<00:02:21.920> saving<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:22.700> existing

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
as a 12-percent fuel saving for existing

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.240 
as a 12-percent fuel saving for existing
airliners<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.560> unique<00:02:24.830> thing<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.130> our

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
airliners and the unique thing on our

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.920 
airliners and the unique thing on our
product<00:02:25.700> is<00:02:25.820> we<00:02:26.000> can<00:02:26.180> take<00:02:26.360> what's<00:02:26.570> existing

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
product is we can take what's existing

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.040 
product is we can take what's existing
out<00:02:27.290> there<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:28.160> can<00:02:28.280> modify<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.120> to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
out there and we can modify it to to

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.730 
out there and we can modify it to to
make<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> table<00:02:30.650> on<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.800> fuel<00:02:31.070> that's<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.400> big<00:02:31.550> deal
