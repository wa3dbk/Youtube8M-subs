00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.770
 hi hello my jacket welcome another 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.990
 all of you today I bring you this 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.820
 dramatic makeup that many of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.160
 you were asking me they sent me 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.900
 a picture of this makeup I thought 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.789
 super nice so I re created it with 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 sweetheart presence I hope you like it 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.970
 this idea this makeup usually looks a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 bit difficult but the truth is very 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.320
 simple to perform first we're going to 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 begin by applying us a base of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.570
 shadow on our entire eyelid 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.570
 preference that is skin color 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 and 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.030
 right away I'm going to take a tonality 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:51.719
 matte candy and I'll put it in shape 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.359
 of bow with a very chubby brochette 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.969
 my whole basin we're going to blur it 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.120
 can be helped with this type of brush 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.739
 that is excellent girls and then you 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 can take any color that is 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.090
 look like your partner is not necessary 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.700
 have the same products 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.520
 now let's take a tonality of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.740
 very light brown color and we're going to 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.719
 Tap with a brush very 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.719
 Flat around our eyelid moore 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.540
 let's light up the area of â€‹â€‹the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.960
 animal using a colored shadow 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.960
 white 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.560
 now let's take a tonality 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.560
 Vanilla down our eyebrows 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.160
 let's offer the water line 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.160
 using a black pencil 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.700
 and now we will start with the step that is 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.820
 a bit difficult but nothing impossible 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.130
 girls so very carefully we are going to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.050
 perform our delineation we begin 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.240
 making a hairline very close to 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.150
 our eyelashes 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.150
 let's go up vertically to form 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.770
 a delineated kitty type and little by little 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.770
 let's go it thickening 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.410
 in the animal part we are going to create a 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 triangle and in that way our eyes 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.970
 they are going to look very feline 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.300
 now let's go through the second 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.910
 outlined we will take reference in 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.240
 our lower lashes we are going to 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.959
 create a line and we will draw a 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:41.290
 line as we trace it in the part 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.719
 lower only a little thinner 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.519
 and likewise we went to do what 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.519
 same in the part of the lacrimal 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.840
 in those two openings we will create light 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.350
 putting a little color pencil 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.350
 White 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.349
 also apply false eyelashes 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.880
 celebrity station of the brand time on 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.280
 line 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.320
 Now we are going to create a smoky in the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.040
 bottom part let's put a little bit 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.460
 of shade matte black and then we go 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 to go to blur down just that 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.880
 part 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.360
 let's go mask to swell and 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.629
 from the volume to our tabs 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.629
 lower 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.120
 and finally I'm going to apply this gloss 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.740
 mate that smells delicious is the brand 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.740
 knicks and it's an orange 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.000
 and that's how our look ends on the day of 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.010
 today girls I hope I have met all 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.250
