 from the Russian border 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.690
 but for some reason universal concern 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.790
 It was Russian military exercises that caused 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.370
 which took place in several places on 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.920

 Defense According to the US State Department Russian 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.280
 exercises lead to increased tensions 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.049
 Europe does not like Russian doctrine but 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.110
 at the same time a mass demonstration of military 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.150
 forces and and it seems quite satisfied and so 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.190
 France Germany is trying to cool 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.799
 public was regarding the situation on 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.750
 Ukraine is true but why aren't they 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.670
 try to calm down washington when 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.180
 Eastern Europe held a military parade 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.459
 the difference between ec and 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.650
 nato can say that operations on 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.099
 Ukraine, the very beginning of 90 percent 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.150
 is the NATO operation made the European Union 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.790
 bet on klitschko as a new 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.950
 leaders of Ukraine and lost in particular 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.040
 for germany it was a basic plan 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.439
 spare she had no primary purpose 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.989
 Usa has always been an extension of nato and 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.629
 bringing Ukraine to your side 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.120
 at any price exactly so far 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.400
 events developed now Ukraine 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.989
 is a failed state 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.989
 divided into eastern and western 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.849
 parts in condition 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.950
 civil war with the eastern part 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.500
 Ukraine wants to secede from the state 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.200
 which already does not exist because she 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.450
 built on hate all present 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.569
 Kiev government is built on 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.670
 hate but what the Americans want they 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.560
 want to place NATO military bases 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.470
 in the territory which remained from 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.570
 Ukraine and are not going to retreat because 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.090
 that their priority is 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.400
 not reaching an agreement with iran 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.620
 its nuclear program is not in resolution 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.720
 Syrian crisis and not even 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.120
 Venezuela declared a threat to their 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.759
 state interests main 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.190
 America considers Russia a threat why 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.770
 let's summarize the Eurasian 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.979
 integration means that Russia is China 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.860
 Germany and other productive countries 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.409
 economies will work together this 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.960
 integration will take ten years main 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.830
 China will play a role in it 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.300
 Russian-Chinese partnership and 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.070
 rapprochement with germany 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.560
 it is in terms of German 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.960
 industrialists are watching Americans and 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.210
 they think we will be cut off from Eurasia 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.110
 as Vladimir Putin said more than once 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.169
 Eurasia 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.580
 means from Lisbon to Vladivostok 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.729
 the Chinese are now laying a new one 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.370
 silk road from shanghai to berlin eurasia 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.260
 united and united eurasia in terms of 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.139
 trade has a bright future 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.840
 what the Americans are responding to we 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.240
 crush your dream is not allowed to 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.909
 it came true because otherwise the way to 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.909
 Eurasia is closed for us everything is very simple
