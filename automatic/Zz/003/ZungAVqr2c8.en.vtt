your scalp with this cap yes and it
regenerates<00:00:58.359> hair<00:00:58.690> well<00:00:58.989> what<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.289> does<00:00:59.469> is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.169 
regenerates hair well what it does is
that<00:00:59.620> you<00:01:00.039> stop<00:01:00.339> losing<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:00.789> hair<00:01:00.940> because

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
that you stop losing the hair because

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.090 
that you stop losing the hair because
the<00:01:01.300> fact<00:01:01.539> that<00:01:01.600> it<00:01:01.780> relaxes<00:01:02.469> the<00:01:02.499> muscles<00:01:02.979> we

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
the fact that it relaxes the muscles we

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.889 
the fact that it relaxes the muscles we
think<00:01:03.309> this<00:01:03.429> is<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.639> detective<00:01:04.329> mcann

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
think this is the detective mcann

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.929 
think this is the detective mcann
mechanism<00:01:05.439> behind<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.829> that<00:01:05.979> it<00:01:06.340> relaxes<00:01:06.610> the

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
mechanism behind it that it relaxes the

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.700 
mechanism behind it that it relaxes the
muscles<00:01:07.659> around<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.930> hair<00:01:08.140> allows<00:01:08.530> the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
muscles around the hair allows the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.109 
muscles around the hair allows the
nourishments<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.340> come<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.640> your<00:01:09.759> hair<00:01:09.939> so
