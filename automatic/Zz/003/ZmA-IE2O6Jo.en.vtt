00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.600
 or light guys and 2000 and well today is a 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.570
 review with all the cars that have 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.760
 left in the dlc of 1.21 is worth the dlc 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.680
 Christmas this time because it has only 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.390
 left in nextgen as you can see 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.670
 we have the four cars tuned to 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.230
 maximum is good, well, they are all 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.390
 very beautiful the ones I like are the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.800
 outsider massacre have first video that 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.300
 go up then I'm wrong I thought it was 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.280
 the same car with different stickers 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.960
 but I see that it's not worth it and you can see that 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.030
 let's start with this car worth with 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.250
 the massacre in red color that is very 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.200
 handsome then good you can see that he is 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.149
 tuneado barmaid looks good has 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.980
 a lot of improvements we can change you 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.020
 the color to what the car is and it 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.430
 the sticker is the same as before and 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.620
 The truth is that it is the car that has most 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.090
 liked next to and esther is worth the two 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.070
 sports cars, clearly they are 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.629
 the ones that I liked the most, which is why 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.370
 here you can see it looks pretty good 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.289
 I think it runs the same as the massacre 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.850
 normal, it seems to me that it runs 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.670
 exactly the same but I really do not know 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.170
 to say you are worth I think that so 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.760
 well you can see that it is very good and 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.140
 let's go with the next car worth 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.600
 that will be the one of esther 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.920
 and be like this or it is very similar 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.140
 it may be I was wrong in the video 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.640
 previous because it looks a lot like 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.260
 As you can see, it's a little bit different 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.430
 ok you can see that the color 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.659
 yellow 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.670
 fix the back that color 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.470
 red is red you can not change vale 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.759
 we can only change what is the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.990
 front that will put the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.550
 color that we want and the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.330
 stickers are going to stay the same as 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.560
 before 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.690
 and you can see that the speed of the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.009
 car is very, very good and that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.930
 this car as distant was more 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.820
 enchanted just like slaughtered vale are 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.470
 the two cars that I liked the most 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.060
 the theme of having the stickers is worth 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.369
 I go to are the same as those already 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.990
 I had before but with stickers that 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.550
 It seems that it is the only difference worth 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.110
 so we're going with the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.149
 next car and you can see that this 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.000
 rapa car very, very well worth 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.289
 and for my opinion it is the best 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.110
 that the masagro is worth because they are 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.550
 sports and they are very very handsome like that 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.860
 that's good with the next one 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.710
 he is also very handsome tuned because 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.080
 tune is a very ugly car is the rat 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.280
 truck here you can see this car 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.560
 I wanted it to be crap but what 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.570
 tuned and it is very cool although the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.790
 it really gets pretty fast if you do not 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.000
 you were going very, very slow, but if 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.980
 you had it, it takes a lot of speed 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 if you look closely now more very but that 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.120
 very slow because the speed of 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.220
 accelerate is very slow but as soon as 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.620
 we take a top speed in terms of 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.420
 more straight for a while he will take a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.430
 incredible speed goes for the car 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.110
 it is and you can see later how handsome 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.700
 is that you can take a lot of money is 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.920
 a car that can take a lot of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.360
 things that is various ways of tuning what 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.910
 varying your doctor to the maximum for this 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.560
 type that is for that reason since there 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.780
 things that are better than the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.100
 maximum but they are very well worth 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.690
 set the speed that it picks up as I have 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.090
 said draw a lot of speed for the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.230
 car that seems to go pretty fast and 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.910
 let's go with the next one that 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.470
 It looks a lot like this but unfortunately 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.470
 you can not have so much 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 and finally, we have what is the 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.290
 goes pitch slam man is it worth this car 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.030
 who is very handsome although you can not 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.640
 have a lot of what I liked about this 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.990
 car is the body is worth as you can 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.000
 see I have set to zero or whether 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.650
 I have lowered whole and fixed very well 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.959
 that for the part of before is more 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.030
 inclined that the back is worth 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.040
 a very curious thing and they should catch a lot 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.600
 speed although it seems that no but 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.239
 clearly if this car we did not have it 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.400
 it's a very ugly car and it takes a lot but 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.989
 very little speed also highlights that 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.400
 let's choose two colors is worth the 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.680
 top part has a color and by the 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.090
 low part has another although I decide 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.860
 put the same color because there is a lot 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.720
 it's better so it's good with this 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.670
 general made the video to youtube like 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.560
 comment and subscribe is a 500 the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.370
 iphone this review would be perfect as well 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.370
 good goodbye
