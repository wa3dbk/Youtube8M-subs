00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.990
 when the new motorola team that 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.730
 it is on a motorcycle x here we have your box as 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 I said this you can already have that time 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.400
 that came out about a month maybe a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.220
 little less but good mexico arrived 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.470
 recently is available here with the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.750
 telcel operator and so is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.830
 driving here in mexico nextel the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.840
 price that is being handled 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.550
 officially in Mexico it is 11 thousand 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.020
 so they want to see it is totally 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.969
 real and official is 10 thousand 999 pesos in 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.579
 prepaid and then it is also available 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.440
 in different plans there and so what 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.719
 you will take out directly with telcel 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.550
 or nextel good this is the team 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.059
 only here came to mexico in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 black and white colors this your box the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.280
 model is to be so the international x 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.219
 of 10 53 this equipment is 4g lte and also 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.480
 is 3g obviously with nextel and with 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.460
 any other operator if it is that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.540
 releases on this computer is already totally 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.810
 liberated I acquired it 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.240
 to release it originally this is a 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.430
 team was from nextel as I said I passed it to 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.970
 release and well I'm going to occupy 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.970
 with telcel 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.860
 finally here what has the box 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.720
 really simple does not have so the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.260
 great thing is the team is going to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.260
 check it well 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.340
 although the tool to take out the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.060
 zinc this team use the no if they do not use 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.579
 micros walks we do not have the tool 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.310
 and with the motor logo that they take out 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.720
 about it and a little bit what we have in 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.730
 this part 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.730
 its quick-use manuals 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.840
 instructional bands what we have 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.630
 here everything is completely in Spanish 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.070
 with the charm is a team that is here to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.229
 national level 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.870
 this works with the nextel network 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.070
 evolution but sanz and a team gsm 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.530
 it works well with any 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.539
 3g operator and given that it has the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.150
 compatible ltd bands here in mexico 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.580
 works with lte on telcel once 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.830
 liberated of course 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.410
 the pri so that you have the nextel radio 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.260
 to be cold that comes in the box 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.210
 comes with only comes here the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 good charger the usb cable to micro usb 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.320
 which serves to load it also pass 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.380
 data there to our team in the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.150
 computer and finally the charger 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.560
 wall that is white color treatment 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.430
 two usb ports there is basically what 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.990
 who brings the box 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.660
 then the team 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.040
 pretty nice i like i like it a lot 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.070
 more blank is also me 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.680
 available in black color x camera 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.140
 10 megapixels record video in full hd 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.440
 also recorded in hd we have his flash 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.650
 led 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.420
 power button volume button 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.970
 up and down microusb port so that 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.730
 we have put on the hearing aids or 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.220
 the entrance 3.5 mm standard 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.580
 and here they have the slot to insert the 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.700
 nano sim I wanted to put the little needle and 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:25.000
 take out the tray the display is 4.7 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.250
 inches with hd 720 p quality this 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.410
 team is not full hd program and it looks 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.879
 very well the screen that is annoying 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.379
 the colors are unsaturated but 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.750
 pretty would be pretty pretty good 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.080
 the front we have a camera of 2 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.080
 megapixels 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.690
 as the animation here I had to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.599
 understand and put the sim to activate it 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.200
 release it but well that 's what 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:55.430
 we have here let's turn it on its 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.709
 start animation your pot animation 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.450
 in the inner part good so everything 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.090
 what we are all interested in comes with a 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.909
 dual-core processor qualcomm snapdragon 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.409
 s4 but that many of you were to bumpy 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.480
 in the person that I can alcohol but 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.450
 for nothing at all to see if they are repeated 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.969
 for nothing is it is a low-end equipment or 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.509
 Mid range is considered a gamut equipment 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.709
 high since it has a system 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:22.340
 custom made motorola 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.990
 google that is called ctv x8 of slope 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.870
 mind of the two nuclei that 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.599
 processor handles eight other cores two 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.949
 are for processing two take about 2 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.110
 as I told you the two option for 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.080
 processing operations here of the 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.139
 applications 4 are only occupied 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.120
 exclusively for graphics and two others 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.190
 they are low power which is what we are going 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.080
 to keep the device always 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.699
 turned on as it is said that always 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.680
 there is going to be listening is going to 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.590
 be notifying always going to be there 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.780
 waiting for a command and really what 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.539
 that make those eight cores together 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.150
 it's quite a pretty efficiency 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:00.770
 good with more battery performance 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.979
 Excelent 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.280
 as I say the snapdragon processor 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.440
 s4 custom pro to show it two 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:15.830
 cores minus another eight cpu cores 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.599
 x86 gb ram 16gb internal memory this 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.729
 equipment does not have micro sd port inside 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.440
 of very important and if you want 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.449
 of more capacity is really not going 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.520
 have only going to have 16 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.919
 internal gigas plus the services that 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.729
 have in the cloud as dropbox do not 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:34.340
 pete the mega et cetera etcetera then 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.630
 of that was roughly here well in 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.380
 Spanish 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:43.699
 the operating system comes almost let's say 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.830
 at 99.99 9% pure android does not come with 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:50.570
 no custom interface 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.570
 of motorola or anything like that 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.770
 properly I will put it 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.590
 They do not come with custom icons nor 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.540
 with no extra ai interface 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:07.330
 basically how I tell you is the 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.330
 pure android experience 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.250
 it's an option that was not 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.090
 As you can see, there are icons 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.980
 we have nothing intrusive we do not have here 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.230
 No extra customization as you 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.730
 I say the team from originally on 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.980
 excel so that it is working without 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.020
 any problem and happen as I eat 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.860
 the guy that releases this function here 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.860
 the 4g lte network 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.120
 all the original shortcuts and 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.890
 with the originals of living android 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:48.340
 4.2.2 and later it is going to 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.340
 update to 4.3 the android version 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.600
 You can see the team moves a lot 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.600
 well everything instantaneously 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.919
 and then in another video I'm going to make you 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.780
 a more thorough review of this 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:05.560
 It was basically a boxing of 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.840
 motorola x for android mx dot net yo 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.210
 I'm triforce so here on this team 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.130
 in an unblocked way happen with 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.419
 any operator send an email to 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.229
 Contact 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:19.479
 android mx dot net and then there we 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.820
 we are in communication so I 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:25.440
 dismissal I am triforce and see you 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.440
 until next time
