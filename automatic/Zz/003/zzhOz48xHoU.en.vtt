all right today we did a back superset
high-volume<00:00:03.000> training<00:00:03.570> we<00:00:03.929> isolated<00:00:04.440> the

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
high-volume training we isolated the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.800 
high-volume training we isolated the
back<00:00:04.830> will<00:00:05.460> stay<00:00:05.670> functional<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.330> whole<00:00:06.509> time

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810
