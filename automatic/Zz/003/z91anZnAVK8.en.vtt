00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.400
 with me as his worth 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.950
 where do I start the point is that 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.950
 find new 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.640
 good 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.940
 we will go to the store 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.519
 less clear 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.910
 friends 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 are 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600
 and I got tired 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.280
 it's taking an eternity for helmets 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.060
 They kill me when we have been walking 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.559
 five minutes highness I never imagined that 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.010
 look for a new land series so 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.080
 difficult , it will be worth it, do not believe it 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.120
 fact I think the three tribes could 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.660
 try harder than happens this is what 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.660
 happens 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.229
 alteza alone is a stream we can 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.630
 cross it easily 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.190
 come and water wet my dress I do not have 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.020
 intention to reach my new land 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.450
 looking like a job or cop 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.880
 terrestrial or worse yet a rude and wild 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.409
 pegasus I at least have no intention of 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.509
 lower me to your level 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.649
 On the other hand I have no problem with seeing 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.649
 that you rebate 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.030
 and beware the dress darling is worth more 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.030
 that all the books in your library 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.700
 this is definitely the address 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.210
 correct it seems that we go in circles 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.640
 that is impossible we say 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.860
 I'm misreading the map course 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.039
 that no great chancellor is just that there 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.300
 holes in the map and well clear of what 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.000
 another way I would see where I'm going to 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.550
 talk I need to be able to talk I say how 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.850
 survive if I suddenly shut up that 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.280
 Heaven free us from that great chancellor 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.890
 that what the map besides being of 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.780
 head if here news for you cookie the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.650
 earth is round there is neither up nor 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.480
 down is right is a great relief for 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.480
 me that you are in charge of this map 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.950
 since he needs relief I am not the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.950
 Chancellor or are important 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.489
 Secretary 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.970
 I enjoy a bit of relief Chancellor 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.980
 found obstacles in the way but 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.980
 eventually everyone arrived 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.890
 paradise 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.200
 my future house of jack and I believe that 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.200
 this new earth will be 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.390
 I had seen jewelry plans is that least 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.040
