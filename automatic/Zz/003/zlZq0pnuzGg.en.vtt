00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.479 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
to achieve a design this then we had to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.960 
to achieve a design this then we had to
look<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.470> making<00:00:58.830> many<00:00:59.130> of<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.460> complex

inside the design smaller it's actually

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
inside the design smaller it's actually
eighteen<00:01:03.180> percent<00:01:03.420> thinner<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.260> twenty

very<00:01:48.750> carefully<00:01:49.380> we've<00:01:49.920> created<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.640> new

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
very carefully we've created the new

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.389 
very carefully we've created the new
much<00:01:51.330> smaller<00:01:51.750> lightning<00:01:52.410> connector<00:01:52.920> it's

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
much smaller lightning connector it's

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.700 
much smaller lightning connector it's
all<00:01:53.670> digital<00:01:53.910> so<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.780> designed<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.350> today

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
all digital so it's designed for today

all digital so it's designed for today
juices<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:57.210> made<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> reversible<00:01:58.080> so<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
juices and we made it reversible so it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.790 
juices and we made it reversible so it
fits<00:01:58.920> either<00:01:59.160> way<00:01:59.930> we<00:02:00.930> also<00:02:01.110> move<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
fits either way we also move to a

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.700 
fits either way we also move to a
sapphire<00:02:02.370> lens<00:02:02.850> cover<00:02:03.240> which<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.020> thinner<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
sapphire lens cover which is thinner and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.250 
sapphire lens cover which is thinner and
more<00:02:04.800> durable<00:02:05.400> than<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.000> previous<00:02:06.659> cover<00:02:06.960> box

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
more durable than the previous cover box

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.770 
more durable than the previous cover box
this<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.340> protects<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.970> optics<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
this really protects the optics and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.620 
this really protects the optics and
keeps<00:02:10.050> your<00:02:10.200> photos<00:02:10.590> right

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
keeps your photos right

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.480 
keeps your photos right
I<00:02:11.720> don't<00:02:12.110> think<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.410> level<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.830> convention

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
I don't think the level of convention
