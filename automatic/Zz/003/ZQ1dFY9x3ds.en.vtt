00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
seconds you won't hear the motion sensor

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.160 
seconds you won't hear the motion sensor
anymore<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:31.150> are<00:02:31.269> not<00:02:31.390> being<00:02:31.569> detected<00:02:31.810> any

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
anymore you are not being detected any

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.300 
anymore you are not being detected any
more<00:02:32.790> explosions<00:02:33.790> like<00:02:33.940> 40-millimeter<00:02:34.599> can

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
more explosions like 40-millimeter can

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.190 
more explosions like 40-millimeter can
make<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.459> motion<00:02:36.670> boom<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.299> move<00:02:37.510> away

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
make the motion boom and move away

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.110 
make the motion boom and move away
but<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.680> unreliable<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.579> physics<00:02:39.940> are<00:02:40.090> a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
but it's unreliable the physics are a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.160 
but it's unreliable the physics are a
bit<00:02:40.269> odd<00:02:40.450> with<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> motion<00:02:41.530> sensor<00:02:42.959> if<00:02:43.959> you're

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
bit odd with the motion sensor if you're

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.660 
bit odd with the motion sensor if you're
not<00:02:44.319> playing<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.709> can<00:02:44.920> take<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.340> minute<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
not playing you can take a minute the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.400 
not playing you can take a minute the
movie<00:02:45.910> then<00:02:46.390> it's<00:02:46.540> a<00:02:46.629> good<00:02:46.780> habit<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.049> pick<00:02:47.260> up

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
movie then it's a good habit to pick up

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.890 
movie then it's a good habit to pick up
their<00:02:47.590> kit<00:02:47.859> throw<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.430> motion<00:02:48.790> sensor<00:02:49.299> get

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
their kit throw the motion sensor get

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.569 
their kit throw the motion sensor get
your<00:02:50.019> own<00:02:50.079> key<00:02:50.290> back<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.859> then<00:02:51.069> use<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
your own key back and then use the

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:59.890 
your own key back and then use the
scanning<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.930> your<00:02:53.049> advantage

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.300 

if<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.020> throw<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.230> motion<00:03:01.590> sensor<00:03:01.770> over<00:03:02.100> a

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
if you throw a motion sensor over a

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.580 
if you throw a motion sensor over a
building<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:03.570> can<00:03:03.750> quickly<00:03:03.930> see<00:03:04.290> what's

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
building you can quickly see what's

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.780 
building you can quickly see what's
happening<00:03:04.980> inside<00:03:07.250> motion<00:03:08.250> sensors<00:03:08.640> are

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
happening inside motion sensors are

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.700 
happening inside motion sensors are
especially<00:03:09.060> useful<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.810> see<00:03:09.990> which<00:03:10.260> direction

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
especially useful to see which direction

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.620 
especially useful to see which direction
the<00:03:11.010> enemy<00:03:11.130> are<00:03:11.520> looking<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.330> flank

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
the enemy are looking so you can flank

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.140 
the enemy are looking so you can flank
them

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.340 

this<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.330> really<00:03:21.600> good<00:03:21.720> way<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.870> helping<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
this is a really good way of helping the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.830 
this is a really good way of helping the
team<00:03:22.590> get<00:03:23.250> yourself<00:03:23.580> back<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.030> recent<00:03:24.420> box

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
team get yourself back to a recent box

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.170 
team get yourself back to a recent box
get<00:03:25.410> your<00:03:25.560> map<00:03:25.710> over<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.190> keep<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.550> open<00:03:26.640> and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
get your map over and keep it open and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.880 
get your map over and keep it open and
then<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.600> throw<00:03:27.840> three<00:03:28.080> couples<00:03:28.530> in

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
then just throw three couples in

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.760 
then just throw three couples in
different<00:03:29.280> directions<00:03:29.960> the<00:03:30.960> Intel<00:03:31.380> from
