00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.300
 and very cross 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.090
 welcome to live here we are 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.040
 in another mechanisms tutorial this time 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.630
 it's a basic tutorial we're going to see a 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.880
 how reps work 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.189
 but good is not so basic anymore 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.290
 know a little more about mechanisms to go 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.369
 handling this issue but well I'm going to 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.829
 try to explain it the most basic 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.919
 possible so good I will explain 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.060
 how the repeater or retarder works 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.220
 we have to notice that the pin 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.170
 that which has a red line is the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.640
 current input and the other 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.730
 pin is the exit if it is not going to 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.620
 work those legs can be separated 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.960
 the more separated the more they are 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.500
 the repeater will slow down the signal 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.600
 serves to slow down the signal is worth 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.429
 maybe you think you do not have any 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.100
 type of use and that it is useless at 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.629
 less is not seen here and it just serves 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.559
 to delay the signal comes a little more 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.300
 slow and good in principle does not have 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.550
 much use so thought but the truth that 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.559
 It has a lot of uses, let's see 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.520
 for example one of the uses that more 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.200
 you will have seen what we saw in the chapter 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.950
 to show us your house in the house of 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.680
 ariel 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.689
 the person is who made the titanic and 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.060
 we saw a circuit that I 'm going to try 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.939
 I explain that serves to activate 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.670
 automatically one circuit or several 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.990
 times so we'll see it as you 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.179
 I say the red line has to be 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.770
 always on the side that holds the 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.929
 address so let's put all in 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.729
 the same direction as you see you see the 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.399
 red lines I will go separating all 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.920
 the legs for the circuit to go 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.069
 slowing down since the trick of 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.740
 this is that the current stays 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:45.439
 turns to the circuit and can activate a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.720
 same object a lot of times ok let's go 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.959
 to join the corners of these of these 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.369
 repeaters or retarders and you will see 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.780
 the result 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.119
 you have to look carefully where it enters 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.549
 the signal and where it comes out okay there we go 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.489
 to make the entry of the signal is worth 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.459
 that corner since as you see has the 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.110
 patita with the red line on that side so 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.149
 that's the pensa will be worth the entrance 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.350
 I'm going to put a lever now for 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.680
 that you can see it better 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.850
 and that corner is also going to be used to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.410
 that also goes around the circuit 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.780
 Now you're going to see the truth that it's a 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.310
 little complicated but good I have 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.470
 tried to do it the most basic thing 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.790
 possible and if you have doubts you already know 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.670
 can you leave any comment 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.940
 I answer everything I can and well there 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.430
 we are going to make the exit to the circuit and 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.020
 you will see how the theme of 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.970
 this circuit what we need is a 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.820
 mechanism that gives us a spark 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.740
 one turned on and off or 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.910
 be there we have the spark we do 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.710
 with a lever or simply 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.290
 we activate and deactivate and the circuit 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.580
 it is already hanging around there you see it goes 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.470
 turning around going round 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.940
 always the current arrives by the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.550
 those legs that have the red line 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.220
 It goes and goes around and there in 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.810
 our output we have the mechanism that 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.010
 it turns on and off I'm going to put 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.630
 a reddish stone antenna so that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.940
 you see that it goes off and on 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.610
 all the time it's worth 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.900
 As you can see there, you are seeing it 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.370
 turn off and on all the time because 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.460
 the current is going around the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.220
 repeaters or retarders so good 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.200
 the truth that is one of the uses that a 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.210
 I like it more and wanted to put it to a 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.740
 door and I was trying to put it for 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.440
 this metal door that I had to check 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.610
 of the other tutorials but it's not going to 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.710
 work so in the end I think that 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.200
 I put a table or be a door 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.240
 wood so good now you're going to go 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.070
 watching I hope it's pretty clear 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.690
 I think it's the best use for these 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.150
 retardators although I will equally 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.160
 hang tutorials on how to do little things 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.140
 very interesting with these repeaters 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.150
 retardadores so that you see it very well 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.410
 and I'm trying to make the current 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.170
 get to the door but hey finally 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.390
 the most comfortable thing is to do it first 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.580
 the circuit and then put the door as 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.960
 you're going to see so what I'm going to do is 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.670
 make a separate wooden door 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.160
 to make it look much easier and not 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.740
 be complicating the good as you see the 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.540
 circuit follows is still working for 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.060
 that the circuit would turn off we would have to 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.360
 break a reddish stone of those 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.580
 corners that there is to work 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.930
 and there you see how it will open and close 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.130
 the door all the time of this is a 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.590
 example can be put at any 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.709
 mechanism for example those antennae of 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.660
 reddish stone so we can light 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.250
 and turn off lights in plan a nightclub or 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.500
 lights that go out and turn on 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.110
 just to get attention and 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.760
 Well the truth is that from that exit 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.320
 reddish stone we can extend it to what 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.240
 that we want or we can do it for 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.490
 several mechanisms simply do that 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.200
 circuit serves us for that I hope that 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.270
 be very clear as I say I repeat 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.480
 leave any comment if you do not see it 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.970
 very clear and good just tell you what 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.430
 always like if you liked it and su for 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.169
 more videos so good I'll try to go 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.030
 hanging more tutorials of little things that 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.700
 can be done with these mechanisms and 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.919
 you know and good to share it with you 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.140
 friends that may interest you so 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.290
 we'll see you in upcoming videos until 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.290
 then
