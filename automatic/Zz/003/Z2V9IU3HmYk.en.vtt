nature<00:00:40.000> photos<00:00:40.540> we<00:00:40.750> really<00:00:41.020> going<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.200> try<00:00:41.290> and

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
nature photos we really going to try and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.680 
nature photos we really going to try and
do<00:00:41.650> them<00:00:41.770> in<00:00:41.860> on<00:00:41.980> some<00:00:42.190> objects<00:00:42.700> now<00:00:43.330> normally

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
do them in on some objects now normally

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.290 
do them in on some objects now normally
we<00:00:44.140> would<00:00:44.260> probably<00:00:44.710> use<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:44.890> 50<00:00:45.400> because<00:00:46.150> if

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
we would probably use a 50 because if

we would probably use a 50 because if
you<00:00:46.360> want<00:00:46.540> to<00:00:46.600> get<00:00:46.660> some<00:00:46.840> wide<00:00:47.020> angle<00:00:47.380> nature

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
you want to get some wide angle nature

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.590 
you want to get some wide angle nature
that's<00:00:48.100> always<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> way<00:00:48.580> to<00:00:48.700> go<00:00:48.850> but<00:00:49.180> today

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
that's always the way to go but today

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
now I'm gonna see if I can zoom in on

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
now I'm gonna see if I can zoom in on
some<00:01:28.830> closer<00:01:29.189> objects<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:29.909> some<00:01:30.060> nice

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
wide angle nature shots here so let's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:09.970 
wide angle nature shots here so let's
see<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.330> can<00:01:54.450> do

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:09.980 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.830 

now<00:02:10.980> these<00:02:11.130> 50s<00:02:11.700> aren't<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.240> great<00:02:12.570> for

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
now these 50s aren't just great for

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.800 
now these 50s aren't just great for
nature<00:02:13.320> photos<00:02:13.740> they<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.580> focus<00:02:15.270> up<00:02:15.690> two

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
nature photos they can focus up two

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.200 
nature photos they can focus up two
point<00:02:16.110> four<00:02:16.440> or<00:02:16.620> five<00:02:16.860> meters<00:02:17.340> which<00:02:18.000> is

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
point four or five meters which is

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.750 
point four or five meters which is
really<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:19.050> great<00:02:19.350> for<00:02:19.650> some<00:02:20.160> great<00:02:20.550> depth

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
really really great for some great depth

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.980 
really really great for some great depth
of<00:02:20.910> field<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:21.750> closing<00:02:22.020> objects<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.990> you're

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
of field with closing objects and you're

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.510 
of field with closing objects and you're
also<00:02:25.110> going<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:25.590> some<00:02:25.860> nice<00:02:25.980> natural

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
also going to get some nice natural

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.820 
also going to get some nice natural
photos<00:02:26.820> if<00:02:26.970> anyone<00:02:27.270> uses<00:02:27.750> their<00:02:28.290> fifties<00:02:28.650> for

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
photos if anyone uses their fifties for

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.350 
photos if anyone uses their fifties for
macro<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.370> they're<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.610> really<00:02:30.060> great

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
macro so they're just really great

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:38.360 
macro so they're just really great
versatile<00:02:30.840> lenses

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.370 

you

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.380 

so<00:02:44.830> I'm<00:02:44.980> both<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.400> those<00:02:45.490> photos<00:02:45.790> we<00:02:46.090> got<00:02:46.240> some

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
so I'm both of those photos we got some

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.270 
so I'm both of those photos we got some
really<00:02:46.570> great<00:02:46.960> depth<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.320> field<00:02:47.530> let's<00:02:48.070> see<00:02:48.220> if

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
really great depth of field let's see if

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.380 
really great depth of field let's see if
we<00:02:48.370> can<00:02:48.460> get<00:02:48.520> some<00:02:48.580> more<00:02:50.640> now<00:02:51.640> with<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:51.850> Canon

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
we can get some more now with this Canon

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.390 
we can get some more now with this Canon
60d<00:02:52.750> there<00:02:53.170> are<00:02:53.230> some<00:02:53.380> awesome<00:02:53.620> feature<00:02:54.160> it's

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
60d there are some awesome feature it's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.400 
60d there are some awesome feature it's
one<00:02:54.940> of<00:02:55.030> my<00:02:55.150> favorite<00:02:55.570> has<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:56.020> this
