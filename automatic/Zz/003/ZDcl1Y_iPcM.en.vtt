we're<00:00:17.590> gonna<00:00:17.680> be<00:00:17.800> covering<00:00:18.009> one<00:00:18.160> of<00:00:18.189> the

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
we're gonna be covering one of the

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.570 
we're gonna be covering one of the
automatic<00:00:19.509> modes<00:00:19.720> and<00:00:20.140> that's<00:00:20.770> landscape

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
automatic modes and that's landscape

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.120 
automatic modes and that's landscape
mode<00:00:22.349> this<00:00:23.349> is<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:23.560> mode<00:00:23.710> that<00:00:23.740> you<00:00:23.980> would

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
mode this is the mode that you would

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.769 
mode this is the mode that you would
choose<00:00:24.340> if<00:00:24.700> you<00:00:24.759> want<00:00:24.939> to<00:00:25.059> take<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> landscape

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
choose if you want to take a landscape

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.280 
choose if you want to take a landscape
picture<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.349> say<00:00:27.059> you<00:00:28.059> know<00:00:28.090> hillsides<00:00:28.930> and<00:00:29.230> a

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
picture of say you know hillsides and a

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.290 
picture of say you know hillsides and a
castle<00:00:29.529> on<00:00:29.829> there<00:00:30.149> where<00:00:31.149> you'd<00:00:31.270> want

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
castle on there where you'd want

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.290 
castle on there where you'd want
everything<00:00:32.020> rendered<00:00:32.380> in<00:00:32.730> sharp<00:00:33.730> focus

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
everything rendered in sharp focus

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.319 
everything rendered in sharp focus
so<00:00:34.930> what<00:00:35.079> you'll<00:00:35.230> find<00:00:35.440> is<00:00:36.059> compared<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.090> some

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
so what you'll find is compared to some

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.549 
so what you'll find is compared to some
of<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.480> other<00:00:37.600> modes<00:00:37.719> so<00:00:37.960> for<00:00:38.079> example<00:00:38.410> line

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
of the other modes so for example line

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.750 
of the other modes so for example line
portrait<00:00:39.010> mode<00:00:39.190> it's<00:00:39.370> going<00:00:39.399> to<00:00:39.579> pick<00:00:39.730> a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
portrait mode it's going to pick a

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.040 
portrait mode it's going to pick a
larger<00:00:40.360> F<00:00:40.540> number<00:00:40.870> or<00:00:41.170> f-stop<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.990> know

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
larger F number or f-stop so you know

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.760 
larger F number or f-stop so you know
f/8<00:00:44.590> or<00:00:44.980> f-16<00:00:45.670> something<00:00:46.210> like<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.770> we're

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
f/8 or f-16 something like that we're

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.990 
f/8 or f-16 something like that we're
just<00:00:47.800> going<00:00:48.070> to<00:00:48.130> actually<00:00:48.400> render<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.760> scene

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
just going to actually render the scene

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.670 
just going to actually render the scene
shout<00:00:49.750> back<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.260> front

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
shout back to front

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.890 
shout back to front
unlike<00:00:51.579> portrait<00:00:52.150> mode<00:00:52.300> was<00:00:52.510> probably<00:00:52.780> gonna

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
unlike portrait mode was probably gonna

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.060 
unlike portrait mode was probably gonna
be<00:00:53.020> choosing<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.670> smaller<00:00:54.670> F<00:00:55.120> number<00:00:55.480> or<00:00:55.660> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
be choosing a smaller F number or a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.729 
be choosing a smaller F number or a
larger<00:00:57.070> aperture<00:00:57.540> so<00:00:58.540> your<00:00:59.110> subject<00:00:59.560> is<00:00:59.649> in

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
larger aperture so your subject is in

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.470 
larger aperture so your subject is in
focus<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.250> background<00:01:00.310> more<00:01:00.970> out<00:01:01.210> of

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
focus and the background more out of

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.450 
focus and the background more out of
focus<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:02.530> we'll<00:01:02.649> just<00:01:02.800> go<00:01:02.920> over<00:01:02.950> this<00:01:03.220> mode

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
focus so we'll just go over this mode

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.020 
focus so we'll just go over this mode
now<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.299> show<00:01:04.720> what<00:01:04.899> you<00:01:05.079> can<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.790> in<00:01:06.939> the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
now and show what you can see in the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.639 
now and show what you can see in the
menu<00:01:07.149> systems<00:01:07.659> on<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:07.810> are<00:01:07.990> more<00:01:08.110> control<00:01:08.530> that

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
menu systems on it are more control that

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.230

the previous videos and very very little

the previous videos and very very little
in<00:02:50.939> terms<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.209> we<00:02:51.329> can<00:02:51.450> change<00:02:51.659> it<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.260> say

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
in terms of we can change it is I say

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.110 
in terms of we can change it is I say
one<00:02:52.889> of<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.069> automatic<00:02:53.549> modes<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.879> you<00:02:53.970> can

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
one of the automatic modes that you can

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.629 
one of the automatic modes that you can
use<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:55.470> landscape<00:02:55.950> photography<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.549> if

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
use and for landscape photography so if

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.539 
use and for landscape photography so if
you're<00:02:56.819> unsure<00:02:57.260> then<00:02:58.260> by<00:02:58.530> all<00:02:58.560> means<00:02:59.659> use<00:03:00.659> this

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
you're unsure then by all means use this

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.030 
you're unsure then by all means use this
I'm<00:03:02.549> sure<00:03:02.790> you'll<00:03:02.940> get<00:03:03.030> some<00:03:03.239> great<00:03:03.359> shots<00:03:04.040> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
I'm sure you'll get some great shots and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.759 
I'm sure you'll get some great shots and
what<00:03:05.819> you'll<00:03:05.939> probably<00:03:06.120> find<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.620> said

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
what you'll probably find is like I said

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.699 
what you'll probably find is like I said
in<00:03:07.829> the<00:03:07.920> introduction<00:03:08.189> is<00:03:08.609> when<00:03:08.939> you<00:03:09.650> go<00:03:10.650> to

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
in the introduction is when you go to

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.289 
in the introduction is when you go to
set<00:03:11.010> up<00:03:11.099> a<00:03:11.189> shot<00:03:11.370> off<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.639> take<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.849> shot<00:03:12.120> you'll

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
set up a shot off to take a shot you'll

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.360 
set up a shot off to take a shot you'll
probably<00:03:12.420> find<00:03:12.689> it's<00:03:12.900> going<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.109> use<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.530> larger

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
probably find it's going to use a larger

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.059 
probably find it's going to use a larger
F<00:03:14.549> number<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.060> mean<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.359> saw<00:03:15.540> there<00:03:15.870> last<00:03:16.799> this

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
F number I mean you saw there last this

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.649 
F number I mean you saw there last this
isn't<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.549> landscape<00:03:18.060> scene<00:03:18.269> it's<00:03:18.450> got<00:03:18.569> in

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
isn't a landscape scene it's got in

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.640 
isn't a landscape scene it's got in
front<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.019> camera<00:03:19.349> if<00:03:20.159> chosen<00:03:20.400> F<00:03:20.930> 7.1<00:03:21.930> so

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
front of the camera if chosen F 7.1 so

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.099 
front of the camera if chosen F 7.1 so
you<00:03:22.739> may<00:03:22.889> find<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:24.000> know<00:03:24.120> from<00:03:24.720> top<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.019> the

you may find you know from top of the

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.199 
you may find you know from top of the
hillside<00:03:25.290> it'll<00:03:25.709> say<00:03:25.889> F<00:03:26.129> 16<00:03:26.669> or<00:03:26.849> something

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
hillside it'll say F 16 or something

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.069 
hillside it'll say F 16 or something
like<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.239> will<00:03:30.480> render<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.900> scene

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
like that and that will render the scene

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.589 
like that and that will render the scene
hopefully<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:32.040> nice<00:03:32.579> sharp<00:03:32.910> focus<00:03:33.389> a

father<00:03:44.400> below<00:03:44.699> and<00:03:45.359> will<00:03:45.720> lead<00:03:46.199> the<00:03:46.379> shallower

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
father below and will lead the shallower

father below and will lead the shallower
depth<00:03:47.129> of<00:03:47.220> field<00:03:47.280> or<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:48.180> least<00:03:48.449> depth<00:03:49.349> of

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
field which is using portraits and so

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.640 
field which is using portraits and so
forth<00:03:51.389> so<00:03:51.569> you'd<00:03:51.720> need<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.930> greater<00:03:52.260> depth<00:03:52.530> of

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
forth so you'd need a greater depth of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.069 
forth so you'd need a greater depth of
field<00:03:52.859> generally<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.340> landscape<00:03:53.790> photography

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
field generally in landscape photography

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.759 
field generally in landscape photography
to<00:03:55.079> show<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.349> whole<00:03:55.590> scene<00:03:55.889> in<00:03:56.129> sharp<00:03:57.060> focus

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
to show the whole scene in sharp focus

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.069 
to show the whole scene in sharp focus
so<00:03:58.769> that's<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.250> quick<00:03:59.400> introduction<00:03:59.729> to
