for a thousand milliamp hours now I

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.849 
for a thousand milliamp hours now I
would<00:00:51.579> set<00:00:51.760> these<00:00:51.909> batteries<00:00:52.539> because<00:00:53.170> void

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
would set these batteries because void

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.029

understand<00:01:08.049> that<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:09.159> amperage<00:01:09.549> is<00:01:09.640> too<00:01:09.820> low

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
understand that the amperage is too low

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.690

cartomizer and I haven't faked it as
much<00:03:09.019> as<00:03:09.200> I'm<00:03:09.319> vaping<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:11.150> now<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:11.389> is

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
much as I'm vaping this but now this is

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.259 
much as I'm vaping this but now this is
going<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.019> three<00:03:12.379> days<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.010> battery<00:03:13.969> still

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
going on three days and battery still

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.260 
going on three days and battery still
pretty<00:03:14.810> good

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.780 

number<00:03:21.870> caught<00:03:22.050> her<00:03:22.170> -<00:03:22.350> yeah<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.280> broke<00:03:23.580> out<00:03:23.760> a

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
number caught her - yeah I broke out a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.949 
number caught her - yeah I broke out a
pack<00:03:24.030> card<00:03:24.330> might<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> bunch<00:03:24.990> of

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
pack card might have a bunch of

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.140 
pack card might have a bunch of
let's<00:03:27.530> see<00:03:27.680> if<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:27.860> could<00:03:28.099> see<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.909> battery

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
let's see if I could see the battery

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.520 
let's see if I could see the battery
voltage<00:03:29.360> that's<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:31.390> three<00:03:32.390> point<00:03:32.689> nine<00:03:32.840> stuff

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
voltage that's a three point nine stuff

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.820 
voltage that's a three point nine stuff
you<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:34.579> see<00:03:34.760> that

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:54.430 

not<00:03:40.400> just<00:03:40.880> passed<00:03:41.300> it<00:03:41.510> up

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.370 

3.9<00:03:55.440> left<00:03:55.770> in<00:03:55.920> there<00:03:56.480> from<00:03:57.480> four<00:03:57.780> point<00:03:58.110> two

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
3.9 left in there from four point two

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.940 
3.9 left in there from four point two
three<00:03:59.040> days<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.600> think<00:04:00.660> these<00:04:00.950> cutoff

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
three days so I think these cutoff

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.720 
three days so I think these cutoff
around<00:04:02.840> 3.30<00:04:04.010> got<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> lot<00:04:05.190> more<00:04:05.220> time<00:04:05.550> with

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
around 3.30 got a lot more time with

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:13.540 
around 3.30 got a lot more time with
this<00:04:05.820> battery

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.320 

awesome<00:04:14.550> batteries<00:04:15.030> for<00:04:15.210> regulated<00:04:15.690> months

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
awesome batteries for regulated months

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.479 
awesome batteries for regulated months
best<00:04:18.330> I've<00:04:18.540> used<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:18.989> far<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.590> Panasonic

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
you guys or the integrated over charge

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.650 
you guys or the integrated over charge
discharge<00:04:37.220> sort<00:04:38.220> circuit<00:04:38.640> protection<00:04:39.000> and

discharge sort circuit protection and

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.270 
discharge sort circuit protection and
you<00:04:40.050> can<00:04:40.170> see<00:04:40.380> right<00:04:40.530> down<00:04:40.590> are<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.100> auto

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
you can see right down are the auto

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.760 
you can see right down are the auto
focus<00:04:41.580> on<00:04:42.000> but<00:04:42.330> it's<00:04:42.960> probably<00:04:43.230> hard<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.590> make

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
focus on but it's probably hard to make

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.710 
focus on but it's probably hard to make
out

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.470 

that's<00:04:50.320> what<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:50.560> says<00:04:50.740> right<00:04:50.980> there<00:04:51.010> of<00:04:51.850> the

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
that's what it says right there of the

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.660 
that's what it says right there of the
great<00:04:52.780> batteries<00:04:53.290> I<00:04:53.560> guess<00:04:54.460> at<00:04:54.580> the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
great batteries I guess at the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.760
