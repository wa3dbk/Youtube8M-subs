most of the time it's in the forward
right<00:02:48.830> quadrants<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.360> case<00:02:50.570> that's

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
right quadrants that in this case that's

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.750 
right quadrants that in this case that's
north<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.230> west<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.950> circulation<00:02:52.459> center

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
north and west of the circulation center

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.820 
north and west of the circulation center
and<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.360> puts<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.780> up<00:02:53.900> around<00:02:54.049> 2:00<00:02:54.530> there

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
and so that puts it up around 2:00 there

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.940 
and so that puts it up around 2:00 there
around<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.190> Port<00:02:55.430> Lavaca<00:02:55.519> area<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:57.290> then

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
around the Port Lavaca area and then

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.830 
around the Port Lavaca area and then
down<00:02:58.280> through<00:02:58.640> Corpus<00:02:59.000> Christi<00:02:59.360> over<00:02:59.630> just

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
down through Corpus Christi over just

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.990 
down through Corpus Christi over just
south<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.230> San<00:03:00.410> Antonio<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:01.280> Laredo<00:03:01.549> on<00:03:01.850> all

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
the way down south across Texas today

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.910 
the way down south across Texas today
into<00:03:04.580> Brownsville<00:03:05.120> for<00:03:05.870> isolated<00:03:06.500> tornadoes

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
into Brownsville for isolated tornadoes

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.949 
into Brownsville for isolated tornadoes
a<00:03:07.070> few<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.640> those<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.030> then<00:03:08.090> tomorrow<00:03:08.600> as<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
a few of those and then tomorrow as the

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.509 
a few of those and then tomorrow as the
circulation<00:03:09.320> pushes<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.830> bit<00:03:09.980> farther<00:03:10.190> west

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
circulation pushes a bit farther west

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.370 
circulation pushes a bit farther west
could<00:03:11.030> include<00:03:11.390> San<00:03:11.660> Antonio<00:03:12.080> and<00:03:12.170> all<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
could include San Antonio and all the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.990 
could include San Antonio and all the
way<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.530> Del<00:03:12.799> Rio<00:03:13.010> with<00:03:13.459> some<00:03:13.610> isolated

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
way to Del Rio with some isolated

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.759 
way to Del Rio with some isolated
tornadoes<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.630> still<00:03:14.810> perhaps<00:03:14.989> almost<00:03:15.530> as

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
tornadoes and still perhaps almost as

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.890 
tornadoes and still perhaps almost as
far<00:03:15.980> south<00:03:16.070> as<00:03:16.280> Brownsville<00:03:17.269> now<00:03:17.450> for<00:03:17.720> heavy

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
far south as Brownsville now for heavy

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.630 
far south as Brownsville now for heavy
rain<00:03:18.140> and<00:03:18.290> flooding<00:03:18.500> certainly<00:03:19.310> going<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.519> get

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
rain and flooding certainly going to get

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.880 
rain and flooding certainly going to get
a<00:03:19.700> lot<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.090> very<00:03:20.330> slow<00:03:20.630> movement<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.380> so

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
a lot of that very slow movement and so

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.740 
a lot of that very slow movement and so
we're<00:03:22.310> getting<00:03:22.549> rates<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.180> up<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.390> two<00:03:23.570> inch

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
we're getting rates of up to two inch

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.720 
we're getting rates of up to two inch
per<00:03:23.959> hour<00:03:24.049> at<00:03:24.739> times<00:03:24.769> during<00:03:25.400> these<00:03:25.489> rain

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
per hour at times during these rain

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.600 
per hour at times during these rain
bands<00:03:26.000> offshore<00:03:26.870> up<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.470> about<00:03:27.769> five<00:03:28.190> inches

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
bands offshore up to about five inches

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.220 
bands offshore up to about five inches
per<00:03:28.820> hour<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.510> holds<00:03:29.810> together<00:03:29.959> and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
per hour so if that holds together and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.820 
per hour so if that holds together and
