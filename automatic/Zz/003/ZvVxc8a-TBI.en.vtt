right<00:01:54.869> down<00:01:55.140> below<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.270> going

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
right down below it and we're not going

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
right down below it and we're not going
to<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.780> quite<00:01:57.990> enough<00:01:58.290> room<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.189> that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.050 
one so let's transfer this and show you
the<00:02:02.909> transfer<00:02:03.530> put<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:05.399> bring<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the transfer put that there bring up a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.710 
the transfer put that there bring up a
sheet<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.659> formed<00:02:07.290> and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
sheet that we have formed and

on and there it is absolutely beautiful
we<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.930> lay<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.500> one<00:02:19.680> side<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.569> rapidly

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
we can lay that to one side and rapidly

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.150 
we can lay that to one side and rapidly
here<00:02:21.870> show<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.290> how<00:02:22.860> we<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.910> also<00:02:24.240> make<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
here show you how we can also make a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.520 
here show you how we can also make a
tree<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.520> our<00:02:26.970> tree<00:02:27.330> we<00:02:27.360> drew<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.290> cut

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
tree that is our tree we drew it we cut

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.310 
tree that is our tree we drew it we cut
it<00:02:28.680> out<00:02:28.860> that's<00:02:29.190> about<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.670> much<00:02:30.600> ownership<00:02:30.870> as

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
it out that's about as much ownership as

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.260 
it out that's about as much ownership as
you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:31.709> on<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.520> use<00:02:32.880> your

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
you can get on it and you can use your

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.630 
you can get on it and you can use your
turkey<00:02:33.900> baster<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.680> fact<00:02:34.950> don't<00:02:35.250> squirt

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
turkey baster in this fact don't squirt

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.310 
turkey baster in this fact don't squirt
straight<00:02:36.000> down<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:36.480> sort<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.810> score<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.110> at<00:02:37.200> an

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
straight down but sort of score it at an

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.780 
straight down but sort of score it at an
angle<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:38.480> your<00:02:40.070> sheet<00:02:41.070> literally<00:02:41.550> because

that's what you're making a sheet in the
form<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.650> tree<00:02:43.920> well<00:02:44.640> form<00:02:44.970> quite

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
form of a tree well form quite

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.350 
form of a tree well form quite
beautifully<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:47.190> again<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.820> here<00:02:48.030> at<00:02:48.209> home

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
indeed you can put the tip of the tree

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.060 
indeed you can put the tip of the tree
there<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.690> Sun<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.230> moon<00:03:16.410> whatever<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.980> is

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
that very nice here's the sheet we just

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.339 
that very nice here's the sheet we just
made<00:03:27.600> pressed<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.650> dried

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
and here we've taken a tin can shape and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.870 
and here we've taken a tin can shape and
combined<00:03:36.050> it<00:03:36.260> with<00:03:36.290> pole<00:03:36.770> painting<00:03:37.370> for<00:03:37.700> this

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880

dryer paper shapes instead of

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.809 
dryer paper shapes instead of
transferring<00:03:45.050> them<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.800> sheet<00:03:46.099> you<00:03:46.340> can
