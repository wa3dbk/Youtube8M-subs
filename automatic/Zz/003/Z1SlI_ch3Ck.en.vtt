00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:07.279
 the butterfly that was believed lost puts retired rest at the end of 18 years of 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.279
 search 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.569
 In the last nine years, José Montero has dedicated himself to 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.569
 research of the butterflies of the bioethics institute 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:21.119
 investigations that led 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.109
 until san ramón 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.439
 where they found the favorite place 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.439
 of these insects 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.920
 they found a species that was not observed for 18 years 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.470
 in st the research we carry sampling 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.880
 we have started to have butterflies that for example sare tiscali days is a 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.770
 butterfly diurnal the chosen sale of fruits a butterfly your figure that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.280
 they feed in two the one of the forest in they welcome the glasses of the trees only 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.620
 we had a collection of the Indian 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.600
 we connected cradle last week so we are carrying a butterfly that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.020
 It was not connected many years ago that we did not know because in this case, the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.360
 we had 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.590
 inside the hotel villa blanca 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 where the Indian specialists founded a biological station 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.360
 the moths will be their main research goal before 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360
 it is a paradise for their survival 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.640
 good this particular site 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.280
 it's a cloud forest 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.790
 that is always munier oblaré worldwide and it is not always raining always 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.300
 it's really cold 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.680
 in this case a habitat like this one a place like this a cloud forest are 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.340
 very fragile sites your site very wet then all insects 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.270
 they really are sites multiplied their site very interesting because there are many 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.630
 plants impact is green coughs and a lot of food that start that we hope this 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.060
 a lot of interesting information to see what is going to be generated since 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.799
 take into account for example that we are in a cloud forest that is 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.010
 justly 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.370
 where the cordillera ends and the mountain range begins 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.120
 central we are in the continental history 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.120
 will be between the Pacific in the Caribbean slope 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.719
 Indian specialists another collection of diversity management 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.779
 then in the station the investigation of each one will be reviewed 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.409
 process that tourists can also observe step by step 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:28.840
 oe again 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.789
 the actress look at costa rica or the ticos in a tone 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.539
 to learn more 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.149
 things that are important to them 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.599
 then with indian we work for criticism and recognition 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.819
 of the cloud forest in this case 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.199
 because with that possible information we are concerned to conserve 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.779
 the choir of costa rica 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.220
 san ramón 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.099
 it's a paradise of butterflies 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.379
 and little by little 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.650
 they want to go discovering
