of<00:02:18.239> weapon<00:02:19.239> being<00:02:19.390> Opie<00:02:19.780> but<00:02:20.319> it's<00:02:20.470> not<00:02:20.530> my

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
of weapon being Opie but it's not my

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.100 
of weapon being Opie but it's not my
biggest<00:02:21.879> issue<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.360> lag<00:02:22.569> compensation

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
biggest issue is the lag compensation

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.869 
biggest issue is the lag compensation
this<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.709> one<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:23.890> those<00:02:24.040> games<00:02:24.250> from<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.610> half

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879
