00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.749
 How long have you been with Rodrigo Borgia? 

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:33.318
 Only if necessary, my holy one. 

00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:36.386
 The death of the Duke of Milan changes many things. 

00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:40.172
 Really? 

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.754
 Human covenants are fragile. 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.001
 Nowadays, cities often change their rulers. 

00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:49.224
 As long as God stands on our side. 

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:50.599
 Amen. 

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:58.350
 I have heard that Lorenzo Medici does not show much respect for us. 

00:01:58.794 --> 00:01:59.504
 That's true. 

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:02.668
 But you can obey them. 

00:02:03.104 --> 00:02:05.765
 Florence is weak. We should use it. 

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:06.755
 With the help of ... 

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:09.638
 The death of others does not belong to my affairs. 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.639
 My job is to protect the Republic of Florence. 

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:19.850
 That's why I'm ready to provide church support. 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.394
 And ... military help. 

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:27.740
 To keep order. 

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.807
 Be worthy of the Church's trust, Rodrigo! 

00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:37.890
 You can count on me, my holy one! 

00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:07.906
 I'm looking for the man who has just come. 

00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:10.916
 You had to see. Where did you go? 

00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:14.698
 There has been total silence so far. 

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.850
 I haven't seen a man outside of you. 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.220
 He covers his face with a hood. 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.253
 She is wearing a black dress. 

00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:23.792
 I can not help. 

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:25.919
 Maybe God can. 

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:30.602
 Pray and find the answer. 

00:04:54.424 --> 00:04:57.627
 Your blade won't be enough. Assassin! 

00:05:03.246 --> 00:05:05.148
 What happens next is up to you. 

00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:10.534
 You have special abilities, Giovanni. 

00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:12.916
 This is your name, isn't it? 

00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:17.826
 Abilities that I would be happy to have on my side. 

00:05:22.102 --> 00:05:23.571
 And what page is it? 

00:05:26.178 --> 00:05:29.864
 The page that will soon win a war that you don't even know about. 

00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:34.202
 The world is changing before your eyes, Giovanni. 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.828
 Join us! 

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:37.946
 Then you can see yourself. 

00:05:39.242 --> 00:05:40.698
 Borgia ... 

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.686
 Yes, I know your name. 

00:05:44.232 --> 00:05:46.434
 And I also know how it will end ... 

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:51.479
 Your imagination in ruins and the throat of an assassin in your throat. 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.684
 We'll see... 

00:06:00.054 --> 00:06:02.206
 Yours! Get it! 

00:06:27.518 --> 00:06:28.370
 Kill me!
