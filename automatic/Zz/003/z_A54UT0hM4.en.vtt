00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 Hello 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.160
 minecraft is commenting for you 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.450
 today's minix you do not speak well then let's go 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.630
 to a new chapter of the structures 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.369
 of structures in my world but this 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.670
 infrastructure I owe everything to 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.420
 tricky for that is almost more and almost more 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.420
 hers that endorses me 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:37.220
 of a 100% infrastructure 50 there 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.310
 we have the dojo vale space japanese with 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.940
 its palaces I say with its gardens of 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.190
 Paradise I have made it like a 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.780
 actual picture is worth I do not remember how 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.170
 called what convenient has a name 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.030
 very weird but good here is a 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.500
 superstructure that if it had not been 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.180
 for some infrastructure that is 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.440
 would have been for him would not have been 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.050
 able to make it worthwhile since they 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.360
 I taught him he shows him the photo and he 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.100
 proposed to do it and all that and in the end 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.970
 It has been quite good, too. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.730
 to fly thanks to kaleshin aura 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.300
 oh my little angel and his brother amaury 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.300
 already 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.680
 I believe that nobody else so many 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.570
 thanks for all of you for helping me 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.490
 to make this construction amendment and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.520
 but structure as you want to call vale 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.740
 and well here we have a super source in 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.270
 the garden are worth I could not do it 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.580
 totally the same as in the photo but it is 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.040
 something very similar was that it was in the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.600
 photo that was a great big 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.720
 building and how are you looking there at 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.720
 final 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 so huge and the gardens huge 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.310
 I had sideways with many 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.590
 gardens I have many trees and all that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.200
 if the paradise style if we had 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.369
 could put animals but as yet 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.750
 we do not have the update too 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.060
 let's see tucked chickens and sheep worth 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.360
 well there we see how pretty it is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.170
 the bridge and look well that this garden 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.019
 it is totally equal to the other garden vale 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.880
 is nailed the only thing that are not equal 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.470
 they are the trees because the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.130
 Trees can grow in any way 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.140
 It's worth it and as you can see there the road is empty 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 and here is the source totally equal 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.040
 many thanks to the trick for helping me 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 to do all this is worth it without your help 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.480
 it would have been possible and for emilio's 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.000
 lime and without aura and all these either 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.930
 as you have seen the walls are huge 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.400
 we threw almost almost a day just 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.380
 flattening and doing what is the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.049
 terrain is worth what are the walls 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.980
 calculating distances and all that since 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.739
 they are 100 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.409
 50 the infrastructure how am I 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.900
 saying good and we are getting closer 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.989
 towards the magnificent place is worth towards the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.080
 Dojo on the outside I love how he has 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.290
 it's worth it and let's see its gardens 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.010
 of the paradise they have out here is 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.690
 a mega mega infrastructure that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.069
 I've always wanted to do since 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.420
 I started playing minecraft worth it's something 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.790
 what impresses me is going to do one thing 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.540
 how is this and thanks to trulli all 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.760
 that I have already said I have managed to do it and 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.129
 Well, here, as you can see, we have a 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.150
 tiny waterfall for this goes for 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:29.430
 nothing like a pool they have here 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.290
 It would have been nice as well 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.780
 had the water lilies as in the pc 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.269
 to put them out there for the water that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.459
 it looks pretty nice like that and that too 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.930
 you could put small pebbles 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.840
 but it would be very much to ask the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.280
 minecraft and well then here the other 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.590
 garden we also see it with the trees 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.120
 these are bigger have grown more and 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.010
 they have more man years 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.360
 and with a good view towards the augury 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.340
 crimson 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.060
 in this pool we see that it is also 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.040
 same as the previous one and I say again 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.260
 thank you so much, thank you very much 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.800
 emilio thank you very much 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.170
 mauri many thanks rafa very many 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.650
 thanks to 6 in that also I also 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.239
 they have helped 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.549
 because if it had not been for them 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.560
 especially truffaut could not have 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.720
 do this structure with either I'm 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.590
 repeating too much but it's something 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.630
 like a dream I had since I started 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.639
 in minecraft and how do you see the stairs 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.740
 that we have placed have cost us almost 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.020
 more than doing the whole structure place 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.610
 just stairs because you have seen in 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.620
 the walls are also very many 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.600
 good stairs we see on the floor of 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.449
 down the dohyo that is too big 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.250
 it's huge you 're going to see it as 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.440
 we are going up the plants every time they are 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.919
 smaller as you can see this is already a 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.110
 little smaller and we have seen a 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.870
 balcony to see a little what it is for 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.389
 out here for now there are no big 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.940
 Vale views are pretty good but 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.940
 when we keep going up you will see the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.400
 views of the umm before creepy that 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.380
 there are how pretty they are worth to me 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.889
 I've loved the views that have 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.969
 this as we see this area is very small 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.309
 OK 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.420
 and how well you see everything all the 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:13.970
 gardens from here 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.040
 and well from here we also see a 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.740
 Pretty pretty ocean view 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.740
 Pretty pretty at the edge of the map 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.009
 we will also keep going up for the 

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:28.779
 other floors you will see this room is super 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.089
 small compared to the first as 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:32.559
 you are watching super small we do not have 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.119
 site to place the stairs as 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:36.249
 you are seeing here that then in the 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:39.909
 door but good here we start to have 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:42.189
 the great views that are waste 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:45.669
 nominal value let's keep going up 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.879
 if you realize this infrastructure 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.339
 It has taken us much space it 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:53.110
 as I told you if in 100% 50 we 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.759
 we throw away one day flattening just for this 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.360
 good one day one hour planning only 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:06:00.849
 for this and well here you see that you are 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.860
 two rooms are already super small and what 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.059
 big one that was the one below it's all worth 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.559
 I do not know if I will put decoration 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:07.990
 rooms for people who are a miss 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:10.360
 I do not know, but here you see that you are 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.969
 small but attention to this you will see that 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.869
 small this room this room is already super 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.099
 small but has views 

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:20.139
 very good crimson augury for 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:23.169
 example to the perfect one and you to the 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.909
 gardens that are I love a monkey 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.830
 removed from the gardens the effect that 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:29.409
 gives the tall grass is worth and now we're going 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.409
 towards the smallest room 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:35.499
 the dojo viewpoint where we have all 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:37.089
 the super nice views of all my 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:39.399
 world let's break here a little bit the 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:41.409
 berries take what it gives to be so big 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:44.349
 the infrastructure I do not know about the pyramid 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.249
 that is there in the background is good we see 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:47.319
 here 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:50.069
 How beautiful are all the gardens 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:52.239
 I hope this infrastructure is 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:55.599
 I love it because I loved it 

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:58.209
 shortly I will be one the triple 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:01.569
 of great a very good infrastructure 

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:03.519
 by the hand of emilio de milito 97 vale 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:07.659
 has one of the seven wonders of the 

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:09.639
 world made perfect me from the is the 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:12.099
 first time I see that infrastructure 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.469
 of the best made in minecraft I've 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:16.869
 seen is better even than the one I've 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:18.660
 seen in some creative sites of 

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:21.540
 times 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.150
 well here we see how it is coming out 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.430
 the sun and good we are going to make it the night 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.250
 at night and let's see what is good 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.800
 also this structure at night we see 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:35.639
 the super well lit gardens are worth 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:39.669
 I also love night time 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:43.659
 midday to midnight at dawn I 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:46.750
 love this infrastructure I hope that 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:49.960
 you like it as much as you like 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.669
 me because it's something that I love though 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.750
 even if it was not made in my world 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.940
 that was made in the world of 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:59.310
 truffles I would also have liked it and 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.310
 well give it to the xxi
