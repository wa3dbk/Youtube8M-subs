00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
in a block of ice and it cools the air

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:37.099 
in a block of ice and it cools the air
and<00:03:13.950> sends<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.400> back<00:03:14.430> out<00:03:35.569> what<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.599> can<00:03:36.810> do<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.019> I
