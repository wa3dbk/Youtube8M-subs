00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
scheme of things this is not a very

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.120 
scheme of things this is not a very
secretive<00:01:26.549> device<00:01:27.560> however<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.860> always

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
secretive device however it is always

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.380 
secretive device however it is always
exciting<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> kind<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.850> get<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.090> hands<00:01:30.240> on

exciting to kind of get your hands on

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.050 
exciting to kind of get your hands on
something<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:31.020> others<00:01:31.650> cannot<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.820> let's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
something that others cannot so let's

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.640 
something that others cannot so let's
now<00:01:33.240> finally<00:01:33.659> take<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> look<00:01:34.079> at<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.439> case

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
now finally take a look at the case

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.609 
now finally take a look at the case
itself<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.150> seems<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> very<00:01:36.810> highly

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
itself so this seems like a very highly

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.950 
itself so this seems like a very highly
protective<00:01:38.430> case<00:01:38.759> covered<00:01:39.450> outside<00:01:39.810> with

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
protective case covered outside with

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.899 
protective case covered outside with
rubber<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> inside<00:01:41.070> hard<00:01:41.369> plastic

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
rubber and on the inside hard plastic

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.850 
rubber and on the inside hard plastic
this<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.540> course<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> multi-layer<00:01:43.530> case

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
this of course is a multi-layer case

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
this of course is a multi-layer case
because<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> does<00:01:44.640> feature<00:01:44.909> two<00:01:45.329> different

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
because it does feature two different

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.980 
because it does feature two different
materials<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.829> are<00:01:47.070> separable<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.810> hard

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
materials that are separable the hard

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.310 
materials that are separable the hard
plastic<00:01:49.439> material<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:50.100> pitch<00:01:50.399> black<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
plastic material is pitch black and the

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.350 
plastic material is pitch black and the
rubberized<00:01:52.320> material<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> dark<00:01:53.640> charcoal

rubberized material is a dark charcoal

rubberized material is a dark charcoal
gray<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.770> case<00:01:56.070> also<00:01:56.340> features<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> kickstand

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
gray this case also features a kickstand

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.230 
gray this case also features a kickstand
although<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.380> rather<00:01:58.680> cheap<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.939> feel

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
although it is rather cheap and I feel

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.940 
although it is rather cheap and I feel
like<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.630> wouldn't<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.320> reliable

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
like it wouldn't really be that reliable

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
like it wouldn't really be that reliable
also<00:02:02.729> over<00:02:03.090> time<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> feel<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:03.780> case

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
also over time I feel like this case

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780 
also over time I feel like this case
might<00:02:04.380> maybe<00:02:04.590> break<00:02:04.890> down<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.159> little<00:02:05.399> bit<00:02:05.579> in

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
might maybe break down a little bit in

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.340 
might maybe break down a little bit in
the<00:02:05.909> kickstand<00:02:06.299> section<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.930> because<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.229> is

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the kickstand section just because it is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.410 
the kickstand section just because it is
so<00:02:07.469> cheap<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:08.459> buttons<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.910> case<00:02:09.119> feel

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
so cheap the buttons on the case feel

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.199 
so cheap the buttons on the case feel
quite<00:02:09.690> tactile<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.410> firm

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
quite tactile and firm

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.789 
quite tactile and firm
and<00:02:11.299> it<00:02:11.450> also<00:02:11.689> noticed<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.109> power<00:02:12.319> button

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
and it also noticed the power button

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.800 
and it also noticed the power button
seems<00:02:13.069> to<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.370> bit<00:02:13.670> lower<00:02:14.120> than<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.629> is<00:02:14.659> on

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
seems to be a bit lower than it is on

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.470 
seems to be a bit lower than it is on
the<00:02:15.230> Samsung<00:02:15.650> Galaxy<00:02:15.799> s5<00:02:16.340> now<00:02:16.939> I<00:02:16.969> personally

do not have a s5 on me and convenient

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.819 
do not have a s5 on me and convenient
enough<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.450> include<00:02:20.689> in<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.900> video<00:02:20.989> however

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
enough to include in the video however

my<00:02:22.040> mom<00:02:22.219> has<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.640> phone<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:23.120> got<00:02:23.299> it<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.569> for

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
my mom has that phone I got it for for

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.800 
my mom has that phone I got it for for
Christmas<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:26.239> kind<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.510> noticed

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
Christmas and I just kind of noticed

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.119 
Christmas and I just kind of noticed
that<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.079> button<00:02:27.290> seems<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.650> be<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.739> little<00:02:27.980> bit

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
that the button seems to be a little bit

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.520 
that the button seems to be a little bit
lower<00:02:28.489> on<00:02:28.639> this<00:02:28.969> case<00:02:29.299> which<00:02:29.840> obviously<00:02:30.319> means

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
lower on this case which obviously means

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.039 
lower on this case which obviously means
that<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:30.799> lower<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.310> real<00:02:31.459> phone<00:02:32.049> so

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
that it's lower on the real phone so

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.449 
that it's lower on the real phone so
here's<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.319> closer<00:02:33.590> look<00:02:33.829> at<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.040> kickstand

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
here's a closer look at the kickstand

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.490 
here's a closer look at the kickstand
obviously<00:02:35.150> as<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.389> can<00:02:35.420> see<00:02:35.689> here<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.049> really

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
obviously as you can see here it really

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.119 
obviously as you can see here it really
is<00:02:36.709> just<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.310> firm<00:02:37.670> flimsy<00:02:38.540> piece<00:02:38.719> of<00:02:38.780> plastic

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
is just a firm flimsy piece of plastic

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.379 
is just a firm flimsy piece of plastic
however<00:02:40.129> if<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.370> wanted<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:40.670> watch<00:02:40.790> Netflix

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
however if you wanted to watch Netflix

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.629 
however if you wanted to watch Netflix
or<00:02:41.510> any<00:02:41.870> other<00:02:42.019> video<00:02:42.319> content<00:02:42.829> on<00:02:43.040> your

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
or any other video content on your

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.330 
or any other video content on your
device<00:02:44.000> for<00:02:44.419> a<00:02:44.450> extended<00:02:45.409> amount<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.650> time<00:02:45.739> it

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
device for a extended amount of time it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.280 
device for a extended amount of time it
would<00:02:46.609> be<00:02:46.730> quite<00:02:47.000> convenient<00:02:47.659> to<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:48.049> this

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
would be quite convenient to have this

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.869 
would be quite convenient to have this
kickstand<00:02:48.859> definitely<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.549> want<00:02:49.579> to<00:02:49.760> have

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:51.919 
it be a hands-free experience and you

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:52.869 
it be a hands-free experience and you
don't<00:02:52.069> want<00:02:52.189> to<00:02:52.250> lean<00:02:52.370> your<00:02:52.519> phone<00:02:52.730> on

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
something the kickstand really would

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.679 
something the kickstand really would
come<00:02:54.859> in<00:02:55.129> handy<00:02:55.370> now<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.299> can<00:02:56.419> see<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:56.629> the

sensor<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.419> uses<00:03:23.690> up<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:24.019> little<00:03:24.169> bit<00:03:24.319> more

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
sensor so it uses up a little bit more

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.670 
sensor so it uses up a little bit more
space<00:03:24.859> than<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.370> galaxy<00:03:25.760> s5<00:03:26.090> does<00:03:26.419> and<00:03:26.780> now<00:03:27.470> it

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
space than the galaxy s5 does and now it

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.770 
space than the galaxy s5 does and now it
is<00:03:27.799> time<00:03:28.010> for<00:03:28.069> a<00:03:28.519> size<00:03:28.819> comparison<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
is time for a size comparison on the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.199 
is time for a size comparison on the
left<00:03:30.019> here<00:03:30.229> we<00:03:30.260> have<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.799> iPhone<00:03:31.220> 6<00:03:31.729> on<00:03:31.970> the

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
left here we have the iPhone 6 on the

left here we have the iPhone 6 on the
right<00:03:32.419> we<00:03:32.629> have<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.930> iPhone<00:03:33.379> 6<00:03:33.769> plus

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
right we have the iPhone 6 plus

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.030 
right we have the iPhone 6 plus
obviously<00:03:35.000> as<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.659> can<00:03:35.720> tell<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.260> Galaxy<00:03:36.709> s6

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
obviously as you can tell the Galaxy s6

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.159 
obviously as you can tell the Galaxy s6
is<00:03:37.310> going<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.669> be<00:03:37.790> about<00:03:38.030> mid<00:03:38.389> sized<00:03:38.750> between

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
is going to be about mid sized between

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.289 
is going to be about mid sized between
the<00:03:39.590> two<00:03:39.769> which<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.549> really<00:03:40.759> smart<00:03:41.120> for

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
the two which is really smart for

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.610 
the two which is really smart for
Samsung<00:03:41.810> because<00:03:42.109> they're<00:03:42.229> not<00:03:42.349> gonna<00:03:42.500> really

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
Samsung because they're not gonna really

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.460 
Samsung because they're not gonna really
be<00:03:42.799> making<00:03:43.040> a<00:03:43.099> +<00:03:43.629> version<00:03:44.629> of<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.930> well<00:03:45.439> I

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
be making a + version of the well I

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.780 
be making a + version of the well I
guess<00:03:45.680> they<00:03:45.799> do<00:03:45.859> they<00:03:46.099> have<00:03:46.129> a<00:03:46.250> note<00:03:46.430> but

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
guess they do they have a note but

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.199 
guess they do they have a note but
anyway<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.959> it's<00:03:48.319> good<00:03:48.560> because<00:03:48.849> if<00:03:49.849> people

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
anyway it's it's good because if people

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.149 
anyway it's it's good because if people
are<00:03:50.299> trying<00:03:51.109> to<00:03:51.259> consider<00:03:51.590> whether<00:03:51.799> they<00:03:51.979> want

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
are trying to consider whether they want

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.159 
are trying to consider whether they want
to<00:03:52.220> get<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.340> 6<00:03:52.699> or<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.030> 6<00:03:53.419> plus<00:03:53.569> and<00:03:53.959> they<00:03:54.019> wanna

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
to get a 6 or a 6 plus and they wanna

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.509 
to get a 6 or a 6 plus and they wanna
get<00:03:54.290> something<00:03:54.590> maybe<00:03:54.769> in<00:03:54.889> the<00:03:54.949> middle<00:03:55.310> then

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
get something maybe in the middle then

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:56.619 
get something maybe in the middle then
maybe<00:03:55.699> they'll<00:03:55.879> just<00:03:56.030> decide<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.389> get<00:03:56.569> a

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
maybe they'll just decide to get a

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.559 
maybe they'll just decide to get a
galaxy<00:03:57.139> s6<00:03:57.709> so<00:03:58.549> that<00:03:58.699> pretty<00:03:58.849> much<00:03:58.970> wraps<00:03:59.239> up
