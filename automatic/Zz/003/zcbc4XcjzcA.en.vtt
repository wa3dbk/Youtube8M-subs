you'll<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
you'll see it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.790 
you'll see it
just<00:02:03.890> small<00:02:04.400> geeks<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.780> can<00:02:05.900> get<00:02:06.020> some<00:02:06.170> teflon

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
just small geeks you can get some teflon

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.100 
just small geeks you can get some teflon
tape<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.310> put<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:07.550> around<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:08.390> threats<00:02:08.780> where

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
tape and put it around the threats where

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.500 
tape and put it around the threats where
where<00:02:09.650> this<00:02:09.770> thing<00:02:09.979> goes

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
where this thing goes

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.660 
where this thing goes
other<00:02:11.900> than<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.230> that's<00:02:12.740> how<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.130> install

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
other than that that's how you install

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.000 
other than that that's how you install
sprinkler<00:02:14.540> heads<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:16.040> also<00:02:16.520> um<00:02:17.800> my<00:02:18.800> mom's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
sprinkler heads and also um my mom's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.530 
sprinkler heads and also um my mom's
sprinkler<00:02:19.850> valve<00:02:19.910> broke<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:22.360> it's<00:02:23.360> actually

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
sprinkler valve broke so it's actually

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.420 
sprinkler valve broke so it's actually
the<00:02:23.720> valve<00:02:23.990> didn't<00:02:24.350> break<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.980> bumped<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
the valve didn't break so I bumped the

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.210 
the valve didn't break so I bumped the
valve<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.750> solenoid<00:02:27.350> just<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.010> case

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
valve and the solenoid just in case

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.730 
valve and the solenoid just in case
solenoid<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> thing<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
solenoid this is the thing this is the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.340 
solenoid this is the thing this is the
electrical<00:02:31.280> basically<00:02:31.910> relay<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.600> turns<00:02:32.960> on

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
electrical basically relay that turns on

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.850 
electrical basically relay that turns on
the<00:02:34.340> water<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.880> off<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.330> ECP<00:02:36.290> wires<00:02:36.530> are

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
the water and off and ECP wires are

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.600 
the water and off and ECP wires are
basically<00:02:38.410> these<00:02:39.410> are<00:02:39.560> these<00:02:40.040> two<00:02:40.190> wires<00:02:40.370> are

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
basically these are these two wires are

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.800 
basically these are these two wires are
basically<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:41.390> on<00:02:41.540> 20-fold<00:02:42.340> 24<00:02:43.340> volts<00:02:43.940> AC

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
basically one on 20-fold 24 volts AC

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.850 
basically one on 20-fold 24 volts AC
which<00:02:45.530> means<00:02:45.740> you<00:02:45.890> can<00:02:46.070> put<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:47.170> human<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.830> know

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
which means you can put a human you know

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.460 
which means you can put a human you know
either<00:02:49.160> side<00:02:49.580> wire<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.720> good<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.140> there's<00:02:51.290> no

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
either side wire is good so there's no

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.350 
either side wire is good so there's no
right<00:02:51.740> way<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.950> put<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.460> is<00:02:52.610> alternating

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
right way to put it this is alternating

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.470 
right way to put it this is alternating
current<00:02:53.720> um<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:55.160> what<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.370> do<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.700> I'll<00:02:56.420> show

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
current um so what you do is I'll show

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.380 
current um so what you do is I'll show
you<00:02:57.160> like<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.890> part<00:03:01.250> was<00:03:01.430> leaking<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.180> I

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
you like this this part was leaking so I

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.300 
you like this this part was leaking so I
took<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.840> out<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.380> found<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:03.830> it<00:03:04.040> was<00:03:04.160> all

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
took it out and I found that it was all

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.160 
took it out and I found that it was all
busted<00:03:04.850> up<00:03:04.970> that's<00:03:05.270> why<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.450> was<00:03:05.630> leaking<00:03:06.020> and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
busted up that's why I was leaking and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.199 
busted up that's why I was leaking and
also<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.740> solenoid<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.700> would<00:03:07.850> turn<00:03:08.060> the

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
also the solenoid it would turn the

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.910 
also the solenoid it would turn the
water<00:03:08.390> on<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:08.989> wouldn't<00:03:09.230> turn<00:03:09.320> it<00:03:09.470> off<00:03:09.590> so

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
water on but it wouldn't turn it off so

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.100 
water on but it wouldn't turn it off so
my<00:03:10.610> mom<00:03:10.790> will<00:03:10.940> have<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.209> turn<00:03:11.450> off<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.870> whole

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
my mom will have to turn off the whole

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.820 
my mom will have to turn off the whole
house<00:03:12.410> water<00:03:13.150> anyway<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.840> just<00:03:15.050> unscrew<00:03:15.380> this

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
house water anyway you just unscrew this

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.890 
house water anyway you just unscrew this
right<00:03:17.110> if<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.260> unscrew<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.810> then<00:03:20.810> you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
right if you unscrew it and then you

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.690 
right if you unscrew it and then you
just<00:03:21.110> buy<00:03:21.290> one<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.590> these<00:03:21.739> for<00:03:21.800> like<00:03:22.220> ten<00:03:22.489> bucks

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
just buy one of these for like ten bucks

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.350 
just buy one of these for like ten bucks
at<00:03:22.970> Home<00:03:23.000> Depot<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.650> have<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.130> put<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.370> little

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
at Home Depot and I have to put a little

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.790 
at Home Depot and I have to put a little
bit<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.600> teflon<00:03:27.050> tape<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:28.430> then<00:03:29.650> screw<00:03:30.650> back

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
bit of teflon tape and then screw back

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.180 
bit of teflon tape and then screw back
on<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.900> then<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.440> can<00:03:33.590> just<00:03:33.739> get<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.010> two

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
on and then you can just get the two

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.460 
on and then you can just get the two
wires<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.850> whatever<00:03:35.360> it<00:03:35.660> was<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.260> floor

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
wires and whatever it was on the floor

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.380 
wires and whatever it was on the floor
it<00:03:37.160> doesn't<00:03:37.340> matter<00:03:37.580> which<00:03:37.790> order<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.239> you

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
it doesn't matter which order and you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.430 
it doesn't matter which order and you
put<00:03:38.570> it<00:03:38.660> back<00:03:38.810> in<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.290> then<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.370> have<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.550> fixed

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
put it back in and then you have a fixed

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.930 
put it back in and then you have a fixed
solenoid<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:43.010> will<00:03:43.220> turn<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.580> water<00:03:43.820> off

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
solenoid that will turn the water off

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.900 
solenoid that will turn the water off
and<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.500> that's<00:03:45.680> what<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:45.890> did<00:03:46.130> over<00:03:46.430> the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
and on so that's what I did over the

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.479 
and on so that's what I did over the
last<00:03:46.940> couple<00:03:47.269> days<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.930> if<00:03:48.530> your<00:03:48.680> whole<00:03:49.160> thing

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
last couple days and if your whole thing

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.400 
last couple days and if your whole thing
is<00:03:49.670> leaking<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.239> valve<00:03:50.450> is<00:03:50.630> leaking<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:51.230> can

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
is leaking the valve is leaking you can

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.620 
is leaking the valve is leaking you can
just<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.890> know<00:03:52.060> replace<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.239> whole<00:03:53.390> thing

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
just you know replace the whole thing

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.860 
just you know replace the whole thing
but<00:03:54.080> I'm<00:03:54.230> going<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.440> return<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:54.860> to

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
but I'm going to return this to

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.360 
but I'm going to return this to
I<00:03:55.900> just<00:03:56.200> bought<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.710> don't<00:03:56.770> want<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.040> make

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
I just bought it so I don't want to make

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.310 
I just bought it so I don't want to make
two<00:03:57.580> trips<00:03:57.610> just<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.330> case<00:03:58.540> what<00:03:59.110> was<00:03:59.170> the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
two trips just in case what was the

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.530 
two trips just in case what was the
whole<00:03:59.470> Val<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.910> when<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.210> took<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:02.520> solenoid

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
whole Val but when I took the solenoid

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.320 
whole Val but when I took the solenoid
solenoid<00:04:04.540> out<00:04:04.740> it<00:04:05.740> was<00:04:06.090> anyway<00:04:07.090> that's<00:04:07.270> how

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
solenoid out it was anyway that's how

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.590

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
I built this from scratch I didn't build

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.620 
I built this from scratch I didn't build
the<00:04:47.080> touchscreen<00:04:47.530> module<00:04:48.330> but<00:04:49.330> I<00:04:49.360> put

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
the touchscreen module but I put

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.880 
the touchscreen module but I put
everything<00:04:50.020> together<00:04:50.320> I've<00:04:50.650> actually

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
everything together I've actually

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.680 
everything together I've actually
programmed<00:04:51.640> this<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:52.120> can<00:04:52.270> see<00:04:52.419> it<00:04:52.510> says

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
programmed this you can see it says

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.220 
programmed this you can see it says
Max's<00:04:53.470> sprinkler<00:04:53.980> program<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:55.870> can<00:04:56.020> have<00:04:56.200> a

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
Max's sprinkler program you can have a

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.250 
Max's sprinkler program you can have a
bunch<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.650> programs<00:04:57.030> set<00:04:58.030> up<00:04:58.150> mode<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.870> it's

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
bunch of programs set up mode and it's

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.710 
bunch of programs set up mode and it's
even<00:04:59.560> in<00:04:59.770> Korean<00:05:00.370> so<00:05:00.760> my<00:05:00.910> mom<00:05:01.150> can<00:05:01.330> read<00:05:01.540> it

then you'll see you can hear the water
going<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.160> that<00:05:53.610> turned<00:05:53.910> on<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.270> relay<00:05:54.630> and

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
going and that turned on the relay and

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.720 
going and that turned on the relay and
that's<00:05:55.230> going<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.830> valve<00:05:56.040> I<00:05:56.280> showed<00:05:56.520> you

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
that's going to the valve I showed you

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.600 
that's going to the valve I showed you
earlier<00:05:56.760> and<00:05:57.510> the<00:05:58.350> solenoid<00:05:58.830> was<00:05:59.070> broken

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
earlier and the solenoid was broken

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.180 
earlier and the solenoid was broken
