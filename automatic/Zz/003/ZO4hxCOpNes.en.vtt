00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.390
 Oh 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.530
 well that's it everyone knows this 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.149
 that she is today we find ourselves 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.050
 for a new video of fast on goss 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.399
 so a campaign mode 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.629
 so to make this book it's 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.530
 really very simple it will be enough for you 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.269
 just to launch the mission 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.129
 the fall of the class and make you 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.479
 at the same checkpoint as me then a 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.280
 once arrived at this checkpoint that you 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.110
 have a freight elevator right in front of you 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.120
 there I show you two possibilities for 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.710
 climb on this one the first one being the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.690
 simpler and faster because you 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.250
 just have to jump on the pipe that goes 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.229
 you rock on the glass says if you 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.739
 do a job to get to the roof and there 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.680
 wham 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.449
 the stratagem and the output of maps is at 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.460
 so you once on this barrier 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.140
 invisible there is a multitude of small 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.490
 high spots and wels breach to 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.770
 realize I 'll leave you all 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.030
 discover by myself for myself 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.340
 just show you two little things 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.770
 so there you can walk on 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.509
 this invisible barrier 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.640
 you can go a little bit more 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.630
 up here to then go on the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.700
 platform or if it was a time 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.590
 the helicopter only you will not be able 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.939
 not go next to this one where it's 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.920
 that I aimed you can not go there 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.740
 at least I did not find the way 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.210
 to access it and I will also 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.920
 show how to go below the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.510
 map to dislocate your weapon 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.150
 disintegrate your weapon as in the 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.220
 too much of the video so eventually I 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.720
 will show you also a vision she 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.159
 breach very beautiful to see for me 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.570
 I think she is really nice 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.970
 it's not in all breached oueds 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.659
 we can see a vision like this 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.460
 that I will show you 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.750
 so if you like this video 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.400
