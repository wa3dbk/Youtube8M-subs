by 0.5 every 5 minutes rest and a 6 for
one<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:41.759> increase<00:01:42.329> by<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.899> by

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
one and then increase by that by

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.980 
one and then increase by that by
increased<00:01:44.399> by<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.759> point<00:01:44.939> five<00:01:45.180> again<00:01:45.509> so

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
increased by that point five again so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
increased by that point five again so
say<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> six<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.040> increased<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> 6.5

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
say I was out of six I increased you 6.5

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.170 
say I was out of six I increased you 6.5
go<00:01:48.659> back<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> 6<00:01:49.229> go<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> 7<00:01:50.189> go<00:01:50.399> back<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.670> 6<00:01:50.939> go

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
go back to 6 go to 7 go back to 6 go

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.910 
go back to 6 go to 7 go back to 6 go
back<00:01:51.329> some<00:01:51.600> way<00:01:51.780> 5<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.320> keep<00:01:52.619> increasing

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
back some way 5 and just keep increasing

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.550 
back some way 5 and just keep increasing
until<00:01:53.729> you're<00:01:54.420> at<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> very<00:01:54.869> end<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
until you're at the very end and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.469 
until you're at the very end and
like<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> last<00:01:56.549> couple<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.970> minutes<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
like in the last couple of minutes to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.139 
like in the last couple of minutes to
just<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.899> pull<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.909> that's<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
just like pull down and I think that's a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
just like pull down and I think that's a
perfect<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:01.020> increase<00:02:01.560> your

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
perfect way to like increase your

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.850 
perfect way to like increase your
stamina<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.689> after<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> go<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> your<00:02:04.200> 0.5<00:02:04.619> s

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
stamina and after you go to your 0.5 s

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.679 
stamina and after you go to your 0.5 s
and<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.100> maybe<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.610> your<00:02:05.820> ones<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.329> maybe

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and like maybe go to your ones or maybe

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.779 
and like maybe go to your ones or maybe
could<00:02:06.960> increase<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.890> time<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.399> run<00:02:08.550> for

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
could increase your time and run for

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.969 
could increase your time and run for
like<00:02:08.940> an<00:02:09.270> hour<00:02:09.420> okay<00:02:10.080> no<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.649> gonna<00:02:10.770> run

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
like an hour okay no one is gonna run

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.410 
like an hour okay no one is gonna run
for<00:02:11.099> an<00:02:11.190> hour<00:02:11.220> I've<00:02:11.640> never<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.090> know<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.269> for

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
for an hour I've never you know up for

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.559 
for an hour I've never you know up for
an<00:02:12.480> hour<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.840> can't<00:02:13.019> even<00:02:13.170> run<00:02:13.410> for<00:02:14.150> 30<00:02:15.150> minutes

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
an hour I can't even run for 30 minutes

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.330 
an hour I can't even run for 30 minutes
this<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.840> why<00:02:15.989> this<00:02:16.470> increasing<00:02:17.099> thing<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
this is why this increasing thing is

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.250 
this is why this increasing thing is
really<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.970> helpful<00:02:18.480> idea<00:02:18.750> for<00:02:18.989> those<00:02:19.080> who

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
this and I feel like this is really

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.670 
this and I feel like this is really

helpful as water really has helped me so

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.800 
helpful as water really has helped me so
after<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.640> stretch<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:36.569> think

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
after that I like to stretch and I think

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.350 
after that I like to stretch and I think
stretching<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.500> really<00:02:37.739> important<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.239> do<00:02:39.239> my

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
stretching is really important I do my

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.990 
stretching is really important I do my
splits<00:02:39.660> stretch<00:02:40.440> my<00:02:40.739> shoulders<00:02:41.340> wash<00:02:41.610> my<00:02:41.790> legs

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
splits stretch my shoulders wash my legs

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.960 
splits stretch my shoulders wash my legs
my<00:02:42.510> calves<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.049> stretch<00:02:43.260> everything<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.010> I

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
my calves and stretch everything and I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.180 
my calves and stretch everything and I
think<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:46.049> right<00:02:46.349> after<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.769> run<00:02:47.010> is

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
think this like right after you run is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.949 
think this like right after you run is
when<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:47.610> muscles<00:02:47.940> are<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.450> warm<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
when your muscles are just so warm and

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.520 
when your muscles are just so warm and
it<00:02:49.080> just<00:02:49.260> like<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.720> bendable<00:02:51.720> whatever<00:02:52.200> and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
it just like so bendable whatever and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.960 
it just like so bendable whatever and
links<00:02:52.769> stretchable<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.489> think<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:53.940> a

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
links stretchable so I think this is a

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.470 
links stretchable so I think this is a
perfect<00:02:54.209> time<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.720> be<00:02:55.200> stretching<00:02:59.359> what<00:03:00.359> I<00:03:00.390> do

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
perfect time to be stretching what I do

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.330 
perfect time to be stretching what I do
every<00:03:00.780> day<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.109> pretty<00:03:01.350> it's<00:03:01.769> like<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.250> just

much<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.419> I<00:05:07.840> don't<00:05:08.200> know<00:05:08.320> if<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.500> saw<00:05:08.650> any

improvements<00:05:09.310> but<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:09.790> think<00:05:10.060> that<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.479> fun<00:05:10.720> way

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
improvements but I think that a fun way

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.330 
improvements but I think that a fun way
to<00:05:10.900> do<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.260> as<00:05:11.380> well<00:05:11.590> but<00:05:11.800> make<00:05:11.979> sure<00:05:12.010> you

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
to do it as well but make sure you

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.430 
to do it as well but make sure you
incorporate<00:05:12.640> rest<00:05:13.510> days<00:05:13.720> because<00:05:14.080> without

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
incorporate rest days because without

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.260 
incorporate rest days because without
rust<00:05:14.830> age<00:05:15.010> it's<00:05:15.370> gonna<00:05:15.490> lack<00:05:16.479> motivation
