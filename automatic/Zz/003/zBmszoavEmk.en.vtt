pursuing to you my job career later one
with<00:03:03.070> something<00:03:03.490> so<00:03:04.210> you<00:03:04.270> eventually<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.990> 453

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
with something so you eventually the 453

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.110 
with something so you eventually the 453
I<00:03:05.890> think<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.400> probably<00:03:06.610> one<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
I think that's probably one of the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.880 
I think that's probably one of the
biggest<00:03:07.330> drills<00:03:07.750> for<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.080> running<00:03:08.410> backs<00:03:08.650> do

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
biggest drills for the running backs do

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.610 
biggest drills for the running backs do
you<00:03:08.950> think<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.520> you<00:03:09.820> know<00:03:09.940> did<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.720> want<00:03:11.560> to

you think that you know did you want to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.350 
you think that you know did you want to
have<00:03:11.770> a<00:03:11.800> little<00:03:12.010> higher<00:03:12.310> than<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.790> or<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.030> mean

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
something higher what something faster

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.320 
something higher what something faster
for<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.350> um<00:03:32.470> I'll<00:03:32.980> take<00:03:33.280> it<00:03:33.459> how<00:03:34.150> does

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
for that but um I'll take it how does

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.820 
for that but um I'll take it how does
that<00:03:34.360> how<00:03:34.660> do<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.810> think<00:03:35.050> that<00:03:35.200> affects<00:03:35.530> your

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
that how do you think that affects your

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.000 
that how do you think that affects your
earhole<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.640> draft<00:03:37.120> status<00:03:37.390> now<00:03:37.780> though<00:03:38.019> I

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
earhole of draft status now though I

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.490 
earhole of draft status now though I
think<00:03:39.340> overall<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.850> video<00:03:40.150> pretty<00:03:41.050> much<00:03:41.290> put

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
think overall the video pretty much put

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.830 
think overall the video pretty much put
me<00:03:41.650> up<00:03:41.739> here<00:03:42.040> amongst<00:03:43.030> others<00:03:43.480> one<00:03:43.660> of<00:03:43.780> the
