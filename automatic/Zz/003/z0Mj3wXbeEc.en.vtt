natural<00:00:14.700> because<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> kind<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
natural because I know in the kind of

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.300 
natural because I know in the kind of
drawing<00:00:16.109> whether<00:00:16.529> people<00:00:16.830> don't<00:00:17.100> like<00:00:17.279> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
place it on the inner corner and also

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.020 
place it on the inner corner and also
around<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> tear<00:01:01.230> duct<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.850> lower

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
around the tear duct and on the lower

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.500 
around the tear duct and on the lower
lash<00:01:03.270> line<00:01:04.610> i'm<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.090> take<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.330> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
lash line i'm just going to take it a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.700 
lash line i'm just going to take it a
little<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:06.810> further<00:01:07.049> than<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.560> normally

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
little bit further than we normally

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.859 
little bit further than we normally
would<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> inner<00:01:08.850> corner<00:01:09.150> colors<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
would for the inner corner colors and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
would for the inner corner colors and
that's<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.650> because<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.820> kind

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that's just because it's as it's a kind

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.940 
that's just because it's as it's a kind
of<00:01:12.119> bright<00:01:12.450> color<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.170> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.590> harder

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
of bright color it's going to be harder

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.679 
of bright color it's going to be harder
to<00:01:13.979> blend<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.549> onto<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.820> neutral<00:01:15.270> shade<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
to blend it onto the neutral shade that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.990 
to blend it onto the neutral shade that
we<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.200> over<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> lid<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> take

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
we have all over the lid so if you take

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640 
we have all over the lid so if you take
it<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> bit<00:01:18.540> further<00:01:18.780> there's<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.409> space

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it as a bit further there's more space

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.039 
it as a bit further there's more space
for<00:01:19.710> blending<00:01:20.479> but<00:01:21.479> you're<00:01:21.600> still<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
for blending but you're still going to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.539 
for blending but you're still going to
have<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.650> color<00:01:22.920> payoff<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
have that kind of color payoff of the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.649 
have that kind of color payoff of the
green<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> inside<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.450> done

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
green on the inside so with that done

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.060 
green on the inside so with that done
I'm<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> go<00:01:28.110> straight<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.770> next

seam of where bitter and all that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
seam of where bitter and all that
glitters<00:01:46.380> kind<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.979> join<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.700> that's<00:01:48.240> just

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
glitters kind of join and that's just

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510 
glitters kind of join and that's just
going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.720> help<00:01:49.140> them<00:01:49.409> blend<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
going to help them blend like if you can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.999 
going to help them blend like if you can
see<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:50.939> they're<00:01:51.119> kind<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:52.009> transitioning

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
see there they're kind of transitioning

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
see there they're kind of transitioning
a<00:01:53.100> lot<00:01:53.250> smoother<00:01:53.759> rather<00:01:54.000> than<00:01:54.180> having<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
a lot smoother rather than having a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
a lot smoother rather than having a
harsh<00:01:54.869> line<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.740> once<00:01:55.860> I've<00:01:55.979> done<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.130> I'm

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
harsh line so once I've done that I'm

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.300 
harsh line so once I've done that I'm
going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> quickly<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.060> blend<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:58.320> here<00:01:58.799> kind

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
all the glitters kind of had a line of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.109 
all the glitters kind of had a line of
separation

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
