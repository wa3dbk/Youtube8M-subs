00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello friends I come to bring you a 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.429
 small tutorial on how to increase the 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.640
 internal memory of the and 70 and 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.140
 It can work on some other equipment 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.560
 to remind you that the el and the 70 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:24.310
 put there is a memory the truth a bit 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.730
 well very very small that does not work for 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.980
 nothing and sometimes it is already having to 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.650
 update the same applications that 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.800
 the team already brings by default not us 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.240
 leave for the problem of good memory 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.460
 unless we must do for this 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.000
 problem the first thing we should do is 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.000
 be root as root us 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.660
 come on we have to download a 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.149
 application that is called founding install 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.449
 and many of you should know and 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.280
 here it happens until they are using good that 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.850
 we must do we must enter the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.309
 exhibitor install and in the section of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 downloads we're going to get in and we're going to 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:11.280
 look for the module that is called 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.609
 x internal s that we're going to do the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.369
 we go 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:19.200
 download and we will install it at 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.259
 moment to finish installing it on 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.719
 team is going to ask us to please 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.259
 we restart that we must do we are going to 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:32.009
 give back back back and in the first 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.840
 option we will give you restart good 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.009
 friends has already restarted that we should 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.069
 do not we should put into the menu of 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.890
 applications and we're going to look for the x 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:47.250
 internet sd as you see already has its icon 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.099
 we are going to get good himself since 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.159
 we must jamming in the 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:56.520
 following options default route 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:59.099
 allow all applications and access 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.420
 complete to the very important card 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:05.340
 here on the path we are going to put 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.039
 we are already talking about the teams of and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.640
 the 70 the next address that we 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.190
 appears here 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.750
 we must describe it well if not already 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.090
 we can cause some problem to the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.160
 good phone we are driving another 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.920
 team that we can do good we do 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.530
 the next we left we go to the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.140
 application menu let's look for the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.480
 file manager already inside you 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.030
 we are going to give in all the files we 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.000
 let's put it to the micro sd folder or 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.870
 sd memory depending on the cell phone that 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.550
 you have us to click and the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.500
 next address that appears here 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.010
 is what we should write to ourselves 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.220
 appear here is the same because as I already 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.959
 I told them I'm on the 70 good and 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.580
 copied and put into the application of x 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.190
 internal sd we will leave 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.170
 and we re-enter the menu 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.450
 applications and let's go to the exposer e 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.640
 install already being here we are going to go 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.130
 the section of modules already being in 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.700
 modules we are going to palomear the option 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.710
 of the internal x module of headquarters and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.800
 palomeado a message will appear 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.570
 what to put the changes 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.050
 done we have to restart the 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.940
 team please restart the computer and 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.740
