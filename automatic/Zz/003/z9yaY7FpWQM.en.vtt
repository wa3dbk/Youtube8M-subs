different they they've chose to go with
what<00:00:49.410> looks<00:00:49.590> more<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.219> halo<00:00:51.000> screw

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
what looks more like the halo screw

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
what looks more like the halo screw
instead<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:54.050> original<00:00:56.660> try<00:00:57.660> screw<00:00:57.989> which

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
instead of the original try screw which

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.889 
instead of the original try screw which
is<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:58.829> here's<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> flat<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.840> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
is right here here's the flat one so you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
is right here here's the flat one so you
can<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.500> those<00:01:01.770> those<00:01:02.340> are<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> three<00:01:02.850> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
can see those those are the three the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
can see those those are the three the
these<00:01:03.780> proprietary<00:01:04.110> screws<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.070> three

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
these proprietary screws have the three

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.260 
these proprietary screws have the three
holes<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.320> tell<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
holes in them you can tell and then the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.690 
holes in them you can tell and then the
Tri<00:01:09.450> grip<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:09.840> has<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.189> little<00:01:11.400> different

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
Tri grip now has it's a little different

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.469 
Tri grip now has it's a little different
it's<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> halo<00:01:14.000> thumb<00:01:15.000> slide<00:01:15.299> is

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
it's more like the halo thumb slide is

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.810 
it's more like the halo thumb slide is
different<00:01:16.100> here<00:01:17.100> they<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.280> side<00:01:17.640> by<00:01:17.670> side

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
different here they are side by side

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510 
different here they are side by side
it's<00:01:18.720> got<00:01:18.869> an<00:01:18.960> X<00:01:19.140> pattern<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:20.220> feels

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it's got an X pattern it actually feels

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.590 
it's got an X pattern it actually feels
better<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.210> me<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.630> makes<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.960> easier<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
better to me it makes it easier to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.850 
better to me it makes it easier to
easier<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> deploy<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> lot<00:01:26.340> better

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
easier to deploy I like it a lot better

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.109 
easier to deploy I like it a lot better
action<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.040> feel<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> action<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:29.970> better

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
action I feel like the action is better

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.580 
action I feel like the action is better
on<00:01:30.299> these<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.600> don't<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.320> don't

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
on these I don't know if they I don't

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.200 
on these I don't know if they I don't
think<00:01:31.740> they've<00:01:31.979> changed<00:01:32.009> anything<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
think they've changed anything but and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.800 
think they've changed anything but and
it<00:01:33.299> could<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.020> thumb<00:01:34.409> slide<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:35.810> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it could just be the thumb slide but it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.539 
it could just be the thumb slide but it
feels<00:01:37.140> great<00:01:37.460> feels<00:01:38.460> great<00:01:38.549> either<00:01:38.820> way

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
feels great feels great either way

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
feels great feels great either way
something<00:01:41.549> noticeably<00:01:42.180> different<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.960> off

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
something noticeably different right off

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.789 
something noticeably different right off
the<00:01:43.229> bat<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.479> glass<00:01:45.479> breaker<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.500> gone

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the bat is the glass breaker that gone

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
the bat is the glass breaker that gone
with<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.070> carbide<00:01:47.460> ball<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.479> instead

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
with the carbide ball on it now instead

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.389 
with the carbide ball on it now instead
of<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.170> sharp<00:01:49.500> point<00:01:49.770> which<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.130> know<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.310> lot

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
of this sharp point which I know a lot

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
of this sharp point which I know a lot
of<00:01:50.640> people<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> lot<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.420> customers<00:01:51.990> have

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
of people a lot of my customers have

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.209 
of people a lot of my customers have
complained<00:01:52.530> about<00:01:52.970> they've<00:01:53.970> caught<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:55.219> on

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
complained about they've caught it on

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.520 
complained about they've caught it on
stuff<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.420> cut<00:01:57.930> themselves<00:01:58.110> on

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
stuff and on there and cut themselves on

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.310 
stuff and on there and cut themselves on
this<00:01:58.680> thing<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.729> think<00:02:00.509> Microtech<00:02:01.200> has

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
this thing so I think Microtech has

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.870 
this thing so I think Microtech has
probably<00:02:01.619> heard<00:02:01.770> those<00:02:02.009> complaints<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.759> they

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
probably heard those complaints and they

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.780 
probably heard those complaints and they
chose<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.049> with<00:02:04.200> these<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.430> it's

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
chose to go with these so I like it it's

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.830 
chose to go with these so I like it it's
cool<00:02:06.770> not<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> big<00:02:08.009> deal<00:02:08.160> either<00:02:08.280> way<00:02:08.840> other

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
cool not a big deal either way other

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.330 
cool not a big deal either way other
than<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.259> pretty<00:02:10.649> much<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> same<00:02:11.190> size

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
than that pretty much the same size

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.490 
than that pretty much the same size
everything<00:02:13.000> is<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:16.720> pretty<00:02:17.050> much<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.319> same

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
everything is is pretty much the same
