up the review on we are mainly or we

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.070 
up the review on we are mainly or we

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
were mainly using this monitor as a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.670 
were mainly using this monitor as a
computer<00:02:41.070> monitor<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.790> also<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.810> watch<00:02:43.290> TV

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
computer monitor and also that watch TV

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.110 
computer monitor and also that watch TV
like<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.280> we'd<00:02:44.430> switch<00:02:44.610> back<00:02:44.820> and<00:02:44.850> forth<00:02:45.030> um<00:02:45.860> I

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
like so we'd switch back and forth um I

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.070 
like so we'd switch back and forth um I
guess<00:02:48.120> I'll<00:02:48.270> start<00:02:48.480> off<00:02:48.570> with<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.750> picture

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.200 
plugging in like the you know the audio
cable<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.190> see<00:05:03.340> if<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.550> would<00:05:03.700> resolve<00:05:04.000> that

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
cable to see if that would resolve that

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.480 
cable to see if that would resolve that
but<00:05:04.479> nothing<00:05:04.900> happened<00:05:05.289> so<00:05:06.070> we<00:05:06.190> ended<00:05:06.370> up

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
but nothing happened so we ended up

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.980 
but nothing happened so we ended up
taking<00:05:06.700> that<00:05:06.970> back<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.419> just<00:05:07.570> sticking<00:05:07.810> with
