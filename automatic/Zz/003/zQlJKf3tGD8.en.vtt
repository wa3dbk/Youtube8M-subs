 modelco to tell us about 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.070
 the world of model making and its 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.340
 business 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:27.440
 hello I have a good day accounted for the 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:30.230
 mark then model caused a society 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.379
 100% French and more 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.300
 Lyon, which is based in the 9th to 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.489
 lyon and I draw branches in the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.430
 30/08 at allevard is now a 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.380
 structure in asia in hong kong since 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.880
 2011 so model basically cause it was 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.710
 a purely modelist society that 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.810
 was called the product it can always 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.030
 pro doc for part of its range 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.579
 and who was specialized in 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.989
 thermal competition engines for 2 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.460
 racing cars 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.690
 the market of competition and market 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.370
 thermal engines it's a market 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.480
 niche 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.920
 roughly speaking, we made 4 million euros 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.960
 of turnover which represents 10% 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.240
 of the world market what is a niche 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.579
 so it's our CEO richard austria 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.900
 that irakia society in 2007 was quickly 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.220
 realized that this niche market 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.390
 was of little use and has 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.790
 decided to enter the market for 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.200
 toy more classic products and in 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.049
 drawing on his experience in the 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.460
 model making so in 2006 we started 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.940
 our activity in his call of the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.440
 trading 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.299
 to read distributed existing brands 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.369
 in particular German marks and 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.810
 american on the french market so 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.940
 we were just a distributor to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.049
 deco stickers doctors on boxes 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.299
 who did not belong to us and on the 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.680
 products they bring apples 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.659
 our development was quite 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.580
 quickly quickly sign 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.680
 licenses and in particular the license 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.530
 eurocopter which today our product 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.360
 lighthouse with a license on different 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.680
 models but the products that are 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.080
 released this year as our 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.640
 best sellers are the eurocopter 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.470
 civil security and gendarmerie which are 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.990
 strong identities in France so 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.159
 it's really the first one 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.479
 blow on the model market what 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.979
 it's really this eurocopter license 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.810
 which allowed us to differentiate ourselves 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.070
 competition has brought a world of 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.400
 hip hop earth that was well developed 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.890
 already an identity license is a product 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.750
 of quality that was 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.980
 above the market price so it was 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.110
 a challenge for us to propose a 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.930
 technologically equivalent product has 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.640
 taken over the market but it's 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.290
 this license and this visual identity 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.000
 who made us stand out in 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.790
 seriously the most sold helicopter in 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.230
 France on the permanent in 2011 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.420
 according to the stats is a pillar is 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.560
 today the heart of two models 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.240
 what it's really ugly will produce from 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.680
 orders and we really have this this 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.790
 desire to develop all produce 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.320
 two strings and they are product 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.640
 entry- level products to top 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.020
 range we can have cars at lyss 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.230
 happy like cars at 600 euros 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.459
 of our range but today we have 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.480
 realizes that the development 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.410
 also requires broad, 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.690
 widening of range 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.280
 we knew that by selling only 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.930
 generate orders and will 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.300
 evolution that will be what it will be but 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.170
 we will not necessarily have leverage at the 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.610
 provincial sale date in 2010 2011 note 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.920
 best sales in volume it was 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.180
 long that the cup mister fo has nothing to 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.430
 see with had to produce and order 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.930
 it's a product a magic illusion type 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.340
 and that's why we were able to 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.080
 develop new networks and that's it 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.519
 it's by going to get the products a 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.690
 little more atypical that we will attract the 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.580
 world we are going to talk about us and 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.989
 that we will become a brand of toys to 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.970
 full and not necessarily targeted 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.530
 heart of communes and who are your 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.459
 customers 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.769
 so today we are really 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.220
 a company that has a relationship quickly 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.070
 forget it 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.180
 so that is to say that we sell 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.459
 products to distributors 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.840
 so we are not in direct contact with the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.000
 ultimate consumer same thing at best 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.829
 we are led to do a little bit 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.480
 of online sale fault for skins 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.160
 point fr it remains from the sale of parts 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.299
 spare parts mainly would need a 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.470
 other force is also proposed for 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.000
 each of them the product of the pieces 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.040
 spare parts and after tomorrow you go to 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.269
 pinpoint comments if you break 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.250
 the pale or if you break the back 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.870
 back for a few cents 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.430
 you can reciprocity not have 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.450
 need to buy a co-op land so 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.400
 that's the first point 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.110
 so our customers mainly this is the 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.000
 large retail stores 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.190
 70% of the total 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.989
 turnover to them both and after 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.459
 we have a development that is becoming 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.799
 stronger on the new networks have 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.540
 especially the web is also new 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.020
 networks that were recently opened 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.610
 thanks to 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.740
 to this first the digicopter ie 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.120
 chickens and networks where we go 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.490
 massive and telephone operators 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.370
 have massive and people who are more 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.730
 pc in hi fi and in products 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.410
 technological 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.060
 so this new range intelligence 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.739
 if it's really a workhorse 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.270
 for model that it will be developed 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.980
 still schultz in 2012 with new 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.510
 products with cars driven by 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.580
 smartphone with helicopters 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.690
 pedestrian by smartphone and with a 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.640
 new product that still has a little 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.770
 surprised today but who will be 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.440
 soon presented to nuremberg 1 at the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.000
 international toy fair which is a 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.280
 very important project for us it will be 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.710
 an object in me say unidentified for 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.480
 the instant that will be controllable in wifi by 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.700
 that name also sounds with a camera 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.870
 and gyroscopic at 30 degrees you 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.100
 will make a shot and 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.020
 take pictures and videos at 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.450
 distance for our customers 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.280
 and the years that buy 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.140
 model products that have obviously 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.180
 the male target is favorite from 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.100
 today because the little car 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.030
 and helicopters it's still an age 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.950
 where and when even much more 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.900
 boys in combat bang on a target at 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.950
 8 15 hours for the target heart but 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.080
 it is true that today products 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.790
 referee pilates by iphone on va 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.590
 try to help young adults or 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.810
 adults who want to exploit 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.490
 their devices so here we have here 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.260
 is totally and military and 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.600
 to learn about products like 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.250

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.410
 products that they are happy for 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.730
 the team really does if the net for 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.130
 the source printers it is really 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.120
 all sex so we really it was the 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.570
 regulating range cement that makes 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.360
 today we can target an audience that 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.790
 ranges from 7 to 77 years looks like it is 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.620
 well she is going so we would like 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.120
 see them well what would it be 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.520
 possible to demonstrate 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.659
 wii pass as well thank you m 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.919
 so as agreed here is a little demo 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.330
 of the gic opted to show you that 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.479
 it's not at all complicated 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.479
 pilot 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.260
 so the very simple application is enough 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.320
 date is true on the app store or android 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.940
 market and once the intrigued be 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.160
 download there is more to put the 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.070
 small the little dongle in the device and 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.810
 launched his helicopter ride like a 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.210
 conventional control arms the gases to 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.230
 left and the direction to the right so 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.070
 before she burns 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:49.670
 in conclusion according to the of the 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.650
 direction I gave my camera a 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.270
 Thanks a lot to J Remy for accepting
