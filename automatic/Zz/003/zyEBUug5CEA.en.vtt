00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.649
 the decomposition of organic matter is a natural process similar to what 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.109
 It happens when the leaves fall from the trees in autumn 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.369
 and it is deposited in the earth 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.480
 heart art imitated this process creating the conditions which acted 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.480
 good composting 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.370
 composting is an aerobic process that allows microorganisms to degrade the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.370
 matter through the wits 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.030
 additionally, carbon is used as an energy source 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.690
 to improve the process 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.130
 for this you can use sawdust 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 vÃ©lez of wood 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.300
 The jack every 170 is a very simple rotary composter and designed to 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 use them continuously 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.990
 for this the composter is introduced the remains of food is added 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.990
 carbon and it is spun 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.950
 The composter jk 270 is resistant to corrosion and high temperature 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.870
 interior was that they arose in the process of composing the waste 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.870
 Inventory 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.759
 the compost 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.630
 It is a valuable enrichment or soil 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 given its high nutrient content 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.270
 the compost 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.270
 It is good to improve the structure and composition of the soil 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.770
 in this organization teachers the apartment there are four centers of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.210
 recycling waste 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.780
 one for metals another for apple and cardboard 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.780
 another for glass another for food remains 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.090
 the remains of food are collected in bosa that are also with potable 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.110
 the bag are introduced directly into the equipment with what I do have a cube 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.429
 of trash that has to be taken back to the apartment 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:14.870
 the very simple process 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.070
 the lid opens even if the bag 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.399
 close the lid 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.079
 when it closes automatically it will be of the amount of 40 bonus 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.909
 in the shape of a wooden fish 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.529
 it's called everything 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.519
 the process begins 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.809
 the jk5022 composter is clean 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.069
 Easy to use 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.069
 and generates a compost of superior quality 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.209
 the jk 5100 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.209
 It can also be used in queues and restaurants 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.319
 It is advisable to use in the kitchen one as they separate it from the rest 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.279
 of food waste 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.299
 these cubes can then be emptied directly into the composter 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.679
 the jk5033 to the fully automatic composter that does not need titration 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.189
 previous loading 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.309
 that equipment I found a powerful crusher the entrance 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.969
 the carbon additives in the form of wooden or series perez 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.779
 can be added manually or automatically each time it is loaded 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.819
 machine 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.020
 after the waste and the rectory 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.559
 passed the first camera to which I love camera the process 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.679
 in which the interior temperature increases due to the action of the 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:39.909
 microorganisms reaching about 60 posse I felt 5 degrees centigrade the material 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.490
 it mixes and would be in this chamber for about two weeks 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.220
 During this time, the vacancy of waste that can be 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.969
 especially through the work therefore mess 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.809
 already before the two cameras present different and jens aviation and state 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.809
 can be tested independently of each other 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:58.520
 the ventilation 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.120
 it can be adjusted so that the air flow is said to be in both chambers 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.159
 we optimize the composting process by 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.159
 Mixing time and ventilation time 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.949
 approximately after 2 weeks the programming of the machine tracer 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.200
 content from the first to the second chamber 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.009
 we love you 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.009
 ripening chamber 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.460
 The double chamber system guarantees that in terms of maturation, no 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.460
 mix with the material that is said periodically 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.000
 in this way a perfectly composted final product is guaranteed 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.650
 after another two weeks inside the maturation bed 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.650
 the moment of emptying arrives 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.700
 the compost can be used as a soil enriching power gardens 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.699
 tas 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.089
 as you can see 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.089
 the remains of food that we use will be returned nature 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.180
 the new computer jora 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.789
 They incorporate a temperature control system according to the regulations of 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:33.719
 hygiene 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.830
 the new compost series or the improvement guarantees that I receive it organic are 

00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:40.369
 treated in a clean and respectful way with the environment
