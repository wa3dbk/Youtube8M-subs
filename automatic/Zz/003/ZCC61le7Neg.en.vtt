essentially the way the time of day
boils<00:01:32.910> down<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.840> first<00:01:34.170> 10

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
boils down to is that the first 10

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:57.989 
very long but just look at how much I
could<00:04:23.370> destroy<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.630> time

00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:57.999 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.929 

not<00:04:58.599> content<00:04:58.989> with<00:04:59.409> just<00:05:00.219> having<00:05:00.519> done<00:05:00.909> a

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:00.939 
not content with just having done a

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:03.239 
not content with just having done a
stage<00:05:01.360> or<00:05:01.629> the<00:05:01.749> time<00:05:01.989> of<00:05:02.019> day<00:05:02.169> matters<00:05:02.799> were

00:05:03.239 --> 00:05:03.249 
stage or the time of day matters were

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.969 
stage or the time of day matters were
thrust<00:05:03.729> right<00:05:04.239> into<00:05:04.539> another<00:05:04.719> one<00:05:04.959> this<00:05:05.739> one

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
thrust right into another one this one

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.879 
thrust right into another one this one
isn't<00:05:06.339> nearly<00:05:06.729> as<00:05:06.879> dangerous<00:05:07.419> or<00:05:07.889> interesting

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
isn't nearly as dangerous or interesting

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.799 
isn't nearly as dangerous or interesting
though<00:05:09.069> and<00:05:09.339> the<00:05:09.939> time<00:05:10.119> goddess<00:05:10.360> doesn't<00:05:10.689> give

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:10.809 
though and the time goddess doesn't give

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:19.340 
though and the time goddess doesn't give
you<00:05:10.899> terrible<00:05:11.529> advices<00:05:11.979> time<00:05:12.159> around

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.550 

Oh<00:05:19.610> believe<00:05:20.610> me<00:05:20.670> sailor<00:05:21.390> suit<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:21.840> will<00:05:22.200> be<00:05:22.350> back

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
Oh believe me sailor suit I will be back

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:30.090 
Oh believe me sailor suit I will be back
for<00:05:22.590> you

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.070 

the<00:05:31.100> stage<00:05:31.400> really<00:05:31.880> is<00:05:32.120> just<00:05:32.150> more<00:05:32.720> grinding

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
the stage really is just more grinding

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.800 
the stage really is just more grinding
than<00:05:33.620> anything<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:34.580> evil<00:05:34.910> learns<00:05:35.090> Castle<00:05:35.690> is

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
than anything the evil learns Castle is

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.140 
than anything the evil learns Castle is
literally<00:05:36.380> like<00:05:36.800> this<00:05:36.980> rate<00:05:37.370> there<00:05:37.700> and

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
literally like this rate there and

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.030 
literally like this rate there and
there's<00:05:38.600> really<00:05:38.900> nothing<00:05:39.140> stopping<00:05:39.680> us<00:05:39.980> from

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
there's really nothing stopping us from

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.880 
there's really nothing stopping us from
just<00:05:40.310> going<00:05:40.670> there<00:05:41.120> sure<00:05:42.050> there's<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.530> tide

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
just going there sure there's the tide

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.300 
just going there sure there's the tide
but<00:05:43.400> that<00:05:43.610> hardly<00:05:44.120> slows<00:05:44.720> you<00:05:44.870> down<00:05:44.930> like<00:05:45.500> you

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
but that hardly slows you down like you

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.130 
but that hardly slows you down like you
could<00:05:46.490> get<00:05:46.790> to<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.090> evil<00:05:47.360> Lord<00:05:47.540> probably<00:05:48.020> by

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
could get to the evil Lord probably by

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.190 
could get to the evil Lord probably by
level<00:05:48.500> two<00:05:48.920> in<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:50.390> grand<00:05:50.630> scheme<00:05:50.840> of<00:05:50.900> things

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
level two in the grand scheme of things

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.920 
level two in the grand scheme of things
is<00:05:51.530> just<00:05:51.760> I'm<00:05:52.760> not<00:05:52.970> a<00:05:53.000> huge<00:05:53.210> fan<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.450> this<00:05:53.660> stage

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
is just I'm not a huge fan of this stage

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.680 
is just I'm not a huge fan of this stage
it<00:05:54.650> really<00:05:54.920> feels<00:05:55.220> like<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:56.000> should<00:05:56.330> have<00:05:56.360> come

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
it really feels like it should have come

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.060 
it really feels like it should have come
before<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.230> one<00:05:57.380> before<00:05:57.590> it

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
before the one before it

before the one before it
this<00:05:58.790> one<00:05:59.030> introducing<00:05:59.660> to<00:05:59.780> us<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.080> yes<00:06:00.320> the

map is literally actively changing as
time<00:06:04.160> passes<00:06:04.460> then<00:06:05.420> you<00:06:05.510> have<00:06:05.720> the<00:06:06.530> one<00:06:06.710> where

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
time passes then you have the one where

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.920 
time passes then you have the one where
the<00:06:07.220> time<00:06:07.430> of<00:06:07.580> day<00:06:07.670> is<00:06:07.820> essentially<00:06:08.330> vital<00:06:08.780> to
