spirituality<00:01:09.260> stuff<00:01:09.800> so<00:01:10.190> I<00:01:10.250> think<00:01:10.310> these

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
spirituality stuff so I think these

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.400 
spirituality stuff so I think these
stuff<00:01:10.910> from<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.540> point<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:11.840> view<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:12.020> someone

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
stuff from the point of view of someone

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.020 
stuff from the point of view of someone
who<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.680> incredibly<00:01:13.040> rational<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.000> logical

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
who is incredibly rational and logical

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.210 
who is incredibly rational and logical
so<00:01:14.870> it<00:01:14.990> should<00:01:15.110> mean<00:01:15.260> that<00:01:15.290> I<00:01:15.470> kind<00:01:15.800> of<00:01:15.890> want

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
so it should mean that I kind of want

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.150 
so it should mean that I kind of want
this<00:01:16.880> magic<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.600> don't<00:01:17.720> I<00:01:18.080> want<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.560> believe<00:01:19.010> in

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
this magic I don't I want to believe in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.610 
this magic I don't I want to believe in
stuff<00:01:19.370> but<00:01:19.610> I<00:01:19.640> really<00:01:20.320> struggle<00:01:21.320> with

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
stuff but I really struggle with

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.710
