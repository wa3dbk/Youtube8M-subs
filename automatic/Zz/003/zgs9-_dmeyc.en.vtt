00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.590
 Hello people for getting a new video in this video powerful 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.109
 slimmed down top-act 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.119
 imagine 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.189
 and not as Chancellor Christian Henze 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:20.710
 this feedback exists in the versions 128 around 28 points and place 7 50 March 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.189
 1 56 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.669
 as a very high at 5 6 percent 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.119
 it is the same rage to elude on critical topics sixties version 2 0 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.019
 64 times 16 nations 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.970
 so 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.220
 Those who can not have a good pc are actually forgiven forgetting the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.840
 is so high 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.920
 to each person a few pictures 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.100
 it's him 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.010
 4 1 and 8 the assembly is there is a friend Felix even 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.800
 To pass is a must for those who are clever minds who later read that 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.960
 Purpose Prayers 1 14 Food is or continues 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.970
 the title will always react after the changed pound the makers go off 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.770
 is percent of AXA that has been covered by ca percent 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.530
 We then changed the title so it would not work for everyone 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 Settling victories make it useless 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 Here we see Patrick's shot of the9 ruins 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.500
 JU then left the ears with the title then 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.310
 I personally recommend sustainable solutions for the Danes 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.710
 also gamers PC have defeated Oakley meet 6 4 5 4 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.000
 to 11 basically at both tracks so nothing exaggerated big differences 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.359
 on reimbursement extra bit clear 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.920
 he started to made you have the textures who started on the desktop 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.500
 that could years, what could I do right now 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.860
 the winner gene consumptions ahead 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.530
 the TS Lichtenfels 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.870

 There he in his eyes may have in place 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.640

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.799
 Text APA Red 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.180
 Sharp exotics, and from this the community incurs an additional one 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.289
 and also the latest recommends percent it is as linked to the description 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.749
 Pilati opens shortly 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:26.080
 in order to be able to do what you want you HD textures the ARD of 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.119
 and if he does not please God torturers 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:30.319
 and then just click Patch 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.959
 i did all i do not want my whole matsuri to be that IT 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.739
 Then it will be natural 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.469
 if he is done 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.469
 Just eat my strength 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.529
 would 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.589
 and there Corny is so far down 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:58.589
 is the thickest which appears in the 4 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.319
 Depending on the perpetrator or time, data can always be longer 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.879
 but it generally takes a long time 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.749
 not well though 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.739
 Let's see 80 you see new font 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.409
 be on the bottom right 4 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.289
 because they are running too 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.279
 Nimptsch also recommend 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.539
 and often very humorous yet can not share it 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.179
 around 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.179

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:46.360

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.599
