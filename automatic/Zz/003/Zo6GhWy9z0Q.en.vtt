 ready-made original packaging comes 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.379
 this device is written behind 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.460
 technical characteristics of this 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:24.300
 apparatus in principle in the lineup with we 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.369
 met the data of the packaging roller 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.630
 a little bit different here but nonetheless 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.590
 the packaging has not changed so us 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.590
 the smartphone itself 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:47.879
 further here is such a liner which 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:51.920
 manual is attached we also guarantee 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.920
 obligations from the plant 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:00.559
 we also see in the micro usb package 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.559
 cable 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:09.140
 here is a charger with 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:12.869
 power of 2 amps and here is such 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.460
 Adapter for our Razi and so this 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.280
 equipment nothing more here here to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.479
 the smartphone can also be purchased also

 Silicone bumper and cover book in 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.590
 In principle , the manufacturer has it all. 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.630
 so consider the appearance of the gadget 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.140
 our back panel is made of 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.920
 plastic plastic is not glossy can not 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.420
 say marker no because 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.020
 pearl color with no white such 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.500
 by some overflow those are not pure white 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.090
 That marks on it does not remain 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.039
 logo external speaker microphone

 the volume below us mikrofonchik one more 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.849
 i.e. two microphones in total for one 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.649
 for noise cancellation with gravitsky tops

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:23.819
 here is the front panel we have done yet 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:27.299
 turn on the front panel and we have done 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.790
 from the glass that is, thank them to the knight 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.170
 the display will not bend anything give 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.470
 very high quality glass to know what 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.170
 what little is Gorilla Glass is in 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.720
 bottom 3 social buttons to 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.180
 Unfortunately, there is no backlight indicator 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.930
 of events 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.930
 5 megapixel front camera

 speaker speaker light sensor 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:56.599
 and approximations so this is included 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.250
 smart here we have a desktop let all 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.090
 us 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.920
 Russified this smartphone further 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.510
 great tusy reacts to all my 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.040
 touch by the way if said

 display with a diagonal of five and a half 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.019
 inches applied by jess technology with 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.660
 the corners of the images do not affect 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.440
 there will be a matrix and ps tus kranchik here 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.069
 very high quality installed here 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.810
 manufacturer like interface here in 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.000
 principle steel standard shell 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.640
 from the manufacturer white used and called 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.590
 version 2 and 5 here and we can go into 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.350
 the settings basically see it all 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.860
 in the paragraph about the phone

 security we are now information 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.880
 Immediately look at the arrangement 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.859
 that's passed in the katana that works 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.030
 This smartphone 2 gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.910
 16 built 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.970
 and versions of android become already 500 and pop so 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.140
 so called but with a given shell 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.930
 I think that you are getting acquainted 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.060
 5 viewers themselves have shown now let's see 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.650
 on the real characteristics of the device with 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:16.489
 using antutu benchmark program here at 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:22.190
 us android 5 spoke mtk processor 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:25.130
 6753 dual core pray 760 video chip 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.590
 full hd resolution 2 gigabytes 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.590
 RAM internal memory on 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.860
 here is 16 gigabyte hours before each core 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.700
 one of the hertz family 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.280
 As for the sensors and Sasha produced 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.820
 so we understand the linear sensor itself 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:48.340
 accelerate you victor navara 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:52.860
 After that, the gyroscope proximity sensor 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.860
 magnetic field sensor 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.400
 accelerometer twist such Temka sees with 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.050
 quick access to various settings 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.180
 orientation gravity basically everything 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.490
 sensors you need in your smartphone 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.560
 present how do we do the test now and 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.660
 Man how many points will type 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.430
 this unit this test here is 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.880
 the number of points scored devices and after 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.350
 43200 66 test pretty good 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.570
 quantity despite the fact that we already 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.060
 held many apparatus in hand 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.780
 that work on this hardware here 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.430
 Now we go to the camera, we will 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.090
 test in principle the camera dice is equal 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:37.570
 13 megapixels right after day settings 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.350
 let's see you can choose the ratio 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.400
 parties 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.490
 we can change shooting modes inside 10 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.010
 installed this video choose 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.230
 Maximum full hd resolution and 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:58.770
 focus on further photo mode hdr 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:02.370
 can choose we take a picture 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.370
 we will make a video 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.410
 so about Lenin what we recorded 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:20.160
 information full hd video resolution photo 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.880
 matching 13 megapixels tusk 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.170
 the radio operator is really 13 megapixel here with 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:29.400
 with her you can get good 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:33.480
 pictures now go to the panel set 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.310
 the numbers you call him an emergency call and 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.930
 let's see how the sensor works 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.910
 approximation works principle without 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.190
 problems and let's summarize small results 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.280
 regarding this product, I think that 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.740
 for your money numerical given 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.550
 the product deserves attention why 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.610
 because these technical 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.520
 performance level and quality then 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.650
 there is virtually all its competitors stand 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.360
 more expensive that is to say the technical part is not 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.430
 go do not win and take into consideration the 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.600
 update a slinger should be fine 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.310
 from the manufacturer show the start of sales 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.230
 therefore we recommend to everyone 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:12.120
 This unit and camera is excellent and the sound and 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.270
 All strictly speaking, this device on 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.680
 top level given the cost 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.950
 buy in the online store mom sneaker 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.950
