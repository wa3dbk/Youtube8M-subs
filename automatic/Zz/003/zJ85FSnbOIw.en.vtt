with<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:35.940> how<00:00:36.840> timing<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:38.280> everything<00:00:38.579> when

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
with you how timing is everything when

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.229 
with you how timing is everything when
it<00:00:39.899> comes<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.800> getting<00:00:41.550> rid<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:42.030> belly

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it comes to getting rid of your belly

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.160 
it comes to getting rid of your belly
fat<00:00:42.629> clearing<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.739> brain<00:00:44.840> giving<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.020> the

fat clearing your brain giving you the
energy<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.579> want<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.270> need<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.809> making

energy that you want and need and making

energy that you want and need and making
the<00:00:49.739> inside<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.430> body<00:00:51.110> 20<00:00:52.969> timing<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
the inside of your body 20 timing is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.869 
the inside of your body 20 timing is
really<00:00:54.480> critical<00:00:55.070> don't<00:00:56.070> realize<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.520> how

really critical don't realize just how

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.170 
really critical don't realize just how
critical<00:00:57.890> there's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> series<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.489> hormones

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
critical there's a series of hormones

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.250 
critical there's a series of hormones
that<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:01.320> cyclical<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.640> body<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.359> one

that are cyclical in your body and one
of<00:01:04.379> those<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.619> called<00:01:05.129> leptin<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.770> leptin<00:01:07.770> has

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
of those is called leptin and leptin has

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.100 
of those is called leptin and leptin has
a<00:01:08.729> peak<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:10.439> around<00:01:10.680> dinnertime<00:01:11.159> and

a peak right around dinnertime and

a peak right around dinnertime and
between<00:01:13.110> dinner<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.560> bedtime<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.900> when<00:01:15.900> that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
between dinner and bedtime and when that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.359 
between dinner and bedtime and when that
cake<00:01:17.009> happens<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.200> your<00:01:19.200> body's<00:01:19.590> receptive

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
cake happens and your body's receptive

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.840 
cake happens and your body's receptive
to<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.610> key<00:01:21.200> your<00:01:22.200> appetite<00:01:22.710> goes<00:01:23.009> away<00:01:23.159> your

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to that key your appetite goes away your

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.140 
to that key your appetite goes away your
appetite<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.450> at<00:01:24.600> an<00:01:24.720> all-time<00:01:24.900> low<00:01:25.200> and

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
appetite is at an all-time low and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.390 
appetite is at an all-time low and
ideally<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.330> appetite<00:01:27.840> should<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:29.159> an

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
ideally your appetite should be at an

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.600 
ideally your appetite should be at an
all-time<00:01:29.579> low<00:01:30.259> right<00:01:31.259> after<00:01:31.439> dinner<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
all-time low right after dinner you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
all-time low right after dinner you
shouldn't<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> munchies<00:01:33.570> an<00:01:34.170> hour<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
shouldn't have the munchies an hour to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.219 
shouldn't have the munchies an hour to
after<00:01:35.310> eating<00:01:35.579> dinner<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.869> so

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
after eating dinner which is what so

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.399 
after eating dinner which is what so
many<00:01:37.259> people<00:01:37.619> tell<00:01:38.100> me<00:01:38.130> about<00:01:38.540> when<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:40.020> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
many people tell me about when you do it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.929 
many people tell me about when you do it
indicates<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.270> leptin<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> balance

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
indicates that leptin is out of balance

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.219 
indicates that leptin is out of balance
so<00:01:44.939> there's<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> couple<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.630> tips<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.079> to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
so there's a couple of tips I'm going to

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.899 
so there's a couple of tips I'm going to
share<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.829> today<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.700> these<00:01:47.850> are

share with you today and these are

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.170 
share with you today and these are
things<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.570> put<00:01:48.600> into<00:01:48.930> place<00:01:49.290> right<00:01:49.590> away

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
things you can put into place right away

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
things you can put into place right away
one<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.600> things<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.020> scientists<00:01:52.799> have

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
one of the things that scientists have

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.240 
one of the things that scientists have
found<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.610> true<00:01:54.329> about<00:01:54.450> leptin<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:56.130> if

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
found is true about leptin is that if

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760 
found is true about leptin is that if
you<00:01:56.490> eat<00:01:56.520> carbohydrates<00:01:57.270> too<00:01:58.200> soon<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you eat carbohydrates too soon in the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.289 
you eat carbohydrates too soon in the
day<00:01:59.060> you<00:02:00.060> cause<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.420> left<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.530> peak<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:03.149> be

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
day you cause that left and peak to be

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.880 
day you cause that left and peak to be
sooner<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.079> day

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
sooner in the day

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.029 
sooner in the day
and<00:02:04.979> then<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.640> starts<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.270> go<00:02:06.420> down<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.770> after

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
and then it starts to go down so after

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.580 
and then it starts to go down so after
dinner<00:02:08.580> your<00:02:09.240> leptin<00:02:09.660> levels<00:02:09.869> are<00:02:10.200> low

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
dinner your leptin levels are low

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.199 
dinner your leptin levels are low
instead<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> high<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.569> guess<00:02:13.230> what<00:02:13.560> happens

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
instead of high and guess what happens

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.360 
instead of high and guess what happens
you<00:02:15.209> get<00:02:15.390> hungry<00:02:15.800> even<00:02:16.800> though<00:02:16.920> you've<00:02:17.100> just
