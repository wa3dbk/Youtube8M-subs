 we put our meat a kilo of meat 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.060

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.840
 people 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.800
 legs are asked 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.640
 and it's a kilo and here we're going to 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.640
 put this 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.680
 we'll let it marinate for 24 hours 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.650
 but we are going to cover it 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.500
 see, let's cover it 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.650
 well and we're going to keep it in the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.650
 fridge 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:52.320
 it's already 24 hours that our cochinita c 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.320
 zero and we're going to put it in the fire 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.629
 we are going to salt the cochinita already 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.890
 is starting to boil, we are going to put 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.110
 a little bit of salt we cover it again and 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.480
 We left it there for an hour until it 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.830
 thing 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.910
 you are watching 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:19.890
 but let's make the onions chili 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.340
 habanero salt vinegar and oregano 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.490
 this is to prepare the onion for 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.680
 accompany the cochinita let's slice 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.729
 the onion 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:36.600
 we slice them and cut them in half 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:39.720
 so that it is not too big for 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.380
 the onion is not so strong we wet it 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.250
 to the water jet 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.760
 to chop the habanero chile also 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.840
 we cut it down 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.510
 be careful because this chile is very much 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.200
 spicy and you have to be careful not to 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.470
 put a lot of hands because we 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.100
 we put our eyes in, we are going to put a 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.230
 teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.360
 oregano 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.639
 remember that this is for a kilogram of 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:18.240
 meat and vinegar 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:21.479
 vinegar a cup of vinegar and there goes the 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.560
 most important secret so that 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.410
 onions are not strong warm water to 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.860
 to cover the onions and leave them there 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.750
 until we serve our cochinita 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.340
 our cochinita is already cooked as 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:42.750
 you can see we are going to crumble 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:46.530
 but you see it 's so soft that with the 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.650
 pure fork breaks down we do not need 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.020
 put your hands because it 's hot I 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.060
 I will present it in this on stake 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.530
 mud sole 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.530
 now yes you 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:06.760
 where you like to see the leaves now 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:09.280
 We are going to remove the leaves 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.849
 because these little sheets have already released their 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.759
 taste 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:16.759
 see this time less used and ready 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:20.259
 to eat with their onions and their 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.259
 warm tortillas 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.210
 and this is already
