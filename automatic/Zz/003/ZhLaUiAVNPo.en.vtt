 hyperdock is the best-selling model 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.720
 every year in September 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.850

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 even lighter model than usual 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.120
 with luna run cushioning all over the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.400
 week a huge hull at the level of 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.750
 heel to properly maintain your foot the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.850
 shoe also has cables 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.260
 flywire especially the all in loincloth of the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.740
 shoe for good will maintain your 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.710
 foot at each change of direction 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.820
 the model is also aimed at all 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.409
 feet, that is to say with wide feet 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.729
 as at the end foot to girls as to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.500
 boys so this is a great model 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.180
 multi post you are a leader 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.219
 rear winger the effort to pivot 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.509
 it's an excellent model to come and test 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.789
 in store as soon as possible 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.649
 this year's flagship model at adidas 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.310
 I will introduce you crazy light 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.710
 boost 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.289
 so who replaces the old adidas 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.950
 crazy light is different from his 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.439
 predecessor 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.180
 not only by its amortization which is not 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.609
 the more there says take and that is the boost 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.950
 so what is the boost this is a 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.109
 compounded particle damper that stores 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.590
 and that restores your energy to every 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.659
 stride 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 so it's a hyper dynamic cushioning 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.859
 for the players rather fast and rather 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.030
 light the shoe is really very 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.890
 light because his sign is 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.460
 consisting of locks exclusively without 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.560
 sewing you also have a heel 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.740
 3d molded called fit frame which is 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.050
 really excellent and coupled with the vault 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.520
 plantar energy played all this you 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.260

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.819
