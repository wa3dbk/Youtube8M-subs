is<00:03:13.150> good<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.870> sound<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.410> predictably<00:03:14.920> electron

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
is good it sound is predictably electron

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.520

but<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.340> plays<00:03:18.520> well<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.060> if<00:03:19.300> you<00:03:19.810> redefine

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
but it plays well and if you redefine

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.120 
but it plays well and if you redefine
the<00:03:20.830> keys<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.580> sensible<00:03:22.270> keys<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.890> very

playable<00:03:24.780> would<00:03:25.780> probably<00:03:26.110> be<00:03:26.200> better<00:03:26.380> with<00:03:26.560> a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
playable would probably be better with a

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.230 
playable would probably be better with a
joystick<00:03:26.830> but<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> don't<00:03:27.520> have<00:03:27.730> one<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.150> I

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
joystick but I don't have one and I

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.699 
joystick but I don't have one and I
