no crazy needs I mean the tight end
positions<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.640> little<00:00:23.850> bit<00:00:23.970> thin<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
positions a little bit thin but it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
positions a little bit thin but it
wasn't<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.990> targeted<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.980> or<00:00:26.130> two

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
wasn't like we targeted one or two

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.980 
wasn't like we targeted one or two
positions<00:00:26.699> set<00:00:26.939> okay<00:00:27.240> they've<00:00:27.449> got<00:00:27.660> him<00:00:27.869> out

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
positions set okay they've got him out

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
positions set okay they've got him out
of<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.170> draft<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> these<00:00:28.800> guys<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.250> they

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
of the draft one of these guys so they

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.339 
of the draft one of these guys so they
were<00:00:29.820> able<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.150> sit<00:00:30.359> back<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.539> pick<00:00:31.140> town

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
were able to just sit back and pick town

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.020 
were able to just sit back and pick town
I<00:00:31.380> think<00:00:31.769> they<00:00:31.859> did<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> fine<00:00:32.309> job<00:00:32.340> even<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:32.910> it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
I think they did a fine job even if it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.370 
I think they did a fine job even if it
was<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> little<00:00:33.510> more<00:00:33.630> slanted<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
was a little more slanted to the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260 
was a little more slanted to the
offensive<00:00:34.739> side<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> ball<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:36.090> were

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
offensive side of the ball what were

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.760 
offensive side of the ball what were
your<00:00:36.420> favorite<00:00:36.660> was<00:00:37.110> your<00:00:37.200> favorite<00:00:37.500> pic<00:00:37.620> and

your favorite was your favorite pic and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.200
