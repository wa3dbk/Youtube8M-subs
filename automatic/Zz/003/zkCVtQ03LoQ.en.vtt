secret we standing between the back

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.419 
secret we standing between the back
pistons<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.200> activate<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.830> I'm<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.370> to

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
pistons and activate it I'm going to

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.749 
pistons and activate it I'm going to
fall<00:00:11.639> straight<00:00:11.849> through<00:00:12.240> into<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.599> secret<00:00:12.990> room

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
fall straight through into a secret room

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.480 
fall straight through into a secret room
like<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.289> so<00:00:16.289> now<00:00:16.830> we<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.039> take<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.250> look<00:00:17.340> at

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
like this so now we can take a look at

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.300 
like this so now we can take a look at
the<00:00:17.550> red<00:00:17.699> stone<00:00:18.140> if<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.350> should<00:00:19.590> avoid<00:00:19.800> outside

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
the red stone if we should avoid outside

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.820 
the red stone if we should avoid outside
we<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.850> see<00:00:21.060> into<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.529> here

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
we can see into it as you can see here

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.279 
we can see into it as you can see here
it's<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.460> very<00:00:23.640> thing<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.300> very<00:00:24.570> long<00:00:24.810> so

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
it's not very thing not very long so

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.880 
it's not very thing not very long so
it's<00:00:25.439> best<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> both<00:00:25.890> worlds<00:00:26.539> now<00:00:27.710> when<00:00:28.710> it's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it's best of both worlds now when it's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.700 
it's best of both worlds now when it's
closed<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:30.689> power<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.199> line<00:00:31.439> here

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
closed like this we power this line here

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.889 
closed like this we power this line here
and<00:00:31.949> it's<00:00:32.489> basically<00:00:32.700> using<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> top<00:00:33.390> off<00:00:33.600> one

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and it's basically using the top off one

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
and it's basically using the top off one
of<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:34.079> old<00:00:34.260> doors<00:00:34.559> which<00:00:35.010> may<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.309> seen<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
of my old doors which may have seen the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.270 
of my old doors which may have seen the
three<00:00:36.120> by<00:00:36.360> two<00:00:36.680> flush<00:00:37.680> door<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:38.010> well<00:00:38.660> where<00:00:39.660> we

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
three by two flush door as well where we

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
three by two flush door as well where we
send<00:00:41.280> some<00:00:41.520> power<00:00:41.760> down<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.660> around<00:00:42.870> like

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
send some power down and around like

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
send some power down and around like
that<00:00:43.829> which<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.910> push<00:00:45.149> these<00:00:45.329> side<00:00:45.600> Pistons

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that which will push these side Pistons

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.860 
that which will push these side Pistons
out<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> same<00:00:47.610> time<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
out and this one at the same time and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
out and this one at the same time and
then<00:00:49.050> two<00:00:49.320> dicks<00:00:49.530> before<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
then two dicks before that I have this

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.150 
then two dicks before that I have this
block<00:00:50.700> powered<00:00:51.059> here<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.680> get<00:00:52.890> powered

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
block powered here so these get powered

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910 
block powered here so these get powered
at<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:53.489> time<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:55.170> they'll<00:00:55.530> attend

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
at the right time and it they'll attend

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.250 
at the right time and it they'll attend
probably<00:00:56.390> now<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> bottom<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.140> see

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
probably now at the bottom you can see

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.840 
probably now at the bottom you can see
our<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.530> secret<00:00:59.129> when<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.989> door<00:01:01.230> closes

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
our little secret when the door closes

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.789 
our little secret when the door closes
just<00:01:02.850> Pistons<00:01:03.480> push<00:01:03.600> together<00:01:03.809> those<00:01:04.530> two

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
just Pistons push together those two

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.100 
just Pistons push together those two
persons<00:01:05.400> pull<00:01:05.640> apart<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.780> allow<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
persons pull apart and that allow the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.010 
persons pull apart and that allow the
player<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.470> drop<00:01:07.860> through<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.939> make<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.659> no

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
player to drop through to make it so no

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.109 
player to drop through to make it so no
one<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.040> mechanism<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
one can see this mechanism is here and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.730 
one can see this mechanism is here and
they<00:01:12.210> can't<00:01:12.479> find<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
they can't find it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.609 
they can't find it
we're<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:15.820> have<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.270> make<00:01:16.630> sure<00:01:16.960> we

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
we're going to have to make sure we

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.740 
we're going to have to make sure we
can't<00:01:17.890> see<00:01:18.100> these<00:01:18.280> moving<00:01:18.790> while<00:01:19.030> its<00:01:19.299> opening

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
can't see these moving while its opening

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.450 
can't see these moving while its opening
or<00:01:19.840> closing<00:01:19.869> so<00:01:20.350> if<00:01:20.470> i<00:01:20.590> sign<00:01:20.860> here<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.250> watch

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
or closing so if i sign here and watch

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.620 
or closing so if i sign here and watch
you<00:01:21.790> can't<00:01:22.720> see<00:01:23.080> any<00:01:23.439> of<00:01:24.130> it<00:01:24.250> happening<00:01:24.630> does

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
you can't see any of it happening does

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.139 
you can't see any of it happening does
that<00:01:25.840> want<00:01:26.259> to<00:01:26.320> open<00:01:26.649> it<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:27.189> never<00:01:27.820> see<00:01:28.030> these

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
that want to open it you never see these

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.429 
that want to open it you never see these
moves<00:01:28.479> so<00:01:28.689> you're<00:01:28.840> not<00:01:28.899> really<00:01:29.049> gonna<00:01:29.200> have<00:01:29.380> an

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
moves so you're not really gonna have an

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.499 
moves so you're not really gonna have an
idea<00:01:29.770> what's<00:01:30.039> going<00:01:30.340> on<00:01:30.460> unless<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.450> course

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
idea what's going on unless of course

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.560 
idea what's going on unless of course
you're<00:01:31.810> standing<00:01:32.170> here<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.590> we<00:01:32.890> have<00:01:33.009> 28<00:01:33.220> it

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
you're standing here and we have 28 it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.440 
you're standing here and we have 28 it
will<00:01:34.570> part<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:34.960> we<00:01:35.289> drop<00:01:35.500> straight<00:01:35.740> through

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
will part and we drop straight through

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.480 
will part and we drop straight through
the<00:01:37.450> bottom<00:01:37.929> Pistons<00:01:38.350> just<00:01:38.649> powered<00:01:39.039> by<00:01:39.280> an

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
the bottom Pistons just powered by an

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.639 
the bottom Pistons just powered by an
inverted<00:01:40.149> fighting<00:01:40.659> its<00:01:40.780> monostable<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:41.560> what

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
inverted fighting its monostable so what

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.010 
inverted fighting its monostable so what
that<00:01:41.679> means<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.280> when<00:01:43.000> this<00:01:43.149> line<00:01:43.420> powers<00:01:43.840> on

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
that means is when this line powers on

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.560 
that means is when this line powers on
this<00:01:44.679> torch<00:01:44.979> will<00:01:45.159> power<00:01:45.429> off<00:01:45.640> let's<00:01:46.330> just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
this torch will power off let's just

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.300 
this torch will power off let's just
pull<00:01:46.810> back<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.319> then<00:01:47.590> that's<00:01:47.740> all<00:01:47.830> I<00:01:47.890> late<00:01:48.100> at

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
pull back and then that's all I late at

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.160 
pull back and then that's all I late at
this<00:01:48.490> repeater<00:01:49.060> will<00:01:49.420> eventually<00:01:49.750> turn<00:01:49.990> on

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
this repeater will eventually turn on

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.930 
this repeater will eventually turn on
pairing<00:01:50.920> register<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.369> below<00:01:51.549> it<00:01:51.729> and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
pairing register and below it and

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.010 
pairing register and below it and
pushing<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.899> back<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:54.060> now<00:01:55.060> for<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.479> tutorial

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
pushing it back and now for a tutorial

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.139 
pushing it back and now for a tutorial
we're<00:01:56.830> going<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:57.190> start<00:01:57.429> out<00:01:57.700> with<00:01:57.729> our

these top two pistons and then sell at
the<00:02:26.410> top<00:02:26.590> here<00:02:26.829> and<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.850> chiseled<00:02:28.359> blocks

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
the top here and now the chiseled blocks

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.599 
the top here and now the chiseled blocks
show<00:02:28.870> one's<00:02:29.079> going<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.410> be<00:02:29.500> moving<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.459> rest

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
show one's going to be moving the rest

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.220 
show one's going to be moving the rest
aren't<00:02:30.880> going<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.269> accept<00:02:31.299> these<00:02:31.720> down<00:02:31.959> here

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
aren't going to accept these down here

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.050 
aren't going to accept these down here
and<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:33.100> just<00:02:33.250> need<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.549> make<00:02:33.670> these<00:02:33.880> two

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and you just need to make these two

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.300 
and you just need to make these two
blocks<00:02:34.299> here<00:02:34.480> slabs<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.500> they<00:02:36.130> don't

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
blocks here slabs so they don't

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.099 
blocks here slabs so they don't
suffocate<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.030> when<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:37.420> try<00:02:37.630> and<00:02:37.690> drop<00:02:37.840> down

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
suffocate you when you try and drop down

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.640 
suffocate you when you try and drop down
through<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.970> start<00:02:40.420> off<00:02:40.600> with<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.959> input<00:02:41.470> is

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
through so start off with that input is

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.349 
through so start off with that input is
going<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.010> be<00:02:42.130> right<00:02:42.340> here<00:02:42.370> we're<00:02:43.120> going<00:02:43.239> to

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
going to be right here we're going to

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.080 
going to be right here we're going to
put<00:02:43.480> power<00:02:43.720> into<00:02:44.489> somewhere<00:02:45.489> like<00:02:45.609> here<00:02:45.640> and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
put power into somewhere like here and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.319 
put power into somewhere like here and
then<00:02:46.930> that's<00:02:47.140> what's<00:02:47.350> going<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.620> power<00:02:47.859> it<00:02:48.329> so

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
then that's what's going to power it so

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.270 
then that's what's going to power it so
now<00:02:49.540> we're<00:02:49.810> going<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.989> place<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> block<00:02:50.620> here<00:02:50.680> a

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
now we're going to place a block here a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.500 
now we're going to place a block here a
block<00:02:51.970> here<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.709> round<00:02:53.709> like<00:02:53.829> that<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.970> then

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
block here and round like that and then

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.920 
block here and round like that and then
this<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.870> going<00:02:56.109> to<00:02:56.260> do<00:02:56.440> our<00:02:56.620> jab<00:02:57.370> duel<00:02:57.930> just

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
this is going to do our jab duel just

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.949 
this is going to do our jab duel just
like<00:02:59.079> that<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.530> now<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.489> power<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.060> you'll

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
like that and now if I power that you'll

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.479 
like that and now if I power that you'll
see<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.380> will<00:03:02.500> power<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.739> gel<00:03:03.069> all<00:03:03.280> nicely

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
see that will power the gel all nicely

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.629 
see that will power the gel all nicely
and<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:05.200> power<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.739> now<00:03:05.920> we<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.220> need<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.489> do

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
and the power it now we just need to do

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.050 
and the power it now we just need to do
the<00:03:06.790> bottom<00:03:07.090> piston<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:09.060> we're

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
the bottom piston so to do that we're

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.970 
the bottom piston so to do that we're
going<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.510> put<00:03:10.690> torch<00:03:11.019> here<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.709> avoid<00:03:11.950> that

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
going to put torch here to avoid that

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.699 
going to put torch here to avoid that
signal<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.850> block<00:03:13.030> there<00:03:13.359> with<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.470> repeat

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
signal and a block there with the repeat

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.740 
signal and a block there with the repeat
on<00:03:14.859> for<00:03:15.040> tix<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.400> delay

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
on for tix the delay

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.990 
on for tix the delay
mental<00:03:17.470> block<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.190> both<00:03:18.460> these<00:03:18.790> are

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
mental block and then both these are

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.730 
mental block and then both these are
going<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.240> go<00:03:19.360> into<00:03:19.480> register<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.440> why<00:03:20.500> here

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
going to go into register and why here

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.780 
going to go into register and why here
and<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:22.120> will<00:03:22.300> make<00:03:22.450> our<00:03:23.160> thing<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.700> you

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
and that will make our thing that so you

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.300 
and that will make our thing that so you
can<00:03:24.880> see<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.090> powering<00:03:25.630> off<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.160> then<00:03:27.160> we're

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
can see that powering off and then we're

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.850 
can see that powering off and then we're
just<00:03:27.340> going<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.670> take<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:28.030> around<00:03:28.240> in<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.450> loop

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
just going to take that around in a loop

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.590 
just going to take that around in a loop
down<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.040> power<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.340> piston<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.060> then<00:03:31.390> I'm

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
down to power that piston and then I'm

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.270 
down to power that piston and then I'm
just<00:03:31.810> look<00:03:32.020> at<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.230> replicates<00:03:32.680> out<00:03:32.890> on<00:03:33.070> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
just look at the replicates out on the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.060 
just look at the replicates out on the
other<00:03:33.340> side<00:03:34.080> now<00:03:35.080> I've<00:03:35.320> got<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.860> side

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
other side now I've got you the side

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.190 
other side now I've got you the side
done<00:03:36.370> we<00:03:36.550> can<00:03:36.580> do<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> inputs<00:03:37.360> I'm<00:03:37.630> just<00:03:37.930> using

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200
