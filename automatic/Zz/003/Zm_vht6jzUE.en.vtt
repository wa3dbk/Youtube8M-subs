00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.930 

hey<00:00:08.860> guys<00:00:09.070> what's<00:00:09.280> up<00:00:09.400> the<00:00:09.550> question<00:00:09.850> that

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
hey guys what's up the question that

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.879 
hey guys what's up the question that
we're<00:00:10.059> going<00:00:10.180> to<00:00:10.240> address<00:00:10.480> today<00:00:10.719> is<00:00:11.139> what<00:00:11.830> do

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
we're going to address today is what do

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.509 
we're going to address today is what do
I<00:00:11.980> feel<00:00:12.190> of<00:00:12.309> the<00:00:12.400> most<00:00:12.580> beneficial<00:00:12.910> lifts

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
I feel of the most beneficial lifts

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.000 
I feel of the most beneficial lifts
for<00:00:14.940> improving<00:00:15.379> acceleration<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.619> sprinting

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
for improving acceleration so sprinting

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.580 
for improving acceleration so sprinting
acceleration<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.760> top<00:00:17.789> end<00:00:18.630> speed<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:19.470> right

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
acceleration and top end speed all right

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.970 
acceleration and top end speed all right
so<00:00:20.189> we'll<00:00:21.119> we'll<00:00:21.779> go<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> specific<00:00:22.500> exercise<00:00:22.829> in

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
so we'll we'll go a specific exercise in

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.050 
so we'll we'll go a specific exercise in
this<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> little<00:00:23.310> bit<00:00:23.460> more<00:00:23.610> groups<00:00:23.939> of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
this a little bit more groups of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450 
this a little bit more groups of
exercises<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> be

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
exercises so it's going to be

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.689 
exercises so it's going to be
prioritized<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.449> sprinting<00:00:28.349> first<00:00:29.039> ven<00:00:29.669> jumps

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
prioritized as sprinting first ven jumps

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.510 
prioritized as sprinting first ven jumps
then<00:00:30.390> throws<00:00:30.719> and<00:00:31.110> then<00:00:31.200> the<00:00:31.320> weight<00:00:31.469> room<00:00:31.649> so

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
then throws and then the weight room so

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.799 
then throws and then the weight room so
the<00:00:32.669> spring<00:00:32.910> drills<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.420> are<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> have

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the spring drills that are going to have

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.600 
the spring drills that are going to have
the<00:00:33.899> highest<00:00:34.050> correlation<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.370> your

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the highest correlation to to your

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
their sprinting abilities then the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
their sprinting abilities then the
jumping<00:01:04.710> exercises<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> look<00:01:05.759> into

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
jumping exercises you want to look into

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
jumping exercises you want to look into
for<00:01:06.329> acceleration<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.829> be<00:01:07.950> more

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
for acceleration are going to be more

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.280 
for acceleration are going to be more
single<00:01:08.549> response<00:01:08.909> jumps<00:01:09.329> like<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> box<00:01:10.229> jump<00:01:10.560> or

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
single response jumps like a box jump or

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.359 
single response jumps like a box jump or
standing<00:01:13.290> staying<00:01:13.680> long<00:01:13.920> jump<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
standing staying long jump and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
standing staying long jump and
particularly<00:01:15.270> adding<00:01:15.630> weight<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:15.930> those

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
particularly adding weight to those

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.959 
particularly adding weight to those
through<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.649> weighted<00:01:17.130> vest<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.579> still<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
through a weighted vest but still of

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.819 
through a weighted vest but still of
course<00:01:18.149> focusing<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.899> soft<00:01:19.259> landing<00:01:19.679> and

course focusing on the soft landing and

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.090 
course focusing on the soft landing and
then<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.609> the<00:01:20.909> top<00:01:21.149> speed<00:01:21.649> jumps<00:01:22.649> are<00:01:22.920> going

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
then the the top speed jumps are going

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.760 
then the the top speed jumps are going
to<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.280> multiple<00:01:24.149> jumps<00:01:24.359> for<00:01:24.630> distance<00:01:25.049> will

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to be multiple jumps for distance will

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.459 
to be multiple jumps for distance will
go<00:01:25.889> about<00:01:26.130> three<00:01:26.520> four<00:01:26.880> five<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.259> could

go about three four five you could

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.699 
go about three four five you could
potentially<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:29.219> to<00:01:29.280> ten<00:01:29.789> consecutive<00:01:30.709> double

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
potentially go to ten consecutive double

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:33.649 
potentially go to ten consecutive double

sprinting and jumping an improvement so
i<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.790> say<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.330> them<00:02:18.420> has<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.810> much

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
i can say that one of them has that much

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.470 
i can say that one of them has that much
higher<00:02:19.170> transfer<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.190> then<00:02:21.000> another<00:02:21.270> one

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
higher transfer to the then another one

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.410 
higher transfer to the then another one
as<00:02:22.440> long<00:02:22.620> as<00:02:22.650> you're

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
as long as you're

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.630

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
produce a good output on it and do it do

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.210 
produce a good output on it and do it do
it<00:02:25.670> safely<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.209> mechanically<00:02:27.220> efficiently

it safely and mechanically efficiently

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.770 
it safely and mechanically efficiently
then<00:02:28.610> it's<00:02:28.819> going<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.030> be<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.150> positive

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
then it's going to be a positive

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.280 
then it's going to be a positive
exercise<00:02:30.380> for<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.709> or<00:02:30.830> your<00:02:30.980> athlete
