00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.580

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.170

 e and a little pinch of johnny salt 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.280
 some shouting and for that so we 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.100
 start pouring the flour into our 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.890
 salad bowl flour salad bowl is farid 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.870

 do not we're going to separate the whites from 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.539
 yellow we will put the whites in the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.219
 blender bowl because we 're going to go 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.170
 go up in snow and we'll put the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.530
 yellow with flour 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.329
 I 'm going to watch you during this 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.550
 time there we will melt the butter 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.800
 microwaves have created a lot of stuff to 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.660
 soon so while Aurelie is 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.350
 not there we can play a little bit with 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.060
 flour or not so if you want you can 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.680
 add yeast the yeast sugar and the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.280
 little pinch of salt can help you I 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.280
 let's do it here 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.000
 here 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.650
 all white Lebanese in snow during this 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.979
 time there I add milk in nine 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.979
 that said 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.409
 but I think that's ok, so there 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.500
 eggs are beaten in snow 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:48.890
 we're good I add the melted butter my 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.600
 side of it here and I mix that one last 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.869
 blow and we will still take port and the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.869
 whisked egg whites 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.579
 So here are the eggs in snow 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.679
 I do not have to beat him 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.670
 will still work but it will be me 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.980
 a little less light a little less 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.709
 irene see our whites are good 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.410
 incorporate it just let it sit 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.310
 dough 20 to 30 minutes and after we can 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.940
 leather our Czech bread dough has 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.739
 mounted we will now be able to 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.310
 circuits have to give them a nice 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.310
 round shape 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.750
 we will give them a shape of the canvases 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.010
 against these little silicone molds 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.959
 it's very funny there are plenty of 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.860
 forms to amuse the kids that's 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.910
 great for afternoon tea 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.420
 so there we pour a little bit of 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.120
 pathos 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.620
 as usual no but everywhere would 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.599
 not funny otherwise it's a bit like 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.540
 blinis it will form small bubbles to 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.530
 surface and this moment not go back 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.230
 ok little bubbles we can go back 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.450
 the little bubbles so we go back to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.099
 the cooking is a little less 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.890
 one minute on each side between 30 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.200
 seconds and a minute it depends on the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.120
 tip of the stove the heat of the 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.120
 Press climatic conditions 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:24.640
 and here is a beautiful 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.170
 so we even talked to him about a good 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.230
 can taste but a small nest egg 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.070
 example then honey at the cdci rodez to 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.330
 the way I push you 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:39.310
 this is how you want beautiful 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:44.220
 well, if you keep cooking it's 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.220
