happened after that restart some contact
in<00:04:58.830> traffic<00:04:59.250> or<00:04:59.400> something<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.880> might<00:05:00.090> have

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
in traffic or something that might have

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.630 
in traffic or something that might have
got<00:05:01.380> an<00:05:01.470> offender<00:05:01.830> in<00:05:01.950> on<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.160> right<00:05:02.220> front

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
got an offender in on that right front

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.020 
got an offender in on that right front
tire<00:05:02.850> or<00:05:03.120> something<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:03.630> caused<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.200> crash

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
tire or something and caused that crash

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.160 
tire or something and caused that crash
yeah<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.060> could<00:05:06.240> have<00:05:06.300> very<00:05:06.360> well<00:05:06.570> done<00:05:06.900> that

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
yeah I could have very well done that

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.650 
yeah I could have very well done that
but<00:05:07.410> yeah<00:05:08.100> run<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.700> into<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:08.970> back<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.330> 83

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
but yeah run it into the back of the 83

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.940 
but yeah run it into the back of the 83
could<00:05:09.930> have<00:05:10.020> certainly<00:05:10.290> pushed<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.740> back

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
could have certainly pushed that back

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.610 
could have certainly pushed that back
enough<00:05:11.610> that<00:05:11.850> would<00:05:12.750> have<00:05:12.840> created<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.350> well

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
enough that would have created that well

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.170 
enough that would have created that well
here's<00:05:13.770> one<00:05:13.890> other<00:05:14.040> one<00:05:14.430> of<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.610> possibility

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
here's one other one of the possibility

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.880 
here's one other one of the possibility
is<00:05:15.330> is<00:05:15.510> his<00:05:15.630> brake<00:05:15.870> pedal<00:05:16.140> could<00:05:16.260> yes<00:05:16.440> is<00:05:16.560> you

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
is is his brake pedal could yes is you

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.250 
is is his brake pedal could yes is you
know<00:05:16.980> we're<00:05:17.130> late<00:05:17.220> in<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.460> race<00:05:17.780> 460<00:05:18.780> laps<00:05:19.020> in

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
know we're late in the race 460 laps in

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.960 
know we're late in the race 460 laps in
could<00:05:19.830> have<00:05:19.860> been<00:05:20.040> having<00:05:20.280> some<00:05:20.400> brake<00:05:20.580> issues

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.120 
could have been having some brake issues
and<00:05:21.300> all<00:05:21.840> in<00:05:22.110> that<00:05:22.290> pipe<00:05:22.500> traffic<00:05:22.920> if<00:05:23.010> that

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
and all in that pipe traffic if that

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.620 
and all in that pipe traffic if that
pedal<00:05:23.400> goes<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.760> floor<00:05:23.970> you<00:05:24.300> know<00:05:24.390> we<00:05:24.480> saw

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
pedal goes to the floor you know we saw

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.990 
pedal goes to the floor you know we saw
with<00:05:24.840> with<00:05:25.230> a<00:05:25.260> 33<00:05:25.650> card<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.370> in-car<00:05:26.670> camera

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
with with a 33 card that in-car camera

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.460 
with with a 33 card that in-car camera
how<00:05:27.420> you<00:05:27.480> tapped<00:05:27.780> that<00:05:27.870> brake<00:05:28.140> to<00:05:28.230> make<00:05:28.350> sure

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
how you tapped that brake to make sure

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.720 
how you tapped that brake to make sure
it's<00:05:28.590> there<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:29.070> thing<00:05:29.310> could<00:05:29.490> have<00:05:29.580> gone<00:05:29.670> to

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
it's there that thing could have gone to

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.520 
it's there that thing could have gone to
the<00:05:29.880> floor<00:05:30.090> on<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:30.480> and<00:05:30.780> that's<00:05:31.230> exactly

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
the floor on that and that's exactly

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.370 
the floor on that and that's exactly
what<00:05:31.800> would<00:05:31.920> have<00:05:32.040> happened
