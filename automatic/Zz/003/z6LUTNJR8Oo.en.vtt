00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
coordinates and then in a set of curly

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.220 
coordinates and then in a set of curly
brackets<00:02:29.410> we've<00:02:29.530> got<00:02:29.680> attributes<00:02:30.340> :<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.329> then

call<00:05:03.300> in<00:05:03.479> generic<00:05:03.810> base<00:05:04.200> damage<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.800> then

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
call in generic base damage and then

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.969 
call in generic base damage and then
after<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.310> coma<00:05:05.610> we<00:05:05.849> got<00:05:06.030> name<00:05:06.530> colon<00:05:07.530> generic

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
after a coma we got name colon generic

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.500 
after a coma we got name colon generic
job<00:05:08.130> base<00:05:08.310> damage<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:08.760> it's<00:05:08.880> just<00:05:09.000> repeating

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
job base damage so it's just repeating

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.560 
job base damage so it's just repeating
it<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.900> guess<00:05:10.620> that<00:05:10.830> confirms<00:05:11.430> really<00:05:12.330> what<00:05:12.450> you

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
it I guess that confirms really what you

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.620 
it I guess that confirms really what you
want<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.020> then

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
want and then

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.770 
want and then
as<00:05:14.200> you<00:05:14.710> can<00:05:14.830> see<00:05:15.010> I've<00:05:15.130> got<00:05:15.310> no<00:05:16.000> amount<00:05:16.570> I

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
as you can see I've got no amount I

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.800 
as you can see I've got no amount I
guess<00:05:17.110> for<00:05:17.320> it<00:05:17.410> at<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.890> moment<00:05:18.040> so<00:05:18.490> it<00:05:19.390> doesn't

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
guess for it at the moment so it doesn't

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.000 
guess for it at the moment so it doesn't
have<00:05:20.020> any<00:05:20.290> additional<00:05:21.070> attack<00:05:21.550> damage

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
have any additional attack damage

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.090 
have any additional attack damage
alright<00:05:24.010> so<00:05:24.250> then<00:05:24.900> we<00:05:25.900> go<00:05:26.080> give<00:05:26.320> Nero<00:05:26.800> diamond

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
alright so then we go give Nero diamond

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.510 
alright so then we go give Nero diamond

I<00:05:31.030> mean<00:05:31.600> naturally<00:05:31.930> you<00:05:32.020> name<00:05:32.260> generic<00:05:33.250> type

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
I mean naturally you name generic type

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.010 
I mean naturally you name generic type
base<00:05:33.580> damage<00:05:33.910> name<00:05:34.270> generic<00:05:34.690> table<00:05:34.840> based

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020

base damage name generic table based
image<00:05:35.290> and<00:05:35.470> then<00:05:35.620> on<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.340> end<00:05:36.490> we<00:05:36.640> have<00:05:36.850> the

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
image and then on the end we have the

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.040 
image and then on the end we have the
tag<00:05:37.300> amount<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.370> then<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.580> colon<00:05:39.910> and<00:05:40.210> 120<00:05:41.280> so

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
tag amount and then a colon and 120 so

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.240 
tag amount and then a colon and 120 so
that's<00:05:44.050> just<00:05:44.320> going<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.710> give<00:05:44.830> us<00:05:44.950> another

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
that's just going to give us another

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.120 
that's just going to give us another
diamond<00:05:46.000> so<00:05:46.150> that<00:05:46.330> doesn't<00:05:46.510> have<00:05:46.720> any<00:05:47.130> generic

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
diamond so that doesn't have any generic

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.910 
diamond so that doesn't have any generic
oh<00:05:48.640> no<00:05:49.480> any<00:05:49.870> more<00:05:50.110> extra<00:05:50.650> damage<00:05:50.920> so<00:05:52.920> then

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
oh no any more extra damage so then

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.890 
oh no any more extra damage so then
you'll<00:05:54.100> see<00:05:54.280> why

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
you'll see why

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.050 
you'll see why
after<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:56.140> mount<00:05:56.710> which<00:05:57.220> this<00:05:57.460> is<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.670> tank<00:05:57.910> we

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
after a mount which this is the tank we

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.270 
after a mount which this is the tank we
added<00:05:58.330> in<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.450> last<00:05:58.630> one<00:05:58.840> we've<00:05:59.260> got<00:05:59.290> UUID

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
added in the last one we've got UUID

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.670 
added in the last one we've got UUID
least<00:06:01.060> :<00:06:01.780> one<00:06:02.110> so<00:06:02.880> I'm<00:06:03.880> not<00:06:04.600> really<00:06:04.870> sure<00:06:05.260> what

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
least : one so I'm not really sure what

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.280 
least : one so I'm not really sure what
this<00:06:05.890> does<00:06:06.160> but<00:06:06.490> that<00:06:07.360> needs<00:06:07.660> to<00:06:07.900> be<00:06:07.930> at<00:06:08.260> least

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
this does but that needs to be at least

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.660 
this does but that needs to be at least
one<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:09.070> so<00:06:09.280> does<00:06:09.490> in<00:06:09.730> this<00:06:09.910> one<00:06:10.290> UUID<00:06:11.290> most<00:06:11.980> :

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
one and so does in this one UUID most :

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.820 
one and so does in this one UUID most :
one<00:06:12.880> they<00:06:13.570> both<00:06:13.780> need<00:06:14.080> to<00:06:14.110> be<00:06:14.230> at<00:06:14.560> one

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
one they both need to be at one

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.970 
one they both need to be at one
otherwise<00:06:15.690> nothing's<00:06:16.690> gonna<00:06:16.990> happen<00:06:17.140> but

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
otherwise nothing's gonna happen but

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.800 
otherwise nothing's gonna happen but
when<00:06:18.100> you<00:06:18.160> put<00:06:18.310> them<00:06:18.430> both<00:06:18.520> in<00:06:18.760> you<00:06:19.420> got<00:06:19.600> a

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
when you put them both in you got a

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.590 
when you put them both in you got a
diamond<00:06:20.020> sword<00:06:20.350> with<00:06:20.620> 120<00:06:21.430> attack<00:06:21.730> damage<00:06:22.590> so
