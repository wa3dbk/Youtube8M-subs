the shampoo because I just find it makes
everything<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.880> lot<00:01:06.180> easier<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.780> mix<00:01:06.930> together

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
even though that looks pretty lumpy

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.820 
even though that looks pretty lumpy
anyway<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:13.340> it's<00:01:13.460> fine<00:01:13.640> guys<00:01:13.820> it's<00:01:14.300> fine<00:01:14.830> so

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
anyway but it's fine guys it's fine so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.940 
anyway but it's fine guys it's fine so
we<00:01:16.160> need<00:01:16.310> two<00:01:16.630> shampoos<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.320> there's<00:01:18.800> the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
we need two shampoos so there's the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.100 
we need two shampoos so there's the
first<00:01:19.130> one<00:01:19.340> fifty<00:01:19.940> mil<00:01:20.090> again

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:36.570 

and<00:01:26.250> there<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.760> second<00:01:28.240> one

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.090 

so<00:01:37.420> then<00:01:37.780> you're<00:01:37.960> just<00:01:38.050> going<00:01:38.230> to<00:01:38.290> want<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.530> mix

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.990 

then<00:01:48.680> once<00:01:48.890> it's<00:01:49.100> all<00:01:49.190> mixed<00:01:49.250> up<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:49.820> should

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
then once it's all mixed up it should

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
then once it's all mixed up it should
look<00:01:50.150> something<00:01:50.390> like<00:01:50.510> this<00:01:50.750> with<00:01:50.930> a

and<00:02:10.490> haven't<00:02:10.700> done<00:02:10.790> my<00:02:10.880> roots<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:11.660> like<00:02:11.810> to

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
and haven't done my roots I just like to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.220 
and haven't done my roots I just like to
go<00:02:13.010> over<00:02:13.040> my<00:02:13.400> most<00:02:13.670> visible<00:02:14.150> roots<00:02:14.390> first<00:02:14.780> so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
go over my most visible roots first so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.420 
go over my most visible roots first so
they'll<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.590> little<00:02:16.010> bit<00:02:16.160> extra

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
they'll have a little bit extra

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.980 
they'll have a little bit extra
processing<00:02:16.910> time<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.360> lighten<00:02:17.630> them<00:02:17.750> up<00:02:17.810> a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
processing time to lighten them up a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.080 
processing time to lighten them up a
little<00:02:18.230> bit<00:02:18.410> more<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.310> I'll<00:02:19.490> just<00:02:19.640> blend<00:02:19.850> into

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
little bit more so I'll just blend into

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:41.520 
little bit more so I'll just blend into
the<00:02:20.270> rest<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.570> my<00:02:20.720> hair<00:02:20.870> better

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.870 

but<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:42.680> when<00:02:42.860> I'm<00:02:42.950> actually<00:02:43.130> doing<00:02:43.400> my<00:02:43.640> hair

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
but then when I'm actually doing my hair

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.660 
but then when I'm actually doing my hair
I<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.300> grab<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.630> all<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.170> my<00:02:45.350> hand<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.490> like

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
I just grab it all in my hand and I like

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.840 
I just grab it all in my hand and I like
to<00:02:46.820> go<00:02:47.000> from<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:48.110> roots<00:02:49.100> first<00:02:49.460> because<00:02:49.790> I

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
to go from the roots first because I

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.000 
to go from the roots first because I
just<00:02:50.000> find<00:02:50.210> it<00:02:50.420> love<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.020> much<00:02:51.380> easier<00:02:51.860> if<00:02:51.950> you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
just find it love is much easier if you

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.240 
just find it love is much easier if you
start<00:02:52.310> at<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.520> base<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:54.680> I'm<00:02:54.800> just<00:02:55.010> going<00:02:55.160> to

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
start at the base so I'm just going to

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.590 
start at the base so I'm just going to
rub<00:02:55.460> that<00:02:55.490> into<00:02:55.970> my<00:02:56.660> roots<00:02:56.960> around<00:02:57.260> my<00:02:57.710> head

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
rub that into my roots around my head

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:07.190 
rub that into my roots around my head
like<00:02:59.600> so

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.360 

never<00:03:08.200> forgetting<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.860> back<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.159> your<00:03:09.220> head

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
never forgetting the back of your head

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:29.259 
never forgetting the back of your head
because<00:03:09.549> that's<00:03:09.790> mega<00:03:10.090> important

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.979 

and<00:03:31.189> then<00:03:32.189> I'll<00:03:32.459> go<00:03:32.760> on<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.909> do<00:03:33.150> my<00:03:33.359> lengths

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
and then I'll go on to do my lengths

00:03:33.989 --> 00:04:06.580 
and then I'll go on to do my lengths
just<00:03:39.409> rubbing<00:03:40.409> it<00:03:40.500> all<00:03:40.709> in

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.780

pop<00:04:20.580> that<00:04:20.610> on<00:04:21.030> top<00:04:21.360> so<00:04:22.050> it<00:04:22.350> keeps<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.830> heat

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
pop that on top so it keeps the heat

inside and lets it process a little bit
easier<00:04:27.410> yep<00:04:28.760> so<00:04:29.760> then<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.420> just<00:04:30.930> kind<00:04:31.170> of<00:04:31.320> check
