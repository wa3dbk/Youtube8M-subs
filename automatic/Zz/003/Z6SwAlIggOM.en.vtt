then<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.890> have<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> walk-in<00:02:47.459> refrigerator

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
then if you have a walk-in refrigerator

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.910 
then if you have a walk-in refrigerator
you<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.510> do<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.200> brine<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.770> in

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
you can do it you can brine it in

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.740 
you can do it you can brine it in
smaller<00:02:50.370> batches<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.240> want<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.480> put<00:02:51.630> them

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
smaller batches if you want to put them

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.360 
smaller batches if you want to put them
in<00:02:51.840> bowls<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.320> your<00:02:52.440> refrigerator<00:02:52.680> you've<00:02:53.280> got

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
in bowls in your refrigerator you've got

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.740 
in bowls in your refrigerator you've got
to<00:02:53.490> make<00:02:53.610> sure<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.880> keep<00:02:54.090> these<00:02:54.270> at<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> safe

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
to make sure you keep these at a safe

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.900 
to make sure you keep these at a safe
temperature<00:02:54.920> otherwise<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.280> meats<00:02:56.490> gonna<00:02:56.730> go

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
temperature otherwise the meats gonna go

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.620 
temperature otherwise the meats gonna go
bad<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.650> my<00:02:59.190> recommendation<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.390> how<00:03:00.570> I

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
bad so my recommendation this is how I

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.420 
bad so my recommendation this is how I
do<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.080> there<00:03:01.440> might<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.650> other<00:03:01.890> people<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
do it there might be other people that

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.860 
do it there might be other people that
say<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:03.060> know<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.390> salt<00:03:03.630> concentration

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
say that you know the salt concentration

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.440 
say that you know the salt concentration
might<00:03:04.620> be<00:03:04.770> different<00:03:05.220> I'm<00:03:05.820> going<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.239> use

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
might be different I'm going to use

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.660 
might be different I'm going to use
about<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.810> half<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.320> cup<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.650> salt<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:08.459> about

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
about a half a cup of salt for about

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.479 
about a half a cup of salt for about
three<00:03:09.180> gallons<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.840> water<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:10.800> each<00:03:11.010> one<00:03:11.310> of

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
three gallons of water now each one of

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.420 
three gallons of water now each one of
these<00:03:11.700> buckets<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.900> six<00:03:13.260> gallon<00:03:13.680> bucket<00:03:14.070> if

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
these buckets is a six gallon bucket if

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.070 
these buckets is a six gallon bucket if
you<00:03:14.610> fill<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:15.000> up<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.420> line<00:03:15.750> right<00:03:15.780> here

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
you fill it up to this line right here

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.160 
you fill it up to this line right here
that's<00:03:16.980> gonna<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.520> six<00:03:17.760> gallon<00:03:18.150> line<00:03:18.390> so

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
that's gonna be the six gallon line so

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.500 
that's gonna be the six gallon line so
even<00:03:19.530> though<00:03:19.620> there's<00:03:19.830> not<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.520> meet<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:21.300> to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
even though there's not the meet up to

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.000 
even though there's not the meet up to
that<00:03:21.660> height<00:03:21.930> that's<00:03:22.230> how<00:03:22.470> high<00:03:22.680> I'm<00:03:22.770> going<00:03:22.950> to

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
that height that's how high I'm going to

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.229 
that height that's how high I'm going to
put<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.190> water<00:03:23.340> because<00:03:23.640> I<00:03:23.730> want<00:03:23.970> there<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.150> be

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
put the water because I want there to be

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.600 
put the water because I want there to be
a<00:03:24.300> lot<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.720> water<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.140> soak<00:03:25.410> this<00:03:25.590> meat<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.459> I'm

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
a lot of water to soak this meat so I'm

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.580 
a lot of water to soak this meat so I'm
gonna<00:03:26.730> put<00:03:26.970> a<00:03:27.000> full<00:03:27.300> cup<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.690> salt<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.200> both<00:03:28.410> of

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
gonna put a full cup of salt in both of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.880 
gonna put a full cup of salt in both of
these<00:03:28.680> buckets<00:03:29.160> all<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.209> gonna<00:03:30.360> do<00:03:30.890> sprinkle

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.280 
it all over the top and then I'm gonna
fill<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.590> water<00:03:34.830> up<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.519> level<00:03:35.940> at<00:03:36.299> that

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
fill the water up to this level at that

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.570 
fill the water up to this level at that
point<00:03:37.680> I'm<00:03:38.010> going<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.220> put<00:03:38.340> them<00:03:38.459> outside

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
point I'm going to put them outside

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.150 
point I'm going to put them outside
where<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.269> cold<00:03:39.660> right<00:03:40.290> now<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:40.830> well

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
where it's cold right now it is well

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.270 
where it's cold right now it is well
below<00:03:41.370> freezing<00:03:41.760> outside<00:03:42.350> so<00:03:43.350> we're<00:03:43.920> hoping

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
below freezing outside so we're hoping

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.940 
below freezing outside so we're hoping
that<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.580> doesn't<00:03:44.940> freeze<00:03:45.180> if<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.780> does<00:03:46.019> you

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
that it doesn't freeze if it does you

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.640 
that it doesn't freeze if it does you
know<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.370> might<00:03:47.610> take<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> little<00:03:48.090> bit<00:03:48.209> longer

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
know this might take a little bit longer

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.390 
know this might take a little bit longer
but<00:03:49.650> basically<00:03:50.370> at<00:03:50.930> 32<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.110> 40<00:03:52.410> degrees<00:03:52.769> I'm

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
but basically at 32 to 40 degrees I'm

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.910 
but basically at 32 to 40 degrees I'm
gonna<00:03:53.640> leave<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.299> salt<00:03:54.720> on<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.320> meat<00:03:55.650> in

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
gonna leave this salt on this meat in

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.600 
gonna leave this salt on this meat in
the<00:03:56.820> brine<00:03:57.060> water<00:03:57.390> for<00:03:57.870> 24<00:03:58.350> hours<00:03:58.680> okay<00:03:59.160> after

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
the brine water for 24 hours okay after

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.789

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
that I started to process it now I know

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.830 
that I started to process it now I know
you're<00:04:14.700> probably<00:04:14.820> thinking<00:04:15.329> wow<00:04:15.450> that's<00:04:15.720> a

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
you're probably thinking wow that's a

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.180 
you're probably thinking wow that's a
lot<00:04:15.989> of<00:04:16.019> salt<00:04:16.350> than<00:04:16.590> me<00:04:16.680> it's<00:04:16.829> going<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.040> taste

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
lot of salt than me it's going to taste

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.460 
lot of salt than me it's going to taste
salty<00:04:17.640> but<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.180> really<00:04:18.359> doesn't<00:04:18.750> this<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
salty but it really doesn't this the

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.250 
salty but it really doesn't this the
meat<00:04:19.739> at<00:04:19.979> this<00:04:20.190> point<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.700> not<00:04:21.000> absorbing<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
meat at this point is not absorbing the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.890 
meat at this point is not absorbing the
salt<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:23.250> salt<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.820> drawing<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.360> blood<00:04:24.660> out

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900

salt the salt is drawing the blood out
of<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.530> meat<00:04:25.560> so<00:04:26.220> when<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.460> dump<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.850> off<00:04:27.090> at

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
of the meat so when you dump this off at

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.240 
of the meat so when you dump this off at
24<00:04:27.690> hours<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.110> water<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.500> going<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.740> be<00:04:28.860> read

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
24 hours that water is going to be read

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.000 
24 hours that water is going to be read
after<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:30.419> second<00:04:30.780> 24<00:04:31.020> hours<00:04:31.440> it's<00:04:31.650> not<00:04:31.830> going

about this later okay

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:51.479 
about this later okay
as<00:04:49.119> you<00:04:49.329> can<00:04:49.449> see<00:04:49.659> we've<00:04:50.379> got<00:04:50.559> our<00:04:50.709> water<00:04:50.889> up<00:04:51.189> to

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:51.489 
as you can see we've got our water up to

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:54.269 
as you can see we've got our water up to
the<00:04:51.789> level<00:04:51.939> that<00:04:52.119> we<00:04:52.209> wanted<00:04:52.509> to<00:04:52.599> be<00:04:52.719> on<00:04:52.869> I<00:04:53.279> know

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:54.279 
the level that we wanted to be on I know

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.309 
the level that we wanted to be on I know
this<00:04:54.549> is<00:04:54.669> kind<00:04:54.969> of<00:04:55.029> intuitive<00:04:55.359> but<00:04:55.809> in<00:04:55.989> case

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
this is kind of intuitive but in case

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.599 
this is kind of intuitive but in case
you<00:04:56.469> didn't<00:04:56.649> realize<00:04:56.739> you<00:04:57.069> got<00:04:57.219> to<00:04:57.279> put<00:04:57.399> a<00:04:57.429> lid

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:57.609 
you didn't realize you got to put a lid

00:04:57.609 --> 00:04:58.649 
you didn't realize you got to put a lid
on<00:04:57.639> this<00:04:57.879> because<00:04:58.149> if<00:04:58.239> you're<00:04:58.329> gonna<00:04:58.389> put<00:04:58.569> it

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
on this because if you're gonna put it

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.709 
on this because if you're gonna put it
outside<00:04:59.789> you<00:05:00.789> don't<00:05:00.969> want<00:05:01.149> the<00:05:01.239> Kruegers<00:05:01.569> to

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
outside you don't want the Kruegers to

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:04.049 
outside you don't want the Kruegers to
get<00:05:01.869> into<00:05:02.169> it<00:05:02.289> can't<00:05:03.279> just<00:05:03.489> leave<00:05:03.669> an<00:05:03.789> open

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:04.059 
get into it can't just leave an open

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.419 
get into it can't just leave an open
book<00:05:04.179> at<00:05:04.359> a<00:05:04.419> meet<00:05:04.629> outside<00:05:05.169> and<00:05:06.069> you<00:05:06.159> can<00:05:06.309> see

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:06.429 
book at a meet outside and you can see

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:07.799 
book at a meet outside and you can see
the<00:05:06.549> water<00:05:06.729> is<00:05:06.879> already<00:05:07.059> starting<00:05:07.539> to<00:05:07.629> turn

the water is already starting to turn

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.259 
the water is already starting to turn
red<00:05:07.949> it's<00:05:08.949> starting<00:05:09.339> to<00:05:09.429> pop<00:05:09.579> draw<00:05:09.909> the<00:05:09.969> blood
