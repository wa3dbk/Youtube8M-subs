00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
unfortunately it didn't turn out as good

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.910 
unfortunately it didn't turn out as good
as<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.159> wanted<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.810> as<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.050> can<00:01:25.230> see<00:01:25.530> there

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
as we wanted it to as you can see there

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
as we wanted it to as you can see there
is<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.190> glare<00:01:26.910> coming<00:01:27.420> from<00:01:27.660> the<00:01:27.960> light<00:01:28.170> source

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
is a glare coming from the light source

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
is a glare coming from the light source
because<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.770> thought<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:29.130> natural<00:01:29.580> light

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
because we thought some natural light

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.130 
because we thought some natural light
from<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.060> outside<00:01:30.420> back<00:01:30.690> there<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.110> be

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
from the outside back there would be

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.470 
from the outside back there would be
good<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.310> funny<00:01:32.550> part<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.300> I

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
good and the funny part is is that as I

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.850 
good and the funny part is is that as I
was<00:01:33.690> looking<00:01:34.020> through<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:34.320> focusing<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
was looking through and focusing the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.890 
was looking through and focusing the
camera<00:01:35.280> through<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.940> our<00:01:36.240> camcorder<00:01:36.750> through

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

camera through the our camcorder through
the<00:01:36.990> LED<00:01:37.380> screen

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the LED screen

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.820 
the LED screen
none<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.180> showed<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.680> was

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
none of that showed up so it was

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.960 
none of that showed up so it was
something<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.160> seemed<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> appear

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
something that seemed to appear

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.510 
something that seemed to appear
afterwards<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.950> unfortunately<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.100> didn't

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
afterwards and unfortunately I didn't

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.860 
afterwards and unfortunately I didn't
know<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.880> until<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.330> went<00:01:45.450> looked<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
know that until I went looked at the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.090 
know that until I went looked at the
footage<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.440> course<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.770> model<00:01:46.950> was

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
footage and of course the model was

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.880 
footage and of course the model was
already<00:01:47.250> built<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.760> we<00:01:47.910> couldn't<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.300> back<00:01:48.480> and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
already built so we couldn't go back and

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.890 
already built so we couldn't go back and
go<00:01:49.890> back<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.220> time<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:50.550> reverse<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:51.630> on

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
go back in time and reverse it and so on

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.380 
go back in time and reverse it and so on
this<00:01:52.620> model<00:01:53.010> as<00:01:53.250> well<00:01:53.430> proved<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.060> much

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this model as well proved to be much

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
this model as well proved to be much
more<00:01:54.660> tedious<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.320> time-consuming<00:01:55.650> than<00:01:56.340> you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
more tedious and time-consuming than you

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490 
more tedious and time-consuming than you
could<00:01:56.610> imagine<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:57.690> first<00:01:57.900> portion<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
could imagine the first portion of this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.870 
could imagine the first portion of this
video<00:01:58.770> which<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.040> compressed<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.640> into<00:01:59.850> just

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
video which is compressed down into just

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.270 
video which is compressed down into just
a<00:02:00.150> couple<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.570> minutes<00:02:00.870> here<00:02:01.110> actually<00:02:01.770> took

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
a couple of minutes here actually took

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.090 
a couple of minutes here actually took
my<00:02:02.400> wife<00:02:02.550> close<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.240> an<00:02:03.480> hour<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.020> half<00:02:04.290> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
my wife close to an hour and a half and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.460 
my wife close to an hour and a half and
then<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.460> went<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.150> reset<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> reposition

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
then we went and we reset and reposition

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.710 
then we went and we reset and reposition
the<00:02:07.500> camera<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:09.269> to<00:02:09.360> having<00:02:09.569> some

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
the camera I want to having some

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.839 
the camera I want to having some
technical<00:02:09.899> difficulties<00:02:10.769> and<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.250> had<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> stop

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
technical difficulties and I had to stop

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.729 
technical difficulties and I had to stop
for<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> minute<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.840> latter<00:02:13.230> part<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.620> it

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
for a minute and the latter part of it

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.259 
for a minute and the latter part of it
that's<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:14.099> compressed<00:02:14.670> down<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> couple

that's just compressed down to a couple
minutes<00:02:15.360> was<00:02:15.569> probably<00:02:15.840> another<00:02:16.080> half<00:02:16.290> an

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
minutes was probably another half an
