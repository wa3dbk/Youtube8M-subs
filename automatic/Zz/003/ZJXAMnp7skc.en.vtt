00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.680
 friends, I welcome you to the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.390
 channel today we are going to prepare a rich and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.650
 simple and super easy kneading bread good 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.210
 here I have the ingredients as always 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.970
 I leave you here below in the box 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.030
 video information and you will see what it is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.400
 super super easy and quick to make 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.820
 well here I have 500 grams of flour 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.250
 Common flour-free baking flour 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.490
 stream of wheat to which I am going 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.310
 add 5 grams of yeast this is 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.890
 baking powder that they do not see for good 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.030
 granulated yeast that is special for 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.940
 I'm going to add a quarter of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.239
 teaspoon of sugar 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.410
 ok and I'm going to add a little bit of 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.059
 water in the center 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.360
 Y 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.659
 I will begin to unite with fingers 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.619
 from the center and here on the side 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.009
 I'm going to add 10 grams which is 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.380
 about one a spoonful 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:27.659
 teaspoon of tea and a half of salt 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.530
 Here I have 250 ml of warm water which 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.530
 I'm going to add it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.530
 little by little 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:47.180
 well now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.810
 add butter too 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:56.150
 it's butter this I have here is 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.950
 vegetable modified butter but if not 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.229
 you get this kind of butter is 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.030
 butter not butter because in 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.330
 argentina the butter tells me in 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.179
 butter but this is not butter this 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.729
 it's butter that when melted is left 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.250
 transparent like oil in 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.970
 reality is a modification of the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.670
 oil and 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.000
 if you do not get this butter you can 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.430
 occupy 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.040
 butter of animal origin perfectly 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.599
 you will be like super rich bread 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.430
 so good now these are 100 grams 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.629
 I will add the need is 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.020
 soft at room temperature I'm going to 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:45.130
 add and I will go 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.780
 uniting this mass well the idea is 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.940
 get a very very soft dough 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.870
 so 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.010
 now it's just to finish joining 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.930
 well the ingredients and take them out of the bowl 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.390
 and let's go 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.830
 [Music] 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.890
 i 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.890
 ah 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:29.659
 [Music] 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.560
 well now after kneading 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.750
 about 8 minutes approximately 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.760
 I'm going to take it to rest to rest 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.310
 double its size 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.430
 right here inside this same bowl and 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.690
 we are going to cover it with a damp cloth 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.069
 let's put a little oil for 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.359
 over 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:57.970
 very little so it does not get too dry 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:04:01.540
 and when I double the size we'll go back 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.880
 well as you see it has already doubled the size 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.470
 so now I'm going to take it out I'm going to 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.890
 return a little bit of flour and I'm going to 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.970
 take out and let's make our balls 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.840
 to form the bread 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.209
 now we are going to be forming our bread the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.240
 size depends on your taste 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.480
 I'm going to cut more or less that I fall 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.250
 there in the hand 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.250
 I'm not going to make them very big 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.880
 I'm going to put them on the tray 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.880
 which is going to put a little flour 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.849
 I already got 6 bread rolls because it was 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.360
 half a kilo of flour and 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.789
 they are approximately 130 grams each 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.409
 I am the fish because I can 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.039
 think so it's more or less necessary 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:58.190
 I want to show you what you have to do 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:01.150
 for example you can do them like this 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.150
 with a fork 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.570
 and also with this 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.390
 it is already 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.270
 your thing 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.900
 as you see and now I'm going to let you rest 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.870
 another another half hour for them to climb 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.180
 again and I'm going to take them to the 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.710
 oven 200 degrees until they are well 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.070
 golden also the others that you can 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.080
 put a little over egg 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.880
 beaten if you want them to give you a 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.470
 pretty nice shine and sometimes I do it in 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.190
 this time I will not do it but that 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.620
 it's optional 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.470
 so already when 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:43.150
 when you're ready about 25 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:46.570
 approximately minutes we return 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:49.090
 and the little bread is finished medel 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:53.410
 look what I see what you can not imagine 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:56.760
 how rich it smells this is delicious 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.180
 exquisite I got 6 and this little one 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.500
 there is 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.500
 has a little bit of flour 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.039
 and the others came out more or less like this 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.039
 to be seen 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.170
 they smell delicious so let's try 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.100
 lets go see it 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.500
 how rich in how a little bit of a 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.129
 myth because they are still hot 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.679
 but anyway 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:32.679
 we are going to put a little 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.410
 of butter 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.060
 how rich with a tecito to me that I 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.440
 love bread so fresh out of the 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.440
 oven with butter and a tecito 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.040
 how delicious is exquisite 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.180
 on the top is super 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.180
 crunchy 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.550
 remember that it has to be fine 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.650
 golden brown underneath and well browned 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.350
 up at that moment you can already get it out 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:17.280
 25 to 30 minutes depending on your oven 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:20.040
 200 degrees and then if you do it I 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.780
