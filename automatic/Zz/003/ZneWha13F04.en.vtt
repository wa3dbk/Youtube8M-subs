00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.620 
this way for a brick wall so guess what
that<00:01:52.860> means<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.060> back<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.450> jump

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that means you have to go back and jump

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.690 
that means you have to go back and jump
over<00:01:54.690> all<00:01:55.020> seven<00:01:55.350> scorpions<00:01:56.070> again<00:01:56.310> making<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
over all seven scorpions again making it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.610 
over all seven scorpions again making it
a<00:01:56.760> grand<00:01:57.000> total<00:01:57.150> of<00:01:57.360> 14<00:01:57.810> scorpions<00:01:58.440> and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
a grand total of 14 scorpions and

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.050 
a grand total of 14 scorpions and
nothing<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.950> show<00:01:58.980> for<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.490> except<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.820> brick

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
nothing to show for it except a brick

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.780 
nothing to show for it except a brick
wall<00:02:00.500> even<00:02:01.500> without<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:02.010> dead<00:02:02.040> ends<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.550> still

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
wall even without the dead ends I still

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.340 
wall even without the dead ends I still
recommend<00:02:03.060> simply<00:02:03.540> sticking<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.080> oval

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
I suggest pitfall it still holds up well
