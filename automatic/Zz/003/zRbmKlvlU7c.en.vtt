00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.710
 imposing mass but the interior hardly benefited because here 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 There was about as much legroom in today's Polo 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 nevertheless further demands became a dream car of its time

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.869
 the process is in progress 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.950
