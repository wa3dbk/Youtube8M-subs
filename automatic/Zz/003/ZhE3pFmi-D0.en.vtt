my new lego trip care it's my all my

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.890 
my new lego trip care it's my all my
design<00:00:07.049> it<00:00:07.350> kind<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:07.980> has<00:00:08.309> some<00:00:09.240> stuff<00:00:09.630> from

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
design it kind of has some stuff from

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.100 
design it kind of has some stuff from
the<00:00:10.110> public<00:00:10.500> gunship<00:00:11.210> like<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.540> guns<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
the public gunship like the guns in the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.460 
the public gunship like the guns in the
front<00:00:13.410> um<00:00:14.150> they<00:00:15.150> move<00:00:16.910> sideways<00:00:18.140> both<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.380> them

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
front um they move sideways both of them

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.820 
front um they move sideways both of them
these<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.689> custom-made<00:00:21.689> ting<00:00:22.230> guns<00:00:22.500> on

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
these are my custom-made ting guns on

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.849 
these are my custom-made ting guns on
the<00:00:22.980> side<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.310> balloons<00:00:23.930> this<00:00:24.930> ship<00:00:25.199> also<00:00:25.470> has

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the side of balloons this ship also has

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.290 
the side of balloons this ship also has
more<00:00:26.630> guns<00:00:27.630> than<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.170> Republic<00:00:28.619> gunship<00:00:29.300> has

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
more guns than the Republic gunship has

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.799 
more guns than the Republic gunship has
kind<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> same<00:00:31.260> engine<00:00:31.740> design<00:00:32.189> um<00:00:32.910> right

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
kind of the same engine design um right

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.790 
kind of the same engine design um right
here<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.880> part<00:00:36.260> opens<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> can

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
here this little part opens and you can

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.180 
here this little part opens and you can
see<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.010> pilot<00:00:38.629> okay<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:43.190> then

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
see the pilot okay so that's that then

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.660 
see the pilot okay so that's that then
we<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> wings<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.450> slanted

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
we have the wings that are slanted

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
we have the wings that are slanted
pretty<00:00:47.670> cool<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.120> got<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.170> kind<00:00:49.469> idea<00:00:49.860> from

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
pretty cool I got that kind idea from

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.830 
pretty cool I got that kind idea from
the<00:00:50.160> public<00:00:50.640> gunship<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> then<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.840> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
the public gunship so then we have this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.860 
the public gunship so then we have this
little<00:00:55.079> area<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.239> pick

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
little area you can you have to pick

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.340 
little area you can you have to pick
this<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.390> take<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.420> off<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.870> there's<00:01:01.199> some

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
this up and take it off and there's some

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.020 
this up and take it off and there's some
bombs<00:01:02.539> okay<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.860> set<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
bombs okay so that's that set in the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.570 
bombs okay so that's that set in the
back<00:01:07.040> we<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.070> another<00:01:08.970> door<00:01:10.250> kind<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.369> see

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
back we have another door kind of see

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.420 
back we have another door kind of see
opens<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> back<00:01:14.180> we<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.390> trip<00:01:16.430> that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
opens in the back we have a trip that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.840 
opens in the back we have a trip that
comes<00:01:17.880> off<00:01:18.590> I'll<00:01:19.590> say<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.799> later<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.640> in

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
comes off I'll say that later but in

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.469 
comes off I'll say that later but in
here<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> little

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
here we have the it's like a little

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
here we have the it's like a little
cargo<00:01:24.869> space<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:27.060> there's<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.579> area<00:01:29.579> in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
cargo space and there's the area in

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.789 
cargo space and there's the area in
there<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.890> put<00:01:32.130> troops<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.909> um<00:01:33.799> so

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
there that you can put troops in um so

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219 
there that you can put troops in um so
that's<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.549> part<00:01:35.909> right<00:01:36.060> there<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.049> goes

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that's that part right there and it goes

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.399 
that's that part right there and it goes
back<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:42.750> design<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
back there and see I like my design on

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.100 
back there and see I like my design on
here<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.130> Republic<00:01:44.729> symbols<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.509> both

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
here with the Republic symbols on both

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.600 
here with the Republic symbols on both
sides<00:01:47.930> okay<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.540> turret<00:01:52.610> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
sides okay so now for the turret it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.749 
sides okay so now for the turret it
comes<00:01:53.909> off<00:01:56.869> ok<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> turret<00:01:59.070> comes<00:01:59.280> off<00:02:01.759> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
comes off ok so the turret comes off and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.749 
comes off ok so the turret comes off and
it<00:02:03.659> drops<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.229> off<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> Graham

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
it drops it off so if you have a Graham

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.240 
it drops it off so if you have a Graham
Bell<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.600> use<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
Bell you can use that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.990 
Bell you can use that
so<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.630> cool<00:02:09.869> part<00:02:09.899> about<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
so that's the cool part about this I

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.060 
so that's the cool part about this I
kind<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.150> don't<00:02:13.080> really<00:02:13.410> know<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.890> name

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
kind of don't really know what to name

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.850 
kind of don't really know what to name
it<00:02:14.310> except<00:02:15.060> i<00:02:15.180> call<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.540> acute<00:02:15.870> care<00:02:16.110> because

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
it except i call it acute care because

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.920 
it except i call it acute care because
it<00:02:16.980> carries<00:02:17.190> coups<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.880> can<00:02:18.300> drop<00:02:18.510> off<00:02:18.720> a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
it carries coups and can drop off a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.310 
it carries coups and can drop off a
turret<00:02:19.820> as<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.030> can<00:02:21.210> see<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.690> turret<00:02:22.080> has

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
turret as you can see the turret has

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.890 
turret as you can see the turret has
very<00:02:23.280> detailed<00:02:23.850> designs<00:02:24.300> all<00:02:24.690> gray<00:02:26.360> 18<00:02:27.360> gun<00:02:27.630> on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
very detailed designs all gray 18 gun on

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.410 
very detailed designs all gray 18 gun on
it<00:02:28.110> ok<00:02:30.740> so<00:02:31.740> that's<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:33.200> now<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.830> side

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
it ok so that's that now for this side

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.160 
it ok so that's that now for this side
the<00:02:36.420> wings<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.959> go<00:02:37.110> up<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:39.090> which<00:02:39.720> i<00:02:39.959> like

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the wings can go up that which i like

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.660 
the wings can go up that which i like
them<00:02:40.350> slanted<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:41.100> lot<00:02:41.459> better<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.310> we<00:02:44.310> have<00:02:44.489> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
them slanted a lot better so we have the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.720 
them slanted a lot better so we have the
pilot<00:02:45.150> inside<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.900> front<00:02:47.690> see<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
pilot inside the front see that the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.240 
pilot inside the front see that the
bottom<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.959> hip<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.410> pretty<00:02:52.739> simple<00:02:55.250> on

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
bottom of the hip is pretty simple on

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.540 
bottom of the hip is pretty simple on
just<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.940> bunch<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.390> flat<00:02:57.630> pieces<00:02:58.250> I'll<00:02:59.250> show

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
just a bunch of flat pieces I'll show

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.140
