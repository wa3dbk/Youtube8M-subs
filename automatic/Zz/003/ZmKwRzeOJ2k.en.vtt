00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.570
 i know richa and thank you our 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.410
 young people are the hitmaker punk chain for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.719
 a new video 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.150
 so in this video I'm going 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.020
 just invite you to join me 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.740
 during my webinar that I'm organizing the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.070
 Sunday, January 25 at 3 pm for 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.369
 deal with the beloved theme and accept its 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 texture of the transition until 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.809
 transition to natural so in fact I know 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.989
 that many girls are disappointed with 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.210
 their texture after going natural 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.430
 after developing extracts are 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 disappointed because was expecting to see a 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.789
 other texture 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.399
 so we will try to take any 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.570
 this disappointment and transform that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.180
 in something very positive 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.840
 that is, love and 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.590
 self acceptance so accepted his 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.649
 texture with its faults with its 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.339
 qualities know what to do to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.260
 precisely to take precisely what we 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.689
 call defects and make some 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.049
 a good thing that we accept that we 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.760
 can know squarely at 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.360
 own characteristics of our hair 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.920
 and in fact I'm going to give you a 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.659
 testimony of what I experienced 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.850
 knowing that I'm doing a very long 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.590
 transition and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 finally very long for me it was very 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.320
 long of 1 year and two months so we can 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.830
 exchange I will testify to you 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.229
 exactly what I have in quotation marks 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.930
