succulents are really popular in the
garden<00:00:12.080> right<00:00:12.110> now<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:12.980> one<00:00:13.520> of<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:13.700> things

garden right now and one of the things
that<00:00:14.180> I<00:00:14.209> want<00:00:14.539> to<00:00:14.600> show<00:00:14.750> you<00:00:14.840> how<00:00:14.990> to<00:00:15.020> do<00:00:15.289> is<00:00:15.469> how

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
that I want to show you how to do is how

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.200 
that I want to show you how to do is how
to<00:00:15.650> multiply<00:00:16.100> your<00:00:16.610> investment<00:00:17.119> of

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
to multiply your investment of

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.930 
to multiply your investment of
succulents<00:00:17.810> so<00:00:18.590> I<00:00:18.619> actually<00:00:18.980> have<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:19.610> old

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
succulents so I actually have this old

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.749 
succulents so I actually have this old
pot<00:00:20.300> here<00:00:20.690> that<00:00:20.839> I've<00:00:20.929> had<00:00:21.140> in<00:00:21.289> my<00:00:21.320> yard

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
pot here that I've had in my yard

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.550 
pot here that I've had in my yard
sitting<00:00:22.759> on<00:00:22.849> a<00:00:22.880> table<00:00:23.150> for<00:00:23.570> several<00:00:23.960> years<00:00:24.289> and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
sitting on a table for several years and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.230 
sitting on a table for several years and
it's<00:00:24.679> gotten<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.039> little<00:00:25.189> leggy<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:25.759> a<00:00:26.000> little

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
it's gotten a little leggy and a little

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.269 
it's gotten a little leggy and a little
stringy<00:00:26.599> one<00:00:27.499> of<00:00:27.589> the<00:00:27.679> great<00:00:27.919> things<00:00:28.189> about

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
stringy one of the great things about

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.329 
stringy one of the great things about
succulents<00:00:29.060> though<00:00:29.300> is<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:29.900> they<00:00:30.050> hold<00:00:30.380> root

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.339 
succulents though is that they hold root

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.670 
succulents though is that they hold root
cells<00:00:31.730> in<00:00:32.119> both<00:00:32.329> their<00:00:32.570> stems<00:00:32.990> and<00:00:33.320> their

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
cells in both their stems and their

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.380 
cells in both their stems and their
leaves<00:00:33.980> so<00:00:34.310> they're<00:00:34.490> really<00:00:34.970> easy<00:00:35.180> to

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
leaves so they're really easy to

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.750 
leaves so they're really easy to
multiply<00:00:35.920> there's<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:37.010> couple<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.430> different

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
multiply there's a couple of different

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.299 
multiply there's a couple of different
ways<00:00:37.940> that<00:00:37.969> you<00:00:38.210> can<00:00:38.539> do<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.800> have<00:00:40.100> some

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
ways that you can do it I have some

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.779 
ways that you can do it I have some
started<00:00:40.820> here<00:00:41.329> in<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:41.629> little<00:00:41.809> container<00:00:42.789> but

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
started here in a little container but

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.459 
started here in a little container but
we're<00:00:43.940> going<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.090> take<00:00:44.359> one<00:00:44.629> of<00:00:44.660> these<00:00:44.840> off<00:00:45.230> of

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
we're going to take one of these off of

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.619 
we're going to take one of these off of
this<00:00:45.829> guy<00:00:45.980> here<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:47.199> I'll<00:00:48.199> show<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.500> how<00:00:48.829> to

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
this guy here and I'll show you how to

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.330 
this guy here and I'll show you how to
multiply<00:00:50.629> it<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.840> start<00:00:51.289> a<00:00:51.379> new<00:00:51.410> plant<00:00:51.859> so

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
multiply it and start a new plant so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.439 
multiply it and start a new plant so
first<00:00:52.670> thing<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.820> want<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.000> do<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.239> always<00:00:53.359> put

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
first thing you want to do is always put

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.209 
first thing you want to do is always put
on<00:00:53.719> your<00:00:53.870> gardening<00:00:54.230> gloves<00:00:54.530> protect<00:00:55.010> your

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
on your gardening gloves protect your

on your gardening gloves protect your
hands<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:56.809> have<00:00:57.170> some<00:00:57.500> potting<00:00:58.039> soil<00:00:58.340> here

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
hands I have some potting soil here

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.880 
hands I have some potting soil here
that's<00:00:59.000> especially<00:00:59.179> meant<00:00:59.929> for<00:01:00.050> succulents

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
that's especially meant for succulents

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.369 
that's especially meant for succulents
or<00:01:01.250> cactuses<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.239> can<00:01:02.390> use<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:02.629> indoors<00:01:02.870> and

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
or cactuses you can use this indoors and

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.970 
or cactuses you can use this indoors and
out<00:01:04.420> what<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.540> cactus<00:01:05.930> soil<00:01:06.170> does<00:01:06.440> is<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.830> it

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
out what the cactus soil does is that it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.670 
out what the cactus soil does is that it
actually<00:01:07.430> provides<00:01:07.760> a<00:01:07.940> lot<00:01:08.120> of<00:01:08.270> drainage

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
actually provides a lot of drainage

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.780 
actually provides a lot of drainage
succulents<00:01:09.680> don't<00:01:09.920> like<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.250> be<00:01:10.370> sitting<00:01:10.580> in

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
succulents don't like to be sitting in

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.020 
succulents don't like to be sitting in
water<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:11.600> they'll<00:01:11.870> get<00:01:12.020> rotted<00:01:12.440> out<00:01:12.620> and<00:01:13.190> I'm

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
water so they'll get rotted out and I'm

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.650 
water so they'll get rotted out and I'm
going<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.210> take<00:01:14.480> a<00:01:15.760> my<00:01:16.760> herb<00:01:17.030> snips<00:01:17.420> here

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
going to take a my herb snips here

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.470 
going to take a my herb snips here
because<00:01:17.840> these<00:01:17.930> are<00:01:17.990> nice<00:01:18.230> and<00:01:18.500> sharp<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.480> you

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
because these are nice and sharp and you

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.090 
because these are nice and sharp and you
want<00:01:20.660> to<00:01:20.750> look<00:01:20.990> down<00:01:21.230> where<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.650> leaves<00:01:21.860> are

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
want to look down where the leaves are

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.640 
want to look down where the leaves are
on<00:01:22.280> one<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.490> these<00:01:22.790> kind<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.750> older<00:01:24.110> ones<00:01:24.320> and

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
on one of these kind of older ones and

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.050 
on one of these kind of older ones and
you'll<00:01:24.740> see<00:01:24.920> little<00:01:25.100> bumps<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.580> are<00:01:25.640> coming

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
you'll see little bumps that are coming

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.060 
you'll see little bumps that are coming
out<00:01:26.210> here<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:26.720> just<00:01:27.200> snip<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.590> off<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.770> nice

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
out here and just snip it off a nice

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.960 
out here and just snip it off a nice
clean<00:01:28.430> snip<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:29.630> can<00:01:29.780> pull<00:01:30.020> off<00:01:30.230> some<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:30.620> the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
clean snip you can pull off some of the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.250 
clean snip you can pull off some of the
leaves<00:01:31.970> too<00:01:32.300> but<00:01:32.480> hold<00:01:32.660> onto<00:01:32.840> these<00:01:33.080> because

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
leaves too but hold onto these because

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.920 
leaves too but hold onto these because
you<00:01:33.380> can<00:01:33.410> actually<00:01:34.010> sprout<00:01:34.310> these<00:01:34.610> as<00:01:34.850> well<00:01:35.090> so

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
you can actually sprout these as well so

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.390 
you can actually sprout these as well so
I'm<00:01:36.050> going<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.230> pull<00:01:36.410> a<00:01:36.440> couple<00:01:36.680> off<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:37.370> that

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
I'm going to pull a couple off so that

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
I'm going to pull a couple off so that
way<00:01:38.110> we<00:01:39.110> can<00:01:39.260> have<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.440> nice<00:01:39.680> good<00:01:39.950> inch<00:01:40.360> now<00:01:41.360> the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
way we can have a nice good inch now the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.360 
way we can have a nice good inch now the
first<00:01:41.780> thing<00:01:41.900> you<00:01:42.020> want<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.290> do<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.950> give<00:01:43.220> us

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
first thing you want to do is give us

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.990 
first thing you want to do is give us
about<00:01:43.610> 24<00:01:44.300> hours<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.960> dry<00:01:45.170> out<00:01:45.620> so<00:01:46.490> you'll<00:01:46.670> see

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
about 24 hours to dry out so you'll see

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.910 
about 24 hours to dry out so you'll see
here<00:01:47.480> it's<00:01:47.690> nice<00:01:47.870> and<00:01:48.110> moist<00:01:48.290> because<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.710> just

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
here it's nice and moist because I just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.830
